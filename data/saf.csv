The construction, maintenance and use of buildings accounts for 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions and as such the construction industry shoulders a huge responsibility when it comes to global sustainability.

Fortunately, forward-thinking architects, engineers and developers are redefining what it means to build with the planet in mind.

The new generation of sustainable construction projects are not only marvels of design and engineering, but powerful statements of what’s possible when creativity meets responsibility.

In this list, we explore ten of the most groundbreaking, environmentally-conscious construction projects from around the world.

One Central Park is a residential and commercial complex that stands as a shining beacon of green design. The building features more than 1,000 square metres of vertical gardens, a feat made possible by botanist Patrick Blanc’s innovative hydroponic systems. It also includes a massive heliostat—an array of motorised mirrors that redirect sunlight into shaded parts of the structure. These systems reduce heat gain, provide natural cooling and foster biodiversity in the heart of Sydney. It’s a visually arresting example of how technology and botany can work together to redefine high-rise living.

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital breaks the mould of utilitarian, resource-intensive healthcare environments. With gardens integrated into nearly every floor, it brings therapeutic nature into patients’ daily lives, supporting faster recovery and better mental health. Passive design features, such as natural ventilation and strategically placed openings, reduce the hospital’s energy use significantly. Rainwater is collected and reused for irrigation, and the landscaping is designed to support local biodiversity. This patient-centred approach proves that healthcare and sustainability can thrive side by side, making the hospital not just a place of treatment, but a sanctuary of healing.

This visually stunning structure is a testament to the power of natural materials. The bamboo sports hall at Panyaden International School was designed to blend with its tropical surroundings while minimising environmental impact. Bamboo was chosen for its rapid renewability and impressive tensile strength, offering the flexibility and durability needed for the structure. The building’s form takes advantage of natural ventilation and daylight, eliminating the need for artificial lighting or air conditioning. The project celebrates local craftsmanship and age-old construction methods, proving that low-tech solutions can yield high-impact sustainability.

CopenHill is where high design meets high ambition. Located on the outer edge of Denmark’s capital, it is a waste-to-energy plant that doubles as a public recreational space, burning non-recyclable waste to generate clean electricity and district heating for 150,000 homes. Its façade features aluminium bricks and glass, optimised for energy efficiency. But what really sets it apart is the rooftop—a ski slope, hiking trail, climbing wall and viewing platform that transform the plant into a local attraction. It exemplifies a new kind of multifunctional urban infrastructure, one that serves communities both environmentally and socially, turning utility into an experience.

The Bullitt Center isn’t just green—it’s regenerative. Built to last 250 years, it is one of the few structures worldwide to meet the rigorous standards of the Living Building Challenge. It produces all of its own energy through solar panels, manages water with a rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling system, and uses composting toilets to minimise waste. Constructed without toxic materials, the building also features timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. More than just an office space, the Bullitt Center is a bold statement on what the future of building must look like in the era of climate action.

Dubbed the greenest office building in the world, The Edge has become a symbol of what sustainable corporate architecture can achieve. With a BREEAM score of 98.36%, it holds one of the highest sustainability ratings ever awarded. The building uses an innovative array of 28,000 sensors to manage lighting, temperature and occupancy. Rainwater harvesting, solar panels and an aquifer thermal energy storage system contribute to its net zero energy profile. Deloitte, the building’s primary occupant, worked closely with developers to ensure the workplace supported both environmental and employee wellbeing. The result is a smart, self-learning building that sets a new global standard.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ae2b408f8cefd92c74db642980016cf9:06735ee8cc5d3a08202cb4643af316f1/large-sustainability-top10-projects-cms-apr2025.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 19:56:24.131880

The company said the aircraft has the potential to cut fuel burn by up to 50% per passenger mile, while comfortably seating 250 passengers and flying up to 5,000 nautical miles.

JetZero's Path to Commercial Flight and Military Utility

JetZero's flagship aircraft, the Z4, is a high-capacity commercial plane designed to reshape both civilian and military aviation. With a demo flight scheduled for 2027, the Z4 targets long-haul commercial routes but also offers military potential, according to the company. The aircraft has multiple configurations including cargo transport and refueling tankers, two use cases that account for around 60% of the U.S. Air Force's total jet fuel consumption.

The Air Force's $235 million contract is meant to accelerate the development of JetZero's demonstrator aircraft and airframe technologies. JetZero is working closely with the Air Force, NASA, and the Federal Aviation Administration, which places it at the intersection of federal defense, aviation research, and commercial innovation.

In addition to military support, JetZero's commercial ambitions are gaining serious momentum, with United entering into a conditional agreement to order up to 100 aircraft, along with an option for 100 more.

Rethinking the Passenger Experience

Besides the focus on fuel savings, the aircraft's blended wing structure introduces a completely reimagined cabin layout. The company said that plans for the interior include larger, flexible seating, wider aisles, handicap-accessible lavatories, and dedicated overhead bins for each seat. The design also streamlines boarding, thanks to a wide main entrance and multiple aisles, reducing crowding and speeding up passenger flow.

The aircraft will run on conventional jet engines but is also compatible with sustainable aviation fuel blends. This opens the door to dramatic cuts in carbon emissions without requiring immediate overhauls of fueling infrastructure.

It’s not just the biodiesel industry that is largely shut down, but the entire value chain is shut down.

— Joe Jobe, CEO, Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition

JEFFERSON CITY, MO, UNITED STATES, May 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition, representing 70 organizational members throughout the biodiesel value chain, applauds the reintroduction of a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives on May 1 to reinstate the $1-per-gallon biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC)—a much-needed boost for the biodiesel industry.

HR 3137, introduced by Reps. Mike Carey, R-Ohio, and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, calls for retroactive reinstatement of the Section 40A biodiesel BTC, which expired Dec. 31, 2024. The bill would reinstate the BTC as of Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2026. While the Section 45Z production tax credit in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was viewed as a replacement for the BTC, the U.S. biodiesel industry has been in real trouble since last year, when the BTC sunset loomed and no implementing regulations on the 45Z credit were even proposed let alone finalized in the two-plus years since the IRA became law. This delay along with disadvantages the industry faces as a result of implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard program have had significant adverse impacts on biodiesel producers, many of which are smaller facilities located in rural areas. Numerous plants have shut down, their workers laid off and assets lost.

“The expiration of the biodiesel blenders tax credit (40A) along with the lack of implementing regulations on Section 45Z have effectively shut the biodiesel industry down for all of 2025, with no end in sight,” said SABR Coalition CEO Joe Jobe. “This bill to extend 40A would turn the markets back on immediately because the implementing regulations for 40A are already in place and the markets understand them.”

The Section 45Z credit as it currently stands is not the answer. The incentive favors sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel over biodiesel. Many biodiesel producers will be fortunate to get a third of the value from the Section 45Z credit as they got from the BTC or be subject to significant red tape to potentially get a higher value. Meanwhile, some SAF producers may get up to $1.75 a gallon from the new incentive. In addition, much like European policies and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the 45Z credit discriminates against ag-based feedstocks like soybeans grown by American farmers. This improper discrimination is based on the failed modeling theory of indirect land-use change, but 20 years of real-world data shows those predictions never came true.

The two-year BTC extension would provide time for Congress to fix fundamental flaws in the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z and for the Trump administration to propose and finalize implementing regulations for the 45Z credit, which the previous administration had two and a-half years to do but didn’t. The SABR Coalition and its members believe retroactive reinstatement of the $1-per-gallon BTC, which has an anti-double-dipping provision allowing producers to claim either a credit under Section 40A or 45Z but not both, is critically necessary to not only revive the battered U.S. biodiesel industry, but to save it from extinction.

“The biodiesel industry is in a world of hurt,” Jobe said. “It’s not just the biodiesel industry that is largely shut down, but the entire value chain is shut down. Farmers can’t sell their beans to crushers, who can’t sell their soybean oil to biodiesel producers, who can’t sell their fuel to distributors and byproduct to glycerin refiners. And those fuel distributors can’t sell their fuel to truck-stop operators, and glycerin refiners can’t sell their refined material to numerous, wide-ranging industries that rely on it for their products, including sewage treatment plants that use glycerin and enzymes in their water treatment processes. So, this doesn’t just impact biodiesel producers—several separate industries are involved in the value chain, and they’re all being devastated by the biodiesel industry being shut down by government inaction.”

The SABR Coalition and its members are urging Congress to include the BTC extension marker bill in the budget-reconciliation process—the “big, beautiful bill.” SABR sent a letter to the House and Senate majority and minority leaders, in addition to the chairs of the House ways and means committee and the Senate finance committee, along with the White House, explaining how imperative it is to reinstate the BTC to restore commerce up and down the biodiesel value chain—from farmers to crushers, biodiesel producers, glycerin refiners, fuel distributors, truck-stop operators and other important sectors of the American economy.

Groups endorsing the 40A extension bill include:

– American Trucking Associations (ATA).

– Clean Freight Coalition.

– Energy Marketers of America (EMA).

– Illinois Soybean Growers.

– National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).

– National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI).

– National Tank Truck Carriers.

– NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Centers and Truck Stops.

– Renewable Fuels Association (RFA).

– SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers.

– Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition.

– Truckload Carriers Association (TCA).

“Decades of public and private investment—including from the soybean checkoff—to build out the domestic biodiesel industry is at risk,” said Ron Kindred, the chairman of Illinois Soybean Growers and a farmer from Atlanta, Illinois. “This legislation removes the uncertainty that is impacting everyone in the biodiesel value chain starting with soybean farmers, all the way down to distributors, retailers and consumers.”

Cosponsors of the bill include Reps. Andrew Garbarino, R-New York; Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota; Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania; Darin LaHood, R-Illinois; and Claudia Tenney, R-New York.

Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants.
But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty.
He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies.
The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said.","Robert Bonnie, the Agriculture undersecretary for farm production and conservation in the Biden administration, said Monday that he is “very concerned that USDA is being weakened” by the Trump administration’s staffing and budget cuts.

In his first public remarks on the Trump administration’s policies, Bonnie told the North American Agricultural Journalists at their spring Washington meeting that he is particularly worried about the loss of key personnel. Bonnie said he is prohibited from having direct contact with USDA officials for two years due to the ethics agreement he signed when he took his presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed post, but that he has learned that Tim Griffiths, the national coordinator of the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s sage grouse initiative, left USDA on Friday.

An email to Griffiths’ NRCS address in Montana on Monday resulted in the following automated reply: “I am sorry, but I am no longer available.” The response directed senders to another USDA official, and ended with “Your friend in conservation. Tim.”

Bonnie noted that the sage grouse initiative Griffiths led covers more than 9 million acres and “involves a couple thousand ranches in a voluntary, all incentive-based program.”Bonnie said it was terrible for USDA to lose “that type of leadership, creativity. Tim is one of many people lost.

“According to a biography on the Society for Range Management website, Griffiths has “spent his entire career working to achieve fish and wildlife conservation through sustainable agriculture and to reduce regulatory burdens associated with the Endangered Species Act. In 2011, Tim received the Secretary of Agriculture Honor Award for his work on the agency’s major sage grouse conservation initiative.” Bonnie also said that 75% of the federal government’s wildfire response “sits at USDA,” and that he is worried as the summer fire season approaches, the Forest Service is “going to lose senior people, the number of teams will be reduced.” Bonnie also pointed out that the Biden administration established relationships with Ducks Unlimited and other conservation groups, and that he worried that USDA will lose those relationships. Bonnie, who developed the Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities during the Biden administration but also worked at USDA during the Obama administration, noted that during the Obama administration farmers “ran the other way from climate policy,” but during the Biden years the government and the farmers worked together on agriculture and forestry. Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants. The Trump administration has changed the Partnerships initiative into the Advancing Markets for Producers (AMP) initiative, and Bonnie has said he hopes that the administration will follow through on the original goals.

But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty. Bonnie said he also worried about the impact of cutting back on USDA programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, and the loss of U.S. international leadership. He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies. The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said. On biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel, other departments are also involved, he said.The final guidance for the 45Z tax credit for biofuels was not completed because officials in an interagency process wanted to further examine a carbon calculator, but if the Treasury Department would put in place the peer review process established by the Biden administration, “farmers would be off the races on sustainable aviation fuel,” Bonnie said. But Bonnie said he is worried about the loss of leadership in all the agencies that play a role in biofuels. If the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department pull back, “farmers are going to pay the price,” he said.

The awards, now in their second year, are presented by TheBusinessDesk.com in partnership with Clarion, Deloitte, and the Swinton Estate. They celebrate companies that are making lasting, positive contributions to society and the environment.

This accolade is a testament to Jet2’s dedication to creating a more sustainable future, demonstrating its leadership in the aviation industry. The company’s efforts were acknowledged for implementing clear sustainability strategies, achieving significant milestones, and continually working towards a greener tomorrow.

A Comprehensive Sustainability Strategy

Jet2’s updated Sustainability Strategy is built around three key pillars: In the Air, On the Ground, and In Resort. The strategy’s scope extends to tackling Scope 3 emissions across its supply chain, reflecting the company’s commitment to reducing its overall environmental impact.

One of the standout aspects of the strategy is Jet2’s new climate transition plan, which aims for tangible, immediate actions to reduce the airline’s carbon footprint. The company has set a target to reduce carbon emissions per revenue passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK) by 35% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. This ambitious goal means reducing emissions from 67gCO2/RPK in 2019 to 43.55gCO2/RPK in 2035.

Key Sustainability Achievements

Jet2 has made notable investments to decarbonize its fleet, with a firm commitment to purchasing 146 Airbus A321 neo aircraft. These new aircraft will result in up to 20% reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger and are 50% quieter than their predecessors, helping Jet2 achieve its carbon reduction goals while providing a more comfortable experience for passengers.

The company has also prioritized eliminating single-use plastics, replacing them with biodegradable and recyclable alternatives. This initiative alone has successfully removed 22 million single-use plastic items from Jet2’s supply chain each year.

To further enhance fuel efficiency, Jet2 has incorporated cutting-edge technologies like the split-scimitar winglets on 60 of its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. These modifications have resulted in reduced fuel consumption through improved aerodynamic performance.

A Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

In its efforts to reduce its environmental impact, Jet2 has introduced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its operations. The company began using SAF at key airports such as London Stansted, Bristol, and Malaga, well ahead of the mandatory SAF requirements set to take effect in the UK and EU in January 2025. This proactive approach highlights Jet2’s leadership in the industry and its commitment to adopting greener fuel alternatives.

Ground Operations and Electric Equipment

Jet2 has also focused on electrifying its ground operations, with over 50% of its ground service equipment now fully electric. This effort significantly reduces carbon emissions from the company’s non-flying operations and contributes to the overall sustainability of its business.

Jet2holidays’ Sustainable Hotels Collection

In addition to its work on the airline front, Jet2holidays has expanded its Certified Sustainable Hotels collection. This growing collection, now with over 1,200 hotels, provides customers the option to choose accommodation that meets rigorous sustainability certifications, furthering Jet2’s commitment to responsible travel.

Recognized as an Industry Leader

In recognition of its efforts, Jet2 has earned a platinum rating for airline sustainability in the CAPA 2023 sustainability benchmark report, placing it among the top ten airlines globally for its sustainability performance. The airline ranks 4th out of 100 airlines in carbon emissions per revenue passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK), cementing its status as a leader in environmental responsibility.

A Social Value Framework for Communities

Jet2’s Sustainability Strategy goes beyond environmental considerations. The company has introduced a social value framework that focuses on supporting its employees and the communities where it operates. This framework addresses eight key areas: training and development, well-being, inclusion and access, health and safety (within the company), and jobs and skills, communities, partnerships and ethics, risk and safety (outside the company).

This holistic approach to sustainability not only benefits the environment but also fosters positive change in the communities Jet2 serves, ensuring that its efforts extend beyond business operations.

Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays said: “I am very proud of what we have achieved since launching our first sustainability strategy in 2021 and this award reflects the investment and hard work that has gone into that. We are basing our strategy on technologies and tangible actions that we know are available to us now, rather than what may or may not be available in the future, however we continually monitor to see where we can embrace new technologies. Our tangible steps include investing in new and more fuel-efficient aircraft, using SAF, launching a Certified Sustainable Hotels collection, removing millions of single use plastics from onboard our aircraft, and utilising technologies such as split-scimitar winglets. Our strategy clearly sets out our vision to accelerate our sustainability journey whilst supporting our colleagues and the communities where we operate, and we will continue to make this a critical area of focus.”

Jet2’s recognition at the Yorkshire Sustainability Excellence Awards is a well-deserved acknowledgment of its ongoing commitment to sustainability. From investing in new aircraft to reducing single-use plastics and promoting sustainable travel options, Jet2 is paving the way for a greener and more responsible aviation industry. As the company continues to build on its impressive sustainability achievements, it remains at the forefront of driving positive change within the aviation sector and beyond.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Jet2_Sustainability_award-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 19:56:32.967735

Off the pitch, the club is also making waves as a leader in sustainability efforts, positioning itself as one of the greenest football clubs in Europe.

As fans cheer their goals and victories, the club is also scoring major points in its mission to cut carbon emissions and adopt environmentally friendly practices. Through ‘The Red Way‘ strategy, Liverpool aims to reduce its environmental footprint and set new standards for sustainability in the world of elite football.

The Red Way: Liverpool’s Blueprint for Sustainability

Liverpool FC’s journey to sustainability officially began in 2021 with the launch of The Red Way. It is the club’s award-winning strategy to minimize its environmental impact.

The plan focuses on three pillars: people, planet, and communities. It aligns with 16 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. On the environmental front, Liverpool has set clear targets:

Halve operational carbon emissions by 2030

Achieve net zero by 2040

Achieve carbon neutrality in merchandising by 2030

In its 2023–24 Red Way report, the club outlined key achievements:

96% of all energy at club sites came from renewable or low-carbon sources

Football operations emissions were 100% offset

Overall carbon emissions fell 12.5% compared to 2022–23

A 15% reduction in emissions from its 2019–20 baseline

In transportation, LFC invested in Sustainable Aviation Fuel to eliminate all emissions from domestic flights. Its team buses are powered by Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, cutting emissions by up to 90% compared to diesel.

The club worked on biodiversity and planted over 1,000 trees and hedges. They also added honeybee habitats with 60,000 bees. Plus, they grew half a tonne of food for their kitchens.

The legendary Anfield pitch is now fully recyclable. Old turf is repurposed into benches and other materials for community projects like the orchard at the AXA Training Centre.

The club’s operations have been recognized through ISO certifications:

ISO20121 (sustainability management)

ISO45001 (health and safety)

ISO50001 (energy management)

Liverpool has committed to global efforts by signing the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and the UN’s Race to Zero. They pledge to cut emissions in half by 2030 and aim for net zero “as soon as possible.”

A Game-Changing Collaboration: Direct Air Capture with 1PointFive

In 2025, Liverpool strengthened its sustainability efforts. It partnered with 1PointFive, a subsidiary of Occidental that focuses on Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology.

Under this collaboration, LFC calculates the carbon footprint of its merchandise — from production to delivery — and purchases carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits to offset those emissions.

DAC is a cutting-edge solution that removes CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. Liverpool’s purchased credits are tied to STRATOS. This facility will be the largest DAC in the world that can capture 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ each year.

According to LFC Chief Commercial Officer Ben Latty:

“Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do at the club. Through The Red Way, we are dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint and driving positive change for our people, planet, and communities.”

This innovative step positions Liverpool as one of the first clubs to embed carbon removal directly into fan merchandise. Beyond offsetting, it also encourages supporters to make carbon-conscious choices, deepening fan engagement on climate action.

How Liverpool Compares: Sustainability Efforts of Rival Clubs

Liverpool FC is seen as one of the leaders in football when it comes to protecting the environment. But Liverpool is not alone. Two of its biggest Premier League rivals, Manchester City and Arsenal, are also working hard to make their clubs more environmentally friendly.

Manchester City’s Sustainability Initiatives

Manchester City has added many green actions to its Etihad Campus. Like Liverpool, it signed the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and promised to reach net-zero emissions by 2030.

The club uses 100% renewable electricity in its stadium and buildings. It has installed over 10,000 solar panels at the City Football Academy and the Joie Stadium. Man City is also strong in waste management. It sends zero waste to landfills and recycles over 90% of waste on matchdays.

To cut travel emissions, the club encourages fans to take public transport or bike to games. The club’s buildings use energy-saving lights and water-saving systems. In 2023, Manchester City won the Sustainability Team of the Year award at the Football Business Awards for all these efforts.

Arsenal FC’s Green Efforts

Arsenal FC is another club known for its green leadership. It was the first Premier League club to put in a large battery storage system at its Emirates Stadium. This system stores extra renewable energy for later use.

The club aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. It has an interim goal of reducing Scope 1 and 3 emissions by 42% and Scope 3 emissions intensity by 52% by 2030, versus 2021 levels.

Like Manchester City, Arsenal uses 100% renewable electricity to power its Emirates Stadium and low-carbon gas to lower emissions. It has installed a 3MW battery storage system.

The club has cut down on single-use plastics in food stands, drink areas, and its shops. It also runs projects like tree planting and wildlife protection to help nature near the club.

Between 2019 and 2023, Arsenal cut its operational emissions by 20%. It signed the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework too. Through its “Arsenal for Change” campaign, the club encourages fans to take part in environmental activities.

All three clubs show a strong commitment to protecting the environment. Liverpool stands out because it uses carbon removal technology in its merchandise and leads in biodiversity work. Manchester City is strongest in waste management, while Arsenal leads in energy storage and community nature projects.

Overall, here is how the three Premier League clubs compare in terms of the following environmental metrics.

A Growing Collective Responsibility in Football

Liverpool, Manchester City, and Arsenal’s initiatives reflect a larger shift: elite football clubs are starting to recognize their role in fighting climate change.

Beyond clubs, fans, governing bodies, and sponsors are pushing for greener practices. The Premier League launched a Sustainability Strategy in 2023 and recently published an update. This plan urges all 20 clubs to cut emissions, reduce waste, and engage with communities.

The Sports Positive League Table ranks Premier League clubs based on sustainability. It helps set standards and boosts competition in ESG practices. Liverpool has consistently ranked in the top three, alongside Arsenal and Manchester City.

Beyond the Premier League, the push for greater environmental responsibility in football is becoming a global movement. Clubs worldwide are stepping up. They aim to cut emissions, reduce waste, and support sustainable practices on and off the field.

In Germany, VfL Wolfsburg stands out as a leader in sustainable football. The club, owned by Volkswagen, has been carbon neutral since 2012. This makes it one of the first in European sports to adopt large-scale environmental initiatives.

Wolfsburg uses 100% renewable energy, and they harvest rainwater to irrigate the pitch. The club also offers eco-friendly transport for fans and staff.

In the Netherlands, Ajax Amsterdam has embraced renewable energy and circular economy principles. The Johan Cruijff Arena is Ajax’s home stadium. It uses solar panels, wind energy, and a 3-megawatt battery storage system. This system is one of the largest in Europe and runs on recycled Nissan Leaf car batteries.

The arena’s green design includes LED lights, water-saving tech, and waste separation systems. These features help cut down the environmental impact of major sports events.

Moving to North America, Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer (MLS) has made strong commitments to sustainability. The club offsets travel emissions for the team. It also promotes zero-waste matchdays at Lumen Field. Plus, it partners with local groups for urban reforestation and community solar projects.

Sounders FC helped start MLS WORKS Greener Goals. This league-wide initiative focuses on making American soccer more environmentally friendly.

Even smaller clubs are stepping up. In England’s League Two, Forest Green Rovers has been widely praised as “the greenest football club in the world”. The club has set a global standard for sustainable sports infrastructure. Their fully vegan stadium menu, organic pitch, and solar-powered stadium lead the way.

These examples show that Liverpool, Manchester City, and Arsenal are part of a much broader shift. More clubs are using new solutions and sharing best practices. This helps football make a bigger impact on climate action.

A New Competition Off the Field

As Liverpool FC chases silverware on the pitch, it is also chasing leadership in sustainability off it. With bold targets, innovative partnerships, and award-winning initiatives under The Red Way, the club is setting standards that go beyond football. And as its Premier League rivals also raise their ESG ambitions, the competition for sustainability leadership is only set to grow.

Winning matches is important. But setting a strong example in the fight against climate change? That could be one of the most meaningful goals of all.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2279399373.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 17:56:25.247038

“The UK and Scottish governments have utterly failed to protect refinery jobs at Grangemouth, and thousands face losing their jobs as oil refining in Scotland ends,” said Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary.","Petroineos Refining Ltd. (PRL) has permanently ended conventional processing activities at Petroineos Manufacturing Scotland Ltd.’s 150,000-b/d Grangemouth refinery complex on the Firth of Forth in Scotland (OGJ Online, Sept. 13, 2024).

As of Apr. 28, Grangemouth refinery was no longer processing crude oil, PRL confirmed to OGJ in an e-mailed statement.

“[PRL] has invested £50 million (US$66.4 million) in creating a modern import and distribution terminal capable of receiving finished fuels by sea for onward distribution to customers around the country,” said Iain Hardie, Petroineos’ regional head of legal and external affairs.

“From 29 April, we will be importing all the products necessary to meet Scotland’s demand for transport fuels,” Hardie added.

Confirmation of the closure follows PRL’s late-2020 announcement of its intention to begin rationalizing capacity before ultimately ending operations in second-quarter 2025 amid a collision of global market pressures and the global energy transition, the combination of which left the 1924-built refinery unable to economically compete with more modern and efficient sites in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Africa, as well as limited demand for key fossil-based fuels produced at the site (OGJ Online, Nov. 19, 2020).

PRL extended its appreciation to Grangemouth’s workforce, about 400 of which were set to lose employment with the refinery’s shutdown.

“Our colleagues have shown incredible commitment, dignity, and resilience during months of uncertainty regarding the future of this [refinery], through the consultation period, phased shutdown, and the start of refinery decommissioning. It has been a challenging period, but their professionalism has ensured security of fuel supply to our customers across Scotland and beyond,"" Hardie said.

PRL is a joint venture of INEOS AG’s Ineos Investments (Jersey) Ltd. (50.1%) and China National Petroleum Corp.’s PetroChina Co. Ltd. (PetroChina) subsidiary PetroChina International (London) Co. Ltd. (49.9%).

Grangemouth’s future

The refinery’s shuttering comes just more than a month after the UK and Scottish governments released results of a £1.5-million ($2-million) feasibility study executed by Ernst & Young Global Ltd. that outlines nine low-carbon and renewable energy business models most likely to attract private investment for securing the industrial site’s future (OGJ Online, Mar. 21, 2025).

Known as Project Willow, the plan—backed by £25 million from the Scottish government and £200 million from the UK government—includes investments such as:

Waste: Hydrothermal upgrading (breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics); chemical plastics recycling, acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) biorefining (breaking down waste material).

Biofeedstock: Breaking down Scottish timber into bioethanol; anaerobic digestion of bioresources and digestate pyrolysis; hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), entailing conversion of Scottish cover crops into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel using low-carbon hydrogen.

Offshore wind conduit: Replacing natural gas with hydrogen; using low-carbon hydrogen to produce methanol for subsequent conversion to SAF; producing low-carbon ammonia from hydrogen for shipping and chemicals.

Both the UK and Scottish governments said they work with Petroineos to market the proposals set out in Project Willow and seek investor interest to support businesses and stakeholders in a goal to bring forward investible propositions for the site within the next 12 months.

Unforgiving workforce?

In the wake of the refinery’s closure, Unite the Union (Unite)—the country’s largest trade union—issued an Apr. 29 statement in which it warned political leaders of electoral consequences for failing the refinery’s workforce and the broader Grangemouth community.

“The UK and Scottish governments have utterly failed to protect refinery jobs at Grangemouth, and thousands face losing their jobs as oil refining in Scotland ends,” said Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary.

“There are projects like SAF production which can be accelerated to protect jobs, and…pave the way for Grangemouth to become a world leader in green aviation,” Graham said.

Unite cited an impact assessment by PwC that concluded the Grangemouth refinery makes an economic contribution of £403.6 million/year and that “almost 3,000 workers [relied] on the refinery’s operations.”

“[B]oth [the UK and Scottish] governments have effectively allowed China to shutdown Scotland’s capacity to refine fuel, as it hopes to use Grangemouth as an import hub,” Graham contended.

“Workers will not forget or forgive,” she said.

Graham pointed out that while Project Willow has identified nine possible projects for the site, “under [PRL’s] proposals, most of these [projects] would not start for several years after the site had closed and jobs had been lost.”

Unite believes many of the potential projects “could be fast tracked and implemented now,” including “a rapid move to convert the existing refinery to [SAF] production…starting with co-processing [of renewable feedstock with conventional crude].”

“Instead, not one job will be saved at the refinery, not one job will be created for years by Project Willow, and not one penny of the £200-million National Wealth Fund can be unlocked without private investment,” said Derek Thomson, leader of Unite Scotland.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/05/6815029eacfa13120c4aaa06-250502petroineos_refining_ltd.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-02 19:56:37.683623

But referring to the government’s SAF Mandate, which requires 2% of fuel on flights departing the UK this year to be SAF, she said: “Mandates alone don’t create supply.”

Hudson told Abta’s Aviation Forum: “We’re further ahead as a group than we thought we would be – 2.6% of our fuel is SAF. [But] we’re trying to replace fossil fuels in a short space of time. We need to see next‑generation SAF fuels scaling. That requires technologies to come to market quickly.”

She argued the government’s proposed Revenue Certainty Mechanism to encourage SAF production would see the costs “come back to airlines and go on to consumers”.

Sustainable Aviation’s Duncan McCourt said: “The Revenue Certainty Mechanism can’t come quickly enough.” But he noted: “SAF will be a global commodity and the UK will [have to] import large quantities.”

The aviation industry has a “credible” plan to reach net zero by 2050, Sustainable Aviation chief executive Duncan McCourt told delegates at the Abta forum.

But he acknowledged: “It’s not without significant challenges, not without significant uncertainty and no doubt there will be significant periods of discomfort.”

McCourt warned: “The political pressure is likely to increase. Aviation will be the biggest emitter [of carbon] by 2040, so it’s incumbent on aviation to do all it can to address this.”

He insisted: “The tools now exist to take carbon out of flying. All the elements of the technology already exist. We know the science of how to do it, but we haven’t got the scale.”

McCourt said aviation leaders fear that if the industry does not move fast enough, it faces “the risk of stranded assets and regulations restricting demand growth”.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/074/Shutterstock-airline-fuel_Main.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 12:56:34.141048

However, the company held firm because of strong oil and gas output and steady LNG profits, and more interestingly, its carbon credits investment.

The report revealed that production rose 4% year-over-year, averaging 2.55–2.57 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. New output from Brazil, the U.S., Malaysia, Argentina, and Denmark helped drive this growth. Gas prices stayed high, partly balancing weaker oil prices.

Power and LNG Boost TotalEnergies Amid Refining Woes

The LNG business posted $1.3 billion in adjusted net operating income. While LNG trading met expectations, gas trading struggled due to Europe’s volatile markets and geopolitical tensions.

Power operations also grew. The segment generated over $500 million in income and $600 million in cash flow. Key deals, like acquiring Germany’s VSB and investing in battery storage, supported this growth.

Still, downstream operations faced headwinds. Weak refining margins and issues at French and U.S. facilities cut into profits. Petrochemical and biofuel margins in Europe also declined, adding pressure.

Carbon Credit Spending Hits Record High

TotalEnergies spent $2 million on carbon credits in Q1 2025. That’s double what it spent in Q1 2024. This massive spending aims to cut emissions and reach its net-zero target by 2050.

Robust Backing for Nature-Based Projects

A significant segment of its investment supports nature-based solutions like forest protection, regenerative farming, and wetland conservation. By the end of last year, TotalEnergies had collected 13.7 million verified carbon credits. Each year, the company plans to invest $100 million in carbon projects.

Between 2025 and 2030, TotalEnergies will build a stock of 50 million carbon credits.

These projects can potentially deliver at least 5 million metric tons of CO₂e credits annually by 2030.

From 2030, the company will start using high-quality carbon credits to offset its remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The aim is to build a strong portfolio of trusted projects that support global rules and ensure the credits are real and long-lasting. Additionally, the company expects these projects to bring long-term environmental and social benefits.

It expects to reach 37 million verified credits by 2030 and 53 million by 2050. These projects could also generate $770 million for local communities.

$100 M Deal with Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands

TotalEnergies signed a $100 million deal with Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands last year. The project protects 300,000 hectares of forests across 10 U.S. states—Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

This partnership supports sustainable forest management and boosts the forests’ ability to absorb carbon. It also helps local communities by improving land use and preventing environmental damage. The carbon credits generated help offset the company’s remaining emissions.

What Makes Total Energies the Top Net-Zero Player

Last year, the LNG giant launched the “Our 5 Levers for Sustainable Change” initiative. The goal was to engage all employees in reducing emissions by boosting energy efficiency and adopting low-carbon technologies across its operations.

GHG Emissions Fell in 2024

The company cut emissions from operated sites by more than 36% in 2024 compared to 2015. Notably, over 200 emission-reduction projects helped slash 1.3 million tons of CO₂e.

However, recently the company raised its 2025 emissions goal to 37 Mt CO₂e per year. It aims to cut net Scope 1+2 emissions by 40% by 2030 (vs. 2015 levels). This also includes using 5 million carbon credits from nature-based projects, as explained before. Subsequently, these offsets will be used only for residual emissions from 2030 and consumed gradually at about 10% per year.

By end-2024, TotalEnergies had invested around $750 million in emissions reduction. These investments save 1.5 Mt CO₂e each year and cut energy costs by over $100 million annually.

However, emissions from flexible power generation rose slightly. This happened due to the addition of combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) in the U.S. and U.K., which support TotalEnergies’ low-carbon electricity expansion.

Still, overall emissions dropped 25% from 2015 levels.

The carbon intensity of upstream oil and gas assets also fell from 21 kg CO₂e/boe in 2015 to 17 kg CO₂e/boe in 2024.

All these figures make TotalEnergies one of the top industry performers.

Scope 3 and Scope 4 Emissions

In 2024, TotalEnergies helped reduce global emissions by 65 million tonnes of CO₂e through LNG sales, as many customers replaced coal with gas for power generation. Although gas increases Scope 3 emissions, it enables cleaner energy and avoids more emissions overall. These are classified as Scope 4 emissions.

The company also avoided 18 million tonnes of CO₂e in 2024 and is aiming for 150 million tonnes of emissions by 2030. This makes 90 Mt from LNG and 60 Mt from renewables while keeping Scope 3 emissions below 400 Mt.

Methane Emissions Drop Drastically

Methane emissions dropped from 64 kt in 2020 to 29 kt in 2024—a 55% cut. TotalEnergies beat its 2025 target early and now aims for a 60% cut by 2025, and an 80% cut by 2030 compared to 2020.

Digital Tools Boost Efficiency

The company is using digital tools to cut emissions smartly. In Exploration & Production, the ForCFR app links carbon forecasts with oil and gas output. In Angola, it helped cut 179 kt CO₂e annually by optimizing well operations.

Another example is: at the Normandy, Donges, and Feyzin refineries, the CarbOptim app tracks energy use in real-time and helps cut steam and energy waste.

2025 Carbon Intensity Reduction Target

TotalEnergies has raised its 2025 carbon intensity reduction target from 15% to 17%, aiming for a 25% emission cut by 2030. That means delivering the same energy with fewer emissions, or more energy with the same carbon footprint. Most of the progress will come from boosting clean electricity, cutting oil use, and growing gas and bioenergy.

Joins Google for Clean Energy

In January 2025, TotalEnergies teamed up with Google Europe to help power its Dutch data centers with 24/7 clean electricity by 2030. They’ll combine Google’s green power deals and add battery storage to handle renewables’ ups and downs. Similar deals are already in place with U.S. tech firms

Switch to Low-Carbon Power by 2025

TotalEnergies aims to power all its refining and chemical sites in Europe and the U.S. with 100% low-carbon electricity by 2025. This target will be achieved through initiatives like the Go Green project in Port Arthur, Texas.

Additionally, last year it achieved 26 GW of gross installed renewable electricity capacity, targeting 35 GW by 2025 and reaching 100 GW by 2030.

With this progress, TotalEnergies plans to become one of the top five global producers of renewable electricity (wind and solar), excluding Chinese companies.

Latest Projects

In April 2024, TotalEnergies started the Marsa LNG project in Oman. The plant will run on power from a 300 MW solar farm and emit less than 3 kg CO₂ per barrel of oil equivalent.

Also, the company approved the GranMorgu oil project in Suriname.

This all-electric project will use advanced tech to cut emissions below 16 kg CO₂ per barrel of oil equivalent.

Additionally, it aims to:

Become a key producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), targeting 1.5 million tonnes annually by 2030.

In 2024, the company’s gross biomethane production capacity rose to 1.2 TWh per year

Hydrogen Plans Take Shape

This is part of its long-term plan to decarbonize its operations and energy products.

TotalEnergies is expanding its clean hydrogen portfolio with multiple projects across Europe. In France, it’s building biohydrogen units at La Mède and Grandpuits refineries with Air Liquide, targeting annual CO₂ cuts of 130,000 and 150,000 tonnes respectively.

In the Netherlands, a 250 MW offshore wind-powered electrolyser in Zeeland will supply 30,000 tonnes of green hydrogen from 2029, reducing refinery emissions by 300,000 tonnes yearly.

Furthermore, tolling agreements in Belgium and France will see Air Liquide operate electrolysers in Antwerp (130 MW) and Normandy (100 MW), each producing 15,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually and cutting 150,000 tonnes of CO₂ per site by 2027.

Despite market challenges, TotalEnergies continues to invest in clean energy and climate action. Its rising carbon credit purchases highlight how big energy players are using voluntary carbon markets to decarbonize. Thus, its role for a lower-carbon future is of utmost significance.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2079480685.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 12:56:38.464470

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Report Scope:

Based on fuel type, the biofuel segment is projected to account for the largest share during the forecast period.

Based on fuel type, the biofuel segment is projected to account for the largest share during the forecast period due to several primary factors related to the availability of feedstocks, technology maturity, and regulatory backing. Biofuel production is done from feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural residues, animal fats, and other biomass feedstocks. Technologies such as Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes are established and already qualified for use in biofuel production and are becoming more scalable and easier to retrofit into existing aviation fuel infrastructure. This technological availability provides biofuels with an important start over other types of SAF, which remain at more advanced commercial development stages. Additionally, biofuel production has a broad and increasingly sustainable supply chain, using waste and non-food biomass, which assists in solving both environmental and economic issues. Moreover, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of biofuels up to 80% over that of traditional jet fuel renders it a strong near-term solution for airlines aiming to achieve carbon reduction targets. Airlines and producers of SAF are increasingly signing long-term offtake contracts for bio-based SAF, further supporting demand and investment in this area. All factors, such as technological maturity, regulation support, and the ability to reduce emissions short-term, make biofuel the dominant fuel in the SAF industry.

Based on biofuel conversion pathway, the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

Based on biofuel conversion pathway, the ATJ segment is projected to register the highest growth during the forecast period due to its high potential to meet the environmental and the aviation industry's demand for sustainability. This technology involves the conversion of alcohol-based feedstocks into hydrocarbons with a jet-range, yielding sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The appeal of the ATJ pathway is in its capability to utilize widely available and renewable alcohol feedstocks, some of which are derived from waste or lignocellulosic biomass, resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil-based jet fuels. With regulatory demands and international aviation treaties, such as CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), the market for SAF will grow exponentially, thereby increasing growth in ATJ technologies. In addition, various investments in research and infrastructure are contributing to the commercialization of ATJ processes. Large industry participants and governments are entering strategic partnerships to increase production and simplify certification procedures for ATJ-derived fuels. The adaptability of the ATJ pathway to fit within traditional refining infrastructure and conformity with today's aircraft engines makes it even more attractive. With airlines and airports globally aiming to decarbonize, the ATJ segment will play a leading role in reshaping aviation fuel supply chains, thus making it the most rapidly growing biofuel conversion process.

The trade association highlighted that aircraft deliveries were also up 20% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

The figures – which run until 31st March, two days before the US Administration’s announcement of tariff increases on US imports – show further that the industry’s backlog of aircraft orders has reached a new record high, standing at 15,954 aircraft at the end of March – 1% higher than Q1 2024.

This backlog is estimated to be worth up to £254 billion to the UK economy at current production rates, underscoring the long-term value of the aerospace sector and its extensive UK supply chain.

ADS Outlook

The recent tariffs introduced by the US Administration on 2nd April are still being evaluated by industry leaders, with disruption to trade and supply chains likely to affect aircraft deliveries in the coming months.

Broader international reactions to the evolving US trade policy may add further uncertainty, particularly for long-haul programmes and cross-border component flows. That is why ADS is calling on the UK Government to seek exemptions for civil aircraft, engine parts and components as part of our trade negotiations to ensure the free movement of aerospace goods in line with the longstanding WTO Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.

Despite these challenges, increased momentum at the start of 2025 shows that with the right conditions, industry can deliver strong performance metrics and support UK competitiveness in the global aerospace market.",,N,,2025-05-02 11:57:32.088141

US bill would extend expired biofuel credits

US bill would extend expired biofuel credits

New York, 1 May (Argus) — Legislation soon to be introduced in the US House would extend expired biofuel incentives through 2026, potentially providing a reprieve to refiners that have curbed production this year because of policy uncertainty. The bill, which will be sponsored by US representative Mike Carey (R-Ohio) and some other Republicans on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, according to a person familiar, could be introduced as soon as today. It would prolong both the long-running $1/USG for blenders of biomass-based diesel and a separate incentive that offers up to $1.01/USG for producers of cellulosic ethanol. The credits expired at the end of last year but under the proposal would be extended through both 2025 and 2026. The incentives would run alongside the Inflation Reduction Act's new ""45Z"" credit for clean fuel producers, which offers a sliding scale of benefits based on carbon intensity, though the bill would prevent double claiming of credits, according to bill text shared with Argus . The 45Z credit is less generous across the board to road fuels — offering $1/USG only for carbon-neutral fuels and much less for crop-based diesels — and is still in need of final rules after President Joe Biden's administration issued only preliminary guidance around qualifying. The proposal then would effectively offer a more generous alternative through 2026 for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and cellulosic ethanol but not for other fuels that can claim the technology-neutral 45Z incentive. That could upend the economics of renewable fuel production. Vegetable oil-based diesels for instance could claim the blenders credit and earn more than aviation fuels that draw from the same feedstocks. According to Argus Consulting estimates, aviation fuels derived from wastes like distillers corn oil and domestic used cooking should still earn more than $1/USG this year, conversely, since 45Z is more generous to aviation fuels. Extending the biodiesel blenders credit would also allow foreign fuel imports to again claim federal subsidies, a boost for Finnish refiner Neste and the ailing Canadian biofuel startup Braya Renewable Fuels but a controversial provision for US refiners and feedstock suppliers. The 45Z incentive can only be claimed by US producers. The blenders incentive is also popular among fuel marketer groups, which have warned that shifting subsidies to producers could up fuel costs. The proposal adds to a contentious debate taking place across the biofuel value chain about what the future of clean fuel incentives should look like. Some industry groups see a wholesale reversion to preexisting biofuel credits — or even a temporary period where various partly overlapping incentives coexist — as a tough sell to cost-concerned lawmakers and have instead pushed for revamping 45Z. A proposal last month backed by some farm groups would keep the 45Z incentive but ban foreign feedstocks and adjust carbon intensity modeling to benefit crops. Republicans could keep, modify, extend, or repeal the 45Z incentive as part of negotiations around a larger tax bill this year. But the caucus is still negotiating how much to reduce the federal budget deficit and what to do with Inflation Reduction Act incentives that have spurred clean energy projects in conservative districts. Uncertainty about the future of biofuel policy and sharply lower margins to start 2025 have led to a recently pronounced drop in biodiesel and renewable diesel production . President Donald Trump's administration is working on new biofuel blend mandates, which could be proposed in the coming weeks, but has said little about its plans for biofuel tax policy.

The Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil Market was valued at USD 27.2 Billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 92.1 Billion by 2034, rising at a CAGR of 13%.

The growing shift toward renewable energy sources is rapidly elevating HVO's role as a sustainable fuel alternative across industries. As global economies pivot to reducing dependence on fossil fuels, HVO is emerging as a critical solution for meeting decarbonization goals. Its ability to serve as a drop-in replacement for traditional diesel, combined with cleaner combustion and lower greenhouse gas emissions, is pushing demand among major sectors, including transportation, aviation, and industrial power generation.

Several governments, particularly in North America and Europe, are stepping up mandates to cut carbon emissions with policy frameworks like tax credits, blending mandates, and emission caps that directly encourage the use of HVO. These policies are opening new growth opportunities for HVO producers and reinforcing their importance in the global shift toward greener energy. Increasing public and private investments in advanced biofuels and next-generation feedstocks are further enhancing the market outlook as companies explore innovative ways to scale HVO production while keeping costs competitive. As more industries seek to meet ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals, the focus on clean-burning, low-carbon alternatives like HVO continues to intensify, fueling rapid adoption across both developed and emerging economies.

In 2024, the food and feed crops segment dominated the HVO market with a 68.7% share and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 12.4% through 2034. The widespread use of food and feed crops in HVO production is largely driven by their abundant availability, robust supply chains, and the well-established agricultural framework supporting them. Crops like soybeans and rapeseed are pivotal in supplying the oils required for efficient HVO production, ensuring a steady feedstock supply to meet growing biofuel demand. While concerns around food security and land use are gaining attention, policies across regions still back crop-based biofuels, further propelling market growth.

The market is also segmented by grade, covering premium grade, standard grade, basic grade, and specialty grade. Among these, the standard grade HVO segment generated USD 10.6 billion in 2024 and is set to grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2025 to 2034. Standard grade is increasingly preferred due to its balance of cost, performance, and versatility, making it an ideal choice for transportation, industrial operations, and power generation. It meets stringent emission norms while remaining economically viable compared to higher-end premium grades that are typically used in niche, high-performance sectors.

Regionally, Europe's Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil Market reached USD 10.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.6% through 2034. Europe continues to lead the global HVO landscape, driven by powerful regulatory backing and escalating demand for renewable fuels.

Our dedication to climate protection is exemplified through our insurance of innovative projects like the Montana Renewables facility in Great Falls, Montana.

Montana Renewables: A Leader in Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel provides a lower-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel. It is a ""drop-in"" fuel, which means it can be used with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure – a significant advantage in terms of simplifying the adoption process. As the second-largest producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the United States, Montana Renewables is at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF could contribute around 65% of the emissions reductions the aviation industry needs to be net zero by 2050. Making this happen will require a huge increase in SAF production. The Montana Renewables facility is set to expand significantly, with the help of a $1.44 billion loan from the Department of Energy (DOE). This expansion will increase the facility's production capacity to approximately 315 million gallons of biofuels annually by 2028, with a significant portion dedicated to SAF.

The Importance of SAF, Renewable Diesel, and Hydrogen

The growth of SAF is parallel to the production of Renewable Diesel (RD), as both use similar feedstocks and processes. Montana Renewables is also pioneering the use of green hydrogen in its conversion process, further lowering its operations' carbon footprint.

The expansion of Montana Renewables will boost SAF production and contribute to the supply of RD, providing low-carbon mobility fuels worldwide. This dual production capability is vital for the large-scale adoption of SAF, enabling airlines to commit seriously to its use.

SCOR's Broader Commitment to Renewable Energy

Our support for Montana Renewables is part of SCOR's broader strategy to foster a sustainable and resilient future. In 2023, we launched a dedicated New Energy Practice to support the ongoing energy transition needs of our clients. This practice offers comprehensive insurance solutions for a wide range of low-carbon technologies, including wind farms, solar farms, hydrogen1, carbon capture, and biofuels.

is an alternative fuel that is being marketed as a solution to the aviation industry’s carbon intense nature. It is made by collecting waste materials such as cooking and vegetable oils, animal fats, and food scraps as feedstock. This feedstock is then pre-treated, removing any impurities and contaminants. The feedstock is then refined by removing the oxygen from the feedstock by adding additional Hydrogen in a process called hydrodeoxygenation, the resulting Hydrocarbons then go through a process called isomerisation which adjust the properties of the fuel.

Among the top 10 largest planes in the world are aircraft made for military use, like the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, which the U.S. Air Force uses to haul weapons and supplies, but could carry 350 people if it were used solely for personnel. And there's the Stratolaunch, which looks like two planes connected at the wing. While it's larger than any other plane, is now only used for testing hypersonic flight systems, and was mostly created for rocket launches.

That leaves the Airbus A380 as the largest plane currently flying in 2025, making it one of the most iconic airplanes in aviation history. It carries a whopping 545 passengers if it's outfitted in a typical setup where there are four classes in the plane, but if you made every passenger fly in economy class, it could fit 853 passengers. And as you would expect from those statistics, this thing is massive. The wingspan is 261.8 feet and its height clocks in at 79.1 feet. It has four engines and two full passenger decks, so its interior measures 5,920 square feet — over twice the size of an average home.

The Airbus A380 has an interesting history. It was first manufactured in 2007, and production ceased in 2021, a span of 14 years. This is because demand was far less than Airbus had originally predicted. Instead of sitting among ever-greater amounts of people in a plane, passengers were much more interested in being able to take faster, more direct routes. Passenger jets with incredibly long ranges, like the A380's sister aircraft the Airbus A350, became much more en vogue. Also, the A380 faced strong competition from Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which has a similarly large body, and costs far less to operate.

Another hiccup came when travel slowed in the year 2020 with the rise of COVID-19. It's no surprise that a plane with such a high capacity wasn't as in demand when most people were avoiding travel due to the fear of spreading or contracting the illness. Airbus A380 planes were placed in the desert for storage during the early part of the pandemic, but came out of hibernation by the end of 2021, when travel increased sharply — part of why it's still possible to catch a flight on an Airbus A380 to this day.

In its production heyday, the Airbus A380 was ordered 251 times by 14 different airlines. It's most commonly seen in the Emirates fleet, as the airline purchased 123 of the aircraft, making it the largest customer. Between April 1, 2023 and the same date in 2024, FlightRadar24 reports, Emirates completed over 54,000 flights of the Airbus A380, over two-thirds of the total flights the aircraft took in that year. Many of those flights were going in or out of Dubai, the airline's hub, so you can consider that the most likely place to find this aircraft.

Emirates outfits is Airbus A380s with private first-class cabins and shower spas, giving a luxury twist to a vehicle originally made for hub-to-hub commuter flights. But the airline also says it's trying to become better for the environment. Airbus says the massive airplane performed a successful test flight in March 2022 using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel that was primarily made of used cooking oil.

""Compared with conventional jet fuel,"" says the U.S. Department of Energy, ""100% SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway."" Airbus said in 2022 that all of its planes were certified to use a mixture of half sustainable fuel and half kerosene, with a goal of certifying them for 100% sustainable fuel by 2030.

Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

We have since we started in October last year looked at:

Alternative, lower emission, propulsion technologies, ranging from electric aircraft with batteries as energy source, different propulsion hybrids and new concepts for Jet-fuel and hydrogen gas turbine engines.

We have also reviewed recent research on the role of CO2, NOx emissions, and Contrails generated by airliners.

Last week, we summarized the present situation around SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Before we proceed, we shall examine some facts about the scale of the emission/global warming influences from Air Transport.

Some data around Air Transport

When discussing the influence global Air Transport has on our climate and specifically the problem of global warming, and the actions we spend money on to mitigate these effects, it can be helpful to know some data around the issue:

We presently have around 25,000 airliners that fly routes around the globe every day (Figure 1). The aircraft flies from one to two missions per day, typical for a dedicated Cargo aircraft, to the usual two missions per day for a long-haul widebody (one long and one short filler mission). The single-aisle airliner, which is usually used for domestic flights, flies around six to eight missions per day, with the regional airliners completing around the same number of sectors daily.

The global Air Transport fleet consumes about 300 million tonnes of Jet-A1 fuel when flying these routes. As there is a mathematical direct relation between consumed fuel in a gas turbine engine and the generated CO2 (each kg of Jet fuel generates 3.16kg of CO2), we have a yearly emission from Air Transport of 950 million tonnes of CO2.

On average, each active airliner consumes 12 tonnes of Jet fuel and generates 38 tonnes of CO2 annually.

The amount of Jet fuel consumed per passenger mile varies depending on the aircraft type that flies the route. For the present generation of aircraft, midsized and large aircraft are about twice as efficient per transported passenger as a 19-seat commuter aircraft.

For a 30 to 50-seat aircraft, we have an efficiency which is about 160% to 180% lower per transported passenger mile than the latest generation single-aisle aircraft like the Airbus A321neo or the forthcoming Boeing 737 MAX 10.

Once we reach the 70 to 80 seat turboprops, we talk about a 125% difference in efficiency per passenger mile, which is also valid for the 100 to 130 seat regional aircraft.

What does this all mean for reaching our emission goals

We shall use these numbers in the next Corners to put the investments and actions done so far to lower Air Transport Emissions into a more global and longer-term perspective.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-05-02 04:56:14.506945

Geneva, 2 May 2025: Wizz Air Holdings Plc (""Wizz Air""), one of the most sustainable European airlines, announces passenger and CO2 emission statistics for April 2025.

Wizz Air carried 5.4 million passengers during the month of April, a 10.8% increase year on year. Seat capacity increased 11.4% YoY, resulting in a load factor of 89.8%, down 0.5ppt on last year's load factor of 90.3%.

During the month:

· With Easter falling entirely in April this year, our new fiscal year started strongly, with a seasonal increase in passenger numbers in the month, as anticipated. We expect this seasonal effect to normalise in the months ahead, consistent with historical trends. While overall demand was strong, load factor was modestly lower due to one-directional VFR traffic patterns during the Easter holiday period.

· The airline group launched its carbon roadmap. 'Flying Towards Net Zero'. This focuses on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a critical decarbonization lever. This could deliver a further 25% reduction in emissions by 2030.

· Wizz Air continues to be one of the lowest emission airlines, reporting a further decline in CO2 emissions per RPK in April, down 2.5% YoY, to 51.3 grams.

The fuel was delivered to the Katowice International Airport in Pyrzowice, which is an important step towards decarbonization of air transport in Poland. It is also a clear indication of the company’s readiness to provide comprehensive services in the new regulatory environment, which from 2025 requires the use of SAF at the level of least 2% of the total weight of aviation fuel at airports meeting the definition of EU airport.

SAF is an alternative to traditional fossil fuels. It is produced from vegetable oils, animal fats and agricultural waste, among others. The product can contribute about 65% of the emissions reductions needed for the aviation sector to reach net zero emissions by 2050*. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 October 2023, as at 1 January 2025, all EU airports handling more than 800,000 passengers per year (or 100,000 tons of cargo) are required to use SAF at a rate of no less than 2% of the total weight of aviation fuel. Given these criteria, eight airports in Poland will be subject to this obligation.

Adam Sikorski, CEO of Unimot S.A, says:

At Unimot Aviation, we have strong logistics facilities that allow us to operate quickly and efficiently

We want to be not just a supplier, but a comprehensive partner for airlines and airports in Poland – supporting them in adapting to new regulations and building a more sustainable future for aviation. In the context of global efforts to reduce emissions, alternative fuels such as SAF will only grow in importance,

The delivery to the Katowice Airport culminated with UNIMOT Aviation Services refueling an Airbus A320 aircraft for the 23 April 2025 flight to Marsa Alam (RMF), Egypt. It was the first refueling of a cruise plane with SAF in Poland.

The plan, House Bills 4424-4425 and Senate Bills 235-236, would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be purchased and used for flights departing Michigan.
The SAF is then blended with regular aviation fuel to help reduce the amount of carbon that’s emitted into the atmosphere.
This bipartisan plan is a practical solution that will reduce emissions, promote economic growth, and take care of our farmers.
“I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.","State Rep. Jerry Neyer and State Sens. Sam Singh and Joseph Bellino on Thursday announced their plan to jumpstart the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan. The plan, House Bills 4424-4425 and Senate Bills 235-236, would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be purchased and used for flights departing Michigan.

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. It’s produced using bio-renewable products like ethanol or diesel which are manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn. The SAF is then blended with regular aviation fuel to help reduce the amount of carbon that’s emitted into the atmosphere.

“Whether we like it or not, things are changing in Michigan,” said Neyer, R-Shepherd. “New clean energy standards are quickly approaching, and pending policy changes from the feds have left corn and soybean farmers with a ‘let’s wait and see’ mentality. And who can blame them? The demand for their products could change with one press conference. This bipartisan plan is a practical solution that will reduce emissions, promote economic growth, and take care of our farmers. By incentivizing the private sector to produce and blend SAF here in Michigan, we can encourage cleaner skies and boost the agriculture industry at the same time.”

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realize the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” said Singh, D-East Lansing. “Decarbonizing the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

The legislation would provide a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce, or blend sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is designed to directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning, ethanol-derived aviation fuels. If greater emissions reductions are reached, additional incentives are available. There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in first year, and $9 million annually thereafter for the next nine years.

“Access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” said Bellino, R-Monroe. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state. It is a proactive solution that supports our local farmers, boosts our agriculture industry, and better ensures stable fuel costs — all while also helping cut harmful emissions.”

Created by TheBusinessDesk.com in partnership with Clarion, Deloitte and the Swinton Estate, the awards are in their second year and recognise businesses that are making permanent and positive changes to society and the environment.

Jet2 was recognised for taking significant steps to build a sustainable future, implementing clear strategies and achieving notable milestones.

The company’s updated Sustainability Strategy outlines these targets and objectives across three pillars: In the Air; On the Ground and In Resort, along with an enhanced focus on supply chain Scope 3 emissions.

The award recognises this work, which includes:

A new climate transition plan, focused on existing technologies and tangible actions that can be taken currently. This will see Jet2.com reduce its carbon emissions per revenue paying passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK) by 35% in 2035 compared to 2019 (43.55gCO2/RPK in 2035 vs. 67gCO2/RPK in 2019).

Investing billions into decarbonising its fleet, with a firm order for 146 brand-new Airbus A321 neo aircraft. These aircraft reduce CO2 emissions per passenger by up to 20% and are 50% quieter than the aircraft they are replacing.

Reducing single-use plastics on flights by switching to biodegradable and recyclable alternatives. This initiative alone has substituted 22 million items of single-use plastic from the company’s supply chain each year.

Using new technologies to provide real-time operational data and analysis that drives fuel savings. Jet2 has installed split-scimitar winglets onto 60 of its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, reducing fuel burn through improved aerodynamic efficiency.

Incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its operations, including using SAF at London Stansted, Bristol and Malaga airports before the introduction of the UK and EU SAF mandates came into effect in January 2025.

Electrification of Jet2.com owned ground service equipment, with more than 50% of Jet2.com ground service equipment now fully electric.

Launching and expanding Jet2holidays’ Certified Sustainable Hotels collection, giving customers the option to choose accommodation that meets a sustainability certification – with over 1,200 hotels now in the collection.

Jet2.com has already been recognised as an industry leader in reducing carbon intensity emissions, achieving a platinum rating for airline sustainability in the CAPA 2023 sustainability benchmark report*. This means Jet2.com is among the top ten airlines globally for sustainability performance and ranked 4th out of 100 in carbon emitted per revenue passenger kilometer (gCO2/RPK).

In addition, Jet2 has also created a social value framework within its Sustainability Strategy which is aimed at supporting colleagues and the communities where Jet2 operates. This addresses eight areas of focus, four which are within Jet2 (training and development, well-being, inclusion and access, health and safety) and four which are outside the company (jobs and skills, communities, partnerships and ethics, risk and safety).

Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays said: “I am very proud of what we have achieved since launching our first sustainability strategy in 2021 and this award reflects the investment and hard work that has gone into that. We are basing our strategy on technologies and tangible actions that we know are available to us now, rather than what may or may not be available in the future, however we continually monitor to see where we can embrace new technologies. Our tangible steps include investing in new and more fuel-efficient aircraft, using SAF, launching a Certified Sustainable Hotels collection, removing millions of single use plastics from onboard our aircraft, and utilising technologies such as split-scimitar winglets. Our strategy clearly sets out our vision to accelerate our sustainability journey whilst supporting our colleagues and the communities where we operate, and we will continue to make this a critical area of focus.”",https://www.jet2.com/assets/img/favicons/favicon-32x32.png?etag=YsKwERf1ATeyItxXx7wBOQ==,N,,2025-05-02 07:56:30.831539

Additional information is available on the North Dakota legislature website.","North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on April 15 signed a bill creating a low-carbon fuels fund that is designed to help the state’s ethanol producers lower the carbon intensity (CI) of the fuel they produce, increase local demand for corn, and help producers capitalize on the opportunity of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The legislation, SB 2333, was introduced by North Dakota Sen. Terry Wanzek on Jan. 20. The North Dakota Senate on Feb. 14 voted 42 to 2 to approve the bill. The state’s House voted 65 to 25 in favor of the legislation on April 4. Armstrong signed the bill into law on April 17.

The new low-carbon fuels fund replaces North Dakota’s current ethanol production incentive, which was a program designed to provide aid to the state’s ethanol producers during adverse times when ethanol prices were unusually low and/or corn prices were unusually high.

According to statements made by Wanzek during a congressional hearing held earlier this year, the state’s ethanol plants have all grandfathered out of the program are no longer eligible to receive funds. Yet, the production incentive has a continuing appropriation of 40% of all sums collected for the registration of farm vehicles, he said. As of late January, the balance of the program was approximately $6 million.

SB 2333 reallocates that funding to a new low carbon fuels fund that will distribute incentives to ethanol facilities for eligible projects to increase efficiency and decrease the CI of their production processes. Eligible projects under the program would include the construction of new infrastructure or replacement of existing infrastructure for CO2 capture and storage, beneficial use of CO2, energy efficiency enhancements, or ethanol yield improvements.

Distributions made under the newly created program are limited to 50% of the cost of eligible capital projects and may not exceed $3 million per biennium. In addition, cumulative distributions per facility are limited to $10 million over a 10 year period, beginning with the first distribution to the facility.

The state agency tasked with implementing the program may use up to $1 million from the fund to contract with an entity to develop a CI verification progress.

Additional information is available on the North Dakota legislature website.

‍ 2024 Production and Market Dynamics The 2024 production figures further underscore the urgency.
Less than 30% of planned SAF production projects have secured financing, indicating a major bottleneck in scaling the industry.
Regulators fear that ""book and claim"" might concentrate SAF production at a few sites, undermining broader market development.","As part of its broader renewable energy transition, Europe has set ambitious goals for the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, leading European airlines are now sounding the alarm: without significant increases in production, these targets may become unattainable by 2030.

‍

Current Status of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production

Three months after the European ""RefuelEU"" regulation came into force — requiring airlines to use 2% SAF from 2024, scaling up to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050 — the aviation sector remains concerned. Despite a doubling of global SAF production between 2023 and 2024, sustainable fuels still account for only 0.5% of total jet fuel consumption. Moreover, SAF remains two to three times more expensive than conventional kerosene, and supply levels fall far short of demand.

‍

A Troubling Outlook for 2030

According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, Europe could face a 30% shortfall in SAF supply needed to meet the 6% mandate by 2030. In addition, synthetic SAF (e-SAF) production is projected to miss its target by 45%.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has openly stated that it is now evident the SAF supply will not meet the 6% goal by 2030. Without immediate measures to boost production, he and other industry leaders argue that the timeline should be revised.

‍

2024 Production and Market Dynamics

The 2024 production figures further underscore the urgency. Instead of the anticipated 1.5 million tonnes, global SAF production barely exceeded 1 million tonnes. Moreover, purchase commitments for SAF dropped by 74% in volume last year, leading to a 45% decrease in SAF prices — yet this did not stimulate higher sales.

Neste, Europe's largest SAF producer, faced stockpiling issues and had to delay commissioning a new facility in Rotterdam. Meanwhile, 29% of airlines have taken no action toward their 2030 SAF goals, largely awaiting a potential price drop.

Investment in new production facilities remains sluggish. Less than 30% of planned SAF production projects have secured financing, indicating a major bottleneck in scaling the industry.

‍

Proposed Solutions: Virtual Fuel Certification

Airbus and other stakeholders are advocating for a ""book and claim"" system. This mechanism would allow airlines to purchase SAF certificates even if the actual fuel is consumed elsewhere. This would help carriers meet their regulatory requirements even at airports without SAF availability.

While the aviation sector broadly supports this idea, the European Commission has expressed concerns. Regulators fear that ""book and claim"" might concentrate SAF production at a few sites, undermining broader market development.

‍

Conclusion

Without rapid intervention to scale up SAF production and streamline regulatory frameworks, Europe's aviation sector risks missing crucial decarbonization milestones. Stakeholders urge policymakers to act swiftly, ensuring that the clean energy future for aviation remains within reach.

Bulk corn accounted for 80% of exports in 1990 but only 60% in 2024, as value-added products exports grew.","The usual suspects are all here, and the pressure's building.

Mother Nature's at the bar ordering up a round of something, leaving us all wondering if this is going to be a two-drink happy hour or three-day bender.

Geopolitics recently added steroids to its workout regime. It's all jacked up and picking fights, collateral damage and consequences be damned.

The market is thriving on the drama, working the room, taking bets and counting the dollars that slip into his pocket.

If this were a movie, I'd say settle in and get some popcorn. This is going to be good.

But it's not. Farming is your livelihood, and if I were to ask, you'd probably say it's an important part of your legacy, too. It's a lot harder to revel in the drama when you're entangled in it, when your success or failure is on the line.

""You have to give it your best effort and hope that things shake out better down the road,"" said South Dakota farmer Tregg Cronin. He thinks most farmers believe trade policies need to be reformed even if it comes with some hardship. ""I think the universal thing is: Guys do not want a repeat of 2018-2019.""

Soybeans bore the brunt of President Donald Trump's first trade war with China, which resulted in $27 billion of lost agricultural exports and left farms reliant on ad hoc Market Facilitation Program payments to pay the bills.

A study by the American Soybean Association and National Corn Growers Association states a new trade war could cost corn and soybean farmers $5 to $8 billion in lost production value each year. Higher corn and soybean prices in Brazil and Argentina will fuel further acreage expansion, and their trade ties with China strengthen.

The study can't ""account for the permanent implications from the loss of the United States' reputation with trading partners, as evident in the fact that U.S. agriculture today is still rebuilding from the 2018 trade war. ... The impact on U.S. soybean and corn farmers isn't limited to a short-term price shock: This is a long-lasting ramification that changes the global supply structure.""

This is happening alongside another long-term change with implications for U.S. ag: declining global population, especially in our most established markets, Terrain Senior Rural Economy Analyst Matt Clark argued.

""The idea of producing as much as possible and exporting the excess will likely not be a financially sound business plan in 20-plus years,"" he said, pointing to the corn market's success as a blueprint for other commodities. The development of ethanol not only created new value-added industry but also reshaped the export market. Bulk corn accounted for 80% of exports in 1990 but only 60% in 2024, as value-added products exports grew.

Clark said the U.S. ""should continue to strategically develop new export markets to enable some long-term viability while recognizing the strong need to develop value-added products for both domestic and export markets.""

A worthwhile goal, present challenges notwithstanding. The Trump tariffs could accelerate this process if it helps establish new trading relationships rather than hinder them. Policy support for the development and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel would move the needle. But, as with everything the administration does, we'll have to wait and see what actually happens, not just which way the wind is blowing.

Unlike rankings that rely on ambitious pledges or aspirational goals, 42kft.com’s methodology stands apart by emphasizing tangible achievements in environmental impact. While commitments like “Net Zero by 2050” are important, they serve as baseline expectations rather than distinctive factors in this ranking. Instead, the platform focuses on airlines that demonstrate actual progress in areas such as fleet modernization, sustainable technology adoption, and active environmental programs.

The airline rankings take several crucial factors into account, reflecting how far each airline has come in their environmental efforts. These include:

Fleet Age: A critical ranking factor, as newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft tend to have a significantly lower carbon footprint. However, global aircraft delivery delays, largely due to post-COVID supply chain issues and regulatory hold-ups, have impacted airlines’ ability to modernize their fleets at the pace they desire.

Fleet Renewal and Firm Orders: Airlines with strong commitments to renewing their fleets with more efficient aircraft are prioritized. The commitment to sustainability becomes evident through substantial orders for eco-friendly planes that promise to reduce emissions and enhance operational efficiency.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): Airlines are rated based on their investment in SAF, an alternative fuel source that reduces the aviation industry’s carbon emissions significantly compared to traditional jet fuel. The adoption and use of SAF is a key milestone for airlines aiming to reduce their environmental footprint.

Recycling and Waste Reduction Initiatives: Airlines demonstrating leadership in waste management, recycling efforts, and reducing waste sent to landfills are also given high marks. This reflects a holistic approach to sustainability beyond just fuel consumption.

Technological Innovations: The implementation of cutting-edge technologies aimed at improving fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and enhancing overall sustainability practices are taken into account. This includes aircraft innovations, advanced ground operations technology, and initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of airport infrastructure.

Verified Carbon Offset Programs: Airlines that have adopted verifiable carbon offset programs—programs that offset their emissions through environmental projects—are recognized for their commitment to mitigating their carbon footprint.

Annual Environmental Impact Reporting: Transparency is critical in the environmental space. Airlines that produce regular, comprehensive reports on their environmental impact are considered more credible and are rewarded for providing clear insights into their sustainability strategies.

IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) Compliance: Compliance with the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) environmental standards further strengthens an airline’s sustainability credentials. IEnvA certification reflects a commitment to global environmental best practices.

Investment in Electric and Hybrid Aircraft Technologies: As the aviation industry looks to the future, investment in electric and hybrid aircraft technologies is seen as a key element in reducing emissions. Airlines that actively invest in these emerging technologies are leading the way towards a more sustainable aviation sector.

This study examines how the commercialization of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can be optimized in the business travel sector, where aviation-related emissions remain high and corporate sustainability goals increasingly demand action. Using an adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) experiment with sustainability managers from European firms, we analyze how companies evaluate SAF offerings based on fuel type, blend level, certification, billing structure, and cost. Our results reveal a strong preference for certified SAF and bulk procurement models in short-haul travel, where willingness to pay often exceeds benchmark prices. For long-haul travel, however, cost remains a significant barrier, with low SAF content frequently rejected in favor of conventional options. The study highlights how procurement structures, budget constraints, and internal decision-making shape SAF adoption, offering practical insights for corporate travel managers, airlines, and SAF suppliers. From a policy perspective, our findings underscore the need for regulatory support to accelerate SAF demand. Standardized reporting frameworks, recognition of SAF in emission accounting, and pricing incentives can help reduce entry barriers and align procurement with climate targets. By focusing on the demand side—an underexplored area in SAF research—this paper contributes empirical evidence to inform policy design, promote private-sector engagement, and support the scaling of low-carbon aviation solutions.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-05-01 17:56:12.866665

Why is 2025 a banner year so far? Usually you hear economic development is a marathon. And that is often the case for a particular project. However, on the whole, 2025 has been running wind sprints. Working with the State of Iowa and Quad Cities Chamber of Commerce, Grow Clinton has answered a breathtaking number of requests for information all the while seeing existing projects take shape.

Atlas Roofing Corporation finally feels real for the general public, as they can see the progress of the vertical infrastructure. Countless local contractors have been building up the vertical infrastructure, while the internal plant operations are mobilizing. Atlas has rented the former chamber of commerce office to serve as, among other things, home to human resources.

Around Atlas, the Lincolnway Industrial Rail & Airpark continues to evolve and develop. Project MG no longer needs a code name. Hobo Renewable Energy is looking at 121 acres to create their sustainable aviation fuel factory. A local transload facility, Super 8 Logistics, has purchased acreage in the Railpark and plans to construct a 100,000-square-foot warehouse in 2025. They have growth plans as well to take advantage of the rail. We are looking at heavy rail and truck traffic developing over the next five years. This is already attracting additional entrepreneurial ventures.

Speaking of rail, the City of Clinton has sent out a RFP for a switchyard company to run railcars in the park. Outside of available 130 acres in the southeast corner, the Railpark needed to expand, and working with our partner Iowa Land & Building, we have been adding additional certified acres and optioned land to the footprint.

We need these additional acres because we continue to field a record number of proposals. Every week, we are working with our regional partners, utility partners, and the City of Clinton to build in Clinton. These have resulted in multiple site visits.

Around the park we are also working on multiple development projects like Project Saturday River and another project. Both of these projects have optioned land. We use codenames because we are under a nondisclosure.

Then in our Business & Technology Park, Adcraft’s vertical infrastructure shell is erected. From Mill Creek Parkway, you can see the last touches to Nestle’s Automated Storage Retrieval System.

Located adjacent to existing solar panels just off of the airport’s exit from I-376, the expansion of the solar field, which will add 11,216 high-efficiency solar panels to the existing solar field, is part of the airport’s energy innovation plans to help make clean energy more accessible for the Pittsburgh region.
“The expansion of more than 11,000 solar panels to Pittsburgh International Airport’s existing solar field is a fantastic step toward a more sustainable energy future for our region,” said Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato.
The new solar project also will complement the airport’s existing eight-acre solar array by adding an additional 12 acres atop a closed landfill — land that it says would otherwise not be suitable for development.
“Pittsburgh International Airport is an energy leader, and we are thrilled to partner with Duquesne Light Company and IMG for this important regional project,” said Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis.","A solar field in the Steel City is being expanded at Pittsburgh International Airport, which is partnering with locally based Duquesne Light Company (DLC) and IMG Energy Solutions to bolster local energy production and economic development.

The expansion will enable the generation of an additional 4.7 megawatts (MW) of clean energy, reducing carbon emissions by approximately five million pounds per year, according to the airport, which will supply the electricity generated from the new solar to the regional electric grid.

Expected to be completed in 2027, the solar expansion is the latest energy initiative at the airport, which is maximizing the use of its property, where it also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel on-site.

The new solar project also will complement the airport’s existing eight-acre solar array by adding an additional 12 acres atop a closed landfill — land that it says would otherwise not be suitable for development.

“Pittsburgh International Airport is an energy leader, and we are thrilled to partner with Duquesne Light Company and IMG for this important regional project,” said Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis. “We are maximizing the use of airport assets for the betterment of the region — from air service to real estate development to energy innovation and there’s more to come.”

The original eight acres contain nearly 10,000 solar panels as part of the airport’s 23-MW microgrid project, launched in 2021 as the first to completely power an airport through natural gas and solar energy, Cassotis said.

“DLC is thrilled to be part of this groundbreaking project that highlights the vision of Pittsburgh International Airport, as well as the strength of public-private partnerships in delivering meaningful progress for the Pittsburgh region,” added Kevin Walker, president and CEO of DLC. “By expanding access to clean energy for local homes and businesses, we’re helping to drive economic growth and bringing to life our vision of a more sustainable future for all.”

The expanded solar field will be owned and operated by IMG, with a commitment to supply 100 percent of its generated energy, along with the Renewable Energy Credits, to DLC.

The agreement ensures that DLC can utilize the clean energy to support the electricity needs of its default service customers who do not actively select an electricity supplier outside of DLC.

“IMG is excited to build on the success of the Pittsburgh International Airport microgrid, which combines high-efficiency thermal generation with a utility-scale solar array, by more than doubling our existing solar energy production,” said Mike Brady, vice president of power generation execution at IMG’s parent company, Liberty Energy Inc. “We look forward to expanding our energy portfolio and leveraging the region’s abundant gas supply for resilient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly microgrids.”",https://pennbizreport.com/favico.ico?v=1746125790,N,,2025-05-01 14:56:32.556764

The result was severely impacted by $2.3bn in charges relating to three project cancellations: the World Energy Sustainable Aviation Fuel expansion project in Paramount, California; a green liquid hydrogen project in Massena, New York; and a carbon monoxide project in Texas.

And more tough decisions appear to lie in store for the industrial gas major.

One presentation slide highlighted $5bn-worth of “underperforming projects” comprising two blue hydrogen projects, in Edmonton and Rotterdam (combined capital expenditure exceeding $4bn), a green hydrogen project in Arizona ($360m), and other energy transition projects ($540m).

In another major development, the flagship joint venture Saudi project NEOM is now to focus on green ammonia project until regulations develop for green hydrogen around 2030.

Similarly, European downstream investments are to be delayed until regulatory frameworks are clarified and Air Products will continue to invest around $1.5bn per year in ‘lower risk projects’ with secure offtakes. At Darrow, Louisiana, it will pursue a carbon capture and sequestration and ammonia ‘derisking’ strategy.

Around 10% of the company’s staff has been cut since 2023, as part of the ongoing restructuring. This could yield up to $100m in savings on the full-year profit-and-loss account for 2025, said CFO Melissa Schaeffer. Approximately 2,500 staff will go in the next two to three years, with the long term objective of settling the company headcount at around 18,500 employees.

In terms of regional breakdowns, America sales rose 3% in the quarter to $1.3bn with operating income down 2% to $366m, Asia sales fell 1% to $774m with operating income falling 6% to $191m, and Europe dropped 9% to $727m. Middle East and India equity affiliates’ income rose 6% to $78m.

Corporate and other sales of $95m decreased 53% and operating loss of $118m increased 35% compared with the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of the LNG business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 to Honeywell.

Second quarter sales of $2.9bn were flat as 4% higher energy cost pass-through and 1% higher pricing were offset by 3% lower volumes, primarily due to the LNG divestiture, and 2% unfavourable currency. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2bn was down 3%.

Menezes said, “We don’t expect a lot of help from the economy in the next two quarters. The tariff issue is a bit complicated – we don’t have a lot of [cross-border] trade. The main issue here is on the capital side.

And U.S. tariffs on imported solar cells and lithium-ion batteries date back as far as the Obama administration.
So are energy supply chain experts.
“[T]he tariffs could lead to significant cost increases in the power industry supply chain.
Although suppliers don’t have to pay tariffs on the products they make in the U.S., higher demand is combining with still-limited U.S. supplies to push prices higher across the board, Pochtaruk said.","Minnesotans are already seeing higher prices on electronics, groceries and a host of other product categories due to the Trump administration’s sweeping import tariffs. Industry experts say electricity prices could follow.

“We believe that this is going to raise costs for all electricity consumers,” said Michael Allen, co-founder and CEO of St. Paul-based All Energy Solar, which installs solar, battery and EV charging systems for residential and commercial customers.

On April 2, President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods imported from nearly every country, including manufacturing powerhouses China, Vietnam and Mexico, with exemptions for hundreds of raw materials, manufacturing inputs and finished goods.

About a week later, following a stock market crash and blowback from the international business community, he dialed back duties on most countries to 10% while preserving the option to increase them again in 90 days and boosting tariffs above 100% on a range of goods produced in China.

Trump’s broad tariffs added to preexisting duties on key materials and finished products used across the energy sector. In February, for example, Trump set a 25% levy on imported steel and aluminum in an executive order that name-checked Minnesota’s iron ore industry. A similar tariff on copper — a critical input for electrical equipment — could follow soon. And U.S. tariffs on imported solar cells and lithium-ion batteries date back as far as the Obama administration.

“This is not the first road show we’ve seen come to town,” Allen said. What’s different about this go-round, he said, is the deep uncertainty of an on-again, off-again tariff framework where levies seem to change by the day.

“I have no idea what’s going to happen, and no one else does either. We’re all in limbo right now,” Allen said, adding that pricing throughout the supply chain is much more volatile than usual.

Higher electricity bills ahead?

It’s not just local executives like Allen warning about a possible increase in energy costs — and business uncertainty — induced by the administration’s unpredictable trade policy. So are energy supply chain experts.

“[T]he tariffs could lead to significant cost increases in the power industry supply chain. Uncertainty over tariff liabilities in complex supply chains, and over possible future changes in tariff rates, can also be a deterrent to investment,” wrote Ed Crooks, vice chair of Americas for global consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which focuses on the energy industry, in an April 8 note that called the U.S. power industry “one of the sectors that is most exposed to tariff impacts.”

The average final tariff on electrical equipment is now 38%, Crooks said. And suppliers face similar rates on other key power inputs, like the glass used in solar panels and steel used in piping.

Solar panel installers and other energy equipment buyers in Minnesota and across the United States are actively seeking U.S.-made alternatives to imported products, said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of solar equipment manufacturer Heliene. Canada-based Heliene has two solar module factories in Minnesota and is considering opening a third production facility here.

Although suppliers don’t have to pay tariffs on the products they make in the U.S., higher demand is combining with still-limited U.S. supplies to push prices higher across the board, Pochtaruk said.

“The price is going up whether the product is imported or local, due to the higher demand for local,” he said.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission sets rates charged by public electric and natural gas utilities like Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy. A utility can ask for permission to raise rates in a process known as a rate case, which the PUC says involves “a comprehensive review of [its] investments and expenses” to determine whether the proposed increase is “necessary and reasonable.”

As a rate case proceeds, the utility can bill customers at a higher interim rate, subject to a refund of the difference if the case resolves at a rate lower than requested.

Minnesota law allows utilities to charge rates to recover costs needed “to provide adequate, efficient, and reasonable service to ratepayers, including an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return” on investment, the PUC says.

Utility rates apply not only to residential consumers but also to commercial and industrial consumers that may consume many times more power than a typical household. So if U.S. trade policy chills investment in energy-intensive industries, such as data centers, utilities may have fewer new customers to support planned or already-underway investments in new and existing infrastructure, said Brian Ross, vice president of renewable energy at the Great Plains Institute, a Minneapolis nonprofit focused on decarbonizing power, industry and transportation.

In an April earnings call, an executive with California utility PG&E said the company could actually reduce customer rates amid an influx of data center proposals, making explicit the connection between data center development and residential customers’ bills.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and a lesser-known Colorado developer have announced plans to build massive data centers in the Twin Cities’ exurbs, each expected to eventually consume enough power for tens or hundreds of thousands of homes.

That said, utility planning is a slow process, so Minnesota customers won’t see immediate bill impacts due to data center demand or lack thereof, Ross said.

Tariffs could also raise prices — and the risk of shortages — by worsening preexisting supply constraints for transformers, gas turbines and other critical electrical equipment, Ross said. The average wait time for a new transformer increased from about one year in 2021 to more than two years in 2024, and orders for some larger transformers now take as long as four years to fill, Wood Mackenzie said last year.

Higher equipment prices and longer lead times will make it more difficult and expensive to build new power generation to serve growing demand for electricity from transportation, buildings and the new industrial facilities the Trump administration wants to attract to the U.S., All Energy Solar’s Allen said. If you’re a homeowner or business who believes energy will become more expensive amid future scarcity, it could make sense to lock in relatively low costs — and reduce reliance on the electric grid — by installing solar panels and perhaps batteries for onsite energy storage now, before the tariff impacts fully hit, he added.

“Our customers who already have solar are telling us, ‘Whew, I’m really glad I made this decision,’” Allen said.

The upshot for made-in-Minnesota energy

With the administration unlikely to rethink its protectionist stance anytime soon, businesses across the energy supply chain may try to locate more production in the United States, especially if Congress preserves the clean energy manufacturing tax credits enacted during the Biden administration, Pochtaruk said.

But for more complicated factories, that could take years. Pochtaruk contrasted the eight-to-nine-month build time for a new solar module plant like the ones Heliene runs in Rogers and Mountain Iron with the roughly two-year development window for a new solar cell factory, which he said involves a “wet chemical process” in a super-clean manufacturing environment.

In December, Heliene paused plans to build what would be one of the United States’ only solar cell plants, citing uncertainty around federal tax credits for clean energy manufacturing. The company has done a significant amount of early work on the project and could get the new facility up and running 18 months after deciding to move forward, Pochtaruk said.

Heliene is weighing two possible locations for the cell factory, one in North Carolina and the other in the Twin Cities metro. Heliene today employs about 340 people in Mountain Iron and about 220 in Rogers, he said.

Even for seemingly basic components like solar cells, tariffs play havoc with complex global supply chains. Though solar cell manufacturing involves a mix of imported and U.S.-made inputs, most are more expensive now in part because even domestic inputs may themselves require imported precursors, Pochtaruk said.

Likewise, All Energy Solar sources solar panel racks, power inverters and other types of equipment from U.S. manufacturers, but the complexities of global supply chains for energy equipment mean it’s unlikely that the local industry will ever be able to source everything it needs within the United States, let alone Minnesota, Allen said. Even if trade barriers persist, it may cost less to make some low-margin inputs in lower-cost southeast Asian countries that already make them cheaply, he said.

While Minnesota’s energy industry faces the same tariff-related uncertainty as other states for the moment, the state could protect itself in the longer run by leaning into emerging energy sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, produced from crops and other biomass, Ross said.

Minnesota lawmakers and business boosters seem to agree. A SAF producers’ and buyers’ consortium convened by the GREATER MSP Partnership in 2023 now includes heavyweights like Delta Air Lines and Airbus, and state lawmakers authorized a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for Minnesota-made sustainable jet fuel last year. A few months later, DG Fuels announced plans to produce more than 190 million gallons of SAF annually in Moorhead by 2030.",https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rogers-03.11.2025-5-copy-1.png,N,,2025-05-01 17:56:17.114981

Air New Zealand has launched its first 2030 Emissions Guidance in a significant move to replace its previous science-based target and adopt a more transparent, adaptable, and data-driven approach toward achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This strategic update outlines the airline’s plan to reduce net “well-to-wake” greenhouse gas emissions from jet fuel by 20 to 25 percent by 2030 using 2019 as the baseline. The 2030 Emissions Guidance marks a transition away from static targets to an annually updated model, which the airline says will reflect evolving technologies, regulatory changes, and external risks.

The new guidance will be updated every August through Air New Zealand’s Climate Statement and provides investors, customers, and regulators with a clearer, real-time outlook on the airline’s decarbonisation pathway. Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer Kiri Hannifin stated that the airline remains fully committed to its 2050 net zero target, but emphasized the need for regular updates to reflect shifting realities in the aviation landscape. Rather than relying on outdated or overly rigid projections, Air New Zealand’s new approach embraces flexibility and accuracy in a market where sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) availability and pricing remain uncertain.

The 2030 Emissions Guidance has been developed through detailed modelling and analysis of the airline’s operational capabilities, market factors, and environmental policy trends. The framework is built around five core decarbonisation pillars. First, the increased use of SAF as global mandates and supply chains mature. Second, ongoing fleet renewal and network optimisation, aimed at reducing emissions per passenger kilometre. Third, operational efficiency improvements through advanced flight planning and fuel-saving technology. Fourth, the strategic use of carbon credits to comply with international schemes like CORSIA. And fifth, a realistic acknowledgment that next-generation aircraft will not contribute significantly to emissions reduction by 2030.

Air New Zealand has withdrawn from its former science-based target set in alignment with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement pathway, citing technological and structural uncertainties. In its place, the emissions guidance offers a more accurate picture of what the airline can achieve in the short term while remaining adaptable to change. According to Hannifin, “Rather than setting an emissions target that remains static, regular emissions guidance will give our investors and customers an up-to-date and clear view of our expected emissions trajectory, including the impact from external risks and opportunities.” She added that the airline is hopeful that new technologies and a maturing SAF market could accelerate progress, potentially improving the emissions outlook in future updates.

The guidance is fully integrated with Air New Zealand’s long-term fleet and network planning through to 2030, ensuring operational alignment across all departments. It also accommodates international regulatory frameworks such as CORSIA while preserving the option for voluntary carbon removal when appropriate. This ensures the airline is prepared for evolving domestic and global emissions regulations.

From a broader perspective, Air New Zealand’s shift could set a new industry standard in the Asia-Pacific region, where many carriers still rely on long-range aspirational goals without measurable short-term benchmarks. By pivoting to a dynamic, annually refreshed emissions forecast, the airline is responding to growing calls for transparency and accountability in corporate climate strategies. The aviation industry faces mounting pressure to decarbonise, but faces unique challenges including long fleet life cycles, heavy reliance on fossil fuels, and delayed rollout of zero-emissions aircraft.

Air New Zealand’s new 2030 emissions model reflects this complexity and underscores the airline’s role as a climate leader in the region. By publicly acknowledging the uncertainties inherent in decarbonising aviation, the airline is not backing away from climate leadership but redefining it around transparency, flexibility, and technological realism. This approach is expected to build greater trust among stakeholders and support more informed decision-making at both the investor and consumer levels.

Looking ahead, the airline has positioned its annual August update as a cornerstone of its Climate Statement, where each year’s Emissions Guidance will reflect the latest modelling inputs and market realities. With no immediate contribution expected from next-generation aircraft before 2030, the airline’s focus remains grounded in what can be operationally achieved with current technologies and emerging SAF infrastructure.

State leaders and ag organizations are encouraging Nebraskans to fill up with clean, cost-saving biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel that benefit both the economy and the environment.

Ethanol, Nebraska’s third-largest ag commodity, saved state drivers an estimated $375 million in 2024 when using blends of E10 and higher. Compared to regular gasoline, ethanol reduces emissions by up to 43%—making it a cleaner, more affordable option at the pump.

Governor Jim Pillen will join in on the festivities by officially declaring May as Renewable Fuels Month on May 6.

“Nebraskans are beginning to drive and take advantage of biofuel benefits more this month as the weather warms up for sports, vacations and holiday events,” said Brandon Hunnicutt, chairman of the Nebraska Corn Board. “By choosing a renewable fuel such as ethanol, drivers can support local agriculture, reduce their carbon footprint and save money on fuel costs.”

Most vehicles 2001 or newer can safely run on E15, while flex fuel vehicles can use up to E85 for even more savings. As the nation’s second-largest ethanol producer, Nebraska is also looking to the future.

When it comes to cutting carbon from heavy industries and aviation, there’s no time to waste—and Hy2gen AG just got a serious shot in the arm to keep that momentum going.

The Germany-based company, which focuses on renewable hydrogen production and fuels like clean ammonia and e-fuels (also called RFNBOs), has secured a €47 million funding round to scale up its fast-growing portfolio. We’re talking projects already spread across Germany, France, Norway, and Canada, with plenty more on the way.

This isn’t just a cash influx—it’s fuel for what could be one of the most ambitious industrial decarbonization roadmaps out there, with more than 3.4 GW of planned electrolysis capacity and a staggering 15 GW in development around the world.

Meet the Big Players Backing the Hydrogen Push

Leading this latest round is Hy24, a powerhouse investment firm devoted to building a global low-carbon hydrogen economy. Hy24’s Clean H2 Infra Fund—one of the biggest in the sector—has some serious muscle behind it, with names like Air Liquide, TotalEnergies, and Plug Power on board.

Joining the party are strategic tech and impact investors like Technip Energies, BenDa, and Rely. So this isn’t just about money—it’s about teaming up with folks who know how to build big and move fast in energy infrastructure.

Where the Magic Happens: Projects With Purpose

Hy2gen isn’t just tossing darts at a map. Every project is rooted in natural advantages—whether that’s access to cheap renewables, world-class ports, or smart policy environments.

Germany (Werlte): Home to the Atlantis plant extension, this site officially kicked off renewable hydrogen production in 2023—already up and running.

France (Fos-Marseille): With a 390 MW electrolyzer coming online, this project aims to crank out 75,000 tons of e-SAF (electro-sustainable aviation fuel) per year, helping airlines stay ahead of tightening fuel regulations.

Norway (Iverson project): This one taps into hydropower to create 200,000 tons of clean ammonia annually—perfect for export in a decarbonizing world.

Canada (Courant project): Still in late-stage planning, this plant focuses on producing renewable ammonia and ammonium nitrate for agriculture and industrial uses where emissions are notoriously tough to wipe out.

The Moment Is Now: Hydrogen Goes from Hype to Reality

Let’s face it—for years, talk about sustainable energy and green hydrogen often felt like just that: talk. But the tide has turned.

Global demand is soaring for zero-carbon alternatives. Companies in aviation, fertilizer, and industry are scrambling to get ahead of climate targets. Governments from Brussels to Ottawa are backing the push with real funding and serious regulations.

And in that context, Hy2gen’s ability to take projects from concept to shovel-ready couldn’t be more perfectly timed. This round of funding isn’t about dreaming—it’s about building.

Tech That Delivers: From Power to Molecules

At the heart of Hy2gen’s model is good old-fashioned electrolysis—using clean electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. But they’re not stopping there.

Hy2gen is betting big on Power-to-X technology, which converts renewable electricity into the high-demand fuels industries already use—like e-SAF or clean ammonia. By focusing on Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), they’re aiming straight at the sectors most in need of cleaner alternatives—and the ones that traditional hydrogen developers often overlook.

Go Big or Go Home: Industrial Scale That Moves the Needle

Hy2gen isn’t messing around when it comes to scale. With 3.4 GW of electrolysis already in planning and construction—and another 15 GW lined up behind it—they’re setting a new bar.

If even part of that capacity goes live, it won’t just be a win for hydrogen production. It could reshape regional economies, shorten supply chains, smooth out fuel pricing, and finally give industrial sectors a reliable, clean fuel source they can bet on.

Taking on the Not-So-Glamorous, but Vital Sectors

Let’s be honest—fuel and fertilizer aren’t exactly headline-grabbers. But if we want to hit decarbonization goals, these sectors can’t be ignored.

That’s why projects like Iverson in Norway (for clean ammonia) and Courant in Canada (for renewable ammonium nitrate) are a big deal. They’re targeting hard-to-decarbonize areas most companies shy away from.

Meanwhile, back in France, Hy2gen’s aviation-focused e-SAF project lands at just the right moment, with regulators turning up the heat for cleaner jet fuels.

Don’t expect all this to go online tomorrow—but with construction on Courant expected to kick off by 2027 and funding now locked in, we’re a lot closer than we were yesterday.

The Bottom Line

Hydrogen isn’t some climate cure-all—but it could be a critical link in the chain. And if companies like Hy2gen keep turning ideas into action across borders and sectors, we might just see how real sustainable energy transformation kicks off.

The big question now? How fast can they bring those 3.4 GW online. Because whether it’s for planes, plants, or fertilizer—every gigawatt counts.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/resized-1746105229845.jpg,N,,2025-05-01 15:56:47.648837

About making green hydrogen via PEM electrolysis

Making green hydrogen through PEM electrolysis involves splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. At the anode, oxygen and positively charged hydrogen protons are generated. These protons pass through the PEM, and at the cathode, they combine with electrons to form hydrogen gas. Since water consists of two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen atom, the process produces twice as much hydrogen as oxygen.

Bankers, he noted, told Congress that they could not finance farmers this year if farmers did not get the $10 billion that was in the funding bill that passed at the end of 2024.

Boozman noted that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program contains a provision to account for inflation but farm programs do not. Boozman maintained that addressing basic farm programs and SNAP in the reconciliation bill will make it easier to pass a farm bill that deals with other programs, but some Democrats have said the opposite.

Boozman said he agrees with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. that diets need to improve to avoid diabetes but he also said that Kennedy, who last week said sugar is “poison,” needs to “be careful about going too far. Some of the things he is talking about don’t fall within his jurisdiction.”

Boozman added that saying sugar “is poison is pretty extreme” and that statements about food need to be based on “sound science and common sense.”

On Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ plan to ask the Agriculture Department for a waiver to stop SNAP participants from buying sweetened beverages with their benefits, Boozman said that issue has come up before in farm bill debates but now “has a lot more momentum.” There are “concerns” about how a waiver would be administered, he said.

Boozman said there will be no cuts to current SNAP benefit levels in the reconciliation bill.

The Senate reconciliation bill instructions call for only a $1 billion cut to programs under the Senate Agriculture Committee’s jurisdiction, but the House instructions are for $230 billion.

Thompson said he also favors including increases for ARC, PLC and crop insurance in the reconciliation bill and that he would be “more comfortable” with a lower cut than $230 billion, which is expected to come at least mostly from SNAP.

Thompson also said he is not “looking to cut benefits” in the SNAP program, but he appeared more open to proposals to require the states to pay part of the SNAP benefit. Thompson noted that “states are now trying to define and tweak SNAP when they don’t pay for them.”

Thompson said he believes the House Agriculture Committee will mark up its portion of the reconciliation bill next week.

Thompson pointed out that he wants to make SNAP benefits available to former prisoners and to eliminate the so-called “poverty cliff” that means people who get a small increase in pay can lose their “safety net.”

Thompson called Kennedy’s statement that sugar is poison “a personal opinion.” When a reporter pointed out that Kennedy is the nation’s top health official, Thompson said, “So what?” He added he would “love to have a day with him to explain how healthy our commodities are.”

Thompson praised the Trump administration and Agriculture Secretary Brook Rollins in particular for being open to feedback.

Klobuchar said she is “very disturbed” by the actions the Trump administration is taking on the rural economy. With tariffs, Klobuchar said, “small farmers are roadkill.”

Klobuchar said her Republican colleagues are also worried, but the question is whether they will “stand up and vote” against Trump policies.

There is a lot of support for sustainable aviation fuel, now called synthetic aviation fuel, which could be given certainty through the 45Z guidance process, Klobuchar said.

Republicans need to “be careful” about raising reference prices that trigger farm subsidies in reconciliation, Klobuchar said.

If the Senate goes “too deep” into SNAP cuts, it will be hard to pass a farm bill, she said.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/12/2025/05/01064419/FarmPolicy-050525.jpg,N,,2025-05-01 14:56:57.965787

The agreement supports the airline’s decarbonisation strategy and is expected to unlock the SAF value chain through the combination of ATOBA’s SAF aggregation, enabling management of pricing and supply volatility risk for airlines and will be further enhanced by World Fuel’s global jet fuel logistics, blending, storage and distribution infrastructure.

The agreement is an important step toward scaling advanced SAF technologies and is intended to support easyJet's decarbonisation journey.

The SAF market is facing challenges in expanding at the rate demanded by environmental needs and regulatory mandates. While producers need long-term, stable pricing contracts to ensure a return on their investments, easyJet is seeking competitive SAF market prices in the context of a nascent industry with diverse competing technologies. This conflict of expectations currently hinders the development of SAF production projects and ATOBA’s unique business model brings a compelling solution.

ATOBA uniquely facilitates the development of SAF production through its upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolio management. By offtaking from diversified producers that use production technologies like Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch, or Power to Liquids, ATOBA mitigates technological and pricing risks associated with the various SAF production pathways and facilitates the closing of long-term offtake agreements among airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers and financial institutions, which are essential for scaling the industry.

In 2024, Air NZ announced the withdrawal of its 28.9% reduction in emissions intensity compared to 2019 levels.
“Air NZ remains committed to reaching its 2050 net zero carbon emissions target,” comments Dame Therese Walsh, Air NZ Chair.","Aviation contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, accounting for about 2-3.5% of global CO₂ emissions.

While CO₂ is the primary greenhouse gas emitted, aviation also releases other substances like nitrogen oxides and soot, which contribute to climate change.

Air New Zealand (Air NZ) has updated its emissions pathway amid its dropping of the 2030 SBTi target of 29%.

Air NZ’s new emissions pathway

Air NZ has unveiled its new 2030 Emissions Guidance framework that is aimed at increasing transparency and realism in its path to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The move follows the company’s decision to withdraw from the SBTi and drop its original 2030 carbon intensity reduction target last year.

The change reflects the airline’s reassessment of the feasibility of its climate ambitions in the face of evolving operational, supply chain and policy-related challenges.

Though it marks a shift away from a fixed goal, Air NZ remains committed to its long-term decarbonisation journey and to playing its part in addressing aviation’s environmental impact.

A difficult but necessary decision?

In 2024, Air NZ announced the withdrawal of its 28.9% reduction in emissions intensity compared to 2019 levels.

""We are acutely aware of aviation’s impact on the climate and our natural environment, so developing a replacement has been a priority for the airline,"" the company stated.

“In recent months, and more so in the last few weeks, it has also become apparent that potential delays to our fleet renewal plan pose an additional risk to the target's achievability,” comments Greg Foran, Chief Executive Officer at Air NZ.

“It is possible the airline may need to retain its existing fleet for longer than planned due to global manufacturing and supply chain issues.

“Given so many levers needed to meet the target are outside our control, the decision has been made to retract the 2030 target and withdraw from the SBTi network immediately.”

The 2030 emissions guidance

Replacing the abandoned target is the newly launched 2030 Emissions Guidance, a dynamic tool that will be updated annually as part of the airline’s Climate Statement.

Rather than setting a static target, the guidance reflects an evolving, data-driven outlook of emissions through to 2030, shaped by real-time progress, market conditions, policy shifts and technological developments.

This year’s emissions forecast projects a 20% to 25% reduction in net ""well-to-wake"" GHG emissions from jet fuel, benchmarked against 2019 levels.

This metric includes the full lifecycle of emissions, from fuel production and distribution to combustion during flight.

“We want to be very honest about what we think is possible given the challenges involved in decarbonising the aviation sector,” the airline stated.

“Setting something we can’t reach wouldn’t be tika (truth). This will still be a stretch for us.”

Steps towards 2050: from SAF to efficiency

Air NZ’s decarbonisation strategy relies on a combination of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), new aircraft technology, operational efficiency and high-integrity carbon removals.

In 2023, the airline sourced just 0.4% of its jet fuel from SAF.

This is projected to rise to 1.6% in 2024, with a goal of reaching 10% by the end of the decade.

“While the volumes of SAF we are buying are very small compared to the amount of fossil jet fuel we use, they give an important signal to alternative fuel producers that we are open for business,” explains Kiri Hannifin, Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer.

The airline is also advancing fleet renewal where possible, optimising its network and routes, and investing in carbon credits to meet international regulatory obligations under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Where appropriate, it will also employ verified carbon removal methods to offset remaining emissions.

Annual climate statement

The 2030 Emissions Guidance will form part of Air NZ’s annual Climate Statement, published each August in line with Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (NZCS).

These standards adopt the framework developed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which the airline has voluntarily reported against since 2020.

The Climate Statement covers four mandatory reporting sections and is intended to ensure long-term accountability and transparency as the airline navigates its low-carbon transition.

While the removal of the previous SBTi target may appear as a step back, Air NZ is adamant that its net zero goal remains firmly in place.

“Air NZ remains committed to reaching its 2050 net zero carbon emissions target,” comments Dame Therese Walsh, Air NZ Chair.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/e53ac15b78069301f40c2d0fe7ae2dbf:4f6872e41c9942ef27ffdc76a6184c40/air-nz-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-01 11:57:35.616308

State-owned Masdar has set an aim to reach production of 1 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen and derivatives a year by 2030.

OMV, partly owned by the Austrian government, wants to fuel its refineries with green electrolytic hydrogen to help achieve its goal of Scope 1-3 net-zero emissions by 2050. Green electrolytic hydrogen is derived from water using a renewable energy-powered process.

Also on Wednesday OMV announced the start of production at its first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility, built at home with an annual capacity of 1,500 metric tons.

The plant, located at OMV’s Schwechat refinery, uses a 10-megawatt PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzer powered by hydro, solar and wind energy. The process avoids up to 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year, equivalent to the CO2 consumption of 2,000 persons per year based on a European Union average, according to OMV.

Output will be used to decarbonize the refinery and produce more sustainable fuels and chemicals including sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

“With the start-up of Austria's largest electrolysis plant, we are re-inventing how essentials we use in everyday life are produced sustainably”, Van Koten said.

“By building robust local production and supply chains for green hydrogen in Europe, OMV is not only advancing climate goals but also safeguarding industrial progress”, the OMV board member added.

“The expertise gained from this initiative will act as a springboard for pioneering projects, laying the foundation for a cleaner, more resilient tomorrow”.

“The plant is certified according to the Renewable Energy Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (RED II) for producing RFNBOs (renewable fuel of non-biological origin)”, the company said.

The project had an investment of about EUR 25 million ($28.31 million), with support from the government’s Climate and Energy Fund.

In other news OMV reported EUR 288 million in net profit for the first quarter (Q1), down 57 percent from Q1 2024; EUR 143 million in net income attributable to parent company shareholders, down 70 percent; and EUR 0.44 in earnings per share.

Sales revenue from continuing operations was “stable” at EUR 6.22 billion compared to EUR 6.26 billion for the corresponding three-month period in the prior year, OMV said.

Fuel and feedstock sales generated EUR 3.82 billion, down year-on-year. Energy sales totaled EUR 2.22 billion, also down by prior-year comparison. Chemical sales registered EUR 171 million, up year-over-year.

Cash flow from operating activities came at EUR 1.34 billion. Free cash flow landed at EUR 317 million.

“OMV has had a profitable start to 2025 amid challenging market and geopolitical conditions”, said chair and chief executive Afred Stern.

OMV exited the January-March 2025 period with EUR 12.68 billion in current assets including EUR 5.68 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Current liabilities stood at EUR 7.74 billion.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recognized an unrealized loss of $11.5 ($3.0 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $0.01 per share).","For the quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EPS of $2.69 decreased six percent from the prior year driven by lower volumes and higher costs. These items were partially offset by favorable pricing, which was primarily attributable to non-helium merchant products. The volume decline was driven by the September 2024 LNG divestiture and lower global helium demand, partially offset by higher volumes in our on-site business. Higher costs primarily reflect favorable non-recurring items in the prior year, inflation, and higher expense for maintenance and depreciation, which were partially offset by productivity improvements across the regions. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion was down three percent.

Second quarter sales of $2.9 billion were flat as four percent higher energy cost pass-through and one percent higher pricing were offset by three percent lower volumes, primarily due to the LNG divestiture, and two percent unfavorable currency.

Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Results by Business Segment

Americas sales of $1.3 billion were up three percent versus the prior year, as four percent higher energy cost pass-through and two percent higher pricing were partially offset by two percent lower volumes and one percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $366 million decreased two percent as higher costs driven by planned maintenance were partially offset by a favorable one-time customer contract amendment and non-helium pricing. Operating margin of 28.4 percent decreased 150 basis points, of which approximately 100 basis points was attributable to higher energy cost pass-through. Adjusted EBITDA of $575 million decreased three percent and included the impact of lower equity affiliates' income.

Asia sales of $774 million decreased one percent from the prior year as three percent unfavorable currency and one percent lower pricing were partially offset by two percent higher energy cost pass-through and one percent higher volumes. Operating income of $191 million decreased six percent driven by lower helium pricing, net of power and fuel costs, and currency, partially offset by lower costs. Operating margin of 24.7 percent decreased 140 basis points driven by the lower helium pricing. Adjusted EBITDA of $334 million increased two percent, primarily due to business mix.

Europe sales of $727 million increased nine percent from the prior year as five percent higher energy cost pass-through, four percent higher pricing, and two percent higher volumes were partially offset by two percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $196 million decreased three percent as higher costs, unfavorable business mix, and currency were partially offset by higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs. Operating margin of 26.9 percent decreased 320 basis points, of which approximately 150 basis points was attributable to higher energy cost pass-through. Adjusted EBITDA of $280 million increased six percent and included the impact of higher equity affiliates' income.

Middle East and India equity affiliates' income of $78 million increased six percent from the prior year driven by an affiliate in Saudi Arabia.

Corporate and other sales of $95 million decreased 53 percent and operating loss of $118 million increased 35% compared to the prior year, primarily due to the divestiture of the LNG business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Operating loss in fiscal year 2025 also reflects unfavorable changes to sale of equipment project estimates, which were partially mitigated by productivity improvements.

Reconciliation to Consolidated Results

The table below reconciles total operating income disclosed in the table above to consolidated operating income (loss) as reflected on our consolidated income statements:

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(Millions of U.S. Dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)

We present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), on an ""adjusted"" or ""non-GAAP"" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, and capital expenditures, while on a segment basis, we present adjusted EBITDA. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments"", have on the calculation of our adjusted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.

NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS

In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude gains or losses that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as volatility in equity and debt markets. Further, non-service related components are not indicative of our defined benefit plans' future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans. Additionally, as further discussed below, our adjustments in this release include other gains and losses that are not associated with the ongoing operation of our business. These items are oftentimes difficult to predict; however, the reader should be aware that we may recognize similar gains or losses in the future.

When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions. Additionally, in some cases, we may adjust for tax-only items, such as the income tax benefit related to U.S. tax reform and additional withholding taxes related to the repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal year 2025 as discussed below.

Business and Asset Actions

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recognized charges of $2,934.7 ($2,290.6 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $10.28 per share) for the strategic business and asset actions described below. Our Board of Directors continues to evaluate strategic opportunities across our business that could result in additional costs in future periods. For the prior year quarter, business and asset actions of $57.0 ($43.8 after tax, or $0.20 per share) resulted from severance and other postemployment benefits payable to employees identified under a global cost reduction plan. The charges for business and asset actions in fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were not allocated to our reportable segments.

Project Exit Costs

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer initiated a project review in an effort to streamline our backlog and allow us to focus resources on projects that we believe will enhance value for our shareholders. In connection with this review, we decided to exit various projects related to clean energy generation and distribution.

As a result of these decisions, we recorded project exit costs of $2,861.8 and $6.8 through operating loss and equity affiliates' income, respectively. The majority of these costs related to projects in the Americas segment. The charge reflected in operating loss primarily includes the write down of project assets to their estimated net realizable value as well as estimated costs required to terminate various contractual commitments. The non-cash portion of this charge totaled approximately $2.4 billion, which was largely attributable to plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets associated with the sustainable aviation fuel expansion project with World Energy in Paramount, California. The $6.8 recorded to equity affiliates' income reflects an other-than-temporary impairment of a joint venture in China that had been formed to develop clean hydrogen infrastructure in the region. The amount of these charges attributable to our noncontrolling partners was $3.5.

Our estimates related to exiting these projects, including the net realizable value of assets to be disposed, reflect our best judgment based on information available at the time the project exit costs were recorded. Final settlement of these items may differ materially from our current estimates, which could impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods.

Global Cost Reduction Plan

We initiated a global cost reduction plan in June 2023 that provides severance and other postemployment benefit to employees identified for involuntarily separation. Costs incurred in connection with the plan totaled $66.1 and $57.0 for the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Shareholder Activism-Related Costs

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded costs of $31.4 ($31.0 after tax, or $0.14 per share) in connection with a proxy contest led by an activist shareholder that concluded in January upon certification of the election of directors following our 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Following the election, the Board of Directors appointed a new Chief Executive Officer (""CEO""). The costs incurred during the second quarter primarily reflect executive separation costs for our former CEO, which included a noncash expense of $22.4 to accelerate vesting of share-based awards and $7.3 for severance and other cash benefits that were paid during the quarter.

For additional information regarding post-employment benefits under our Executive Separation Program, refer to our Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

De-designation of Cash Flow Hedges

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting for certain interest rate swaps designed to hedge long-term variable rate debt facilities during the construction period of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project. These swaps are held by NEOM Green Hydrogen Company, a consolidated joint venture accounted for under the variable interest model, of which Air Products owns a one-third interest. We expect the affected swaps to remain de-designated until outstanding borrowings from the available project financing are commensurate with the notional value of the instruments, at which time these instruments may re-qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. As a result of the de-designation, unrealized gains and losses are recorded to ""Other non-operating income (expense), net"" on our consolidated income statements. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recognized an unrealized loss of $11.5 ($3.0 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $0.01 per share). The amount of the unrealized loss attributable to our noncontrolling partners was $7.5.

We expect to recognize changes to the fair value of the impacted instruments through earnings in future periods until they re-qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. It is not possible to predict the significance of adjustments in future periods given potential interest rate volatility.

Non-Service Related Pension Items

As discussed above, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of our defined benefit pension plans because they are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as volatility in equity and debt markets. Non-service related pension items resulted in net non-operating costs of $10.7 ($8.0 after tax, or $0.04 per share) and $25.1 ($18.9 after tax, or $0.08 per share) for the three months ended 31 March 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Income Taxes

Tax Reform Adjustment Related to Deemed Foreign Dividends

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $34.9 ($0.16 per share) related to our intent to file a refund claim after a review of several U.S. Tax Court cases regarding the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition year of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (our fiscal year 2018). While we were not a party to these cases, the opinions resulted in a change to our intent to pursue a refund claim. The $34.9 income tax benefit is net of a $67.8 reserve for an uncertain tax position related to the calculation of the refund amount.

Tax on Repatriation of Foreign Earnings

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded an income tax expense of $31.4 ($0.14 per share) related to estimated withholding taxes on foreign earnings we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest. There were no other significant changes to our assumptions regarding the reinvestment of foreign earnings during the first six months of fiscal year 2025.

ADJUSTED EPS

The table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted EPS, which we view as a key performance metric, for the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. Per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total GAAP EPS and total adjusted EPS due to rounding.

ADJUSTED EBITDA

We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss less income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful metric for management to assess operating performance on both a consolidated and a segment basis.

The tables below present a reconciliation of consolidated net income on a GAAP basis to consolidated adjusted EBITDA:

The tables below present a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted EBITDA for the Company's three largest regional segments for the three months ended 31 March 2025 and 2024:

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Capital expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as the sum of cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates, and investment in financing receivables on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, we adjust additions to plant and equipment to exclude NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (""NGHC"") expenditures funded by the joint venture's project financing, which is non-recourse to Air Products, as well as our partners' equity contributions to arrive at a measure that we believe is more representative of our investment activities. Substantially all the funding we provide to NGHC is limited for use by the venture for its capital expenditures.

A reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below:

The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below:

Outlook for Investing Activities

It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.

We expect capital expenditures of approximately $5 billion for fiscal year 2025.

OUTLOOK

The adjusted EPS guidance below is provided on a diluted basis from continuing operations attributable to Air Products and is compared to historical adjusted EPS. These adjusted measures exclude the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance, such as the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans, the incurrence of costs for business, asset, and cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on certain disclosed items. The per share impact for each of our non-GAAP adjustments is calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted EPS due to rounding.

It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to identify the timing or occurrence of similar future events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance; however, any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on our future GAAP EPS. Accordingly, management is unable to fully reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, our forecasted range of adjusted EPS to a comparable GAAP range.

A multi-faceted approach to aviation sustainability The controversy surrounding SAF underscores the broader challenges of making aviation truly sustainable.","The future of aviation sustainability remains a contentious issue, as highlighted at last year’s World Aviation Festival in Amsterdam. Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman made headlines when he publicly challenged the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) stance on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In a heated discussion with IATA CEO Willie Walsh, Neeleman questioned the feasibility, economic viability, and effectiveness of SAF as the primary solution to reducing carbon emissions in aviation.

While SAF has been widely embraced as a way to decarbonise air travel, Neeleman took a contrarian stance, arguing that the transition to SAF would significantly increase fuel costs, leading to higher ticket prices and reduced consumer demand. He further raised concerns about SAF’s reliance on biofuels, which could interfere with food supply chains.

“SAF interferes with the food supply. It doesn’t really solve the problem, and I think it’s just a complete waste of money,” he stated. Instead, Neeleman advocated for focusing on sustainability in other sectors, such as the development of greener fuels for diesel-powered vehicles.

His remarks ignited debate within the industry, reflecting a broader dilemma: while airlines are under pressure to decarbonise, there is no universal consensus on the best path forward.

The role of SAF in aviation’s decarbonisation strategy

SAF has emerged as one of the aviation sector’s primary solutions for reducing emissions. Produced from renewable sources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and synthetic processes, SAF can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. Despite this potential, adoption remains low, primarily due to high production costs and limited availability.

At the Airbus Summit 2025 held on March 24-25 at Toulouse, France, Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus, emphasised the challenges associated with SAF: “We need to make planes that burn less fuel and be more efficient, ensure better air traffic management, use fuels that put less carbon in the air. But SAF is significantly more expensive than traditional jet fuel. As a result, the economy and ecology are not aligned.”

Even proponents of SAF acknowledge that its price — three to five times higher than conventional jet fuel — poses a major hurdle to widespread adoption. Airbus’ Chief Sustainability Officer, Julie Kitcher, highlighted another issue: “The finance industry is moving away from the SAF sector, not towards it.”

To bridge the gap between supply and demand, Airbus is testing a “Book and Claim” system. This initiative allows airlines to purchase SAF credits even if they do not physically use the fuel, enabling more sustainable operations through emissions accounting mechanisms.

Elena Schmidt, Executive Director at the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), supported this model: “With the Book and Claim system in place, SAF is more affordable, more accessible, and more accountable. It will make the aviation sector more credible and sustainable.”

But how closely is the wider air cargo industry aligned with the vision of scaling SAF adoption and driving broader decarbonisation?

While 71% of companies report having a sustainability strategy, deeper indicators suggest a more cautious commitment in practice, according to TIACA’s 5th annual air cargo industry sustainability survey. Only 53% have a dedicated sustainability team, just 42% allocate a specific budget for sustainability, and a mere 32% are actively engaged in SAF deployment.

However, carbon offset use stands slightly higher at 35%. This measured progress comes despite strong executive-level support—96% of respondents say their CEO backs sustainability efforts, 88% cite CFO involvement, and 94% believe sustainability is as important, if not more, than it was last year. Currently, the industry’s top focus is on energy optimisation, with 72% prioritising it as a key strategy for cutting both emissions and costs.

Fleet modernisation and vehicle utilisation optimisation are also emerging as critical strategies in the industry’s decarbonisation efforts. 88% of companies have prioritised fleet modernisation, investing in newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft to lower emissions. At the same time, 93% of respondents are actively working on vehicle utilisation optimisation, improving asset management and operational efficiency.

“The finance industry is moving away from the SAF sector, not towards it.”

Julie Kitcher, Airbus

This focus on modernising fleets and optimising asset utilisation underscores the industry’s commitment to incremental improvements. However, some experts argue that these measures, while essential, are not enough to drive the transformative change aviation needs

The need for disruption: Exploring alternative solutions

While SAF is seen as an incremental step towards sustainability, some industry leaders believe a true transformation requires deeper technological innovation.

Bertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, criticised the aviation industry’s slow pace of innovation: “Innovation stopped 60 years ago. Planes now look the same as 60 years ago. Of course, they have become safer, more efficient, consume less fuel, and are optimised, but they look the same.”

He argued that a fundamental shift is necessary: “Is SAF a disruption? No. SAF is a way to continue optimisation. There will be planes looking exactly the same that run on SAF.” Instead, he suggested that hydrogen-powered, electric, and even solar-powered planes could be the real game-changers.

Airbus is already working towards hydrogen-powered aviation through its ZEROe project. Glenn Llewellyn, VP of the initiative, explained: “We have decided to move ahead and focus our attention on fuel-cell propulsion systems and liquid hydrogen storage. This combination will allow us to deliver a full-electric aircraft.”

While hydrogen technology is promising, the industry still lacks the necessary infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to support large-scale hydrogen-powered aviation.

Wings of tomorrow: The role of aircraft design in sustainability

Beyond fuel alternatives, innovative aircraft design plays a crucial role in making aviation more sustainable. Airbus and Boeing are investing heavily in new aircraft architectures that prioritise efficiency and reduce emissions.

The “Wings of Tomorrow” initiative by Airbus is a prime example of such efforts. This project focuses on developing ultra-efficient wing structures that enhance aerodynamics, reduce drag, and improve fuel efficiency. The use of advanced materials, such as composite structures and lightweight alloys, further aids in reducing aircraft weight, leading to lower fuel consumption.

Mark Bentall, Head of Research & Technology Programme at Airbus, emphasised the importance of design in sustainability: “We need to rethink aircraft from the ground up. Blended-wing body designs, active wing controls, and advanced propulsion systems will revolutionise aviation in the coming decades.”

Boeing, on the other hand, has been working on its Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) concept, which aims to create aircraft with extended wingspans and greater aerodynamic efficiency. NASA has partnered with Boeing to test these designs, which could lead to significant fuel savings and reduced emissions.

These design innovations, when combined with alternative fuel sources and operational efficiencies, could bring aviation closer to its sustainability goals.

Carbon removal and operational efficiencies: Additional pathways to sustainability

Beyond alternative fuels, other strategies to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint include direct carbon removal and operational efficiencies.

Gabrielle Walker, Co-founder and Chief Scientist at CUR8, emphasised the need for carbon removal in addition to SAF. She mentioned that SAF along with carbon removal is essential for decarbonising the sector. Adding to that Vanessa Hudson, CEO of Qantas Airways mentioned, “In the future, consumers are going to make sustainable choices even for aviation, including booking tickets, even if it requires paying a green premium.”

Operational improvements can also significantly cut emissions. Bentall suggested that aircraft could be redesigned to monitor atmospheric conditions in real time, reducing contrail formation, which contributes to global warming.

“Currently, aircraft are not designed to monitor atmospheric conditions effectively. The existing models are big and expensive, not a practical solution for regular flights. We need to develop models that use the best weather data to predict and avoid high-risk zones for contrails and turbulence,” he noted.

The economic and social implications of aviation’s green transition

While sustainability is a pressing goal, the economic and social implications of decarbonisation cannot be overlooked. Qantas’s Hudson pointed out that the SAF industry could create new employment opportunities: “SAF can open up a new industry and create jobs.”

Schmidt of RSB emphasised the broader benefits of SAF beyond aviation: “Look at regions like Southeast Asia, where agricultural residue from rice production is currently burned, impacting air quality. If we use that residue as feedstock for SAF, it improves air quality and decarbonises aviation while reducing public health costs.”

However, many challenges remain. Airbus’ Head of SAF and CRD, Julien Manhes noted that the lack of clear demand signals from airlines and regulatory support is slowing SAF adoption: “I have spoken to many oil and gas companies. They know how to fulfill a demand, but there is no solid demand.”

“We need to make planes that burn less fuel and be more efficient, ensure better air traffic management, use fuels that put less carbon in the air.”

Guillaume Faury, Airbus

Regulatory frameworks and financial incentives will play a crucial role in determining the future of aviation sustainability. Airlines and manufacturers continue to call for stronger policy support to bridge the cost gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

A multi-faceted approach to aviation sustainability

The controversy surrounding SAF underscores the broader challenges of making aviation truly sustainable. While SAF is a key component of the industry’s decarbonisation strategy, it is not a silver bullet. The transition to a greener aviation sector requires a combination of solutions, including:

Greater investment in hydrogen and electric aviation

Carbon removal technologies

Improved operational efficiencies

Supportive regulatory and financial mechanisms

As the Airbus CEO summarised: “We can make hydrogen-powered planes that work. But to scale up, we need commercially viable aircraft, a regulatory framework, and a hydrogen ecosystem at scale.”

While the road ahead is complex, collaboration between governments, financial institutions, and the aviation industry will be essential to accelerating sustainable aviation solutions. Whether SAF, hydrogen, or another breakthrough technology becomes the dominant force in the coming decades, one thing is clear: aviation must evolve to meet the environmental and economic demands of the future.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/29/81489-1500-x-9002.jpg,N,,2025-05-01 11:57:39.316045

A ceremony was held on Thursday at Kansai International Airport to mark the start of SAF distribution. The fuel is made from used cooking oil collected from restaurants across Japan.

The joint venture of a major oil wholesaler and a major plant construction company produces SAF at a refinery in Sakai City in Osaka Prefecture.

The venture firm plans to supply up to 30,000 kiloliters of SAF per year. Major airlines and other entities will mix a certain percentage of SAF with regular aviation fuel. The European Union began mandating the partial use of SAF this year as part of its decarbonization efforts.

The Japanese government says used cooking oil from businesses such as restaurants amounts to about 400,000 tons per year. More than 90 percent of it is collected and mainly used as livestock feed and to make chemical products.

Company officials say they hope to cut costs and stabilize the supply by expanding the collection of used cooking oil from businesses and including households in the recycling process.

The senior vice president in charge of procurement for Japan Airlines, Ogawa Noriko, says the airline plans to have SAF account for 1 percent of its entire fuel use in 2025 and 10 percent in 2030. She adds that domestically produced aviation fuel is important from the perspective of energy security.",https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/upld/thumbnails/en/news/20250501_15_1521088_L.jpg,N,,2025-05-01 05:56:07.948994

This move reflects a broader strategy to use advanced technology to address aviation’s environmental challenges and help meet long-term net-zero targets.

Known for its hard-to-abate emissions, the aviation industry is under growing pressure to adopt cleaner, more efficient systems.

United sees the JetZero partnership as a practical route to meaningful carbon reductions through engineering innovation.

Reimagining the aircraft through blended wing technology

JetZero’s flagship design, the Z4, moves away from the traditional narrow fuselage and long wings seen in today’s commercial aircraft.

Instead, it adopts a blended wing body structure. This means the aircraft’s body and wings form a single, continuous aerodynamic surface, distributing lift more efficiently across the entire frame.

This structure, according to the company, could result in up to 50% lower fuel consumption per passenger mile when compared to aircraft of similar size.

It’s a substantial saving with direct implications for cutting carbon output and improving operational efficiency.

The Z4 will use conventional jet engines, but these are designed to be compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), offering further emissions reductions once SAF becomes more widely available.

Andrew Chang, Head of United Airlines Ventures, says: ""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.""

JetZero’s Z4 is built for long-haul flights, able to carry 250 passengers more than 5,000 nautical miles.

These specifications place it firmly in the large aircraft category, with a strong fit for international routes like New York to Spain.

Support from defence and focus on sustainable operations

The US Air Force is also involved in supporting JetZero’s development, contributing US$235m to help accelerate a full-scale demonstrator aircraft.

The first flight is scheduled for 2027.

The military sees potential in the design for applications including transport aircraft and refuelling tankers, which together represent around 60% of the Air Force’s total jet fuel use.

This dual-track development — civil and military — could push the Z4 forward on an aggressive timeline.

For United, early access to this technology gives a strong advantage in reducing operational costs and cutting emissions faster.

Passenger experience is also central to the Z4’s blueprint.

Its cabin layout allows for more flexible seating, more spacious arrangements and a wider main door to improve boarding.

JetZero ensures that, despite its new shape, the Z4 works with existing airport layouts.

No major changes will be needed to infrastructure, like runways or jet bridges, which makes adoption less disruptive and more cost-effective.

Tom O'Leary, CEO and Co-Founder of JetZero, says: ""United's investment in our company signals the industry's belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe.""

Part of United’s net zero technology roadmap

The partnership is part of a broader strategy led by United Airlines Ventures, the investment arm of the airline.

Alongside JetZero, United is also supporting projects in hydrogen aircraft, electric air taxis and hybrid-electric propulsion — all contributing to its 2050 net zero target.

JetZero aims to launch the Z4 for commercial use by 2030, with routes like New York to Palma de Mallorca offering prime opportunities.

According to the company, this route could see up to 45% less fuel use compared to existing twin-aisle aircraft.

This gain shows how aircraft design, when re-engineered through a technology lens, can directly impact both cost and carbon.

Sustainable aviation fuel is poised to play a critical role in the future of air travel.","The aviation sector is undergoing a transformative shift, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is at the forefront. As airlines and governments commit to net-zero emissions, SAF emerges as a pivotal solution. Investors are now eyeing this burgeoning market, recognising its potential to revolutionise air travel and deliver substantial returns.

Sustainable aviation fuel, derived from renewable sources like plant oils, waste fats, and municipal waste, offers a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel. Unlike fossil fuels, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%, depending on the feedstock and production method. This significant reduction positions SAF as a key player in decarbonising the aviation industry.

The production of SAF has seen notable growth. In 2023, global SAF production reached 600 million litres, accounting for 0.2% of total jet fuel use. Projections for 2024 estimate a rise to 1.3 billion litres, representing 0.3% of global consumption. While these figures indicate progress, they also highlight the vast potential for expansion in the SAF market.

One of the primary challenges facing SAF is the limited availability of feedstocks. Traditional sources like hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) are in high demand, prompting researchers and companies to explore alternative materials. Innovations include the use of woody biomass, agricultural residues, and municipal waste, aiming to create more sustainable and scalable production methods.

Economic factors also play a crucial role in SAF adoption. Currently, SAF is more expensive than conventional jet fuel. However, with advancements in technology and increased production, costs are expected to decrease. Additionally, government incentives and carbon pricing mechanisms can further enhance the economic viability of SAF.

Major airlines are already investing in SAF. Companies like Lufthansa, Air France, and KLM have entered into multi-year purchase agreements, securing millions of tonnes of SAF for future use. These commitments not only demonstrate confidence in SAF’s potential but also signal a shift towards more sustainable aviation practices.

From an investment perspective, the SAF industry presents numerous opportunities. Companies involved in feedstock production, fuel processing, and distribution stand to benefit from the growing demand. Moreover, technological advancements in SAF production methods can lead to new market entrants and innovative solutions.

Sustainable aviation fuel is poised to play a critical role in the future of air travel. Its environmental benefits, coupled with increasing industry and governmental support, make it an attractive area for investment. As the world moves towards greener solutions, SAF offers a promising pathway for both environmental impact and financial returns.",https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Avation-plc.jpg,N,,2025-05-01 04:56:12.478304

It reveals that half of Australia’s top 178 tourism assets are in an elevated risk category, as they face considerable climate change and natural-peril risks.
For now, Triggs says climate change and its dampening effect on tourism is hurting both the real economy and the financial system in some South-East Asian nations.
“Then producers will start producing that type of fuel in a big way.” Coordinated and well-considered solutions are seen as the best way to promote sustainable tourism.
Sustainable tourism is no longer just about safeguarding the environment.","Dr Adam Triggs, a sustainability expert at economic consultancy Mandala Partners, says the K’gari scenario is just one example of how climate change could jeopardise Asia-Pacific tourism.

“One of the really big risks to tourism is the reputational effects that can manifest from news reports,” he says. “Even if there are infrequent reports of jellyfish and shark attacks and things like that, it can be enough to reduce tourism in an area.”

Triggs is one of the researchers on a new report, The Zurich-Mandala Climate Risk Index, which assesses the impact of climate change on the Australian tourism industry. It reveals that half of Australia’s top 178 tourism assets are in an elevated risk category, as they face considerable climate change and natural-peril risks.

The modelling also suggests that revenue losses from compromised tourist destinations could risk up to 176,000 jobs in Australia, 65 per cent of which are outside capital cities.

While the research is Australia-specific, Triggs says the implications of climate change could be even worse for developing countries where tourism is “more heavily weighted” to highly vulnerable natural wonders such as beaches.

A vulnerable position

A growing number of Asia-Pacific’s famous tourism sites and destinations are exposed to climate risk — including coral bleaching on Australia’s Greater Barrier Reef, increasingly devastating typhoons in South-East Asia that have ravaged Vietnam and the Philippines in recent years, and rising sea levels that are threatening Bangladesh’s low-lying historical Bagerhat mosques.

In the Pacific, a World Meteorological Organization report states that a “triple whammy” of sea-level rises, ocean warming and acidification is putting islands in peril and threatening the socioeconomic viability of people who rely on tourism to live.

Randy Durband, CEO of the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, says a tourism industry that relies on stable and predictable environmental conditions is “extremely vulnerable” to the forces of climate change, which are causing more frequent and severe weather events.

He warns that short-term thinking has resulted in too few nations or tourism operators responding appropriately to the threat. Instead, they may alter tourism products, change destinations or simply say to prospective tourists that people “can’t go here anymore”. “I don’t think there’s been enough adaptation at all,” Durband says.

With tourism forecast to comprise more than 11 per cent of the Asia-Pacific economy by 2034, a value of US$5.83 trillion, the stakes are high to protect the industry. For now, Triggs says climate change and its dampening effect on tourism is hurting both the real economy and the financial system in some South-East Asian nations.

“Tourism is a big source of employment for so many people in Asia, so it really impacts the real economy. But then you’ve got this financial side whereby a lot of South-East Asian countries rely on tourism as their main source of foreign exchange.”

The upshot is that they can then struggle to fund crucial pillars of their economies.

Fight or flight

Not only are priceless natural as sets under threat from climate change — crucial infrastructure such as airports, scenic roads and railways are also at risk of accessibility issues, supply-chain disruption, adaptation costs and reputational damage.

In Australia, at Hobart Airport, the aviation gateway for Tasmania’s highly regarded tourism sector, CFO Kate Gillies CPA and her team are determined to manage transition risk and contribute to the sustainability of the sector on two fronts.

First, the airport has a Climate Change Adaptation Plan in place to help ensure that its facility is as resilient as possible and able to support tourism across the state. Second, as part of the aviation sector, it wants to do its best to reduce its own environmental footprint and work with its partners to help them do the same.

“We’re focused on embedding sustainability in everything we do,” Gillies says. “For example, we’re doing a once-in-a-generation upgrade of our airfield that involves milling the asphalt on the runway.

Instead of just sending that to landfill, we’re using it to construct our new car parks — that’s 27,000 tonnes of asphalt being recycled. These sorts of initiatives lead to good economic and environmental outcomes.”

To reduce the prospect of disruptive flooding, a common problem for many airports located on low-lying land, Gillies says that any new infrastructure will be developed in conjunction with the latest flood modelling, to protect these assets.

This sustainable approach includes working with rental-car partners at the airport to ensure that there is sufficient electric-vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. “If you come to this clean, green state, you don’t want to have to get into a petrol car. Having electric vehicle options is important.”

Gillies says other Hobart Airport initiatives include working with food and beverage partners to compost food waste from the terminal, and adopting indigenous cultural practices that do controlled burns of grass on site, rather than slashing it.

As the tourism industry responds to calls for greater sustainability, Durband says any measures to protect the environment should be reasonable and rational, noting that the “flight-shame movement” that developed before COVID-19 could conceivably rise again.

Avoiding air travel, he says, would be a disaster for many South-East Asian and Pacific economies that rely on coastal tourism. “What we say is that if you don’t fly to Pacific islands where 30 to 40 per cent of GDP is based on tourism, they then become double victims of climate change.

The ocean levels are already taking away their land and, in a resource-free environment where they have less minerals or agriculture, they must have tourism.”

Although “flight-shaming” is on the radar for Hobart Airport, Gillies believes Tasmania’s status as a “green destination” holds it in better stead than most. “We’re hopeful that Tasmania’s reputation and location means people will still want to fly to here.”

Some players within the tourism industry are moving to embrace both adaptation and mitigation strategies to respond to climate change challenges. The former includes investing in resilient infrastructure such as seawalls and flood defences.

The latter includes airlines, cruise companies and hotels investing more heavily in energy-efficient technologies, alternative fuels and carbon-offset programs.

“I’d like to see the whole aviation industry move more aggressively on sustainable aviation fuel development and then come to a consensus, choosing two or three [types of fuel] that are going to be the main ones,” Durband says. “Then producers will start producing that type of fuel in a big way.”

Coordinated and well-considered solutions are seen as the best way to promote sustainable tourism.

This may include engaging in climate-change-scenario planning to help government and tourism operators make more informed decisions; putting more resources and capital into climate-resilient tourism systems; developing overarching tourism policies and guidelines that focus on climate change mitigation; and promoting the decarbonisation of tourism facilities and services.

Triggs concedes that many South-East Asian and Pacific nations may lack the capital to make some sustainable interventions.

For instance, struggles to source finance make it difficult for the government to fund major tourism-related risk-management and infrastructure projects.

Greater adoption of insurance could allow developing countries and tourism facilities to recover faster in the event of a natural disaster, according to Triggs. Whereas a country such as Australia is highly insured, Pacific and South-East Asian nations often lack insurance protection.

“This means that the impact of these climate perils is felt much, much more by people who are not only having to recover and rebuild, but who have also potentially been bankrupted by some of these events as well.”

Prevention of climate-related disasters should also be a greater focus. In Australia, every dollar spent on disaster resilience and mitigation delivers a return nine times over. Triggs notes that “we need to focus a lot more on prevention … and strengthen our processes to respond when something does go wrong.”

There is a bigger role to play, too, for data analysis that identifies climate risks and informs smarter positioning and management of tourism infrastructure.

Sustainable tourism is no longer just about safeguarding the environment. It is a significant financial driver for tourism operators.

The annual global eco-tourism market, valued at about US$248.17 billion in 2024 and projected to grow to US$945.34 billion by 2034, is thriving on the back of climate-conscious tourists who are seeking sustainable travel options.

Global Sustainable Tourism Council CEO Randy Durband says more can be done in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere to speed up the sustainability transition.

He cites more renewable energy use in hotels and resorts; greater rollout of EV or hybrid vehicles by rental companies and tourism operators; superior waste-management approaches; and more sustainable use of air-conditioning.

The wider rollout of universal EV charging stations will be especially crucial to deliver sustainability gains in the transport sector. “We can move much more aggressively on clean energy vehicles and hydrogen” Durband says. “Those prices are coming down.”

His final plea is for governments to introduce stricter regulations to fast-track clean energy options within the sector. “It’s unreasonable to say, ‘Do it tomorrow’, but it’s totally reasonable to say, ‘This is going to be required five years from now, so get going’.”",https://www.cpaaustralia.com.au/-/media/project/cpa/intheblack/images/magazine-2025/05-may/trees-blue-sky-plane.jpg?h=720&iar=0&w=1280&rev=bee2ce90330149d59437a5af9198126f&hash=E249EFC358E4D8BD748BDC1468E11D5E,N,,2025-05-01 05:56:16.134367

Universal Fuel Technologies (UniFuel; Los Altos, Calif.; unifuel.tech) developed a process, known as Flexiforming, that can transform mixtures of alcohols, naphthas, petroleum gas and light olefins into SAF, gasoline or BTX (benzene, toluene, xylenes).

The five-month pilot project, conducted in Texas in late 2024, produced almost 100 L of renewable SAF from multiple renewable feedstocks. The pilot campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF, as well as making SAF from ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA).

“The world of renewable fuels is characterized by many different and often small streams of feedstocks that would be considered weird when compared to derivatives of crude oil,” explains UniFuel CEO Alexei Beltyukov. “Flexiforming is designed to adapt to that reality by allowing the flexibility to process multiple diverse feedstocks in an economical way.”

The process uses a zeolite catalyst with proprietary modifications that allow it to tolerate water and to handle a variety of feeds. The ability of the Flexiforming technology to make aromatic molecules, which are required to meet jet fuel specifications, and to process various feedstocks through a single technology platform where most of the chemical reactions occur in one reactor vessel significantly lowers production costs, Beltyukov says. “Flexiforming doesn’t require a separate set of equipment for dehydrating ethanol to ethylene, and another one for oligomerization, and doesn’t require compressing the ethylene gas, so both the capital expenses and energy requirements are lower than other EtJ processes,” he points out. Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes.

A region that holds immense potential for air traffic growth where air passenger numbers are expected to double in the next decade.

Boeing management's hopes of resolving a strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) have been dealt another blow as IAM members voted on 23-Oct-2024 to reject the company's latest offer.

The ongoing strike has suspended 737 MAX, 767 and 777 production with knock-on effects for Boeing's suppliers, notably Spirit AeroSystems.

The failure of Boeing and IAM to reach an agreement will only add to the growing frustration among airline leaders regarding delayed aircraft deliveries from both Boeing and Airbus, and supply constraints from engine manufacturers such as Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce.

Aircraft delivery delays and broader supply chain problems are a significant factor in the aviation industry's inability to increase capacity to match post-pandemic growth in demand, and it seems that these issues are unlikely to be resolved soon.

Air New Zealand is describing its new, less ambitious climate action forecast for 2030 as ""guidance"" on how it expects to perform, rather than a target.
British environmentalist Sir Jonathon Porritt was head of the airline's external sustainability panel when it adopted its science-based 2030 target but departed before the target was dropped.
Air NZ said its emissions guidance aimed to provide ""a regular and transparent assessment of Air New Zealand's progress towards its 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target"" and it plans to issue updates annually in August.
""We hope there may be opportunities to move faster as new technologies and the SAF industry grows, so our 2030 emissions guidance could be updated to reflect any upside as well,"" she said.","Air New Zealand says getting from 1.6 per cent sustainable aviation fuel this year to 10 per cent by 2030 is ""really going to keep us on our toes.""

Chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer Kiri Hannifin defended the move from a science-based climate target for cutting emissions to issuing ""guidance"" on how climate efforts were tracking.

""We had to pull out of our science-based target last year because we couldn't achieve it and when you can't achieve something you have to be honest about that,"" Hannifin told Morning Report.

""But our view is you can't be an airline and cause the harm that you do without having something in the market that talks about how you're going to decarbonise, and so that's why we replaced it, but we've replaced it with something that is ambitious, it is achievable but it is really going to stretch us.""

""The reason we've done it not as a static target but as guidance is because we want to be radically transparent every with everybody year about how we are tracking.""

Air New Zealand is describing its new, less ambitious climate action forecast for 2030 as ""guidance"" on how it expects to perform, rather than a target.

The airline made global headlines last year when it pulled the plug on its climate targets, saying the new aircraft and alternative jet fuels it needed to reach them were too hard to get and too expensive.

In July 2024 the national carrier removed its 2030 carbon intensity reduction target and withdrew from the global Science Based Targets initiative, which is considered the gold standard for corporate goal setting to combat climate change.

Carbon intensity is a measure of greenhouse gas emissions relative to a certain activity. In Air New Zealand's case, the target aimed for a 29 per cent reduction by 2030 in emissions produced, relative to goods and people transported.

That abandoned target has been replaced with a guidance statement on how the airline's effort to reduce planet-heating emissions are shaping up, the first in an annual series.

The statement said that as of 1 May 2025, Air New Zealand expects to reduce its ""well-to-wake"" net greenhouse gas emissions from jet fuel by 20 to 25 per cent by 2030, compared with a 2019 baseline.

Well-to-wake emissions included jet fuel production, distribution and combustion in flight, which the airline said added up to 92 per cent of its annual climate impact of 4.3 million tonnes of greenhouse gases.

Hannifin said that under the guidance emissions would fall to between 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes in 2030 ""and that's in a period of growth.""

For scale, New Zealand's total greenhouse gas emissions are around 76 million tonnes a year.

However, most of Air NZ's emissions do not count towards that national tally because they happen overseas.

Overseas flights do not count towards any country's official emissions, because of a loophole in international climate reporting which excludes international shipping and aviation.

Reliant on ""affordable"" alternative jet fuels

The airline said the latest guidance relies on Air New Zealand meeting its target to use 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel in 2030, receiving deliveries of new aircraft on time and other factors.

Sustainable jet fuel or SAF comes from alternative sources to fossil fuels such as used cooking oil, wood and plants and - it is hoped - will one day come from synthetic processes, which would have a lower environmental impact.

The airline said its 10 per cent goal is contingent on being able to access ""appropriate volumes of SAF at reasonable prices"", which it said will rely on outside developments.

However climate campaigners have previously criticised Air NZ and other airlines for being unwilling to spend what is needed to rapidly grow the supply of cleaner fuels.

British environmentalist Sir Jonathon Porritt was head of the airline's external sustainability panel when it adopted its science-based 2030 target but departed before the target was dropped.

https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/top/530685/air-nz-says-by-2030-nearly-every-overseas-port-it-flies-to-will-require-it-to-carry-sustainable-fuel-but-not-nz

He previously told RNZ that there was huge demand for sustainable fuel from all major airlines as they try to cut their emissions, and being located in New Zealand made it harder to get an affordable supply.

Porritt said, to Air New Zealand's credit, it refused to source biofuel from potentially destructive sources such as palm oil.

But there was only so much alternative feedstock - like used cooking oil - to go around. Meanwhile, all airlines were determined to grow while also cutting their climate impacts.

""Pretty much everybody is still geared to the desirability and inevitability of more bums on more seats in the air, in every single market around the world.

Sir Jonathon said the solution was to throw support behind synthetic fuel, which does not compete with food or forests for land.

But because it cost more governments were unlikely to make its use mandatory, he said.

Air NZ said its emissions guidance aimed to provide ""a regular and transparent assessment of Air New Zealand's progress towards its 2050 net-zero carbon emissions target"" and it plans to issue updates annually in August.

Hannifin said the guidance could improve in future.

""We hope there may be opportunities to move faster as new technologies and the SAF industry grows, so our 2030 emissions guidance could be updated to reflect any upside as well,"" she said.

Air New Zealand's expected reduction is a net total, meaning it can include buying carbon offsets such as those from tree planting projects, as well as actual emissions reductions. However the guidance said that only a small volume of ""high quality"" offsets will be used, as well an unspecified extra number of credits the airline has to buy as a member of CORSIA.

CORSIA is a UN-backed scheme where airlines support initiatives such as solar grid installations and reforestation projects to offset some of their climate impact.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--3jrmxDNd--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1720674362/4KN78J0_AIRNZ_787_9_In_Flight_exterior_2014_20_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-04-30 21:57:58.005465

The skies above East Asia are witnessing a quiet revolution. In April 2025, Taiwan launched a nationwide trial of sustainable aviation fuel, signaling a strategic commitment to decarbonize air travel. This development marks not just an environmental milestone but also a blueprint for how regional economies can influence global trends.

Rather than treat this SAF initiative as a symbolic gesture, Taiwan’s aviation ecosystem has embedded it into core infrastructure. With 400 tons imported by CPC Corporation and a remarkable 5,500 tons produced domestically by Formosa Petrochemical using recycled cooking oil, this dual-pronged approach exemplifies energy pragmatism paired with innovation.

A Pragmatic Start to a Long-Term Vision

Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration has projected a reduction of approximately 15,000 tons in carbon emissions for 2025 as a direct result of this SAF implementation. These figures, while modest at a global scale, provide critical momentum. More importantly, they signal to domestic carriers and international observers that sustainability in aviation is no longer aspirational — it is executable.

By blending sustainable fuel with conventional jet fuel and deploying it on commercial flights, Taiwan’s top airlines have not only participated but also validated the operational feasibility of SAF integration. It is a strategic, low-risk entry point that builds confidence across the value chain — from refineries to runways.

Local Innovation With Global Implications

Formosa Petrochemical’s use of recycled cooking oil in SAF production does more than reduce waste. It represents an inventive fusion of bioeconomy and energy resilience. This move aligns Taiwan with emerging global standards, where circular economy models and alternative feedstocks are becoming central to decarbonization roadmaps.

Such efforts illustrate how sustainable fuel development is evolving beyond resource extraction. Instead, it draws from existing waste streams — a pivot that many nations, particularly resource-constrained economies, can learn from.

Building a Regional Center for Green Aviation

Taiwan’s early adoption strategy is already casting ripples across the Asia-Pacific region. The government’s proposal to enforce a 5 percent SAF blend mandate by 2030 is more than regulatory foresight — it is a market signal. This signal could encourage neighboring countries to align their aviation policies accordingly, potentially positioning Taiwan as a hub for SAF innovation, distribution, and expertise.

In a region where air connectivity is critical to trade, tourism, and geopolitical relevance, such positioning could hold both economic and strategic value.

Beyond Carbon: The Broader Impacts of SAF

While the primary narrative around SAF focuses on emissions reductions, its downstream implications are equally noteworthy. Energy independence, particularly in a geopolitically sensitive region, stands to gain. Local production reduces reliance on volatile fuel imports and enhances supply chain resilience.

Moreover, the SAF rollout fosters cross-sector collaboration — from petrochemicals to agriculture to waste management. Each of these linkages becomes an avenue for knowledge transfer, policy alignment, and industrial modernization.

Insights for the Global Sustainable Transport Community

The aviation industry is at a crossroads. As global regulatory and market forces converge toward carbon accountability, the pathway forged by Taiwan offers a template rooted in pragmatism, technological adaptation, and policy ambition.

What makes Taiwan’s strategy particularly compelling is its subtle balance: achieving demonstrable impact without disruption. This resonates with how transport-sector sustainability initiatives can be embedded within existing systems — incrementally yet decisively.

A Glimpse Into the Future of Biofuel Economics

The biofuel sector is experiencing a renaissance. As demonstrated by Formosa Petrochemical, turning waste into energy is no longer a speculative concept but a commercial reality. This breakthrough opens up new investment corridors, especially in feedstock innovation and refinery scalability.

For emerging biofuel markets, Taiwan’s approach showcases how pilot programs can scale into national frameworks. It also underlines the importance of domestic production, not just for sustainability targets but for economic self-determination.

How the Renewable Energy Sector is Responding

SAF deployment directly intersects with the broader renewable energy transition. It not only redefines what qualifies as “green energy” but also introduces new metrics of success — carbon intensity per passenger kilometer, for instance.

This convergence prompts energy ministries and private players alike to recalibrate their roles. Renewable energy, in this light, expands beyond solar and wind. It now encompasses bio-based aviation fuels that require integrated policy thinking and cross-sector cooperation.

Conclusion: A Model in the Making

Taiwan’s SAF rollout is more than an isolated policy initiative — it is an emerging model for sustainable aviation. Through modest but targeted interventions, it has achieved measurable environmental outcomes, spurred domestic innovation, and laid the groundwork for regional leadership.

For professionals in the sustainability and transport sectors, this initiative offers valuable lessons: start small, align local capabilities, and prioritize pragmatic implementation over theoretical ambition.

This facility, which is being developed by Solarig and will be located in Teruel, will be one of the most innovative Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production plants in the world.

Turboleta SAF’ will have an annual production capacity of 105,000 tons of sustainable fuel and an estimated investment of more than 1.2 billion euros. The facility, located in Teruel, will create more than 1,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction, and more than 180 direct and indirect jobs during operation. Construction is scheduled to start in 2028.

The recognition of the Aragonese Executive also includes a renewable complex for self-consumption of the installation of more than 550 MW and six biomethane plants developed in Aragon by Biorig, Solarig’s renewable gases subsidiary.

Solarig has submitted the ‘Turboleta SAF’ project to the European Commission’s Innovation Fund, which aims to finance projects to accelerate the energy transition in Europe. This project will allow the decarbonization of more than 400,000 tons of CO2 per year.

The Government of Aragon has announced that the ‘Turboleta SAF’ project, one of the most innovative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plants in the world, has been declared an investment of regional and general interest in Aragon (DIGA). Thanks to the granting of this figure, which is awarded to those facilities and projects with a relevant impact on the economic, technological, social or environmental development of Aragon, the positive impact on Aragonese society of ‘Turboleta SAF’ is recognized.

The ‘Turboleta SAF’ plant, developed by Solarig, will be located in the “Platea” industrial park in Teruel and will have a production capacity of around 105,000 tons of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) per year, which is equivalent to almost 45,000 flights between Zaragoza and London (considering a 50% SAF blend). The plant, which will cover an area of approximately 12 hectares, is expected to start construction in 2028. In addition, the Government of Aragon has included within this recognition the six biomethane facilities currently being developed in the Aragonese community by Biorig, Solarig’s renewable gases subsidiary. These infrastructures will use agricultural and livestock waste from the regions where they will be installed to produce more than 700 GWh of biomethane per year and more than 100,000 tons of biogenic CO2.

With a total estimated investment of more than 1,200 million euros, ‘Turboleta SAF’ will incorporate dedicated renewable assets with direct connection to the industrial plant: a photovoltaic solar farm (350 MW), a wind farm (209 MW), a battery storage system and an electrolyzer for the production of renewable hydrogen of more than 130 MW. In addition, this facility will take advantage of the biomethane and biogenic CO2 production of the facilities developed by Biorig as key raw materials for the synthesis of SAF.

As part of the financial consolidation of the project, Solarig has submitted ‘Turboleta SAF’ to the European Commission’s “Innovation Fund” program, which aims to finance projects to accelerate the energy transition in Europe. The company thus seeks to contribute to European objectives in the fight against global warming.

In addition to having a positive impact in environmental terms, this plant will promote the creation of some 1,200 direct and indirect skilled jobs: 1,000 during the construction phase and more than 180 during operation, favoring local development and the use of existing infrastructures.

The users of nearby infrastructures such as the airports of Teruel and Zaragoza will benefit from this new facility by having a sustainable local fuel production. The SAF is an essential element to decarbonize the aviation sector (responsible for about 14% of global CO2 emissions attributable to transport). This project will allow the decarbonization of more than 400 thousand tons of CO2 per year. Turboleta SAF’ has recently concluded the consultation period prior to the Environmental Impact Statement carried out by the Ministry for Ecological Transition and Demographic Challenge (MITECO).

Solarig will continue to work hand in hand with the main agents of Teruel, and will intensify its informative work and active listening in order to carry out a sustainable project, fully integrated in society and collaborating with the public administrations and relevant agents of the regions to converge in the best environmental and social solutions and contribute to the socioeconomic strengthening of the regions participating in this project.

Low-emissions aviation fuel is available now and is critical to reducing aviation emissions, but existing supply will not grow if suppliers cannot connect with customers.

With philanthropic support, RMI and partners launched a system for accounting for sustainable fuel and a buyers alliance to bridge the gap between buyers and suppliers.

This type of partnership allows new low-carbon products like sustainable aviation fuel to achieve economies of scale and compete with traditional, emissions-intensive counterparts.

Air travel accounts for nearly 2.5 percent of today’s global carbon emissions, and the main culprit is the fossil fuel used to power aircraft.

Innovative fuel suppliers have demonstrated that sustainable aviation fuel made from waste can safely power today’s aircraft. So why hasn’t the switch happened yet?

Even with exciting advancements in battery- and hydrogen-powered aircraft, today’s planes — and a large portion of the future aircraft fleet — are dependent on burning liquid fuels. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), often in the form of biofuel (fuel derived from biological sources, like inedible waste cooking oil), can be used in today’s aircraft and has the potential to reduce the carbon intensity of flying by more than 80 percent. However, due to insufficient supply, cost barriers, and difficulty predicting demand, SAF currently represents less than 0.1 percent of the aviation fuel burned globally.

Shifting to these new methods is challenging and expensive. Making changes affects a large, well-established system. That’s where RMI comes in. The organization was made to tackle difficult, systems-level challenges, and aviation is a leading example where we are uniting corporate partners to support such a change.

Sustainable aviation’s chicken-and-egg problem

Like other green products, SAF faces a chicken-and-egg paradox. Producing sustainable aviation fuel requires a significant up-front investment and relies on supply chains that are not yet efficient or well-coordinated, which forces suppliers to charge higher prices than fossil-derived jet fuel. Unsurprisingly, this makes it harder for SAF to compete with traditional fuels.

Many companies have committed to reducing their organization’s emissions from air travel, but few options exist. High costs and low availability mean that they can’t launch their own flights fueled with SAF. For suppliers, scattered demand from individual companies does not justify ramping up production.

That’s where RMI and strategic philanthropy are stepping in. With our experience in clean energy buyers alliances, RMI understands the power of aggregating demand.

The solution: an alliance of aviation customers

Nearly every company that moves people or products contributes to emissions from flying, and many of these companies also have sustainability goals that include reducing these emissions. Some had expressed to RMI and our partners that they needed a way to reduce emissions from their air travel. RMI and our partners at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) reached out to these businesses with a bold idea: join forces to spur a market for sustainable fuels and show suppliers that there is a real demand. EDF, the Center for Green Market Activation, and RMI, with support from ENGIE Impact, brought together nine founding companies to form the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA). Our goal: help bridge the gap between suppliers and customers and show the market that demand for SAF exists. Nine companies made initial philanthropic grants that allowed RMI to build the digital infrastructure required for scale, such as SAF sustainability procurement guidance and a credible registry to account for and track claims of emissions reductions. Philanthropic funding allowed RMI to bring independent diligence and credibility to the process and build a system that can sustain itself through memberships. SABA was able to use this infrastructure to support many of the original nine companies with the first aggregate purchase of SAF certificates.

The SAF certificate framework accounts for and tracks the emissions reduction from sustainable fuels. This allows an emissions-minded buyer anywhere in the world to purchase the certificate for emissions reduction, while the actual fuel can be delivered where it is most practical to use. While not yet codified into greenhouse gas accounting rules, RMI believes purchasing SAF certificates will allow a company to claim credible emissions reductions from reduction activities taken within the aviation value chain.

In this way, even though the companies purchasing SAF certificates don’t directly buy the fuel or send their cargo on flights that use specific volumes of SAF, their purchase reduces emissions in the aviation system and contributes to the market for further SAF development. This type of partnership is what allows low-carbon products like SAF to compete with traditional, emissions-intensive counterparts.

Today, SABA is supported by membership fees, has recently completed the largest aggregated SAF certificate transactions to date, and is working to develop more impactful procurement options for members. Philanthropy made this happen. By leveraging donor support, we removed early uncertainty from the system and allowed RMI to build the business case for a self-sustaining market.

Aviation charts the flight path to the future

Aviation’s success can illuminate pathways to reducing emissions for other heavy industries like shipping, trucking, and steel. Building on this work, RMI helped develop the registry used by the Zero-Emissions Maritime Buyers Alliance, and we are building new coalitions that include the Sustainable Steel Buyers Platform and ZEROGrid, a coalition focusing on clean energy to support grid reliability. A collaboration to advance sustainable cement and concrete will be forthcoming. In all these sectors, we will continue to organize corporate action as a critical headwind for cleaner products and energy.

These market signals are just the beginning for these ambitious buyers’ platforms, and more purchase agreements are planned in the coming months. Demand aggregating organizations like SABA will continue to bring together buyers as markets mature, scaling the demand signal needed to spur growth in the supply of lower-carbon products, and making lower-carbon products comparable in cost to traditional products. At RMI, we know that change can’t happen alone, but even the heaviest lift can be achieved when we band together.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airplane-iStock-1526986072.jpg,N,,2025-04-30 19:57:03.785889

OMV is producing green hydrogen on a commercial scale for the first time. The Vienna-based fossil fuel and petrochemicals producer started up a 10 MW plant at its Schwechat refinery near Austria’s capital. It is the largest in the country.

The investment amounts to EUR 25 million. The electrolyzer system can produce up to 1,500 tons per annum. OMV said the green hydrogen would be used to make more sustainable fuels and chemicals including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (HVO).

PEM electrolyzer uses wind power, hydropower, photovoltaics

The new 10 MW polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM, also called proton exchange membrane) electrolyzer is powered entirely by renewable electricity. It is generated by wind power, hydropower plants and photovoltaics.

The innovation enables annual savings of up to 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the comparator from the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive. It is equivalent to 2,000 persons per year, based on the EU’s 2024 average of 7.5 tons of CO2 equivalent per capita.

“With the start-up of Austria’s largest electrolysis plant, we are re-inventing how essentials we use in everyday life are produced sustainably. Green hydrogen is at the heart of this transformation, serving as a critical component in producing fuels and chemicals while advancing the decarbonization of our Schwechat site,” said board member Martijn van Koten, responsible for fuels, feedstock and chemicals.

Green hydrogen project is step toward making OMV carbon neutral

The majority owner of Romanian OMV Petrom aims to cut its net emissions to zero by 2050. Its transformation is based on projects including for geothermal energy and chemical recycling. Green hydrogen can be utilized in the production process in refineries.

The green hydrogen plant is certified for producing renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs).

Subsidies have to be redirected into renewable energy,” said Yvonne Moynihan, corporate & ESG officer at Wizz Air.
In the EU, fossil fuel subsidies come primarily from national budgets but are also supported by EU-level funds, particularly for energy infrastructure.
The EU has previously said that most fossil fuel subsidies are due to be phased out by 2030.
The EU did not respond to Skift's request for comment on fossil fuel subsidies.","Wizz Air has warned that aviation is not moving fast enough on climate change and called for “radical change” to keep net zero goals on track.

The low-cost airline called for governments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies and redirect the money into greener jet fuels, which are seen as the key solution to reduce emissions in aviation.

The Hungarian carrier, which flew over 60 million passengers in 2024, recently launched its own roadmap to reach net zero by 2050.

“Radical change needs to happen. Subsidies have to be redirected into renewable energy,” said Yvonne Moynihan, corporate & ESG officer at Wizz Air.

Moynihan told Skift that some airlines have included hydrogen in their roadmaps, but that Wizz Air excluded it and instead focuses on ""realistic levers.”

“We understand that the most realistic decarbonization levers are ones that we already have, which are improvements in current aircraft and engine technology and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“We need to kick start the production of SAF, this is the best chance for airlines to decarbonize.”

California SAF Investment

Moynihan pointed to California as an example of how government incentives can rapidly grow the SAF market.

She said despite recent political setbacks in U.S. federal climate policy, California has tried to incentivize the production of SAF with tax breaks.

“In spite of the current political environment, 90% of the world's SAF is being produced in California and that is because the government introduced tax incentives and tax breaks. This is the type of mechanism or instrument that's needed to really stimulate further supply. The demand is there, so really the issue is the supply,” Moynihan said.

Paying For Emissions

Wizz Air said it supports the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), which is partly designed to raise funds to support decarbonization of sectors such as aviation.

But Moynihan said the system needs to be reformed because it unfairly penalizes short-haul airlines.

A recent report from Transport & Environment highlighted that low-cost carriers are paying more into the fund than long-haul airlines, as the ETS rules do not apply to international flights.

“Short-haul airlines are, in effect, subsidising the longer-haul carriers,” Moynihan said. “Those airlines have higher profit margins and emit more — yet they’re not subject to the same carbon costs.”

She added that Wizz has raised this issue multiple times with the European Commission, and called for the ETS to be extended to flights departing the EU to create a “level playing field.”

Fossil Fuel Subsidies in Europe

Wizz Air’s call to redirect subsidies comes amid growing pressure on European governments to phase out public support for fossil fuels.

In the EU, fossil fuel subsidies come primarily from national budgets but are also supported by EU-level funds, particularly for energy infrastructure.

The EU has previously said that most fossil fuel subsidies are due to be phased out by 2030.

According to Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, only 6 of the EU’s 27 member states have even stated an intention to fully eliminate fossil fuel subsidies - and none have set clear deadlines.

The EU did not respond to Skift's request for comment on fossil fuel subsidies.

EarthOptics GO1 – Turning Soil into Seed Intelligence

EarthOptics is transforming how the seed industry sees soil. By combining high-resolution mapping with biological and chemical insights, the company delivers powerful data that drives more informed decisions — before the seed ever hits the ground.

“Our mission from the beginning has been simple,” EarthOptics CEO Lars Dyrud says. “We want to measure everything of relevance in the soil — and give farmers and seed partners the intelligence they need to make the best decisions possible.”

With precise data on compaction, fertility, carbon, and soil biology, EarthOptics enables seed companies and agronomists to build smarter prescriptions and protect genetic potential with confidence.

“These are all questions farmers are making every year, but oftentimes they’re making their best guess,” chief product officer Cam Norgate says. “Now we can actually know.”

Following EarthOptics’ 2024 merger with Pattern Ag, the company now offers a full-stack platform—from physical and chemical measurements to DNA-based biological insights. This includes support for seed trials, trait validation, and product placement decisions at the field level.

“There’s a huge opportunity to understand how biological products can help boost yield potential,” Norgate says. “We help dealers identify what the opportunity is in the field—and make sure they get it onto the seed and into the ground.”

With demand for sustainable solutions and smarter ROI growing across agriculture, EarthOptics is helping the seed industry turn what’s beneath the soil into a strategic advantage.

“We’ve built a better way to plan a crop,” Dyrud says. “Now we’re focused on getting that power into more hands.”

Intelinair SeedTrax™ – Precision Built for Seed Corn Production

Seed corn isn’t just another crop — and SeedTrax isn’t just another digital platform. Developed through a powerful partnership between Hubner Industries and Intelinair, SeedTrax is the first digital tool purpose-built to handle the complexity, precision and scale of seed corn production.

While most ag tech is built for commercial grain, SeedTrax addresses the unique demands of seed production: tracking multiple hybrids in a single field, managing stand counts, detasseling, silking, rogueing, and scouting — all with traceability and actionable data.

“We were tired of always having to manipulate a tool that wasn’t built for what we do,” says Doug Hubner, CEO of Hubner Industries. “SeedTrax is changing that. It allows our field scouts and leadership team to see every acre in real time — with better intelligence and better results.”

The platform improves labor efficiency, enables smarter agronomic decisions, and generates more reliable supply estimates. Backed by aerial imagery, AI-driven insights, and real-time field data, SeedTrax helps experienced seed professionals manage more acres and mentor new scouts more effectively.

Pheno-Inspect AI in the Field to Transform Crop Monitoring

When Philipp Lottes founded Pheno-Inspect in early 2020, his vision was clear: bring advanced image-based AI technology out of the lab and directly into the hands of agricultural professionals. Drawing from his roots in agricultural robotics at the University of Bonn, Lottes saw a pressing need for scalable, practical tools that could serve real-world crop production and plant science.

Pheno-Inspect’s flagship platform, Plant-Analyzer, exemplifies this vision. It seamlessly integrates image data from a variety of sources — smartphones, drones, even satellites — to provide consistent, high-resolution insights across all stages of production. Whether it’s a small plot trial or a vast commercial field, the platform adapts to deliver meaningful, hardware-independent analysis.

At the heart of Pheno-Inspect’s approach is the fusion of artificial intelligence with deep agronomic expertise. “AI alone doesn’t create value — domain knowledge does,” Lottes emphasizes. His team builds AI models specifically designed for plant breeding and crop production, focusing on extracting economically relevant traits with high reliability and efficiency.

A major milestone came through their participation in the “RegisTer” project, which automated sugar beet variety evaluations. This initiative not only proved the feasibility of sub-millimeter trait detection under field conditions but also validated the use of affordable drone platforms. The success has since extended to a broader range of crops and continues to shape the company’s innovations.

Looking ahead, Lottes acknowledges that technology adoption hinges not only on performance but also on user trust and simplicity. “The true challenge is behavioral,” he notes. “That’s why we focus on intuitive, reliable tools that truly deliver.” As drone technology becomes more accessible, Pheno-Inspect aims to empower users across the globe to harness the full potential of AI-driven crop monitoring.

seedalive – Revolutionizing Seed Viability Testing Across Europe and Beyond

In the heart of Osnabrück, Germany, a groundbreaking innovation is transforming the way seed viability is measured. seedalive, founded by Klaus Mummenhoff and his former student, biologist Jens Varnskühler, is on a mission to make seed testing faster, simpler, and more reliable — empowering plant breeders, farmers, traders, and maltsters across Europe and beyond.

Traditionally, testing seeds for viability and quality has been a slow, resource-intensive process — often taking days or even weeks. seedalive changes that. With its patented, AI-powered test kits, seedalive delivers results in just hours. The dynamic bioassay not only predicts standard germination rates but also identifies abnormalities, dormancy, dead seeds, and germination speed — all while referencing data collected according to ISTA and AOSA standards.

And it’s not just about speed. The system is designed for modern agricultural realities: all it takes is a charged laptop and an internet connection. Whether on a remote farm or in a high-tech lab, seedalive’s cloud-based platform ensures fast, accurate, and reproducible results. For the malting industry, the platform offers equally transformative capabilities — assessing germination energy and water sensitivity of barley and wheat in as little as three hours.

seedalive’s technology is not just a tool — it’s a shift in paradigm. By significantly reducing the time and energy required for seed testing, it supports more sustainable agricultural practices and better decision-making across the value chain.

As the company grows, its vision remains clear: to become the new global gold standard in seed viability testing. With an energetic team and ongoing research collaborations, seedalive is not just keeping pace with the industry — it’s setting the pace.

ZeaKal PhotoSeed™ – Boosting Yield and Quality While Reducing Carbon Intensity

In an industry chasing more with less, ZeaKal’s PhotoSeed™ technology is giving crops a new kind of superpower: the ability to sustain photosynthesis longer, leading to bigger gains in oil, protein, and productivity — all without additional land or inputs.

“We confuse the plant into thinking it’s starving,” ZeaKal co-founder and CEO Han Chen says. “It’s the anti-Ozempic of plants.” That trick keeps plants working harder and longer to convert sunlight into energy, improving performance and sustainability.

ZeaKal’s trait technology, has roots in a surprising place — a napkin sketch in New Zealand. What began as an effort to improve pasture grass grew into something much bigger.

In soybeans, PhotoSeed reverses declining protein levels while increasing oil by up to 15%. In corn, it’s showing as much as 23% more oil. That’s a game-changer for renewable energy, particularly sustainable aviation fuel. Independent analysis suggests PhotoSeed could enable an extra billion gallons of U.S. SAF annually — without expanding farmland.

But ZeaKal’s ambitions go beyond yield. With its “NewType” model, the company hopes to rebuild supply chains around value instead of volume, helping farmers become price makers, not price takers.

“I want growers to say, ‘I know where my crop ends up. I know I’m feeding people better. I know I’m part of the energy transition,’” says Chen.

With PhotoSeed reaching growers in 2026, ZeaKal is betting on a future where innovation fuels not just crops — but a better food, fuel, and climate future. Watch for a more comprehensive feature about ZeaKal in Seed World U.S. June issue.

ZoomAgri Transforms Grain Quality Inspection with AI-Driven Innovation

ZoomAgri is revolutionizing the agricultural landscape with its innovative software that rapidly identifies soybean, wheat, and barley varieties in just two minutes. By utilizing cutting-edge Computer Vision and AI technology, this solution delivers precise results at a fraction of the cost.

In addition to variety identification, the software excels in assessing the percentage of damaged, broken, or peeled grains while also detecting foreign materials — each critical for ensuring quality in the supply chain.

ZoomAgri’s mission is to digitize the antiquated testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) processes that burden the agricultural and food industries through its unique “vision-as-a-service” (VaaS) model.

Since the launch of its flagship product, ZoomBarley, in 2018 — which evaluates malting barley purity in real-time — the technology has gained significant traction on a global scale. Building on this success, ZoomAgri introduced ZoomAgriSpex, a tool designed to evaluate the physical quality of grains and oilseeds in real-time. This feature addresses common issues within the industry, such as classification errors, delays, and inflated costs, making high-quality inspections much more efficient and reliable.

The implications of this groundbreaking technology extend beyond mere convenience — by streamlining quality assessments, ZoomAgri empowers stakeholders throughout the supply chain to optimize resource allocation and minimize waste. This translates into more efficient distribution processes, better use of transport and land, and ultimately, a more sustainable agricultural system.

In an industry where every grain counts, ZoomAgri is not just improving how we assess quality; it’s setting a new standard for efficiency and effectiveness in agricultural practice.

Operated by its affiliate, BSGF Company Limited, the facility is the country’s first to produce 100% Neat SAF, and it adheres to international sustainability certification standards, reported Bangkok Post.

Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, described the unit as Thailand’s first fully integrated standalone SAF production facility. It manages the entire supply chain—from sourcing raw materials to fuel distribution—under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) framework. The plant has an initial production capacity of 1 million litres per day and uses Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology to convert materials such as used cooking oil into aviation-grade fuel.

The SAF production process was developed in partnership with two international technology providers: Belgium’s Desmet, known for feedstock pretreatment, and U.S.-based UOP Honeywell, a leader in hydroprocessing systems. This ensures consistent quality from raw material handling through hydrogenation and molecular refining to final product output. In addition to SAF, the plant also produces by-products like Bio-LPG and Bio-Naphtha and is currently undergoing performance testing.

According to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), aviation contributes about 492 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, despite making up just 2.9% of global energy use. SAF can cut these emissions by up to 80%, making it one of the most promising solutions for reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Several regions, including the EU, UK, and Singapore, have already announced SAF blending targets, and Thailand is evaluating a similar mandate.

In addition to cutting carbon emissions, SAF also contributes to cleaner air. It has very low levels of sulphur and aromatic compounds—elements that contribute to health hazards and pollution—making it a more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional jet fuel.

Bangchak has been active in renewable energy for over two decades. The company’s efforts began in 2000 with a biodiesel project in partnership with the Royal Thai Naval Dockyard.

Repsol said it expects its five Spanish refineries to return to normal operations within a week following the nationwide power outage on Monday, 28 April.

The company confirmed that power was restored to all its refineries on Monday evening, allowing the restart process to begin. It will take three days to restart the crude distillation units and 5-7 days to restart secondary conversion units, with hydrocrackers taking the longest, according to chief executive Josu Jon Imaz.

A momentary and unexplained drop in power supply on the Spanish electricity grid caused power cuts across most of Spain and Portugal, disrupting petrochemical plants and airports, as well as refineries.

Imaz noted that Repsol was fortunate that its refineries avoided damage from petroleum coke formation and other solidification processes during the shutdown. Repsol's 220,000 b/d Petronor refinery in Bilbao was the first to restart, thanks to electricity imports from France, he said.

Petroleum reserves corporation Cores has temporarily reduced Spain's obligation to hold 92 days of oil product consumption as strategic reserves by four days, mitigating potential supply issues from the outage.

Repsol's refining margin indicator, a benchmark based on European crack spreads weighted to the firm's product basket, has been recovering this week and stood at $7.5/bl this morning, compared with an average of $4.2/bl in April and $5.3/bl in the first quarter, according to Imaz.

The company posted a 70¢/bl premium to the indicator in January-March on refinery optimisation and use of heavier and cheaper crudes. This was lower than the $1.20/bl premium it reported in 2024 and negatively affected by the high water content in first-quarter deliveries of heavy Mexican Maya, a staple for Repsol's more complex refineries.

The high water cut in the Maya receipts shaved a potential 50¢/bl from Repsol's refining margin premium in the first quarter, and operational issues at the company's Tarragona refinery a further 20¢/bl, according to Imaz.

Repsol has already completed the three major refinery maintenance projects for 2025 it flagged at its Bilbao, Tarragona and Puertollano refineries. Work on the three refineries in the first quarter cut about 40¢/bl from the firm's refining margin.

The three factors point to a combined $1.10/bl shortfall in the firm's refining margin in the first quarter and were one of the reasons for the 80pc fall in adjusted profit at Repsol's refining-focused industrial division to €131mn ($149mn) in January-March from a year earlier and the 62pc fall in group profit to €366mn.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-04-30 14:56:34.353193

Travelers are also increasingly seeking sustainable practices and expect hotels to pay more than lip service to environmental factors.
The tourism sector now accounts for 9% of global emissions.
By 2030 the EU will require that fuel producers have 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in their fuel by 2030.
It’s clear that sustainable travel isn’t a passing trend, it is a growing societal norm.","“Tourism has long been seen as a way to escape, explore, and connect with the world,” Xavier Font, professor of sustainability marketing at the University of Surrey, told me in an interview. “But there’s a growing contradiction at its core: while travelers marvel at pristine coastlines, ancient glaciers, and untouched wilderness, the very act of traveling is helping to destroy those same wonders. The industry is responsible for nearly 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with accommodation alone accounting for more than 6%.”

Font stresses this isn’t a side issue but one that’s “central to the climate crisis.”

And yet, he adds, “the tourism sector continues to act like sustainability is a nice-to-have rather than a non-negotiable. It’s not enough to install energy-efficient lightbulbs or ask guests to reuse towels. These gestures, while helpful, are superficial without meaningful behavioral engagement from travelers themselves. Many guests unknowingly undermine green initiatives—leaving lights on, wasting water, or ignoring recycling bins—not because they don’t care, but because the messaging isn’t connecting.”

Behavioral science—and some significant nudging—can move the needle. Font and colleagues have conducted research in partnership with Booking.com and the hospitality company Accor to shed light on how accommodation providers can shift attitudes.

“[Our] study shows that smart, psychologically grounded messaging can influence guests to adopt more sustainable habits,” says Font. “Emotionally resonant communication that explains why sustainability matters, and how guests can play a role, is far more effective than vague instructions or guilt-laden commands.”

According to separate research from Booking.com, 28% of travelers feel traveling more sustainably is important, but an equal number report they are tired of routinely hearing about climate change.

“People are eager to be part of the solution. They need to be spoken to like adults, not lectured like children. Empowerment works. Transparency builds trust. Drawing parallels with what people already do at home can make sustainable choices feel second nature, not like a sacrifice,"" Font says.

“If the tourism industry wants to survive the coming decades—not just environmentally, but reputationally—it must stop treating sustainability as an afterthought,” concludes Font. “This is a moment to lead, not lag. Guests are ready. It’s time the [tourism]

industry caught up.”

Regulations Bolster Sustainable Travel Options

Most industries, organizations, and investors are committing to sustainability because it can generate significant cost savings and lead to a greater longer-term valuation of assets.

Travelers are also increasingly seeking sustainable practices and expect hotels to pay more than lip service to environmental factors. Tiny shampoo bottles are no longer seen as cute freebies by many travelers but as profligate waste when refillable larger containers make more environmental sense.

When planning trips, more and more travelers prioritize ESG factors. A recent Virtuoso survey found that nearly 60% of tourists are willing to pay more for hotels that have sustainability goals.

Between 20o9 and 2020 the carbon emissions from tourism increased by 3.5% compared to 1.5% for the rest of the global economy, a new study has found. Major contributors include aviation, utilities, and private motor vehicles. The tourism sector now accounts for 9% of global emissions.

The study, led by researchers at the University of Queensland and published by Nature Communications, attributed 60% of the increase in emissions to India, the U.S. and China. Key factors in the growth of emissions include population growth, rising income levels, and a surge in travel demand among emerging economies.

If the top 20 highest-emitting destinations had curbed their tourism growth by just 1% annually, an estimated 7% of global tourism-related emissions could have been avoided, said the study, led by University of Queensland professor Ya-Yen Sun.

The study highlights the urgent need for interventions in the tourism sector, cautioning that without action, emissions are projected to double every 20 years. In conclusion, the study’s authors called for immediate measures to decarbonize tourism and urges policymakers and industry leaders to align with climate targets.

Overall, the travel industry’s impact on the environment is coming under closer scrutiny from regulators. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, for example, will become mandatory for most international flights by 2027. By 2030 the EU will require that fuel producers have 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel in their fuel by 2030.

FLOREAT, WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA, April 30, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- 42kft.com (42 Thousand Feet), the leading global airline rankings platform, has unveiled its Top 25 Environmentally Focused Airlines, selected from the 142 airlines currently under its rigorous evaluation framework.

The list, presented in alphabetical order, includes:

Aegean Airlines, AeroMexico, Air Arabia, AirAsia Group, Air Baltic, Air New Zealand, Alaska Airlines, Alaskan Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, China Southern, EasyJet, Emirates, Etihad Airways, EVA Air, HK Express, IndiGo, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Ryanair, SAS Scandinavian, Singapore Airlines Group, VietJet, Virgin Atlantic/Virgin Australia, and Wizz.

Unlike other rankings based on pledges and aspirational targets, 42kft.com’s unique methodology prioritizes tangible progress, including fleet renewal, adoption of sustainable technologies, and verifiable environmental programs. Pledges such as “Net Zero by 2050” are considered baseline expectations—not distinguishing factors.

“With these rankings, we’re honouring real, measurable commitments to reducing carbon emissions,” said Geoffrey Thomas, founder of 42kft.com and a globally respected aviation journalist.

“We also acknowledge that government inaction in certain regions slows airlines' sustainability efforts. Our methodology is designed to highlight those pushing forward regardless.”

Thomas, who has written extensively on aviation’s environmental impact and co-authored three books on the topic, noted that fleet age is a critical ranking factor. However, global aircraft delivery delays—due to post-COVID supply chain issues and certification hold-ups—are affecting airlines’ ability to modernize.

“Take the Boeing 777-9, for example. Originally due in 2020, it's now pushed back to 2026 due to a combination of certification delays and supply shortages,” Thomas added.

About the Environmental Ranking System

42kft.com’s evaluation is based on nine key criteria:

Fleet age

Firm orders for fleet renewal

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Recycling initiatives

Adoption of technological innovations

Verified carbon offset programs

Annual environmental impact reporting

IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) compliance

Investment in electric and hybrid aircraft technologies

The platform currently covers airlines representing approximately 80% of global air passenger traffic, with new airlines being added monthly to ensure ongoing relevance and coverage.

The Austrian oil and gas company said it invested €25 million ($28.41 million) in the facility, which can produce up to 1,500 metric tons of green hydrogen per year. The green hydrogen will be used to produce fuels and chemicals, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel (HVO). The installation, which uses a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, runs entirely on renewable electricity from wind, hydro, and solar sources.

TU Graz has inaugurated a hydrogen electrolysis test center at its Inffeldgasse Campus to develop and test hydrogen technologies. The university said the 250-square-meter facility houses electrolyzers with a total capacity of 1.6 MW to 2.5 MW and includes a dedicated transformer station to ensure stable power supply, allowing researchers to simulate various electricity scenarios. At 80 bar of pressure, hydrogen flows through a pipeline to an 18-meter-high storage tank with a 190 kg (48m³) capacity. From there, it travels via a 315-meter underground pipeline to several institutes at Campus Inffeldgasse, where it is available around the clock for research. TU Graz said researchers will use the hydrogen on new and upgraded test rigs for next-generation large engines, turbines, hydrogen burners, and fuel cell stacks.

Wärtsilä said it has completed the development of the world’s first floating ammonia-to-hydrogen cracker in partnership with Höegh Evi. “This breakthrough technology enables floating import terminals to produce hydrogen at industrial-scale volumes from transported ammonia, marking a major step in the energy transition,” said the Finnish technology group. The industrial-scale ammonia cracker has a modular design that makes it compatible with hybrid floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs) and dedicated floating hydrogen terminals. It said the technology is highly scalable, with a send-out capacity of up to 210,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually. Ammonia storage can range from 10,000m³ to 120,000m³.

BMW has launched pilot operations of its first hydrogen trucks at Plant Leipzig under the European H2Haul project, working with Iveco, DHL, and TEAL mobility. The German automaker said the trucks will operate in Germany between Leipzig, Landsberg, and Nuremberg to assess drive performance in daily use, while new hydrogen refueling stations are being built in Leipzig and Hormersdorf.

With the UK’s SAF Mandate now in force - prescribing blending obligations from 2025 onwards - this article analyses the Mandate’s primary features, its interactions with other decarbonisation measures, and its relationship to emerging revenue support mechanisms. Our team examines the strategic role of SAF in the energy transition, assesses the challenges of scaling and enhancing investment in advanced fuels, and compares international regulatory divergences between the UK’s measures and SAF policies announced by other governments around the world. Through this, we situate the UK’s SAF Mandate not as an isolated intervention, but as a critical component of global energy transition and investment policies

Introduction: SAFs’ Strategic Role

Use of aviation fuel is estimated to be responsible for 2‑3% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions1. Forecast increase in worldwide aviation travel, with some analysts predicting passenger numbers will double between 2024 and 20422, will further amplify the aviation sector's carbon footprint. The aviation sector is, however, difficult to decarbonise: current flight technology does not permit electrification of aircraft, nor are carbon-neutral fuels such as green hydrogen capable of use by current aircraft (or indeed realistically capable of use at scale given the immense challenges of those fuels).

The implications of these limitations are profound. SAF is not merely a transitional solution; it is, for the foreseeable future, the only technically viable decarbonisation pathway for long-haul aviation. Unlike hydrogen or electrification-both of which face formidable challenges in energy density, infrastructure readiness, and aircraft compatibility-SAF can be deployed immediately within existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. When combined with SAF’s lifecycle emissions reduction potential of up to 80% (as against fossil-based aviation turbine fuel), this compatibility underscores SAF’s criticality, not only as a climate measure, but as a strategic enabler of the aviation sector’s net zero trajectory. That SAF alone can decarbonise intercontinental routes with minimal operational disruption explains why it commands such prominence in policy design, investment prioritisation, and corporate transition strategies across jurisdictions.

Current SAF Production and Estimated Future Demand

Since the inaugural SAF-powered flight in 2008, and first use of SAF on a commercial aircraft in 2011, SAF demand has experienced consistent growth, with approximately 500,000 flights having operated on fuel mixtures containing SAF to date. Although SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of total aviation fuel consumption, usage doubled in 2023 to over 600 million litres. Industry projections now foresee a sustained acceleration in SAF production, with output in 2025 anticipated to surpass 2.7 billion litres - more than double the actual 2024 figure of 1.3 billion litres - and underscoring the sector’s rapid maturation.

Longer term, the International Air Transport Association (‘IATA’) estimates that SAF usage could account for approximately 65% of the aviation industry’s net zero targets by 2050. The UK government estimates that domestic production of up to 5Mt of SAF annually may be required to achieve the UK’s 2050 net zero target (representing 40% of pre-pandemic aviation fuel consumption of 12.4Mt during 2019). In addition, major airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and corporates are increasingly committing to ambitious SAF targets.

Barriers to Entry

Despite these demand signals, the high capital costs that SAF production projects necessitate currently constrain SAF production, and infrastructure remains limited. Furthermore, production costs remain high. Jet A-1 - the internationally accepted standard for aviation turbine fuel - is currently priced at approximately US$0.05 to US$0.06 per kWh. By contrast, average aviation biofuel prices are currently between US$0.18 and US$0.21 per kWh.

In order to increase SAF production levels, attain economies of scale and reduce prices, substantial further capital investment is required in production capacity and infrastructure for current aviation biofuels. The long-term evolution of synthetic fuels also depends on investors committing the necessary capital for research into technological innovation and extensive production infrastructure.

Facilitating such investment demands a stable, predictable policy framework and clearly articulated long-term targets and demand drivers. In contrast, perceived policy risks could deter sustainable, long-term investment. The coming into force of the UK’s SAF Mandate at the beginning of this year is the result of a multi-year effort by successive governments to provide this predictable policy framework and to increase demand drivers.

Development of the UK Landscape on SAF

Aviation in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme

The aviation sector’s coverage under emissions trading schemes began under the EU Emissions Trading System (‘EU ETS’), which, from 2012, extended its scope to flights from within the European Economic Area (‘EEA’), as well as flights between the EEA and select international routes. This marked the first substantive policy mechanism to apply a carbon price to aviation emissions, thereby initiating efforts to narrow the cost disparity between SAF and fossil-based jet fuel. By assigning an explicit cost to carbon, the EU ETS introduced a market signal intended to internalise the sector’s externalities, albeit one that, in its nascent form, applied only to a subset of routes and with generous free allocation of allowances.

Following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (‘UK ETS’) came into force on 1 January 2021, supplanting the EU ETS for UK-covered routes. The UK ETS applies to emissions from domestic UK flights, UK-Gibraltar flights, and flights between the UK and EEA states, covering both commercial and cargo operations above a specified threshold. It retains core design features from the EU ETS - including auctioning of allowances, free allocation, and a cost containment mechanism - while introducing a UK-specific auction reserve price to maintain price stability. Crucially, both schemes treat eligible SAF as a ‘zero-rated’ fuel, meaning that aircraft operators reporting the use of qualifying SAF on a covered route are exempt from surrendering emissions allowances in relation to that fuel. This zero-rating feature provides an early - although partial - economic lever to reduce the effective cost of SAF relative to fossil-based aviation turbine fuel, particularly for operators with material ETS exposure. By aligning fiscal advantage with environmental performance, the ETS has become an important instrument in promoting SAF uptake, capable of complementing direct blending mandates.

Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (‘CORSIA’) was established under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (‘ICAO’) in 2016 as a global market-based mechanism to address CO2 emissions from international aviation. It aims to stabilise net emissions from the sector at 2020 levels by requiring operators to offset emissions growth above a baseline set at 85% of 2019 emissions through the use of internationally recognised carbon credits. CORSIA entered its pilot phase in 2021, with full implementation scheduled in phases through to 2035. While participation is currently voluntary for most states, it is mandatory from 2027 for all ICAO Member States with significant aviation activity.

As an ICAO Member State, the UK commits to participate in CORSIA and is now considering how best to incorporate this international obligation into UK domestic law. In December 2024, the UK government published a consultation on the incorporation of CORSIA into UK law, with a view to ensuring compliance while maintaining coherence with the UK ETS. The consultation proposes two principal approaches: firstly, a ‘UK ETS-only’ option, which would apply the UK ETS exclusively to flights between the UK, the EEA, and Switzerland, thereby excluding those routes from CORSIA obligations; or secondly, a ‘price-based hybrid’ approach, under which both CORSIA and the UK ETS would apply concurrently to these routes, with operators eligible for financial compensation to mitigate the cumulative cost burden of dual compliance.

Notwithstanding the model adopted, incorporating CORSIA into UK law raises complex legal and policy questions: particularly regarding alignment with existing carbon pricing regimes, the fungibility of offset credits, and the potential for market distortion. Its integration of multilateral offsetting obligations into a sovereign emissions trading framework also marks a significant evolution in international climate governance.

UK Jet Zero Strategy

Acknowledging these policy drivers, the previous UK government unveiled its Jet Zero Strategy (‘the Strategy’) in July 2022, outlining a comprehensive plan to decarbonise the aviation sector. The Strategy foreshadowed a SAF Mandate – requiring that aviation turbine fuel supplied in the UK comprises at least 10% SAF by 2030 – combined with an objective to begin construction of at least five commercial-scale UK facilities by 2025. With these regulatory measures, some analysts surmise that SAF projects could deliver internal rates of return akin to those historically observed in the oil and gas sector, typically ranging from 6% to 17%.

UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation

Alongside this, the UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (‘RTFO’) entered into force in 2008, and explicitly recognised SAF an eligible fuel under the scheme from 2018, before the SAF Mandate amended the RTFO’s scope to exclude aviation turbine fuel. Under the RTFO framework, fuel suppliers had to ensure that a designated percentage of the fuel they supplied was derived from renewable or sustainable sources. The RTFO further established a development fuels sub-target to stimulate the use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (such as electrolytic hydrogen and renewable e-fuels).

UK SAF Mandate: Obligations and Mechanisms

The SAF Mandate came into force on 1 January 2025 and applies to all UK aviation turbine fuel suppliers delivering at least 15.9 terajoules (approximately 468,000 litres) per calendar year (‘fuel suppliers’). Under the SAF Mandate, these fuel suppliers are required to blend certain minimum levels of SAF with conventional, fossil-based aviation turbine fuel.

The SAF Mandate comprises five primary components: a ‘main obligation’ to drive emissions reductions through SAF utilisation; a cap on SAF derived from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (‘HEFA’); a minimum power-to-liquid (‘PtL’) fuel obligation; robust sustainability criteria; and the introduction of a buy-out price. We analyse each of these mechanisms in detail below.

Main Obligation

The main obligation imposes escalating SAF supply obligations on fuel from 2025 to 2040. For 2025, fuel suppliers must ensure that SAF comprises 2% of the total aviation turbine fuel they supply in that year. Each supplier’s obligation is calculated in terms of total energy content — rather than fuel mass or volume — thereby accounting for differences in energy density. This annual target increases to 10% by 2030, 15% in 2035, and 22% in 2040 (refer to Figure 1 for each annual obligation from 2025 to 2040). In the Department of Transport’s (‘DfT’s’) estimation, these targets balance the need for long-term investment certainty in the UK’s SAF demand with the flexibility required to accommodate ongoing technological and commercial developments, whilst upholding ambitious environmental standards.

HEFA Cap

HEFA represents the key commercial-scale SAF production pathway currently available. Although HEFA qualifies as an eligible SAF under the main obligation, the government will cap the volume of HEFA eligible for incentives under the SAF Mandate. Initially, the HEFA cap begins at 100% for 2025 and 2026, then decreases to 92.31% in 2027, declining incrementally each year until the cap reaches 42.16% in 2040. This measure intends not only to encourage investment in a more diverse portfolio of advanced SAF technologies, but also mitigate the premature diversion of HEFA from its vital role in the road transport sector. Importantly, the cap restricts only the volume eligible for support under the SAF Mandate, not the total production of HEFA in the UK, acknowledging that the finite nature of its feedstocks faces global competition from other transport sectors.

Power-to-Liquid Obligation

Complementing the main obligation, the SAF Mandate introduces a dedicated requirement to supply PtL fuels, defined as low-carbon aviation turbine fuel synthesised from renewable (excluding biomass) or nuclear power. From 2028, the SAF Mandate will impose a PtL obligation of 0.2% of the total quantity of aviation turbine fuel that each supplier delivers in a given calendar year, escalating to 0.6% in 2030, and reaching 4.5% by 2040. It requires PtL suppliers to demonstrate that the renewable electricity consumed in the fuel’s production represents genuinely new or surplus generation, rather than diverting existing low-carbon supply from the grid. Suppliers must also demonstrate that their electricity qualifies as ‘additional eligible energy’, proving that it would not have been generated, or would otherwise been curtailed or wasted, without consumption by the PtL production site.

Sustainability criteria

To qualify for eligibility under the SAF Mandate, fuels must satisfy specified sustainability benchmarks, principally achieving a minimum greenhouse gas emissions reduction of at least 40% when compared to a fossil-based aviation turbine fuel baseline of 89gCO2e/MJ. This calculation employs a lifecycle methodology, consistent with the established approach under the RTFO (refer to Figure 2 for further detail). In setting these thresholds, the government sought to strike an appropriate balance between driving immediate substantive emissions reductions and enabling the inclusion of emerging fuel pathways, which may currently exhibit higher emissions, but hold substantial future decarbonisation potential. To maintain momentum towards deeper decarbonisation, the government anticipates progressively raising this GHG reduction threshold. While precise timings and increments for these increases remain under consideration, the government has stated it is committed to an evidence-based, phased approach that responds dynamically to market developments and technological advancements.

Furthermore, the SAF Mandate excludes SAF derived from food and feed crops, reflecting broader concerns over food security, land use pressures, and environmental sustainability. This exclusion aligns with the government’s objective to prioritise waste-based and advanced feedstocks, thereby fostering more resilient and socially responsible supply chains. Eligible SAF must conform to international technical standards — including, but not limited to, ASTM D7566 — which governs fuel composition, performance, and safety of synthetic fuels. Certified SAF may be blended with conventional, fossil-based Jet A-1 aviation turbine fuel in proportions of up to 50%, in accordance with ASTM D1655 specifications for aviation turbine fuel.

SAF Revenue Certainty Mechanism and Industry Levy

Scaling Challenges and Investment Imperatives

The SAF Mandate’s effectiveness will hinge on the sector’s ability to scale production rapidly and sustainably. Notwithstanding the strong demand signal that the SAF Mandate provides, material concerns persist across the industry regarding the feasibility of achieving the uplift in SAF volumes necessary to align with the UK government’s target trajectory. Reliance on HEFA-based fuels — though commercially proven — is inherently constrained by finite feedstock availability and competing demands from other sectors. As the SAF Mandate progressively tightens the cap on HEFA-derived fuels, the imperative to accelerate the commercialisation of advanced pathways — such as PtL and alcohol-to-jet technologies — becomes increasingly acute. Without sustained investment and technological maturation, meeting the higher-end blending obligations of the 2030s and 2040s risks becoming unattainable. Addressing this challenge will require not merely capital mobilisation but coordinated public-private efforts to de-risk innovation, expand production capacity, and secure resilient supply chains.

Revenue certainty mechanism

Against the backdrop of scaling imperatives and supply-side constraints, it is evident that regulatory demand alone will not suffice. Ensuring the bankability of SAF projects will require complementary measures to stabilise revenues and de-risk early investment. The high capital cost of SAF production facilities — with government estimates suggesting costs between £600 million and £2 billion to achieve economies of scale — combined with the substantial price differential between SAF and fossil-based aviation turbine fuel, underscores the need for further targeted support. The SAF Mandate alone does not address this issue: it creates an obligation to supply SAF but neither establishes a guaranteed market price, nor shields domestic producers from global production fluctuations or external price pressures.

In this context, securing affordable finance for SAF projects remains challenging. Perceived regulatory and revenue uncertainty, coupled with intense competition for capital from other low-carbon technologies, heightens the risk premium attached to SAF investments. Without additional mechanisms to stabilise project revenues and reduce investor exposure to price volatility, many SAF developments would struggle to achieve financial close at commercially viable terms.

Guaranteed strike price

Recognising these dynamics, the government has consulted extensively with industry over the past two years on the design of a bespoke revenue certainty mechanism, with a stated aim of enacting the necessary legislative framework by the end of 2026. Building on the proven model of contracts for difference (‘CfDs’) in the renewable electricity sector, the government has confirmed that the mechanism will operate on a ‘guaranteed strike price’ basis, ensuring that SAF producers are remunerated at a predetermined price per litre of fuel supplied. Implementation will proceed through private contracts between producers and a government counterparty, expected, although not yet formally confirmed, to be the Low Carbon Contracts Company (‘LCCC’).

This mechanism is based on an established precedent used for both renewable and (previously) nuclear projects and is now being deployed for hydrogen projects. Both the government and the majority of industry stakeholders felt that it was the model most likely to deliver credible, bankable revenue streams, and the highest level of investor confidence. It should be noted that the government has clarified that the first tranche of contracts signed under the revenue certainty mechanism will be limited to non-HEFA SAF production only.

There are a number of critical policy decisions to be taken in respect of the design of the SAF CfD. One of the most important relates to what to use as the ‘reference price’. A fundamental basis of a CfD is that it pays a difference payment bridging the gap between a pre-agreed strike price and a market reference price; it provides the revenue certainty of topping a producer up from a price which it should be able to achieve by selling its product in the (potentially volatile) market. For the renewables CfD, this is simple: there is a well-established, independently published market reference price for electricity. For SAF, this is not the case: the market is far more nascent than the power sector.

The government faced similar challenges in relation to the Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreement (‘LCHA’) and decided that the reference price should be set at the price that producers are actually able to sell hydrogen for (the achieved sales price). This is one of the preferred options for the SAF CfD. If that is the case, there are two follow-on design features which are critical to address the resultant incentive issue (that is to say, a producer has no incentive to sell SAF at anything above a nominal price if they are always topped up to the strike price).

Firstly, the revenue certainty mechanism would need to set a floor price which SAF producers know they could attain. Whilst the fossil-based aviation turbine fuel price would appear to be the most obvious floor price — following the logic of using the gas reference price as a floor price for hydrogen — the government will need carefully to consider whether this level is appropriate, especially in the context of likely competition from imported SAF and the difficulty of finding offtakers willing to pay a variable price on a long-term contract.

Secondly, the government needs to ensure that SAF producers are incentivised to sell SAF for prices above the floor price. Under the hydrogen business model, producers are permitted to keep 10% of any price achieved above the floor price as a ’price discovery incentive’. We would expect a similar mechanism to be included. In practice, it remains to be observed whether these incentive structures will be sufficient to secure robust offtake pricing. For example, some producers may be willing to accept the floor price in exchange for concessions on other offtake terms (such as in relation to liability regimes) and forego the 10% incentive payment: clearly, the risk of that occurring lessens if the incentive percentage is set at a higher level.

Another critically important policy decision will be how the strike price is adjusted. There are numerous options here (for instance, indexing a portion of the strike price to relevant feedstock prices — which will differ for various pathways — or energy costs, or simply indexing everything to CPI: as for green hydrogen and renewables projects). There is a balance to be struck: whilst DfT may be reticent for LCCC to be exposed to an increase in feedstock prices (in the same way that DESNZ has been unwilling for LCCC to be exposed to increases in power prices for green hydrogen projects: see more here), the alternative could ultimately be more expensive if producers look to reflect this in very expensive, long-term, fixed-price feedstock contracts or a higher cost of capital (both of which will translate to a higher initial strike price).

Fundamentally, clarity over the revenue support structure will serve as a precondition for unlocking institutional capital, particularly from infrastructure funds and impact investors whose mandates hinge on predictable cash flows and regulatory stability. In this respect, we might view the revenue certainty mechanism not merely as a subsidy, but as a structural market reform intended to internalise environmental externalities and provide long-term price certainty for an emerging commodity.

Funding the revenue certainty mechanism

In March 2025, the government published a consultation in relation to how the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded, having previously promised the scheme would be ‘industry funded’. In line with the ‘polluter pays principle’ set out in the Environment Act 2021, it is currently contemplated that the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded by a variable levy on the same aviation turbine fuel suppliers — of which the government estimates there are around 20 in total — that are obligated under the SAF Mandate. The relevant fuel suppliers will pay differing amounts depending on their respective market shares and the payments required are likely to vary over time depending on the price of non-HEFA SAF.

The government’s rationale for funding the levy from high up the supply chain is that the cost will be shared between airlines, freight companies and passengers. The government has sought to reassure fuel suppliers that the requirements for funding will only be modest (the consultation projects that a worst-case scenario would require £10 billion in subsidies to producers over 15 years) and that fuel suppliers will benefit from the likely increase in supply — and resultant reduction in cost — of SAF as a result of the subsidy scheme.

International Comparison of SAF Policies

Governments worldwide are also actively establishing measures to accelerate SAF deployment. In the EU, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates steadily increasing SAF blending requirements, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050. Unlike the UK’s approach, which permits suppliers to discharge shortfalls through a predefined buy-out payment, ReFuelEU imposes direct obligations on fuel suppliers — together with certain operational requirements on airports and airlines — and enforces compliance through monetary penalties.

While both regimes impose financial consequences for failures to meet blending targets, their legal character diverges. The UK’s buy-out mechanism operates as an ex ante compliance alternative, deliberately priced to incentivise physical SAF uptake, while providing a predictable ceiling on non-compliance costs. By contrast, ReFuelEU Aviation treats blending as a strict legal obligation: non-compliance triggers an ex post enforcement penalty, with no structured alternative to achieving the mandated volumes. This structural distinction reflects a broader difference in regulatory philosophy between the two regimes, balancing flexibility and deterrence in contrasting ways.

In addition, the EU and UK regimes’ SAF eligibility criteria diverge in several material respects. ReFuelEU Aviation imposes higher lifecycle emissions reductions of 65% for biofuels and 70% for PtLs, compared to the UK’s 40% minimum standard. Feedstock eligibility also differs: the EU restricts eligible feedstocks to a narrower range of inputs than the UK. Certification requirements further diverge, with the UK relying on domestic verifiers and the EU mandating recognition under approved voluntary schemes. The EU also enforces a 90% minimum uplift requirement to mitigate tankering risks, a measure absent from the UK’s framework.

Furthermore, ReFuelEU Aviation does not establish a certificate trading scheme. Compliance under ReFuelEU is demonstrated directly through verified records of physical SAF supply and sustainability certification, without the creation of tradable surplus credits. Finally, both the EU and UK regimes require certain synthetic SAF production facilities to comply with temporal correlation requirements. This means those facilities must match the facility’s renewable electricity consumption with renewable energy supplied exclusively to the specific facilities, although EU requirements remain less restrictive than those applicable in the UK. These differences have practical implications for cross-border SAF supply chains and project structuring.

In North America, the US Inflation Reduction Act has established significant incentives to catalyse SAF production. Until the end of 2024, a dedicated tax credit under section 40B offered a base rate of US$1.25 per gallon, increasing to a maximum of US$1.75 per gallon for SAF achieving lifecycle emissions reductions exceeding 50% relative to fossil-based aviation turbine fuel. From 1 January 2025, this regime transitioned to the Clean Fuel Production Credit under section 45Z, which offers a base credit value of US$0.35 per gallon of SAF produced. This amount escalates to a maximum of US$1.75 per gallon when prevailing apprenticeship and wage requirements are satisfied, and the fuel achieves the lowest carbon intensities. The credit value is further adjusted based on the fuel’s CO2 emissions factor and annual inflation rates. Separately, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (‘LCFS’) and British Colombia’s LCFS incentivise SAF production by enabling the issuance and trading of compliance credits to achieve carbon intensity benchmarks.

At the global level, CORSIA remains in its voluntary phase until the end of 2026, and covers around 60% of total international aviation emissions. CORSIA’s sustainability criteria — as specified by ICAO — differ slightly, but materially, from those under ReFuelEU Aviation and the UK SAF Mandate. For instance, CORSIA accepts a wider range of eligible feedstocks, including certain crop-based materials. Its lifecycle emissions threshold is also less demanding, requiring a minimum 10% reduction relative to fossil-based aviation turbine fuel.

Yet, while international schemes diverge in their sustainability criteria and enforcement mechanisms, a common structural challenge persists: how to match regulatory ambition with SAF distribution and availability. With this, governments may need to consider the deployment of ‘book-and-claim’ mechanisms to complement physical SAF deliveries. By decoupling the environmental attributes of SAF from its physical movement, book-and-claim models could offer flexible, cost-effective pathways for operators to meet compliance obligations, even where direct SAF supply is unavailable. If properly calibrated, such mechanisms can preserve environmental integrity — ensuring rigorous verification of emissions reductions — while expanding access to SAF markets globally. Furthermore, aligning book-and-claim standards with international frameworks could enhance certificate fungibility across jurisdictions and mitigate the risk of regulatory arbitrage.

Conclusion and Implications

The UK SAF Mandate’s introduction signals a decisive step forward in the UK’s ambition to decarbonise aviation, offering clarity and predictability for stakeholders across the aviation turbine fuel supply chain. While challenges undoubtedly remain — particularly relating to price certainty, supply chain maturity, and international competitiveness — the SAF Mandate represents a sophisticated regulatory approach, balancing ambition with pragmatism. As governments worldwide implement comparable policies, industry players must contend with an increasingly intricate regulatory landscape. Yet, those positioning themselves strategically could leverage significant opportunities in the emerging SAF market. Ultimately, the SAF Mandate’s effectiveness will depend on robust policy coherence, continued innovation, and targeted financial support mechanisms to ensure the UK’s aviation sector is not merely compliant, but indeed a global leader in the net zero aviation journey. In this respect, it will be critical for the UK government to strike the right balance with the revenue support mechanism being crafted for SAF production projects, and industry players will want to ensure they are poised to continue to input and shape the development of these mechanisms.",https://www.slaughterandmay.com/media/mnmdelgq/default-share.jpg,N,,2025-04-30 11:57:10.424145

This year’s expanded edition offers a sharper view of how strategies, priorities, and structures are evolving — and provides clear benchmarks to help industry leaders track progress, identify emerging risks, and sharpen their own sustainability strategies.

Key findings from the 2025 report

This year’s results show an industry focusing more closely on near-term efficiencies, strengthening internal systems, and adjusting communication practices in response to growing scrutiny.

Shift in investment priorities: Fleet renewal has emerged as the overwhelming focus in 2025, overtaking sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) which dominated investment in 2024.

SAF reality check: SAF adoption remains low with most airlines using less than 1%, despite 73% having formal uptake plans targeting 10% by 2030.

Communication strategies are becoming more cautious: Only 5% of airlines openly promote their sustainability progress, with concern about greenwashing rising from 35% to 59%.

Sustainability teams and budgets continue evolving: Hybrid models remain dominant, half of airlines now have Chief Sustainability Officers, and 63.6% increased their budgets over the past year — although nearly half are no longer disclosing allocation details.

Persistent and new barriers are shaping decisions: High costs and technological limits remain the most significant obstacles. New challenges include internal resource constraints and lack of industry-wide collaboration.

As airlines navigate this pivotal transition, strategic collaboration, supportive policy, and sustained investment will be critical to maintaining momentum towards net zero.

Over three years, two helicopters – Christoph Rheinland (Airbus H145) and Christoph Europa 1 (Airbus H135) – have logged over 1,800 flight hours using a SAF blend containing up to 38% bio-derived components. The SAF, produced from recycled vegetable oils, is a drop-in fuel compatible with existing infrastructure.​

Tobias Grein, researcher from the German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute of Combustion Technology, who supervised the project on the DLR side, said: “We used our mobile DLR measurement laboratory for the first measurement campaign of its kind and the only one of its kind to date. It contains special measuring and analysis equipment. These are suitable for investigating ultrafine particles down to a size of seven nanometers. Before each measurement campaign, we develop an individual concept and determine the setup, position of the measuring probe and the duration of the measurements. This is the only way to obtain reliable and comparable data.”

His conclusion: “These measurements were very exciting and also something special for our team to do all this live on a helicopter shortly before takeoff.”​

Key findings include a 44% reduction in ultrafine particle emissions when idle and a 33% reduction during cruise speeds. No adverse effects on engine performance or emissions of CO₂, CO, or NOx were observed. Engine manufacturers Safran Helicopter Engines and Pratt & Whitney Canada reported no significant wear differences compared with conventional kerosene use.​

Frédéric Bruder, CEO of ADAC Luftrettung, emphasized the organization’s commitment to decarbonizing air rescue operations and announced plans to increase the SAF blend to 100% and explore synthetic e-fuels (power-to-liquid) in the future.​

Jean-François Sauer, EVP Programs at Safran Helicopter Engines, commented: “This long-term trial of SAF use on an H145 helicopter powered by our Arriel engine is a major milestone. It demonstrates the compatibility of our engines with SAF on long-term operations and to characterize the environmental benefit, both for CO2 and local pollutant emissions reduction.”​

Initiatives like the Hilo airport landing procedure collectively contribute to these impressive financial and environmental outcomes.","Like all airlines, Delta is exploring ways in which it can decarbonise.

As things stand, aviation accounts for around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is responsible for releasing around 800 million tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere each year.

And despite the best efforts of airlines around the world, that percentage is only expected to rise as other industries decarbonise, simply by virtue of the fact that aviation is especially difficult to make sustainable compared to other sectors.

Delta is not content to approach sustainability with apathy, though. The carrier is making some big changes to its operations in a push to reduce fuel consumption.

“Why? Because sustainability is good for business and our people,” says Amelia DeLuca, CSO at Delta.

How is Delta approaching sustainability?

Delta’s sustainability department is making the case for sustainability as a business imperative.

It’s far from easy, though. Each airport and destination in Delta's network is a unique proposition.

A prime example emerged recently at Hilo Airport in Hawai’i, where Delta's Flight Operations and Operations Control Center (OCC) teams collaborated with the airline's Carbon Council to pioneer a fuel-saving landing approach.

“Throughout Delta’s journey to net zero emissions by 2050, we remain committed to decarbonising operations long term, while making changes within our control now to save on jet fuel,” says Amelia.

Hawaiian innovation demonstrates approach

The easternmost runway in Hawai’i presented both challenges and opportunities for Delta's sustainability teams.

Identifying potential fuel savings for Pacific flights using Hilo as a diversion point, Delta specialists developed a proprietary landing approach requiring less jet fuel.

This bespoke procedure required teams to create, chart, test and certify an entirely new approach specific to Delta's operations.

“The team noticed there was a better way of doing things that burned less fuel, so they innovated across teams to make a change,” Amelia explains.

While representing just one airport among hundreds in Delta's global network, the Hilo initiative exemplifies the airline's commitment to implementing fuel-saving measures wherever possible.

It also demonstrates how seemingly minor operational adjustments can generate substantial cost savings when implemented at scale.

Financial benefits complement environmental gains

With more than 4,000 daily flights, Delta recognises that even minimal fuel savings per flight can deliver significant cumulative benefits.

Jet fuel represents one of Delta's largest operational expenses, making efficiency improvements financially attractive beyond their environmental impact.

Earlier this year, the airline announced reaching its first fuel savings milestone, achieving one percent fuel burn reduction through operational improvements.

This translated to 45 million gallons of jet fuel saved, delivering cost benefits exceeding US$110m for the global carrier.

The US-based firm is well aware that aviation is a hard-to-abate industry, with opportunities to decarbonise few and far between, but it is always looking for areas in which it can reduce its environmental impact.

Sustainable aviation fuel is still a nascent market, so United has begun to explore methods of making planes more fuel efficient while running on their current fuel mix.

United has announced that it is investing in aerospace start-up JetZero, a cutting-edge company that is reimagining the way planes are made.

The partnership between the two includes a conditional purchase agreement for up to 200 aircraft, pending development milestones.

JetZero’s revolutionary design promises huge efficiency gains

JetZero's innovative ‘blended wing body’ design represents a radical departure from conventional tubular aircraft shapes.

Its unusual ‘all wing’ design helps to distribute lift across the entire aircraft structure.

It is thought that this aerodynamic approach could reduce fuel consumption by up to 50% per passenger mile compared to similar-sized conventional aircraft.

""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,"" says Andrew Chang, Head of United Airlines Ventures.

The Z4 is designed to accommodate 250 passengers with a range of 5,000 nautical miles, making it suitable for long-haul routes.

JetZero's aircraft will utilise conventional jet engines with the ability to run on sustainable aviation fuel blends.

Military backing accelerates development timeline

JetZero’s aerodynamic design bears some resemblance to the B-2 Bombers sometimes used by the US military, so perhaps it is little surprise that the US Air Force has helped to fund the company.

An investment of US$235m was announced in 2023, which will help to fast-track the creation of a full-scale demonstrator aircraft, with a first flight expected in 2027.

The Air Force's interest stems from potential applications for transport and refuelling tanker variants.

These military configurations could address approximately 60% of the Air Force's total annual jet fuel consumption.

Passenger experience and operational benefits

Beyond sustainability improvements, the Z4 promises enhanced passenger comfort through its unique cabin layout.

The design allows for flexible seating configurations, larger seats across all classes and dedicated overhead bin space for each passenger.

This innovation holds the promise of addressing water scarcity issues, particularly in remote areas lacking access to clean drinking water. With water scarcity being a growing concern worldwide, this technology could be a game-changer, offering a sustainable and cost-effective solution. As we delve into the specifics of this remarkable advancement, we’ll explore the science behind hydrogels, their practical applications, and their potential to transform water accessibility globally.

The Science Behind Hydrogels

Hydrogels are unique materials that exhibit the ability to absorb and retain significant amounts of water. This property makes them particularly effective in capturing moisture from the air. According to the United Nations, while global access to safely managed drinking water improved from 69% to 73% between 2015 and 2022, millions still lack access, especially in isolated regions. This is where hydrogels come into play. Recent innovations, like the AquaGel developed by Chinese students for the Dyson Awards, utilize a thin layer of 3D-printed hydrogel to collect atmospheric humidity. Such technologies are now being refined further to enhance water capture efficiency.

In February 2025, a team from the University of Texas at Austin presented a novel method in the journal Advanced Materials. They have developed molecularly functionalized biomass hydrogels to transform organic matter into sorbents, materials capable of capturing liquids. This approach is a significant leap forward, offering a sustainable method to harness water from the air in even the most arid conditions. By utilizing biomass-derived hydrogels as a tool for water collection, researchers are paving the way for innovative solutions to global water challenges.

An Abundant and Inexpensive Resource

The use of biomass for hydrogel production involves readily available materials such as food waste, dead branches, and shells. These hydrogels can harvest potable water from the atmosphere, even during droughts, using mild heat. Researchers have demonstrated the device’s capability to collect up to 3.75 gallons of potable water daily. The biodegradable nature of these hydrogels means they require minimal energy to release the accumulated water, making them an eco-friendly option.

The innovation pivots away from traditional methods of “selection and combination,” which necessitate choosing specific materials. Instead, with molecular engineering, any biomass can become an effective water collector. Other materials, like cellulose, starch, and chitosan, have also shown promise during testing. This adaptability makes the technology suitable for off-grid communities and emergency relief operations in isolated areas. By making use of an abundant and inexpensive resource, this innovation offers a sustainable and practical solution to water scarcity.

Potential Impact on Global Water Scarcity

The implications of using hydrogels for water collection are profound, particularly for regions facing acute water shortages. As climate change exacerbates water scarcity, technologies like these could provide a lifeline for communities without reliable access to clean water. This method not only provides immediate relief but also offers a long-term solution by utilizing sustainable materials and processes. The ability to produce water from air, regardless of climatic conditions, means that even in dry areas, communities can access the essential resource they need to survive and thrive.

Moreover, the implementation of this technology could reduce dependency on traditional water sources, which are often strained or polluted. By integrating these hydrogels into existing infrastructure, communities can enhance their resilience against future water-related challenges. This innovative approach not only addresses the symptoms of water scarcity but also tackles its root causes by promoting the use of renewable resources.

Challenges and Future Prospects

While the potential benefits of hydrogel-based water collection are immense, several challenges remain. Scaling up production, ensuring consistent performance across different environmental conditions, and integrating this technology into existing water systems are critical steps for widespread adoption. However, the promise of providing a reliable and sustainable water source makes overcoming these hurdles worthwhile.

Looking ahead, further research and development could refine the technology, enhancing its efficiency and reducing costs. As awareness grows and more resources are allocated to this area, we may soon witness the widespread use of hydrogels as a viable solution to water scarcity. Could this innovation pave the way for a future where access to clean water is a given, rather than a privilege?

Kenya’s KOKO Networks has secured a $179.6-million guarantee from the World Bank’s insurance arm Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) to protect its carbon credit revenues from political risks, the company shared in a press release on Monday March 17. This move could strengthen investor confidence in compliance-grade carbon markets like CORSIA.

However, KOKO’s credits are not yet CORSIA Phase 1 eligible, as they still require a letter of authorisation (LoA) and corresponding adjustments from the Kenyan government. MIGA issued the guarantee to cover investments by KOKO Networks of Mauritius into its Kenyan subsidiary. The coverage shields the company from risks including expropriation, transfer restrictions and breach of contract for up to 15 years, ensuring it can continue generating and trading carbon credits under evolving regulatory frameworks.

A Singapore-based trader told Fastmarkets that while bids for the Gold Standard (GS)-certified KOKO’s cookstoves credits were heard around $12-$16 per tCO2e, offers were reported around $20 per tCO2e. The gap highlights the challenges facing Article 6-aligned projects, as buyers weigh regulatory uncertainty and the timeline for securing corresponding adjustments against the potential long-term value of compliance-grade credits.

A London-based trader added that while prices for CORSIA Phase 1 credits are currently reported around $21 per tCO2e levels, they will likely drop once supply increases in the market after host country governments grant corresponding adjustments.

However, there remains uncertainty over the supply outlook for this year. Both Gold Standard and Verra require insurance to protect against revocation risk by a host-country between an LoA being granted and a corresponding adjustment being made and reported. Currently Gold Standard only accepts MIGA insurance, but both Gold Standard and Verra are looking at setting guidelines and criteria to evaluate other insurance providers later in the year.

KOKO supplies bioethanol cookstoves and fuel to over 1.3 million low-income households in Kenya, replacing charcoal and firewood – major drivers of deforestation and indoor air pollution. The transition generates about 6 million tonnes of carbon credits annually, certified under GS, with revenues used to subsidize fuel costs. The company has issued over 10 million vintage 2021-2024 credits as of late-March.

Greg Murray, Koko’s chief executive officer, said the company operates in highly regulated energy and carbon markets where political risk is a key concern. “MIGA’s guarantee ensures that our carbon finance model remains viable, allowing us to continue expanding clean fuel access while generating compliance-grade carbon credits,” he said. The World Bank has increasingly turned to guarantees to de-risk climate investments, and MIGA’s backing of KOKO suggests a growing focus on carbon finance as a tool for energy transition.

As demand for high-integrity carbon credits rises, particularly in compliance markets, financial risk coverage could play a larger role in stabilizing long-term investments in carbon projects. However, the effectiveness of such guarantees will depend on the speed at which governments implement the necessary policy frameworks to align with international carbon market rules.

Arup agrees £1mln investment for 10,000 tCO2e of UK nature-based carbon removals

UK-based consultancy Arup agreed to a £1 million ($1.27 million) investment to support the restoration of UK nature-based project developer Nattergal’s 617 hectare Boothby Wildlands project in Lincolnshire. As part of the investment, Arup will receive 10,000 tCO2e of nature-based carbon removals from the project over the next 30 years.

The upfront investment, rather than through land ownership or payment on delivery, provides a “new model for private sector support in nature restoration” Arup said in a statement in early March. The company said that nature-based carbon removal projects are “not happening at the speed needed” so hopes the upfront investment will accelerate the development and delivery of the project.

The project involves the rewilding of arable farmland, with Arup’s investment supporting the restoration of 67.5 hectares of degraded land with carbon-depleted soils. This increases carbon sequestration and creates other environmental benefits including enhanced biodiversity, improved soil health and water quality, and flood attenuation. The carbon removal credits generated from the project are verified under Wilder Carbon’s Standard for Nature and Climate.

The deal marks the largest purchase of credits registered under the Wilder Carbon Registry. Previously just over 400 tCO2e credits had been purchased by three entities across two projects. A total of just four projects are currently registered under the standard. The registry lists the total cost of the Boothby Wildlands project at £5.2 million.

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) demand ends the quarter strong, led by Microsoft

Demand for multi-year nature-based and durable CDR offtakes ended the quarter strong, with just under 2.5 million tCO2e agreed and tracked by Fastmarkets in March.

Microsoft continued to be the main demand driver in the market, signing a 1.5 million tCO2e Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) offtake with Climate Impact Partners and Terra Natural Capital. The credits will be generated from the Panna ARR (VCS 4811) project in India and be delivered over 30 years, with the offtake representing around 50% of the project’s output.

Microsoft had previously signed multi-year ARR offtakes totalling more than 10 million tCO2e in January.

Carbon demand aggregator Frontier also signed a $33 million agreement for over 78,000 tCO2e of enhanced rock weathering (ERW) credits with US developer Eion in March to be delivered between 2027 and 2030. There have been signs of increased interest from buyers for ERW credits this year with some viewing it as a scalable pathway to durable carbon removals.

Other notable deals agreed this month included Japanese shipping company Mitsui OSK Lines purchasing 30,000 tCO2e of direct ocean capture credits from Captura for delivery by 2030. While Meta bought 676,000 tCO2e of Improved Forest Management (IFM) removal credits for delivery through 2035 from investment firm EFM. The structure of the deal was novel, in that the negotiations to purchase the land took place in parallel to the offtake agreement. Traditionally property owners have sold credits only after securing ownership.

Airbus to test Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ‘book and claim’ demand through 2025

Airbus will test customer demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through 2025 with a pilot program for “book and claim,” the company announced late March. Book and claim allows customers to request and pay for SAF usage to offset the carbon emissions from their own activities, and claim the emissions credits.

The actual SAF is used wherever it is available and most convenient within the overall aviation system, not necessarily on the routes used by the booking customer. Airbus will purchase SAF certificates through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) registry. The pilot program will focus on customers who need “limited volumes” and are far from SAF supply points, the press release said.

To that end, Airbus has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the book and claim pilot program with a number of private jet charter companies, maintenance providers and other small companies. Airbus has collaborated with and invested globally in a number of airlines, producers and financing initiatives toward the development of the SAF industry.

Earlier this month, Airbus announced that SAF deliveries had begun at its Mirabel, Canada commercial aircraft assembly site, marking SAF availability at all of the company’s test and assembly sites worldwide. At the same time, Airbus announced that 18% of its global fuel mix in 2024 was made up of SAF, and that it would continue to increase its usage toward a goal of 30% by 2030.

Frontier agrees $33 mln enhanced rock weathering carbon removal offtake with Eion Frontier, a carbon demand aggregator, has agreed a $33 million multi-year offtake agreement with US carbon removals project developer Eion for 78,707 tCO2e of enhanced rock weathering carbon credits between 2027 and 2030, according to a press release in late March.

The credits will be sourced from Eion projects in the Southern and Midwestern US, and equates to a cost of around $419.27 per tCO2e. Eion sources olivine, a rock type that reacts quickly with carbon dioxide, and spreads it on agricultural fields. The olivine then reacts with rainwater, converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into bicarbonate, which is then stored permanently in the ocean.

The fast weathering of olivine allows it to remove more carbon dioxide than other enhanced weathering methods. Meanwhile, the ability to subsidize costs with carbon credits allows farmers to use a cheaper alternative to ag lime for managing soil pH. The deal will allow Eion to expand its monitoring and validation efforts, and help drive down the cost of durable carbon removal through enhanced rock weathering, Anastasia Pavlovic, Eion’s chief executive officer, said.

Other market participants have told Fastmarkets that, despite comprising small volumes currently, interest in enhanced rock weathering has increased in recent months, with some viewing it as a scalable pathway to durable carbon removals.

Frontier buyers, including Stripe, Google, Shopify, Autodesk, H&M Group, JPMorgan Chase, Workday and Salesforce, formed part of the agreement. Other companies will also receive credits via Frontier’s partnership with US-based sustainability platform Watershed.

Brazil's 2025-26 sugar crop to near record 46mn t

Sao Paulo, 29 April (Argus) — Brazil may produce a record amount of sugar in the 2025-26 sugarcane crop despite lower crushing because more feedstock is set for the sweetener's production instead of ethanol. Brazil is set to produce 45.9mn metric tonnes (t) of sugar in the 2025-26 crop — which officially started on 1 April — a 4pc increase from the prior season, according to national supply company Conab's first estimate for the cycle. But Conab expects 2025-26 sugarcane crushing to decrease by 2pc from the the prior season, because of unfavorable weather conditions in the months prior to the beginning of the crop. The center-south — responsible for 90pc of national output — was hit by lack of rainfalls and high temperatures in most of last year, harming the development and growing of crops which would be harvested in the current cycle. The planted sugarcane area is expected to reach 8.8mn hectares (ha), a slight 0.3pc rise from the prior cycle, but yields are estimated to decrease by 2.3pc to 75,450 kg/ha. The annual increase in sugar output came because international sugar prices became more attractive than domestic ethanol prices. Both products are derived from sugarcane and production of one occurs at the expense of the other. Additionally, Brazilian mills increased investments on sugar crystallizing capacity last year and market participants expect the results to materialize this season. Ethanol output to fall Brazil will produce 36.8bn l (635,180 b/d) of ethanol in the 2025-26 crop, a 1pc drop from the 2024-25 season, driven by less sugarcane-based ethanol, Conab said. Sugarcane ethanol output is estimated to drop by 4.2pc from the prior cycle, because of less available feedstock and an estimated higher share of sugarcane directed to sugar production instead of the biofuel. But a projected 11pc increase in corn-based ethanol production in the 2025-26 season from the previous cycle partially offsets that expected drop in sugarcane ethanol output. Hydrous ethanol production in the 2025-26 season is estimated to total 22.7bn l, a 6.8pc decrease from 24.4bn l in the 2024-25 crop, while output of anhydrous ethanol — used as a gasoline blendstock — may rise by 10pc to 14.1bn l.

European aviation emissions to surpass pre-Covid levels

London, 29 April (Argus) — Carbon emissions from the European aviation industry are on course to surpass 2019 levels this year, according to a new study by clean energy lobby group Transport & Environment (T&E). Flights departing from European airports — in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and the UK — emitted around 187.6mn t of CO2 in 2024, 8pc higher than in 2023 and just 2pc short of 2019, the year before the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the study said. Meanwhile, 8.4mn flights departed from airports in Europe last year, which was 4pc lower than in 2019. T&E forecasts that aviation emissions will rise to 195.2mn t this year, 4pc higher than 2019 levels, even after taking into account a 2pc mandate on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use. European flight numbers are expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels for the first time this year. Long-haul flights emitted the most CO2 last year, with London to New York flights accounting for 1.4mn t, London to Dubai 1.2mn t and London to Singapore 1.1mn t. T&E criticised carbon pricing in Europe, pointing out that airlines do not have to pay for carbon emissions on intercontinental flights, according to EU, Swiss and UK Emissions Trading Systems (ETS), as their carbon allowances only apply to flights within Europe. This means that airlines operating within these carbon markets do not have to pay for emissions on the biggest-polluting routes. The group claims that up to 70pc of carbon emissions fell outside of these carbon markets last year and were therefore exempt. T&E is pushing the EU and UK to expand their ETS, saying they could have generated an extra €7.5bn in 2024. The EU will review its ETS next year.

Bio-bunker sales in Rotterdam down in 1Q

London, 23 April (Argus) — Sales of marine biodiesel blends in Rotterdam fell for the third consecutive quarter in January-March as demand shifted east of Suez. Port data for the first quarter of 2025 show marine biodiesel blend sales declined by 12pc compared with the previous three months and by 60pc compared with the same period last year. The decline was underpinned by lower prices in Singapore. B24 dob Singapore — a blend comprising very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO) and used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) — averaged a $36/t discount against B30 advanced fatty acid methyl ester (Fame) 0 dob ARA in the first quarter, and a $129.74/t discount against B30 Ucome dob ARA. This price dynamic made Singapore an attractive bunker hub for those shipowners opting to use biodiesel blends to help their customers meet sustainability goals. It also attracted demand from shipowners bound by the FuelEU maritime regulations introduced in January this year. The regulations require a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships travelling into, out of and within EU waters, but energy consumed from blends bunkered in Singapore can be mass balanced to be fully accounted for under the scope of the rules. A pooling mechanism within the regulations also allows vessels operating on the east-west route to utilise compliance generated from marine biodiesel blends bunkered in Singapore across other ships that operate solely in Europe. While biodiesel bunker sales in Rotterdam fell, biomethanol sales at the port soared almost sixfold in January-March compared with a year earlier. The sharp rise in demand reflects the rollout of FuelEU Maritime , higher mandates in Europe for the use of renewables in transport this year and changes to regulations on the carryover of renewable fuels tickets in Germany and the Netherlands . Sales of conventional bunker fuels in Rotterdam edged up by a more modest 1pc on the quarter and by 7pc on the year. Sales of high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) overtook those of very low sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), reversing the trend of the previous quarter despite the imminent addition of the Mediterranean Sea as an Emission Control Area (ECA). Ships without scrubbers that sail through ECA zones must use fuels with a maximum sulphur content of 0.1pc, such as marine gasoil (MGO) and ultra low sulphur fuiel oil (ULSFO). LNG bunker sales in Rotterdam fell by the 13pc on the quarter in January-March, reflecting a price rally at the Dutch TTF gas hub in late January and early February. The Argus northwest Europe LNG bunker price stood at a two-year high of €64.35/MWh on 6 February. LNG bunker sales were still higher than in the first quarter last year, which likely stems from the introduction of the FuelEU Maritime regulations.

NEa tracks first maritime CO₂ submissions

Amsterdam, 22 April (Argus) — The Netherlands Emissions Agency (NEa) has reported that shipping companies are being held financially accountable for the first time for their CO₂ emissions under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The companies are now required to report their 2024 emissions and will have to surrender corresponding carbon allowances by 30 September. Of the 378 shipping companies assigned to the Netherlands by the European Commission, roughly 60pc met the initial 31 March deadline for submitting verified emissions reports. The group represents more than 1,400 vessels, around 75pc of which are operated by companies registered in the Netherlands and 25pc outside the EU. An additional 14pc of companies filed their reports after the deadline, bringing overall compliance to 74pc as of mid-April. NEa expects more reports to follow. Under the revised EU ETS , shippers have to surrender ETS allowances for 50pc of GHG emissions for extra-EU journeys. Surrender obligations for intra-EU shipping are phased in at 40pc of verified emissions reported for 2024, 70pc for 2025 and 100pc for 2026 onwards. From 2026, shipping firms will also have to report emissions of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). The EU sees the move as essential to meeting its climate targets, as shipping alone accounted for over 124mn t of CO₂ emissions in 2021, according to the commission's report.

The solar expansion is the latest energy initiative at the airport, helping maximize the property by adding to the first-in-the-world microgrid already in place.
The solar expansion is set to be completed in 2027 and will be located adjacent to existing solar panels just off of the airport’s exit from I-376.
“Pittsburgh International Airport is an energy leader, and we are thrilled to partner with Duquesne Light Company and IMG for this important regional project,” said Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis.
“IMG is excited to build on the success of the Pittsburgh International Airport microgrid, which combines high-efficiency thermal generation with a utility-scale solar array, by more than doubling our existing solar energy production,” said Mike Brady, vice president of Power Generation Execution at Liberty Energy.","Pittsburgh International Airport, in partnership with Duquesne Light Company (DLC) and IMG Energy Solutions, a Liberty Energy company, on April 29 announced an expansion of a solar field as part of the airport’s energy innovation plans. The project marks DLC’s first power purchase agreement, boosting local energy production and economic development while making clean energy more accessible for the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania region.

The expansion will add 11,216 high-efficiency solar panels to the existing solar field, enabling the generation of an additional 4.7 MW of clean energy, and reducing carbon emissions by about 5 million pounds per year. The electricity generated from the new solar field will be supplied to the regional electric grid, providing the region with additional renewable energy and further enabling DLC’s vision of a clean-energy future.

The solar expansion is the latest energy initiative at the airport, helping maximize the property by adding to the first-in-the-world microgrid already in place. The airport also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel on-site. The solar expansion is set to be completed in 2027 and will be located adjacent to existing solar panels just off of the airport’s exit from I-376.

“The expansion of more than 11,000 solar panels to Pittsburgh International Airport’s existing solar field is a fantastic step toward a more sustainable energy future for our region,” said Allegheny County Executive Sara Innamorato. “I’m thrilled that our airport is an energy leader and that our local partners in DLC and IMG are able to help make important projects like this a reality.”

The new solar project complements the airport’s existing eight-acre solar array by adding an additional 12 acres atop a closed landfill—land otherwise not suitable for development.

“Pittsburgh International Airport is an energy leader, and we are thrilled to partner with Duquesne Light Company and IMG for this important regional project,” said Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis. “We are maximizing the use of airport assets for the betterment of the region—from air service to real estate development to energy innovation and there’s more to come.”

The original eight acres contain nearly 10,000 solar panels as part of the airport’s 23-MW microgrid project, launched in 2021 as the first to completely power an airport through natural gas and solar energy. The microgrid increases resiliency and reduces costs.

“DLC is thrilled to be part of this groundbreaking project that highlights the vision of Pittsburgh International Airport as well as the strength of public-private partnerships in delivering meaningful progress for the Pittsburgh region,” said Kevin Walker, president and CEO of DLC. “By expanding access to clean energy for local homes and businesses, we’re helping to drive economic growth and bringing to life our vision of a more sustainable future for all. This project represents an important step in delivering more renewable energy to our communities, friends and neighbors.”

The expanded solar field will be owned and operated by IMG, with a commitment to supply 100% of its generated energy, along with the Renewable Energy Credits, to DLC. This agreement ensures that DLC can utilize the clean energy to support the electricity needs of its default service customers who do not actively select an electricity supplier outside of DLC.

“IMG is excited to build on the success of the Pittsburgh International Airport microgrid, which combines high-efficiency thermal generation with a utility-scale solar array, by more than doubling our existing solar energy production,” said Mike Brady, vice president of Power Generation Execution at Liberty Energy. “Our expertise in thermal and renewable generation allows us to seamlessly integrate solar into critical infrastructure while meeting the evolving needs of our partners. This project reinforces our commitment to delivering flexible, high-performance energy solutions that provide reliable, low-emissions power.

The agreement supports the airline’s decarbonisation strategy and is expected to unlock the SAF value chain through the combination of ATOBA’s SAF aggregation, enabling management of pricing and supply volatility risk for airlines, and World Fuel’s global jet fuel logistics, blending, storage, and distribution infrastructure.

The agreement is an important step toward scaling advanced SAF technologies and is intended to support the decarbonisation of easyJet. The SAF market is facing challenges in expanding at the rate demanded by environmental needs and regulatory mandates. While producers need long-term, stable pricing contracts to ensure a return on their investments, easyJet is seeking competitive SAF market prices in the context of a nascent industry with diverse competing technologies. This conflict of expectations currently hinders the development of SAF production projects, and ATOBA’s unique business model brings a compelling solution.

ATOBA uniquely facilitates the development of SAF production through its upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolio management. By offtaking from diversified producers that use production technologies like Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch, or Power to Liquids, ATOBA mitigates technological and pricing risks associated with the various SAF production pathways and facilitates the closing of long-term offtake agreements among airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers, and financial institutions, which are essential for scaling the industry.

World Fuel intends to manage logistics, blending, storage and regulatory fulfillment for the EU and UK mandates. World Fuel’s role in ensuring the seamless integration of SAF into easyJet’s supply chain underscores the parties’ joint commitment to developing an efficient and compliant end-to-end sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

Raminder Shergill, Director of Tax & Fuel Strategy at easyJet commented: “We are deeply committed to fostering the growth of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel industry and are thrilled to see ATOBA introduce their innovative approach to catalysing the development of the SAF market. By addressing the long-term offtake challenges that have hindered investment in SAF projects, ATOBA’s approach paves the way for accelerated industry expansion, greater investment confidence, and credible pricing and supply security for easyJet”.

Arnaud Namer, co-founder and CEO of ATOBA Energy, stated: “We are proud to partner with easyJet and World Fuel, two aviation industry leaders taking bold and proactive steps to accelerate aviation’s transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels. With their expertise in highly efficient operational cost management, they are setting a strong precedent for the industry. We are excited to support their transition through our SAF aggregation services, providing airlines with long-term competitive advantages as they shift toward more sustainable fuels.”

SAFFiRE Renewables was purchased by Southwest Airlines just over one year ago, in March 2024.
SAFFiRE Renewables is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures (SARV), which is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines.
According to its most recent annual report, Southwest Airlines spent $5.8 billion on fuel in 2024, which accounted for 21.4% of its operating expenses.
In 2024 Southwest consumed 2.19 billion gallons of fuel, according to the company’s annual report.","The divestment comes at the behest of activist investor Elliott Investment Management, sources said, a group that has recently brought about a slew of changes to longtime policies at Southwest – such as introducing assigned seating and charging for luggage.

The activist investor “has come in and demanded that all SAF purchases have to be at parity with the cost of jet fuel, full stop,” one source said. “It kneecaps their ability to source SAF.”

“They’re shopping around SAFFiRE Renewables, trying to sell it,” a second source said. SAFFiRE Renewables was purchased by Southwest Airlines just over one year ago, in March 2024.

SAFFiRE is currently building a pilot SAF production plant near Liberal, Kansas, that will produce very low carbon intensity cellulosic ethanol from corn stover, which can be used to produce SAF via the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathway.

The Kansas pilot plant project is supported by the US Department of Energy and uses technology from the DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The original plan was for SAFFiRE’s cellulosic ethanol to be converted into SAF by LanzaJet, which is in the process of starting up a commercial-sized AtJ pilot plant near Soperton, Georgia.

SAFFiRE Renewables is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures (SARV), which is itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines. One source thought that SARV could also be brought to an end, but this point was less certain.

When Southwest purchased SAFFiRE last year, Bob Jordan, Southwest’s chief executive officer, said that “championing SAF is a key pillar of Southwest’s Nonstop to Net Zero plan and our work toward a sustainable future for air travel.”

Southwest continues to procure SAF

When asked, Southwest Airlines did not comment on the divestment from SAFFiRE Renewables, but stated, “Southwest continues to procure SAF and most recently signed a SAF offtake agreement with Prime Energy for 1.7 million gallons of SAF annually for a five-year deal, effective once Prime begins production.”

Prime Energy is an agreement between Norway’s Prime Capital and renewable energy company RES to build an e-SAF production plant in northern Sweden. No time frame has been announced for the completion of this plant.

The comment from Southwest further stated that it is “seeking deals that align with our transformational efforts.”

Southwest has a standing agreement with Valero Energy from October 2024 to purchase a minimum of 3.6 million gallons of neat SAF over a two-year period, with delivery at Chicago Midway International Airport. The airline uses about 240 million gallons of fuel at Chicago Midway each year, according to its own press releases.

According to its most recent annual report, Southwest Airlines spent $5.8 billion on fuel in 2024, which accounted for 21.4% of its operating expenses. This percentage is the second lowest reported by Southwest in fifteen years, only slightly higher than the one given for 2020, when global air travel was significantly affected by the outbreak of the Covid pandemic. Fuel has been declining as a percentage of annual operating expenses for Southwest since 2011, when it accounted for 38% of expenditures.

In the same report, the company said “even a small change in market fuel prices can significantly affect profitability.” Within the report, the company also gave extensive reasoning for why its ability to utilize SAF could be limited, and that the company may instead use carbon offsets to achieve mandatory climate obligations or voluntary climate goals.

Originally a government-sponsored project, Heart Aerospace was founded by CEO Anders Forslund in 2018, and has received investment from Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, the EIC fund, EQT Ventures and Norrsken VC, among others.

But the company has struggled to crack Europe, resulting in its latest decision to focus on America. ""As our customers, partners, and investors are increasingly based in the US, we see greater opportunity in focusing our resources here,” said CEO and cofounder Forslund in a statement.

The move means the 75 employees based in Sweden will either have to find a new employer or apply for a few specialist roles the company plans to fill with former Swedish employees with cutting-edge expertise.

Forslund has already moved to Los Angeles, alongside cofounder and wife Klara Forslund, to oversee the company’s US operations. The company relocated its R&D center and its full-scale aircraft demonstrator to the area last year.

Heart Aerospace has raised another $40m

Following Heart’s $107m Series B in 2024, the hybrid plane startup has also raised another $40m earlier this spring, according to the company statement.

Forslund describes how grateful he is for the team and the support he has received in Sweden, however, by focusing fully on the US, “we can accelerate development, strengthen collaboration, and better position Heart Aerospace for the future,"" he said.

Heart’s hybrid 30-seater plane is scheduled to take to the air in 2025.

In the first few years, the company planned to build a 19-seater electric plane, but in 2022, the plan for the smaller plane was scrapped to focus on a 30-seater plane, the ES-30, which will be able to take passengers 200km (from Brussels to Amsterdam, for example) on electric power, and double that distance — Paris to Munich — with hybrid-electric.

Heart Aerospace backed by US Airlines

Whilst Norway aims to operate all short- and medium-haul flights with electric planes by 2040, the rest of Europe hasn’t been as forthcoming about the new technology.

In recent years, discussions at the European Parliament have been focused on increasing the proportion of fuel in planes that comes from biomaterials instead of focus on new technologies, such as electric or hydrogen, according to Simon McNamara, director of government and industry affairs at Heart.

“Within Europe there is a big political focus on SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) as the solution to meeting the sector target of net zero by 2050, but the reality is that SAF will only get us around 70% of the way there under any net zero roadmaps,” McNamara said last year.

Outside of Europe, things have been rosier for Heart. In July 2021, American airlines Mesa and United Airlines invested in Heart and put in an order for 200 planes. A year later, Air Canada put in an order for 30 and Air New Zealand is also working with Heart.

It isn’t clear if Europe’s reduced interest in electric or hydrogen driven planes played a part in Heart’s move to the US. However, as in the case of Heart, most startups pick revenue creation over less soft questions such as Europe as its tech hub.","https://images.sifted.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/01103439/Heart-aerospace-es-30.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=75&fit=crop&auto=compress,format",N,,2025-04-30 05:56:50.277663

The SAF unit operates under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme, overseeing the entire value chain—from raw material procurement to distribution.
“This is Thailand’s first fully integrated Neat SAF production facility,” said Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation.
In addition to Neat SAF, the unit also produces Bio-LPG and Bio-Naphtha as byproducts.
This development positions Bangchak as a regional leader in clean aviation fuel and aligns with broader national and global carbon reduction goals.","In a landmark step toward decarbonizing aviation, Bangchak Group has officially launched Thailand’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production Unit at its Phra Khanong Refinery. Operated by BSGF Company Limited, a Bangchak affiliate, the unit is the country’s first dedicated facility capable of producing 100% Neat SAF at scale, marking a pivotal moment in Thailand’s clean energy journey.

The facility, which began Plant Performance Test Runs in April, boasts an initial daily capacity of 1 million liters. Using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, it transforms used cooking oil and other fatty acid feedstocks into ASTM-compliant aviation fuel. The SAF unit operates under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme, overseeing the entire value chain—from raw material procurement to distribution.

“This is Thailand’s first fully integrated Neat SAF production facility,” said Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation. “It exemplifies our commitment to energy innovation and reinforces our position as a pioneer in future energy solutions.”

The project was developed in collaboration with Desmet (Belgium) for pretreatment processes and UOP Honeywell (USA) for advanced hydroprocessing technology, ensuring rigorous quality control from hydrogenation to molecular restructuring and fuel fractionation.

In addition to Neat SAF, the unit also produces Bio-LPG and Bio-Naphtha as byproducts.

Globally, SAF is emerging as a key lever in reducing aviation emissions, which currently account for roughly 492 million tons of CO₂ annually, according to the IEA and ICAO. SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, offering a scalable, cost-effective alternative to conventional jet fuels. Countries like the EU, UK, and Singapore have already introduced SAF blending mandates, and Thailand is currently reviewing similar regulations.

Beyond climate benefits, SAF contributes to improved air quality. Its low sulfur and aromatic content helps reduce PM2.5 emissions and mitigates acid rain risks.

Bangchak’s SAF initiative builds on two decades of experience in renewable energy. The journey began in 2000 with biodiesel R&D in partnership with the Royal Thai Naval Dockyard, followed by the country’s first commercial biodiesel launch in 2004. In 2008, Bangchak introduced a used cooking oil buy-back program to secure community-based feedstock.

Today, through its “Fry to Fly” campaign, Bangchak collects used cooking oil at over 290 service stations nationwide, with plans to expand to 2,000 locations by the end of 2025. The company is also preparing to introduce a Book & Claim system, enabling verified carbon credit claims for SAF usage by airlines and passengers—a move aimed at accelerating sustainable aviation adoption.

This development positions Bangchak as a regional leader in clean aviation fuel and aligns with broader national and global carbon reduction goals.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/26-2.png,N,,2025-04-30 02:56:28.655688

The airport will partner with utility Duquesne Light Co. and developer IMG Energy Solutions to expand its solar field as part of site energy innovation plans. The expansion will add 11,216 high-efficiency solar panels to enable an additional 4.7 MW of photovoltaic power capacity.

In 2021, Pittsburgh International Airport celebrated commissioning of its own airport microgrid, centered by a 23-MW gas-fired gen-set and solar combination. The microgrid was never owned by the airport but originally by Essential Utilities and now is owned by Cordia. Jennbacher gas-fired gen-sets powered the microgrid which supported the airport’s main campus, while solar energy capacity, which is owned and operated by IMG, was separated and autonomous to energize nearly two dozen meters on the airport grounds and sell back into the PJM Interconnection transmission grid.

The new solar expansion, which will be adjacent to the existing arrays close to the airport’s exit from I-376, is expected to be completed and operational by 2027.

The Pittsburgh International Airport microgrid preceded several high-profile airport microgrid projects lately, including the massive JFK International Airport microgrid development under construction in New York.

“Pittsburgh International Airport is an energy leader, and we are thrilled to partner with Duquesne Light Company and IMG for this important regional project,” said Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis in a statement. “We are maximizing the use of airport assets for the betterment of the region – from air service to real estate development to energy innovation and there’s more to come.”

One hundred percent of the new solar output will be interconnected and delivered into the Duquesne Light Co. (DLC) distribution grid. IMG will also own and operate the solar expansion.

“DLC is thrilled to be part of this groundbreaking project that highlights the vision of Pittsburgh International Airport as well as the strength of public-private partnerships in delivering meaningful progress for the Pittsburgh region,” said Kevin Walker, president and CEO of Duquesne Light Co. “By expanding access to clean energy for local homes and businesses, we’re helping to drive economic growth and bringing to life our vision of a more sustainable future for all. This project represents an important step in delivering more renewable energy to our communities, friends and neighbors.”

The original microgrid, built at no cost to the airport, is interconnected to the PJM grid, although it can operate in island mode under a grid outage scenario. This proof of concept, however, went through a few challenges along the way.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/04/681110cb8f1508e4f43aca8d-blue_sky_news_pia.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-04-30 07:56:22.387611
