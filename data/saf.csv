2025 Alternative Power Survey findings and analysis

Following a turbulent year, the alternative power truck market appears to be entering a period of recalibration in 2026.

While it's impossible to predict the next 12 months with certainty, trends from the last few years suggest that electrification, both BEV and FCEV, is likely to remain in a delayed state.

TRC's Nate Springer, who leads the State of Sustainable Fleets project with support from Penske, Volvo, S&P Global Mobility, and Exelon, summarized the current landscape for Clean Trucking:

""We're seeing a reset and refocusing in the MD and HD EV markets after initial exuberance of 2020–2024. The foundations for future growth are still there, but I would expect a year or two of declining sales from 2024's record, product consolidation by manufacturers to focus on the best uses like yard tractors and delivery vans, and charging development in lowest-cost electricity markets with shared or behind the fence facilities. As those products and projects emerge, we'll also see growing data on use cases where EVs can cut costs for fleets even if battery costs remain flat.""

Tumultuous 2025

2025 brought several political and financial setbacks for commercial zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)—including battery-electrics (BEVs) and hydrogen fuel-cell (FCEV) models—affecting manufacturers and some government bodies such as the California Air Resources Board (CARB), but overall momentum has not collapsed, but has rather entered ""peak uncertainty.""

[Related: 2025 State of Sustainable Fleets Report - What you need to know]

If anything, now is an ideal time for the industry and companies to recalibrate and adapt to new realities. For some companies, however, recovery is likely out of reach.

Once-promising startups like Nikola Motors, Bollinger Motors, and battery-swap specialist Ample filed for bankruptcy. Is this necessarily bad news? While the market has clearly spoken to a degree, legacy OEMs are far from abandoning ZEVs. If anything, they're taking a cautious wait-and-see stance as the second Trump administration enters its second year.

OEMs may also be waiting on the sidelines anticipating the market debut of the Tesla Semi, which is due to begin series production in Nevada later this year. China's Windrose Global E700, a Tesla Semi competitor, received homologation for the U.S. in December.

So, where do BEV and FCEV trucks stand today? Will natural gas—specifically Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) along with biodiesel and renewable diesel—continue to be the most effective way to reduce C02 emissions while electrification and infrastructure mature? What role will the federal and state governments play?

And how do CCJ, Overdrive, and Clean Trucking readers who took part in our annual Alternative Power Survey perceive the current landscape? The survey explored the state of electric commercial vehicle adoption and the reasons many fleets haven't made the shift yet. More on that shortly.

Battery-electric vehicles

BEVs may be down, but they're not out. In fact, the medium-duty commercial BEV industry, currently valued at around $23 billion, continues to show progress.

Late last year, for example, Workhorse and Motive Electric Trucks finalized their merger, and Harbinger Motors raised $160 million in funding co-led by FedEx.

The segment also shows promise thanks to proven use cases, such as electrified garbage truck fleets. Despite the challenges, legacy OEMs also continue to invest and launch new MD BEV offerings.

At the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), analysts from McKinsey & Company validated the view that the brightest spots for commercial zero-emission vehicles in North America are school buses, final-mile delivery, and yard and terminal tractors.

Unfortunately, there have been some notable disappointments.

Michigan-based Bollinger Motors collapse in late November was somewhat surprising, as the company had supposedly resolved earlier financial issues and emerged from court-appointed receivership after Mullen Automotive increased its ownership stake.

In another unexpected move last fall, GM pulled the plug on the Chevrolet Brightdrop last-mile delivery van—a direct competitor to the Rivian Electric Delivery Vehicle (EDV).

Quebec-based electric school bus manufacturer Lion Electric, since renamed LION, filed for bankruptcy in December 2024. Last spring, it was forced to ground its surviving 1,200-unit fleet in the Montreal area due to fire concerns. Although the issue was resolved quickly, other safety concerns—which continue to affect several U.S. school districts—remain unresolved. LION's new owners later declared U.S. warranties null and void, a controversial decision that has left districts in the lurch, forcing them to return aging diesel buses to service to pick up the slack.

The company is currently under investigation by several U.S. law firms for potential federal law violations.

Meanwhile, Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) and Trucking-as-a-Service (TaaS) business models—pioneered by companies like WattEV and Zeem Solutions—are gaining traction, particularly in Class 8 drayage operations. So far, these deployments are largely concentrated in California and have yet to expand to long-haul, cross-country routes typically handled by diesel and RNG/CNG-powered semis. The broader coast-to-coast rollout remains to be seen.

[Related: WattEV CEO knows how to electrify freight at diesel prices]

In summary, light- and medium-duty commercial BEVs continue to prove themselves across a range of applications, while long-haul, heavy-duty Class 8 BEVs still have significant ground to cover.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

Nikola's bankruptcy was, without question, the most significant headline in the commercial FCEV space over the past 12 months. Clean Trucking covered several post-bankruptcy stories, including a Toronto-area hydrogen fueling station that received funding but ultimately never came to fruition.

Last August, Austin, Texas-based Hyroad Energy won the bankruptcy auction for Nikola, acquiring 113 Tre fuel-cell electric semi-trucks along with spare parts, software platforms, operational infrastructure, and related intellectual property. A few months later, the company confirmed plans to restore the trucks' subscription service, provide ongoing support and maintenance, and revive Nikola's hydrogen refueling network in California and Texas.

In an unexpected move at ACT 2025, Honda revealed its Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell truck concept powered by three fuel cell modules. The OEM confirmed the module will enter production in 2027 but no word yet whether it'll be paired with the semi.

Hyundai remains the only legacy OEM to mass-produce a road-legal heavy-duty FCEV Class 8 semi, the XCIENT, though sales have been limited. To date, 35 units have been deployed in California through the NorCAL ZERO Project, with an additional five trucks supported by the EPA's Targeted Airshed Grants program. Hyundai has also introduced 21 XCIENTs to support production at its Metaplant America facility in Georgia.

Further dampening hopes for hydrogen fueling was the DOE's October announcement canceling billions of dollars in green hydrogen production projects.

Despite some ongoing development, FCEV commercial vehicle technology has not achieved sustained momentum in North America, and the government's recent decision further complicates progress.

Alternative fossil fuels

While electrification continues to face significant hurdles, alternatives to traditional diesel—particularly RNG and CNG—are gaining momentum, along with biodiesel and renewable diesel. Traditional diesel remains the dominant fuel of choice for fleets, according to an ATRI survey, while liquefied natural gas (LNG) is also steadily growing in popularity.

As a quick refresher, RNG comes from organic waste like farms or landfills, making it renewable and often carbon negative. CNG is regular natural gas that's been compressed for vehicle use. LNG is natural gas cooled to a liquid state.

[Related: As electric truck demand slows, CNG and RNG-powered trucks accelerate]

RNG recently gained bipartisan support when the House and Senate proposed last April the Renewable Natural Gas Incentive Act of 2025, which would provide a $1.00 per gallon tax credit for RNG used in transportation through 2035. In addition, trucking groups applauded the Trump administration's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which restored tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel.

The market launch of the Cummins X15N engine continues to further strengthen the business case for natural gas fuel options, attracting major customers such as Walmart and legacy OEMs like Peterbilt and Kenworth.

Also noteworthy is that six of the 13 vehicles that took part in the North American Council for Freight Efficiency's (NACFE) 2025 'Run on Less' event last summer either ran on biodiesel, renewable diesel, or natural gas. As fleets weigh the ongoing challenges of electrification, alternatives like RNG, CNG, biodiesel, and renewable diesel continue to gain popularity.

[Related: Hexagon Agility's CNG systems equip 100 Cummins-powered natural gas trucks in Mexico]

NACFE Executive Director Mike Roeth, however, flagged a potential challenge:

""I'm worried that truck OEMs are spreading themselves across too many technologies, which could reduce their scale,"" he warned.

2025 Alt Power Survey

As the push toward cleaner transportation accelerates, our annual Alternative Power Survey revealed how fleet operators are navigating the shift to electrified trucking, highlighting everything from charging challenges and infrastructure concerns to opinions on electric truck manufacturers, and offering a clear view of what's driving—and slowing—the adoption of electric trucks across the industry.

The Alt Power Survey, which ran from February 11 to February 26, 2025, asked respondents questions regarding their fleet size, truck counts, and operating regions. It also gathered viewpoints on fuel economy regulations, many of which have since been rolled back by the Trump administration.

Of course, special thanks goes out to our readers who took part in the survey. Your time and opinions are greatly appreciated.

General findings

The 2025 Alt Power Survey revealed that while the trucking industry, represented by a mix of owner-operators and fleet management, was concerned about new emission mandates from the previous administration, as well as continued reservations about adopting alternative fuels. The primary obstacles identified for both BEVs and FCEVs are the lack of robust fueling/charging infrastructure, high upfront costs, and inadequate vehicle range for demanding operations, specifically long-haul.

Despite these hurdles, 48% of respondents reported they are actively engaged in early-stage discussions and taking immediate steps to reduce emissions, such as maximizing diesel efficiency. However, the disparity grew between fleets and owner-operators with 68% of fleets more likely to be in the ""discussion"" phase compared to the latter at 38%.

The survey also highlighted the competitive landscape, revealing divided opinions on which company is leading the BEV and FCEV race, as well as varying levels of engagement with state and federal grants and infrastructure investments—underscoring the industry's cautious and fragmented approach to the gradual zero-emission transition.

In general, a ""wait and see"" stance dominated, particularly among owner-operators, nearly half of whom (45%) have not engaged in any discussions about transitioning away from diesel. While larger fleets appear more proactive, with 68% involved in early-stage talks, the vast majority remain in a research only phase, mainly because they're hesitant to commit to major transitions amid economic uncertainty.

Rather than making the immediate leap to BEVs or FCEVs, the industry is largely leaning on diesel efficiency. Most respondents prefer to maximize current technology as their most effective tool for emissions reduction, such as prioritizing the purchase of late-model Class 8 trucks, aerodynamic kits, and idle-reduction systems.

In today's economic climate, the general sentiment suggests that achieving cleaner diesel is a far more realistic and attainable goal for most carriers than zero emissions.",https://img.cleantrucking.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/truck-at-charging-station.pdbpYxNZ2k.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-16 15:57:25.397759

Gevo expects to lead the initial deployment of its ETO technology in North America, supporting rural economic development, creating skilled jobs, and strengthening domestic renewable fuel infrastructure.","Gevo, Inc., a prominent innovator in renewable fuels, sustainable chemicals, and carbon management solutions, has announced a significant expansion of its intellectual property portfolio with the granting of a new U.S. patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (United States Patent and Trademark Office) has awarded the company U.S. Patent No. 12,486,207 B2, strengthening legal protections around Gevo’s proprietary Ethanol-to-Olefins (ETO) technology and its application in renewable fuel production.

This newly issued patent broadens coverage for a variety of catalyst combinations and, importantly, provides explicit protection for the use of ETO pathways to produce transportation fuels. By reinforcing ownership over critical process innovations, the patent enhances Gevo’s ability to commercialize next-generation renewable fuels while safeguarding competitive advantages in a rapidly evolving clean energy market.

Gevo is actively advancing its ETO technology through strategic collaborations with leading global partners. For renewable chemical applications, the company is working with LG Chem, Ltd. to deploy Gevo’s next-generation ETO process. In parallel, Gevo has partnered with Axens and IFP Energies nouvelles (IFPEN) to adapt and scale the ETO technology specifically for fuel production, including sustainable aviation fuel.

The patented ETO process converts ethanol into light olefins, which are highly versatile intermediates used across the fuels and chemicals value chain. These olefins can subsequently be upgraded into finished transportation fuels through commercially proven Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technologies. This integrated pathway allows ethanol—often produced from renewable, agricultural feedstocks—to serve as a foundation for lower-carbon jet fuel and other fuel products.

Beyond fuels, the olefins generated through Gevo’s ETO platform can be used to manufacture cost-competitive renewable chemical building blocks such as bio-propylene. These materials are essential inputs for a wide range of everyday products, offering an additional revenue stream and strengthening the economic case for ETO deployment.

Technologically, ETO continues to show meaningful progress. According to Gevo, ongoing advancements are expected to reduce both capital and operating expenses by up to 35% compared to conventional approaches. Such cost reductions are critical for accelerating market adoption, particularly in sectors like aviation where price sensitivity remains a major barrier to widespread use of renewable fuels.

Commenting on the patent award, Dr. Paul Bloom, President of Gevo, emphasized the strategic importance of the development. He noted that the company is focused on creating the most efficient and scalable routes to convert ethanol into fuels and chemicals. Securing this patent not only strengthens Gevo’s proprietary technology position but also enhances a more cost-effective pathway to renewable jet fuel for both Gevo and its partners. He added that the expanding intellectual property portfolio positions the company for long-term cost leadership in ATJ-based fuel production.

The project is expected to begin operations between the second half of 2028 and early 2029, reports Argus.

The proposed plant will be located in Devbhumi Dwarka district of Gujarat. The company expects to take a final investment decision on the project within the next few months, according to senior company officials. Once operational, the facility will process about one million tonnes of feedstock annually to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).

The plant will mainly use fats, oils and greases as raw material, with used cooking oil sourced from within India as well as from overseas markets. The company is also looking at other possible inputs such as animal fat, oil derived from palm oil mill waste, and non-edible oils.

Fuel produced at the facility will meet international sustainability standards. A significant share of the output will be sent to the United Kingdom for use at Essar’s Stanlow refinery, where it will be blended with conventional jet fuel and diesel to meet renewable fuel requirements. The remaining volumes are expected to be exported to other markets and supplied domestically once India introduces mandatory SAF usage.

India has set targets to blend SAF in international flights, starting with 1 per cent by 2027, increasing to 2 per cent by 2028 and reaching 5 per cent by 2030.

The Illinois method uses hydrothermal liquefaction — involving water, medium temperatures, and high pressure — to turn food waste into biocrude oil.","An innovative research group is turning food scraps into air miles.

That's because the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign team's process can convert the waste into sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, that meets industry performance standards without adding petroleum, according to a news release.

""This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,"" corresponding author Professor Yuanhui Zhang said.

It also helps limit pollution from two sources: food waste and plane exhaust.

The World Food Program reported that about 20% of food is wasted, or about a billion meals a day. Those scraps create harmful air pollution when they are dumped in a landfill to decompose.

For its part, aviation accounts for about 2% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, according to U.S. government data.

But the industry is working to operate more cleanly, and Illinois' circularly made SAF ""could help it meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" the experts stated. Net zero means that more air pollution is prevented, or removed through better processes, than is generated, according to the University of Oxford.

The Illinois method uses hydrothermal liquefaction — involving water, medium temperatures, and high pressure — to turn food waste into biocrude oil. Impurities like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur are removed, leaving crucial hydrocarbons (compounds of hydrogen and carbon).

Hydrogen and other catalysts are used to refine it into plane fuel. The team needed to test dozens of mixtures to find the right one.

Amazingly, the researchers said their technique mimics the natural creation of crude oil deep in the Earth without dinosaur bones.

""It uses high heat and pressure,"" lead author Sabrina Summers added. ""The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure.""

The researchers gathered scraps for their experiments from a nearby processing plant. They estimated that 30% of food is wasted worldwide at some point from farms to plates. The method can use other feedstock such as biowaste, manure, algal blooms, and sewage.

Other experts are pursuing cleaner flights as well. Hydrogen-powered and even electric planes are in development.

Battery power is already effective on the ground — electric vehicles prevent thousands of pounds of air pollution annually compared to gas-powered cars, per the U.S. Department of Energy. Air pollution creates smog that's harmful to human health. Eye irritation and cancer risks are concerns listed by the National Library of Medicine that worsen with longer exposure.

Drivers typically save about $1,500 a year in gas and service costs, thanks in part to nixing oil and other fluid changes. Those advantages could be realized for air travel, too, and Joby Aviation is among the companies bringing electric flight to fruition.

On the ground, Kelley Blue Book has a list of incentives for buying and charging EVs by state to get you started on making the switch.

At the University of Illinois, the researchers see their work as bending the traditional linear mindset when it comes to product use. And the process could also be leveraged to create petroleum-free compounds for other things, including plastic.

The in-depth analysis and recommendations outlined in the study offer actionable insights on scaling SAF adoption in the Chinese Mainland through market measures on both supply and demand fronts.

The study examines the challenges and untapped potential in scaling SAF in the Chinese Mainland, benchmarking global best practices while drawing parallels with China’s thriving solar photovoltaic industry. The report highlights China’s unique feedstock and manufacturing advantages, and projects long-term cost implications across different technical production pathways. Notably, the Power-to-Liquid (PtL) pathway — best known for producing electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) — shows the greatest potential for long-term cost reduction. The study notes that, with appropriate policy support, SAF produced locally via PtL may achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel (including China’s projected carbon price in 2030) when the cumulative eSAF output reaches 1.6 million tons.

In addition, the study recommends a multi-pronged approach to growing the national SAF industry and capturing long-term cost benefits, from policy integration and stimulating market demand to expanding international market access and establishing procurement mechanisms that ensure stable supply and demand.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “As a vital player in global aviation and the SAF ecosystem, the Chinese Mainland’s development of its domestic SAF industry not only capitalizes on global momentum and supports national carbon targets, but also helps promote the availability and affordability of SAF needed by the global aviation industry.

“This study by Peking University is encouraging, as it demonstrates the long-term potential for cost parity between SAF and conventional jet fuel, provided there is sufficient support for the development of new technologies and large-scale SAF production, along with policies that support SAF deployment from both demand and supply sides.

The baseline year for reduction goals is 2019.
eBay’s climate transition plan provides an inside-out view of the company’s impact on climate change and an outside-in perspective on physical and financial risks that could impact eBay’s business as weather patterns change and the world warms.
It is meant to motivate eBay partners, sellers and employees by linking climate goals more explicitly to the company’s long-term business and financial growth strategy, Morin said.
eBay published a “carrier engagement guide” in 2024 that outlines its minimum expectations of shipping and logistics partners.","eBay, the world’s biggest resale company, has joined the growing cohort of companies that have published a climate transition plan outlining specific steps needed to meet corporate emissions reduction targets.

Delivering the goods sold by the 134 million sellers on its marketplace to their customers is eBay’s biggest greenhouse gas liability: it accounts for almost 84 percent of total emissions.

The 30-year-old company vows to cut that footprint by 27.5 percent by 2030 — it has already achieved a 21 percent reduction — and to reach a 90 percent cut across all emissions categories by 2045. The baseline year for reduction goals is 2019.

Those commitments were validated in 2025 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the 37-page roadmap published Jan. 14 is a “natural follow-on” to the many cross-function conversations and data-modeling exercises required to come up with the goals, said eBay Chief Sustainability Officer Renee Morin.

“This is not a report that came out of the blue,” she said.

Approximately one-quarter of companies that report greenhouse gas emissions to research firm CDP have published a climate transition plan, but that number is growing rapidly because of anticipated regulatory changes in Europe and potential requirements as part of the forthcoming overhaul of SBTi’s Corporate Net Zero Standard.

eBay’s climate transition plan provides an inside-out view of the company’s impact on climate change and an outside-in perspective on physical and financial risks that could impact eBay’s business as weather patterns change and the world warms. It is meant to motivate eBay partners, sellers and employees by linking climate goals more explicitly to the company’s long-term business and financial growth strategy, Morin said.

Certain sections of the plan are likely to be updated on an annual basis, but eBay hasn’t finalized a schedule.

“At the end of the day, when you can show the value of sustainability, the value of decarbonizing, the value of derisking systems, then businesses are going to lean into those outputs,” she said.

For example, eBay acknowledges in the report that shipping partners may be adversely affected by flooding, extreme heat or natural disasters exacerbated by climate change. It’s in their interest to collaborate with eBay on potential solutions, the report suggests.

Prioritizing carriers

eBay doesn’t own fleets or warehouses. But it is prioritizing relationships with carriers including DHL, UPS and FedEx that have explicit goals to decarbonize their operations through investments in electric delivery vehicles and procurement of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). FedEx, for example, has committed to shifting all of its new vehicle purchases to electric models by 2030. UPS and DHL have similar EV buying plans, and both aim to use SAF for 30 percent of their air operations before 2035.

Other strategies eBay is expanding: local delivery options and the use of ground shipping versus air freight, which generates higher emissions.

eBay published a “carrier engagement guide” in 2024 that outlines its minimum expectations of shipping and logistics partners. It requires all to set short- and long-term emissions reductions goals that are certified by an independent organization and to report annually on strategies for renewable energy, sustainable packaging and operational efficiencies.

In order to reach net zero by 2045, eBay estimates it will need to work with carriers to cut emissions from those activities by 46 percent.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ebay_DSC5412.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:56:39.799641

The Europe sustainable finance market size was calculated to be USD 276.75 billion in 2025 and is anticipated to be worth USD 1,807 billion by 2034, growing from USD 340.92 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 23.18% during the forecast period.

Sustainable finance refers to the integration of environmental, social, and governance criteria into financial decision-making to redirect capital toward long-term ecological resilience and societal well-being. Unlike conventional finance, it embeds planetary boundaries and just transition principles into lending, investment, and risk assessment frameworks. The European Union has institutionalized this paradigm through binding regulatory architecture, including the Taxonomy Regulation, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. As per the European Commission, around 50000 companies across the EU are now required to disclose detailed sustainability performance data under the CSRD starting from 2025. Furthermore, the European Central Bank has already conducted a comprehensive climate-focused stress test across a wide range of significant institutions to evaluate their preparedness and the systemic risks related to climate change. According to sources, the European Union continues to work towards its ambitious climate neutrality goal, a target that experts and institutions suggest will require substantial, ongoing annual investment across various strategic sectors to bridge the funding gap. This systemic recalibration of capital allocation mechanisms positions Europe not merely as a market but as a regulatory laboratory for global sustainable finance standards.

MARKET DRIVERS

Mandatory ESG Disclosure Requirements Are Reshaping Capital Allocation Incentives

The enforcement of granular sustainability reporting obligations under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive has fundamentally altered how financial institutions assess risk and opportunity, which drives the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. A substantial number of European entities must now provide extensive sustainability disclosures, including all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions, under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. This data transparency enables asset managers to align portfolios with the EU Taxonomy’s technical screening criteria, which define what constitutes environmentally sustainable economic activity. European asset managers are increasingly integrating EU Taxonomy alignment metrics into their reporting, driven by regulatory obligations and growing market demand. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority observes a general increase in the number of insurers incorporating climate-related physical and transition risks into their overall risk and solvency assessments. These regulatory mandates reduce information asymmetry and create a level playing field where capital naturally flows toward verifiable sustainability performers rather than self-declared greenwashers. Consequently, demand for sustainable financial instruments, from green bonds to sustainability-linked loans, has shifted from voluntary preference to compliance-driven necessity.

Integration of Climate Risk Into Prudential Regulation Is Amplifying Institutional Demand

European financial supervisors have embedded climate considerations directly into capital adequacy and risk management frameworks, which propels the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. This compels banks and insurers to internalize long-term environmental externalities. In 2023, European authorities conducted simultaneous stress tests across a wide representation of the banking sector to assess resilience to economic and climate-related challenges. Recent European climate scenario analyses indicate that a sudden, disorderly shift to a green economy, combined with negative economic conditions, could lead to significantly elevated credit risk and increased potential losses in bank loan portfolios. As a result, the ECB now requires significant institutions to develop multiyear climate risk management plans as part of their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. Similarly, European regulatory bodies are consistently enhancing transparency requirements, mandating extensive annual public disclosures from banks regarding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and the carbon footprint of their lending activities. The Network for Greening the Financial System has expanded to include a substantial majority of central banks and financial supervisors globally, including the European Central Bank and many national central banks across the European Union. This regulatory pressure cascades into client engagement as banks adjust credit pricing based on borrowers’ decarbonization trajectories. Major private financial institutions are increasingly implementing innovative financial products, such as sustainability-linked loans, which adjust lending rates based on borrowers achieving specific, independently verified environmental performance targets. This systemic recalibration ensures that sustainable finance is not a niche product but a foundational component of financial resilience.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Persistent Data Fragmentation Undermines Comparable ESG Assessments

The region faces acute problems in data quality consistency and interoperability across sustainability metrics, despite ambitious disclosure mandates, which in turn impedes the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. Investment fund documentation often displays a lack of uniformity in how environmental alignment is measured and reported. Variations in calculation methods can lead to differing sustainability profiles for funds with comparable investment objectives. Corporate reporting frequently lacks comprehensive, verified data regarding indirect emissions within the broader supply chain. A significant portion of a company's environmental impact often stems from these indirect sources rather than direct operations. The absence of standardized disclosure practices complicates the ability of stakeholders to compare the ecological footprints of various market participants. This data gap forces financial institutions to rely on estimates, proxies, and third-party ratings that often lack transparency and exhibit low correlation. Mandated sustainability disclosures may just become a 'box-ticking' exercise without standardized digital reporting formats and public verification infrastructure, ultimately obscuring actual performance and eroding market integrity and investor trust.

Risk of Regulatory Arbitrage Due to Divergent National Implementation Timelines

The EU's sustainable finance framework is in place, but its inconsistent adoption across member states is causing fragmentation and compliance uncertainty, which limits the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. European Union member states have consistently worked toward a unified, phased implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation's detailed disclosure requirements across the entire bloc. This discrepancy enables firms to relocate fund domiciliation or reporting functions to jurisdictions with lighter supervisory scrutiny. Additionally, non-EU financial centers like Switzerland and the United Kingdom are developing parallel but non-equivalent standards. The United Kingdom and the European Union have developed distinct approaches to classifying sustainable economic activities, resulting in a divergence in the scope of their respective green taxonomies. This regulatory asymmetry complicates cross-border capital flows and increases compliance costs for multinational asset managers who must maintain multiple reporting systems. Jurisdictional inconsistency will continue to partially constrain the single market for sustainable finance until the ESAs achieve supervisory convergence through binding technical standards and on-site inspections.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Scaling Transition Finance for Hard-to-Abate Sectors Presents a Structural Opportunity

The region’s industrial decarbonization imperative has caused demand for transition finance mechanisms tailored to sectors where zero-emission technologies are not yet commercially viable, which provides new opportunities for the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. Heavy industries have historically been underrepresented in sustainable financing relative to their emissions contribution. A new legislative framework in the region now explicitly supports industrial transition pathways, making them eligible for sustainability-linked financing instruments. Central banking institutions have started accepting transition bonds from heavy industry entities as collateral, provided these bonds align with specific, verifiable environmental targets. Industry groups project the potential mobilization of significant private capital for industrial transition projects, contingent upon the adoption of standardized performance indicators and verification protocols. This structured approach transforms high-carbon sectors from sustainability liabilities into investable transition opportunities, thereby expanding the market beyond renewable energy and electric mobility into the core of Europe’s industrial fabric.

Digital Infrastructure for Verifiable Impact Tracking Is Unlocking New Product Innovation

The emergence of secure digital platforms for real-time sustainability data exchange is enabling novel financial instruments with dynamic pricing linked to verified environmental outcomes, which is expected to fuel the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. Several countries are piloting digital registries that link corporate environmental reporting with financial systems to automate compliance. Industrial networks are connecting manufacturers and suppliers to share audited supply chain carbon data, which banks are using to adjust lending rates. Regulatory authorities have endorsed the use of distributed ledger technology for verifying the impact of green bonds, potentially reducing reliance on third-party attestations. Tokenized sustainability-linked bonds issued on regulated platforms have experienced significant growth, driven by demand for transparent impact attribution. This digital layer transforms sustainable finance from static label-based categorization to continuous performance-based capital allocation, thereby enhancing credibility, scalability, and investor confidence in measurable environmental returns.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Greenwashing Allegations Are Eroding Market Credibility and Consumer Trust

The proliferation of unsubstantiated sustainability claims continues to affect market integrity and deter mainstream capital participation, which challenges the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. A significant number of reviewed product claims relating to environmental benefits have been found to lack clear substantiation or rely on general, non-standardized terminology. Moreover, a notable portion of investment funds marketed under the most stringent sustainability category have demonstrated limited alignment with established environmental criteria in initial portfolio evaluations. Discrepancies identified in the marketing and actual integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices have led to regulatory enforcement measures against specific asset managers. There is a developing trend of public caution, as recent surveys indicate that a minority of individual investors express confidence in the current labeling systems for sustainable investment funds. This credibility deficit increases due diligence costs for institutional allocators and discourages retail participation, and thereby constrains the market’s ability to achieve the scale necessary for systemic impact.

Talent Shortage in Interdisciplinary Sustainability Finance Expertise Is Constraining Implementation Capacity

There is a critical need for professionals with a versatile blend of financial acumen, climate science data analytics skills, and regulatory knowledge to successfully put the region's sustainable finance framework into action, a shortfall which hinders the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. A notable pattern across the industry indicates that few financial institutions have established fully staffed departments dedicated solely to sustainable finance initiatives or the granular verification of alignment with common sustainability frameworks. Across many financial institutions, a perceived gap is consistently noted in the number of employees possessing the specific training needed to interpret complex environmental scenario data for credit assessment. There appears to be an observed lag in the development of dedicated, specialized academic programs within higher education to support the growing workforce demands in sustainable finance. This human capital bottleneck delays product development, increases reliance on external consultants, and heightens compliance risks as institutions struggle to interpret evolving technical standards from the Platform on Sustainable Finance. Europe's ambitious sustainable finance goals risk outpacing actual capacity unless we invest together in reskilling and education reform.

REPORT COVERAGE

SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS

By Investment Type Insights

The fixed income instruments segment dominated the Europe sustainable finance market by accounting for a 58.6% share in 2024. The dominance of the fixed income instruments segment is driven by the maturity, reliability, and regulatory alignment of green and sustainability-linked bonds. A notable preference exists among specific large-scale investors for fixed income instruments, driven by their stable and foreseeable cash flow characteristics and suitability for matching their long-term financial obligations. The inclusion of certain green bonds within a major central bank's asset purchase initiatives has contributed to increased market depth and liquidity for these types of financial products. New regulatory measures establishing a regional standard for green bonds, which includes requirements for independent verification and specific alignment criteria, are strengthening investor confidence and mitigating concerns about misrepresentation of environmental claims. There has been substantial issuance of green bonds by regional entities, with the majority of proceeds directed toward financing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that satisfy stringent technical criteria. This convergence of regulatory credibility, institutional demand, and transparent use of proceeds solidifies fixed income as the backbone of Europe’s sustainable capital markets.

The mixed allocation strategies segment is anticipated to witness the fastest CAGR of 18.7% from 2025 to 2033 due to investor demand for diversified sustainable portfolios that combine equities, fixed income, and alternative assets under unified ESG mandates. New sustainable investment funds are increasingly adopting diversified strategies that combine different asset types to manage risk while pursuing positive environmental or social impacts. This shift is being accelerated by the regulatory environment, which encourages managers to define and categorize products based on sustainability objectives. Consequently, a growing share of funds with high sustainability classifications are utilizing mixed-allocation strategies. Innovations in ESG data integration platforms enable real-time portfolio rebalancing based on corporate decarbonization progress, enhancing responsiveness. Mixed allocation is becoming the primary vehicle for mainstream retail investor adoption, which offers a way to gain comprehensive sustainability exposure while maintaining portfolio diversification.

By Transaction Type Insights

The green bonds segment led the Europe sustainable finance market by capturing a 42.5% share in 2024. The leading position of the green brands segment is attributed to standardized frameworks, strong sovereign issuance, and corporate climate commitments. There is a significant and growing volume of green bonds in circulation within the region. Public sector entities represent a substantial share of the total market volume. A key pattern is the allocation of proceeds from specific public bond programs exclusively to climate and biodiversity initiatives. The market shows a movement towards enhanced standards and increased transparency. The vast majority of regional green bonds currently meet advanced transparency benchmarks, a higher rate than typically seen in the global market. This regulatory rigor, combined with central bank eligibility and strong secondary market liquidity, has made green bonds the default instrument for institutional investors seeking verifiable environmental impact without compromising credit quality.

The ESG investing segment is likely to experience the fastest CAGR of 21.3% during the forecast period, owing to mandatory disclosures and the integration of sustainability into core investment processes rather than as a niche overlay. Following the implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Level 2 in the European Union in early 2023, an extensive majority of asset managers have incorporated ESG factors into their fundamental investment analysis processes. This shift moves beyond exclusionary screening toward active ownership, including voting on climate resolutions and engaging with portfolio companies on decarbonization roadmaps. The number of ESG-focused shareholder resolutions in Europe has increased significantly in recent years, demonstrating growing investor activism on sustainability issues. Furthermore, the European Commission’s MiFID II amendments require financial advisors to assess clients’ sustainability preferences during suitability tests, directly channeling retail capital into ESG-integrated products. Unlike labeled bonds, ESG investing permeates the entire capital allocation system, making it a structural rather than thematic driver of market evolution.

By Industry Verticals Insights

The utilities and power segment held the largest share of 36.6% of Europe sustainable finance market. The leading position of the utilities and power segment is credited to its direct alignment with decarbonization imperatives and regulatory certainty. A forward-looking pattern indicates a planned and substantial increase in the share of renewable sources in the total electricity generation mix. The pursuit of these targets necessitates considerable financial investment in both power generation facilities and the associated power infrastructure. Large energy providers are actively directing capital towards funding key sustainable projects, such as those related to wind and solar energy, as well as grid modernization. A common regional framework is being used to define and evaluate which specific activities and assets qualify as sustainable. Specific regulatory requirements mean that all new major infrastructure developments now include a formal review of their environmental impact. The combination of market activity and regulatory alignment is creating a structured system for developing fundable, sustainable assets. This combination of policy clarity, scalable project sizes, and verified environmental outcomes makes the power sector the natural anchor for Europe’s sustainable capital markets.

The transport and logistics segment is on the rise and is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the market by witnessing a CAGR of 24.1% from 2025 to 2033. The rapid expansion of the transport and logistics segment is propelled by Europe’s aggressive vehicle electrification mandates and sustainable aviation fuel requirements. The adoption of electric vehicles across European markets has increased alongside expanded financial support for regional charging networks. New regulatory frameworks are encouraging the aviation industry to integrate sustainable fuels into its operations over the coming decades. Increased interest in biofuel production is being driven by long-term mandates for cleaner energy sources in the transport sector. Major logistics and shipping firms are utilizing specialized financial instruments to link corporate debt to environmental performance goals. Investment is being directed toward the development of innovative maritime vessels capable of running on alternative fuels. Sustainable transport has emerged as a primary focus for large-scale institutional financing compared to other economic sectors. Tighter EU CO2 emissions regulations for vehicles are accelerating the shift of investment capital into zero-emission logistics systems.

The Hague serves as a hub for sustainable finance due to a concentrated ecosystem of impact investors, green fintechs, and multilateral institutions, establishing the Netherlands as a trusted conduit for domestic and cross-border capital.

Sweden Sustainable Finance Market Analysis

Sweden is anticipated to expand in the European sustainable finance market from 2025 to 2033 due to its integration of social and environmental objectives within a universal banking model. A significant amount of managed assets is directed into new equity and fixed income funds designated as promoting environmental or social characteristics, or having a sustainable investment objective. The national central bank has incorporated a climate-related assessment criterion into its corporate bond acquisition strategy, resulting in the exclusion of entities associated with substantial fossil fuel exposure. The nation's electricity generation is predominantly derived from fossil-free sources, which helps facilitate the redirection of financial resources towards supporting a fair transition and initiatives focused on the preservation of biological diversity. Government-supported finance institutions are channeling a notable annual sum into infrastructure projects that are environmentally conscious and social housing programs. This holistic approach, blending climate neutrality, social equity, and financial innovation, positions Sweden as a benchmark for high ambition sustainable finance in Northern Europe.

Here he shares his perspective on how current trends may play out over the coming year and beyond.

Low-Cost Carriers Continue to Drive Airline Growth

Through to the end of this decade, expect most growth globally to be generated from the low-cost airline sector. Major low-cost operators are due to receive their latest aircraft orders and will expand their networks further. And for many of those airlines we should expect to see an ever-greater focus on ancillary product revenues and maybe even some premium products coming to the market.

Smart Airlines Will Gain an Advantage with AI

Expect lots of stories around AI and its increasing use in the industry with many of the developments in operational areas. Every slight efficiency gained by using AI should result in a cost benefit to the airlines and improved margins for those clever airlines that test thoroughly and adopt early.

Record Revenues For Many Airlines?

Based on current demand and capacity trends, 2026 looks set to be a good year with the potential for record levels of profitability for most airline CEOs with the potential for record levels of profitability. Even some of the less efficient national airlines could break even. Demand continues to be strong Ddespite concerns around economic growth and consumer confidence d, emand continues to be strong, and a weakening of the US Dollar would be a positive for many airlines.

Track Airfares Trends >>

Expect More Longer Narrow-Bodied Flights

In 2025, there were some 44,400 narrow-bodied flights - an increase of over 18% compared to 2024 - that lasted in excess of more than seven hours and thirty minutes, an increase of over 18% on the 2024 number. We expect that to comfortably break the 50,000 mark in 2026 with many transatlantic services added.

Airlines Will Adapt to Geo-Political Events – at a Cost

Sadly, the reach of geo-politics will never be far away and is always outside the control of the airlines that are inevitably impacted. Airlines and their management teams are very skilled at flipping capacity when necessary, but it always takes a lot of effort and cost.

Sustainability Will Improve, But Targets Remain Hard to Reach

Progress will be made on many sustainability fronts from Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through to airport facilities and operational vehicles, but meeting the industry’s targets remains almost impossible given where we are today.

Manchester, London Stansted and East Midlands airports are seeing Gen Z reshape travel, using AI, social media and wellness trends in terminals.

Generation Z travellers are changing the airport experience, with social media, wellness trends and artificial intelligence shaping how younger passengers plan holidays and spend in terminals, according to the UK’s largest airport group, MAG.

Manchester Airport (MAN), London Stansted Airport (STN) and East Midlands Airport (EMA) are seeing significant shifts in passenger behaviour, as younger travellers opt for matcha drinks over pre-flight fry-ups and invest in skincare products rather than traditional holiday items such as swimwear.

Sales of products favoured by Gen Z have soared across terminals. Giant Stanley Cups, for example, have seen a six-fold increase in sales since being introduced to JD Sports stores at all three airports. Hydrating facemasks have also surged, with some items up by 399 percent year-on-year, reflecting the “skincare in the sky” trend popularised on TikTok and other social media platforms.

Matcha is particularly popular, with sales climbing 165 percent across MAG airports compared with last year. London Stansted saw a 174 percent increase, Manchester 144 percent, with outlets including Pret a Manger, Itsu, Caffè Nero and Pasta Evangelists benefiting. Smoothie sales also soared, with Innocent Energise and Defence drinks collectively up 650 percent, becoming a popular addition to budget-conscious meal deals.

Gen Z passengers are also embracing technology, with one in four now using AI to plan their trips. East Midlands Airport leads in the proportion of under-25s using AI tools such as ChatGPT to design holidays. European city breaks top the list of destinations, overtaking traditional package holidays once favoured by older generations. Dublin, Amsterdam and Barcelona are among the most popular, while more adventurous travellers are visiting destinations such as Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Mumbai, which have seen growth of 97 percent and 245 percent respectively since 2019.

Andrew MacMillan, MAG Chief Strategy Officer, said: “As consumer trends evolve, so does the travel industry – that’s both in terms of the destinations we work with our airlines to provide and the kind of products people want to consume in terminals. This data shows the influence of our younger passengers – Generation Z – who are curating airport experiences strongly influenced by AI and social media. It is clear these travellers both want to follow trends and set them. With an ongoing £2bn investment across all three MAG airports, we will continue to focus on how the airport experience can embrace new technology and ensure that it reflects emerging demographics into the future.”",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2443923527-750x500-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:57:07.483897

These next-generation nacelle systems incorporate lightweight composite materials and advanced aerodynamic designs, establishing new benchmarks as the aviation industry intensifies its commitment to sustainability.

Market Growth Driven by Efficiency and Modernization

The global aircraft nacelle systems market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.5% through 2031, driven by increasing air passenger traffic and ongoing fleet modernization efforts. A prominent trend within the industry is the adoption of lightweight composites and hybrid materials, which can reduce nacelle weight by up to 20%, thereby directly improving fuel economy for narrowbody and widebody aircraft alike.

Recent developments highlight this momentum. In late 2025, Safran and Collins Aerospace unveiled upgraded nacelle designs for the Boeing 737 MAX, focusing on enhancing thrust reverser efficiency amid strong demand for narrowbody jets. Spirit AeroSystems introduced advanced composite nacelles for regional jets, targeting a 15% weight reduction to support the growth of low-cost carriers in the Asia-Pacific region. At the 2025 Paris Air Show, Leonardo S.p.A. showcased noise-reduction technologies aligned with the European Union’s Green Deal regulations. Meanwhile, GKN Aerospace advanced hybrid-electric nacelle prototypes in preparation for urban air mobility fleets anticipated by 2030.

Challenges and Industry Response

Despite these technological advances, the transition to sustainable aviation faces significant challenges. High development and implementation costs, slow adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and complex regulatory environments continue to impede progress. The long service life of aircraft and the sluggish uptake of SAF—issues underscored by figures such as Bill Gates and the International Air Transport Association—highlight the sector’s difficulty in rapidly reducing emissions.

In response, industry leaders are accelerating research and development, forging partnerships to develop next-generation nacelles, and investing in SAF infrastructure. These initiatives have attracted growing investor interest, as stakeholders recognize the urgent need for innovation and stronger government policies to reduce aviation emissions.

The Strategic Role of Nacelle Systems

Aircraft nacelle systems play a critical role in shaping an aircraft’s aerodynamic profile, directly influencing fuel savings and emissions reductions. Engineers at Aerospace Dynamics Innovations have collaborated closely with pilots and maintenance crews to ensure these systems meet practical operational requirements. The industry is increasingly moving away from traditional metal nacelles toward carbon-fiber reinforced polymers, which offer superior strength-to-weight ratios. In modern fleets equipped with high-bypass turbofan engines, advanced nacelle systems optimize airflow to minimize drag, a crucial factor as airlines prioritize efficiency in the post-pandemic recovery period.

Recent approvals by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for acoustic metamaterials are also enabling quieter takeoffs, an important development for operations at urban airports.

Regional and Global Outlook

Commercial aviation remains the primary driver of nacelle system demand, with narrowbody aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo leading due to their high production volumes. Military applications are also growing steadily, particularly in the development of stealth nacelle designs for next-generation fighter aircraft. North America dominates the market with well-established supply chains, while Europe emphasizes sustainability initiatives. The Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing market, propelled by airline expansions in India and China. Emerging markets, including Brazil, contribute through retrofit programs.

Looking forward, forecasts indicate sustained market growth, with electric propulsion nacelles expected to disrupt the sector by 2028.

Highlights intensifying race for industrial firms to shape climate, energy and policy pathways

Rolls Royce has appointed former bp Chief Sustainability Officer Ivanka Mamic as Global Head of Government Relations and Chief Sustainability Officer. The new post places sustainability and government engagement within a single leadership portfolio at one of Britain’s most strategically important industrial technology companies.

A Strategic Hire at a Geopolitical Moment

Rolls Royce has been positioning its civil aerospace, defense, and emerging energy systems businesses for a decade defined by decarbonisation, industrial security, and techno-political competition. The decision to combine sustainability with government relations is notable for a firm that operates across regulated markets, sovereign-level procurement, and long-duration climate and energy transition cycles.

Mamic joins after five years at bp, where she led the design and execution of the company’s global sustainability strategy. Her tenure coincided with bp’s public push into low carbon energy and investor engagement on climate transition through 2020 to 2023, followed by a strategic rebalancing last year. That shift included a larger allocation of capital to oil and gas and reduced capex for low carbon investments to below five percent.

Before bp, Mamic spent nearly a decade in sustainability-focused roles at Target, including oversight of global responsible sourcing. She has worked across decarbonisation strategy, supply chain accountability and corporate governance, and has engaged with regulators and investors on the materiality of climate risk.

Personal Statement as Transition Marker

In a public statement announcing her move, Mamic said she was motivated by mission focus and industrial heritage. She noted: “As someone with a strong interest in enduring, mission-driven companies, I am proud to join this iconic British organisation and be part of a team focused on excellence and innovation to drive real-world solutions to complex challenges.”

On LinkedIn, she added: “I’m excited to start 2026 by joining Rolls-Royce as Global Head of Government Relations and Chief Sustainability Officer.” She described her bp experience as “highly formative and rewarding” and continued: “I am deeply thankful for the experiences, the trust, and most importantly the people I had the pleasure of working with. To the teams, colleagues and partners across bp, my best wishes in the year to come.”

Waste-based sustainable aviation fuel could generate 62.5 billion liters of jet fuel annually while reducing emissions by 80-90%.

Scientists have found a way to turn everyday trash into jet fuel that produces 80-90% less carbon than traditional aviation fuel. The breakthrough could transform the 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions that come from air travel.

Research published recently in Science Direct shows that waste headed for landfills could produce 62.5 billion liters of jet fuel annually. This waste-based sustainable aviation fuel would cover a significant portion of aviation’s fuel needs while keeping organic waste out of dumps where it would decompose and release methane.

The aviation industry faces a major challenge in reducing its carbon footprint. Unlike cars or trucks, which can switch to electric power, airplanes require fuel that packs tremendous energy into a small, lightweight package. This makes the industry one of the hardest to clean up from a climate perspective.

Current alternative fuel options, called sustainable aviation fuels, face their own problems. Growing crops specifically for fuel can displace natural habitats or divert land from food production. This creates new environmental problems while trying to solve old ones.

Enter waste-based sustainable aviation fuel. Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University, notes that organic waste offers an overlooked opportunity. Cities already collect garbage regularly, and the supply stays consistent throughout the year. These factors make municipal solid waste an attractive starting material for fuel production.

Until now, no one had crunched the numbers on trash-based jet fuel at a global scale, using real data from actual production facilities. An international research team from the United States and China calculated that incorporating waste-based fuel into aviation could reduce the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions by 16%. This would mean the emissions from roughly one out of six flights would be eliminated.

The process isn’t simple. Garbage contains everything from food scraps to paper to yard waste, creating a literal mixed bag of materials. This variety requires more processing steps and more energy to convert trash into usable fuel compared to using a single crop type.

The biggest hurdle happens right at the start. Ming Zhao, an environmental engineering professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, explains that gasification technology remains a core challenge. This process converts solid waste into a mixture of gases that can then be refined into fuel. Getting it to work reliably and efficiently determines whether the whole system succeeds.

Scientists continue making progress on these technical challenges. A separate team at the University of Illinois focuses specifically on food waste, which makes up the largest portion of what most households discard. They developed a faster method using a process called hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts food scraps into a thick, energy-rich liquid.

The catch with this biocrude oil is its inconsistent chemical makeup. Jet engines require fuel with very specific, uniform properties for safety and performance reasons. The Illinois researchers tested dozens of chemical catalysts to refine the biocrude and found a cobalt-molybdenum combination that works in a single step.

The waste-based sustainable aviation fuel meets current industry standards and can be used directly in airplanes without mixing it with conventional fuel. This marks the first time researchers have achieved this milestone with food waste as the starting material. The same biocrude can also be refined into gasoline and diesel for cars and trucks.

Despite these advances, both research teams acknowledge an important limitation of the waste-based sustainable aviation fuel. Neither food waste nor municipal solid waste alone could completely replace conventional jet fuel. This reality highlights the substantial amount of fuel consumed by the aviation industry and the numerous solutions needed to fully decarbonize air travel.

The waste-based sustainable aviation fuel approach offers several advantages beyond emissions reduction. It addresses two problems at once by diverting organic material from landfills while creating a valuable product. Cities spend a significant amount of money managing waste, so converting garbage into fuel could help offset some of these costs.

The technology also avoids competing with food production and does not require new land to grow fuel crops. The collection infrastructure already exists in most cities worldwide. These factors could make trash-based fuel easier to scale up compared to other alternative fuel options.

However, building the processing facilities and refining operations requires substantial investment. The technology needs to prove itself at a commercial scale, not just in research laboratories. Fuel made from waste must also compete on price with conventional jet fuel, which remains relatively cheap.

Airlines have committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but they need viable alternatives to make this goal a reality. Sustainable aviation fuels derived from various sources, including waste, are likely to play a crucial role in meeting these targets. Regulatory support and financial incentives may help accelerate the adoption of these cleaner fuel options.

The research demonstrates that waste materials previously considered worthless can become valuable energy resources. As gasification and refining technologies improve, waste-based sustainable aviation fuel may become increasingly practical and affordable. This could help make air travel more compatible with climate goals while improving waste management.",https://happyeconews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bao-menglong-FhoJYnw-cg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:00:07.434051

The aviation sector’s shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) continues to be a hot topic with ambitious goals for decarbonization. However, a closer look reveals that although production of SAF is projected to nearly double this year—from 1 million tonnes in 2024 up to 1.9 million tonnes in 2025—the growth rate is already showing signs of tapering off. This slowing momentum poses challenges in meeting the airline industry’s ambitious carbon reduction targets and raises questions about the pace at which sustainable fuels can replace conventional jet fuels.

Why Has Growth Slowed?

Policy choices, especially in Europe, appear to be key culprits in holding back the scale-up of SAF production capacity. Despite the potential for SAF to significantly cut carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels, regulatory frameworks have sometimes been misaligned or too slow to adapt. This has resulted in slower investments and hesitant production expansion.

Efforts by sustainable aviation fuel advocates stress that progress depends not only on ramping up production but ensuring the fuel remains economically viable and scalable without disrupting other sectors such as agriculture. The preferred feedstocks for SAF often include waste products like used cooking oil, algae, and non-food crops, which don’t compete with food supply chains.

Implications for Air Cargo and Global Logistics

The repercussions of SAF production trends stretch beyond just the commercial passenger airlines; freight and cargo logistics are closely tied to the aviation fuel market. Sustainable fuels could reshape the cost structures and environmental impact of air freight, which remains a vital artery for global supply chains—especially for time-sensitive and high-value items.

When SAF production growth slows, the sector risks missing critical environmental targets, keeping carbon emissions from air freight and courier services higher for longer. This creates a ripple effect throughout industries reliant on quick and reliable global distribution, from electronics to pharmaceuticals.

Year Estimated SAF Production (million tonnes) Growth Rate Decarbonization Goal Alignment 2024 1.0 Baseline Initial scaling 2025 1.9 ~90% increase Growth slowing, falling short Beyond 2025 Limited projections Uncertain, below targets Potential gap in meeting targets

Challenges Facing the Aviation Fuel Transition

There are no shortcuts here—transforming the aviation fuel industry is like turning a massive ship; it can’t happen overnight. SAF production involves complex supply chains and requires substantial capital investments in new facilities and technology. The current mismatch between policy ambitions and practical on-the-ground realities slows infrastructure growth and investor confidence.

Moreover, it’s critical to ensure that SAF production does not inadvertently create new environmental or social issues, such as land use conflicts or biodiversity loss, which some traditional biofuel sources have been criticized for. The aviation industry, including groups like the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG), advocates for fuels that minimize negative side effects and integrate seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fuel distribution networks.

Impacts on Logistics Providers and Freight Forwarders

For logistics operators, air freight remains an essential part of global distribution, especially when speed is of the essence. The current plateauing of SAF production means that reliance on traditional jet fuel will persist longer than anticipated, forcing freight companies to keep factoring in rising costs and environmental concerns. This could pressure logistics strategies to diversify transportation modes and seek greener alternatives where feasible.

Heading Toward Sustainable Transport Solutions

While SAF is a promising piece of the broader green transport puzzle, it highlights a key lesson: sustainability transitions in logistics and transportation require coordinated policy, technology, and market support. Companies engaged in cargo delivery, moving, and freight forwarding must stay informed about these fuel shifts as they can influence pricing, availability, and compliance demands globally.

Key Takeaways:

SAF growth is strong but losing steam, which may affect meeting climate goals in aviation.

Policy misalignment in major regions like Europe contributes to slower production scale-up.

Air freight logistics could face persistent challenges, as SAF supply lags demand growth.

Focus on sustainable feedstocks helps balance environmental and economic objectives.

Logistics operators need to stay agile, incorporating sustainable fuels and planning for evolving supply chains.

Formula 1 thrives on change. The cars evolve constantly – but for 2026, revolution rather than evolution is the order of things with wholesale changes to both chassis and engine regulations.

After 11 seasons, the original hybrid F1 power unit spec has been retired, while after a brief, four-season foray into ground-effect, the sport will also undergo an aerodynamic reboot. There’s a lot to unpack: fresh philosophies, new jargon, and a lot of numbers. We’ll get into all of that over the next few months, but for the moment, here are the top notes for the all-new 2026 F1 Championship.

Let’s talk horsepower. What’s changing with the power units?

After 11 seasons with, in essence, the same power unit architecture, F1 has had a rethink for 2026. The 1.6L V6 turbocharged internal combustion engine (ICE) remains, but the MGU-H (which used the flow of exhaust gas to spin a turbine and reclaim energy) has been removed. The MGU-K (which reclaims energy while braking) will be beefed up to harvest and deploy about three times as much energy as its predecessor, with the goal of the new power unit having a roughly 50:50 split between power supplied by the ICE and from the electric system.

With the MGU-H – viewed as complicated and less road-relevant – removed, the new ’26 power units are being hailed as a simplified hybrid system. The reality is a little more complex: this is – as always with F1 – cutting-edge technology, attempting to do something that’s never been done before.

We’re also having an aerodynamic reboot. Isn’t it unusual to do both at the same time?

It isn’t the way F1 usually operates – but this aerodynamic reboot is designed to complement the new power unit… while also addressing a few of F1’s long-standing issues. The new power units are expected to produce a little less power than their predecessors, but to keep lap times in a similar range, the cars have reduced drag and a lower minimum weight, aided by narrower floor and tyres, and a shorter wheelbase.

What are the most prominent aero changes?

The front wing is of a much simpler design with fewer elements, though the endplates have a little more scope for exotic solutions. The ‘eyebrow’ winglets over the front wheels have also been deleted, with new bargeboards appearing. Less noticeable but fundamental to the design is the removal of the Venturi tunnels under the car. Ground-effect goes back into the box as flat(ter) floors return, with a larger diffuser, and the beam (i.e. lower) wing deleted.

Is the new aero package going to impact racing?

Certainly, it is intended to. As has been the case with the previous two aerodynamic iterations, the regulations have been written with the intention of improving racing and increasing overtaking, by enabling cars to be able to follow each other more closely.

The car’s front wheels punch a big hole in the airflow. Designers like to push that turbulent air out to the side of the car (out-washing), allowing smoother air to infill and make the aerodynamic surfaces more effective… but out-washing creates a bigger turbulent wake that makes it much more difficult for the car behind to close in. 2022’s regs were designed to combat the creation of this wake and were initially very successful before teams began clawing back their outwash-generating aerodynamics. These regs have taken that learning and will make it much harder to generate an outwash. Not that teams won’t try…

Beyond controlling the wake, the new regs are also creating a stronger, safer car and, it is hoped, one that is a little more nimble. Roll hoops have a new test to pass that raises the load from 16g to 20g, while the nose now has a two-stage impact structure. The latter is to deal with the issue of secondary impacts – i.e. those times when the front of the car has a heavy impact, spins and then has another heavy impact.

In terms of making a car that is more nimble, the 2026 regs specify a wheelbase that is 200mm shorter, a floor 100mm narrower and a minimum weight reduced from 798kg to 768kg. Whether or not anyone can get close to that minimum remains to be seen.

These cars have active aero. What’s that?

DRS no longer exists… but the cars now feature an adjustable rear wing that will open like DRS on all straights to reduce drag, irrespective of the race situation. The front wing will also move, working together with the rear wing to better trim the car. They’ll close again before corners to maximise downforce – in much the same way DRS did.

What are these modes we are hearing about?

There’s quite a bit of jargon floating about this year. The active aero modes were originally labelled X mode and Z mode. These will now be called Straight Mode and Corner Mode… you can probably extrapolate from context when those are to be used.

If a car is within one second of the car ahead when it passes a detection point (usually the final corner) Overtake Mode will be activated on the following lap. This will provide a speed boost, but also a lap in which it can recover more energy. This looks like it will be the primary overtaking device in the new formula. In ‘normal’ mode, the electrical energy that can be deployed begins to taper off at 290km/h. With Overtake Mode activated, the maximum 350kW will be available up to 337km/h, then tapering off up to 350km/h.

Other words you may hear flying around are Boost and Recharge. A boost button allows the driver to manually deploy electrical energy, in much the same way they’d done in the current generation of cars, while Recharge is the energy recovery function. It’s similar to what’s gone on before, but with a few more options than during the 2014-2025 era.

Will sustainable fuels make a difference?

Moving to 100 per cent advanced, sustainable, carbon-neutral fuels is part of F1’s roadmap to a net-zero carbon footprint. F1 had been running with a 10 per cent bioethanol fuel, but now converts fully to either an e-fuel or something created from waste biomass. The fuels used in F1 are complex creations tailored to their engines: designing any new fuel for the 2026 regs was going to be challenging - doing it with a sustainable fuel, doubly so. The expectation is that the new blends will be slightly less calorific than their fossil predecessors… but development will be rapid over the next few years. Expect this to be a more competitive arena than it has been recently.",https://mclaren.bloomreach.io/delivery/resources/content/gallery/mclaren-racing/formula-1/2026/editorial/explainers/new-regs/explaining-f1-regs-2026-hero-desktop.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:57:39.810608

In the European energy sector, 2022–2025 became a period of rethinking. Just yesterday, the world was trying to find a balance between cheap gas, the growth of green energy, and the logic of the electricity market. But today, Europe is already building new networks, introducing digital rules for trade transparency, and preparing space for industries that are sharply increasing demand for electricity, starting with data centres and ending with electric transport.

During this same time, Ukraine has lived several “energy lives”. It lost energy infrastructure facilities after missile strikes and simultaneously synchronised with the European network, put into operation the largest energy storage systems in the region, and reshaped the investment optics of business. It is painful, but productive: the war forced us to move from the “theory of transition” to the “practice of sustainability”.

The World and the EU in 2022-2025: New Rules, New Networks, New Consumers

The European Union responded to the energy shock with packages of new rules and investments. The electricity market reform consolidated stable long-term instruments and reduced the impact of gas price fluctuations on the price of electricity. In parallel, the modernisation of energy trade supervision increased transparency and responsibility of players. At the infrastructure level, a plan for the rapid completion of networks and interstate connections appeared. And, finally, a new major consumer entered the European agenda – artificial intelligence with its data centres, which in a few years will add dozens of terawatt-hours of demand and force the acceleration of investments in networks, flexibility and demand management.

A separate trend for 2022-2025 is the return of hydrogen from the plane of slogans to the plane of rules and investments. The EU has launched the European Hydrogen Bank with production support auctions, defined green criteria for electrolyser hydrogen (RFNBO) and low-carbon hydrogen, and enabled the phased development of hydrogen infrastructure within the framework of projects of common interest. This loop is connected to transport: at sea, requirements to reduce the carbon intensity of fuel on ships have come into force, in aviation, minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), opening the door to e-methanol and “green” ammonia as energy carriers in these areas.

Europe’s hydrogen ambitions are no longer an abstraction. In 2025, the world’s first commercial e-methanol plant, powered by renewable electricity and captured CO₂, opened in Denmark. The maritime industry has also accelerated contracts for the new fuel. This does not yet solve all the cost problems, but it is already shaping a market with forecasted demand.

Ukraine in 2025: Networks, Imports and Internal Flexibility

After emergency synchronisation with the European network in March 2022, Ukraine not only kept its power system operational, but also opened commercial trade. For the autumn-winter period of 2024-2025, European operators increased the limit on electricity imports to Ukraine to 2.1 gigawatts (GW). This volume was agreed not within the framework of a preferential regime, but determined by the technical capabilities of the system, which has been tested by war and, in this regime, fulfils the conditions of a stabilisation nature.

Ukraine’s response to the electricity shortage and the destruction and decommissioning of energy infrastructure due to Russian shelling was the need to create internal flexibility. In 2025, private investors introduced a portfolio of energy storage systems with a total capacity of 200 megawatts and a capacity of 400 MWh. These are six sites optimised for balancing and emergency modes, which are already undergoing commercial testing and will operate under contracts with the transmission system operator. To put it simply, two hours of reserve for hundreds of thousands of households, exactly when it is needed most.

This did not arise in a vacuum. Back in 2023–2024, the business was massively diversifying towards gas-piston plants and small-scale cogeneration. Cities were buying mini-CHPs based on Jenbacher engines, international partners were importing modular gas turbines, and state-owned companies were launching peak decentralised production programs. All this is a forced pragmatic reaction to blackouts and shortages of energy resources.

In parallel, the regulator adjusted the rules to the new reality. Separate procedures for ancillary services auctions appeared, where storage systems and fast generation can compete for long-term contracts. For wartime, this is a conservative, but timely and reliable innovation, according to which the market receives a clear signal, the operator receives a resource for system control, and the consumer can count on a stable energy supply and a decrease in the number of outages.

Hydrogen, ammonia and methanol: European logic – Ukrainian opportunities

The EU has laid the basic conditions for a large hydrogen market. Support for production through auctions, unified methods for confirming the origin of “green” hydrogen and recognition of low-carbon hydrogen are the market rules that were missing yesterday. Further, regulation covers transport: shipping receives an obligation to reduce carbon fuel intensity, aviation – minimal shares of sustainable fuels. At this stage, hydrogen derivatives – e-methanol and “green” ammonia – come into play.

E-methanol is synthesised from hydrogen and carbon dioxide using renewable electricity, while ammonia is produced from hydrogen and nitrogen from the air. These are liquid energy carriers that are easier to store and transport using the existing bulk infrastructure, so in the transitional years, they become a practical bridge between hydrogen producers and consumers, starting from the chemical industry and the agricultural sector and ending with shipping and aviation.

Ukraine can integrate into this chain from two sides. The first is infrastructure: we have port and chemical assets on the Black Sea, including the Odessa Port Plant, which traditionally worked with ammonia. Its privatisation track in 2025 creates a platform for a restart for “green” products after the war, and not only for classic fertilisers. The second is hydrogen derivative production projects in the logic of future export flows. Investors should make decisions about this, and the regulatory background is already clear, thanks to European rules and Ukrainian policies in the field of hydrogen energy.

For general clarity, it should be noted that we are not ahead of events. Even in Europe, e-methanol projects are only moving from pilots to industrial scales this year. But right now, a “demand funnel” is forming – from ports and logistics to shipping and aviation. Entering it with the right timing means getting a solvent buyer and financing for the export logistics.

Investment instruments in war: what works in practice

Classical investment instruments continue to operate, but with a risk adjustment. Project financing with guarantees from international financial institutions, political risk insurance, blending grants and loans, long-term power purchase agreements and system services are what drive new projects even under fire. When it comes to critical infrastructure, banks and donors are becoming co-investors in resilience, not just lenders. For example, package financing for peak generation and storage systems, which international development banks approved in 2025, was precisely a response to the lack of flexibility and winter risks.

An important nuance remains the networks. The development of data centres and electrification in Europe has already raised the bar for connection requirements and demand management. Demand is growing, and the window for connections is narrowing. For Ukraine, this is also a signal that every new megawatt of wind or solar must immediately receive a place in the network and a contract for flexibility. Otherwise, investors will not pay for generation, but for downtime.

Corruption scandals: not verdicts, but risk premiums

Recent months have given the market several high-profile stories with the arrests of top officials in the energy sector. Together with our lawyer colleagues, we do not give legal assessments and do not substitute for the court. We look at this as a risk factor. For international partners, this adds a premium to the cost of capital, complicates the structure of deals and increases the role of prior conditions: audits, compliance, and transparency of procurement. If a country shows that investigations are going to the top and are being completed procedurally correctly, investors take this into account and return to the project figures. If the turbulence is systemic, the share of grant components increases, and debt resources become more expensive. This is the logic of investment and the mathematics of risk in wartime.

Lessons from the Balkans: What the experience of Croatia and its neighbours says

After the wars of the 1990s, the countries of the former Yugoslavia went through a very similar cycle. First, stabilisation and large-scale intergovernmental initiatives like the Stability Pact, which, under pressure from the EU and international banks, opened up financing specifically for infrastructure. Then came privatisation and the long, sometimes painful modernisation of utility and energy assets, which attracted private capital only after the emergence of clear rules and regulatory safeguards. Croatia came to this through institutional reforms and European integration requirements, and investments in networks and generation were a consequence, not a cause. This is not idealisation, but a useful road map for us, focused on a different paradigm, based on the principle of “first rules and networks, then large-scale investments”.

Forecast for 2026: more networks, more flexibility, more hydrogen

A realistic scenario for Ukraine for 2026 consists of three mandatory elements.

The first is networks and connections. Europe is doubling down on interconnectors and internal lines because, without them, it will not be able to sustain either renewables or data centres. We need our own accelerated grid reconstruction plan with a priority for the rapid connection of new generation and storage facilities, like the Energy Infrastructure Plan for Europe. In the long term, this is cheaper than chronic outages.

The second is flexibility as a business. Portfolio storage systems, fast peaking stations, demand management and new ancillary services markets are not a temporary solution for wartime, but a new reality. Transmission system operator contracts, a clear auction schedule and seamless integration with European regulations, that’s where the difference between projects on paper and commissioned capacities lies.

Third – hydrogen derivatives, ammonia, e-methanol, as an export strategy. We should not compete for the “greenest hydrogen in the world” tomorrow. It is worth laying the foundation for the export of products that are easier to export and for which buyers are already appearing, namely e-methanol and “green” ammonia. This requires solutions that ensure transparent privatisation and reprofiling of port and chemical assets, transparent access to networks, and contractual bridges with European consumers. The rules in the EU already exist, and our strategies are currently under open discussion. Time is pressing, but it does not punish those who act systematically and consistently.

What this means for business and politics

For investors, the signal is simple. Ukrainian energy after 2025 is about networks and flexibility in connection with long-term contracts, plus niche industries based on hydrogen derivatives, where the region can become the production arm of the EU. The cost of capital will depend on the quality of risk management, not just on the scale of assets. The key for politicians will be to quickly create a regulatory framework between national and European legislation, protect competition in auctions and make export logistics predictable.

For citizens, the most important thing is the availability of energy resources and the ease of commissioning energy-efficient solutions. Everything else is just a way to achieve this. Ukraine enters 2026 with the experience of survival and a set of working solutions. Europe is shaping the demand for green electricity, diversifying its sources of natural gas and oil, and developing new markets for hydrogen and its derivatives. At the intersection of these two trajectories lies what we call an opportunity, which Ukraine has a chance to seize.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wind-renewables.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 03:56:29.612760

The two dominant pathways are methanol to gasoline (MTG) and ethanol to jet (ETJ), which is also known as ethanol to kerosene (ETK), writes Stephen B. Harrison, Managing Director at sbh4 consulting, Germany.

.The smaller methanol molecule is ideal to produce the lighter gasoline fraction for cars. The larger ethanol molecule yields the heavier kerosene fraction that is required for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Plant-based bio-ethanol

Traditionally, bioethanol has been produced from fermentation of sugary broths at industrial scale. The process is essentially the same as making beer from grain and then distilling the beer to make whisky.

In Asia and the Americas, the most widely used crops for bio-ethanol production are maize and sugar cane. Rice, sorghum and cassava are also used in secondary quantities. In Europe, these crops are generally replaced by wheat and sugar-beet.

Considering these crops, it is evident that agricultural land and food crops are being diverted to the production of biofuels as affordable energy vectors. At a global level, the price of these nutritional commodities is being driven up by their competing use as a fuel. For the rich, a few cents more for a kilo of wheat or rice will not drive a family into starvation. For impoverished nations, the same is not true.

The need for alternative non-food sources of sustainable ethanol is a global imperative. And, if it can also be produced from industrial emissions, this will surely be a win-win scenario.

Industrial ethanol from recycled carbon

The US company LanzaTech utilises anaerobic acetobacter bacteria in a fermenter to convert carbon monoxide (CO) rich feed gases, such as syngas, to ethanol and a range of biochemicals. The term CCT or ‘Carbon Capture and Transformation’ has been used to describe the LanzaTech fermentation process.

The ideal feedstocks for the LanzaTech fermenter are CO-rich. Syngas derived from biomass gasification is CO-rich and is an ideal feedstock for the LanzaTech process.

Iron and steel making also yields CO-rich flue gases. Blast furnace gas (BFG) contains 20% CO and converter gas (also known as basic oxygen furnace gas or BOFG) contains 60% CO.

At present, the energy rich BOFG (LHV 3 kWh/Nm3) is often utilised on the iron and steel making facility for heat or power generation on a gas engine. Alternatively, it is flared. BFG has a lower energy value because it contains less CO (LHV 0.9 kWh/Nm3). It can also be utilised for heat and power generation, or is sent to the flare.

As an alternative to power generation or flaring, utilisation of the BFG and BOFG in the LanzaTech process can generate ethanol. Subsequently, the complimentary LanzaJet process can be used to convert the ethanol to SAF in their proprietary ETJ process.

Lifecycle analysis

The LanzaTech bioreactor utilises CO from syngas to grow bacterial biomass in the fermenter. Some gases are emitted from the fermenter. This biomass from the fermenter is subsequently converted to biomethane in a separate anaerobic sludge digester. This energy-rich biomethane which is used to fully combust the main fermenter off gases to CO2. This CO2 can either then be emitted to the air or captured.

Life cycle analysis (LCA) of the LanzaTech process shows that CO2 emissions reduction is primarily due to the substitution of fossil fuels or crude-oil derived plastics with biomaterials produced from ethanol or other co-products recovered from the fermentation broth.

Also integral to the LanzaTech LCA is consideration of whether the feedstock, such as iron and steel making flue gases are flared, or utilised. If they are flared, their recovery and conversion to ethanol is a significant environmental benefit. However, if they are utilised to make heat and power, they already avoid the use of fossil fuels and the overall CO2 reduction in the LCA is reduced.

Scaling up successfully

LanzaTech’s process was demonstrated at pilot-scale in 2008 using flue gases from the BlueScope Steel mill in Glenbrook, NZ. Since then, LanzaTech has successfully deployed its technology at two 300 tonne per annum demonstration facilities at Baosteel Shanghai and Shougang Steel Caofeidian in China. These LanzaTech fermenters are fed with a range of iron and steel making off gases including BOFG, BFG, and coke oven gas (COG).

LanzaTech also operates the Freedom Pines Biorefinery in Soperton, Georgia which uses bio fermenters to generate ethanol and other chemicals. The LanzaJet ETJ SAF production process has also been implemented at that location.

Dehydration of ethanol on the way to produce kerosene

Ethanol is an alcohol based on two carbon atoms. As an alcohol, it contains an oxygen atom. Kerosene, on the other hand, is a long paraffinic hydrocarbon with between 10 and 14 carbon atoms that contains no oxygen.

Conversion of ethanol to kerosene takes place in two separate stages. The first is dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, or ethene. This effectively removes the oxygen atom and builds a highly reactive double bond linkage between the two carbon atoms.

The dehydration reaction is effected using a zeolite type catalyst such as H-ZSM-5 at between 250 and 300 °C. Low pressure operation is preferred to enable the production of gaseous ethylene. The reaction requires a very high heat input. This is a parasitic load on the process that consumes some of the energy of the feedstock to enable the conversion to kerosene.

Ethylene oligomerisation

The ethylene produced by the dehydration of ethanol is like a mouse trap, waiting to spring open. As the double bond between the two carbon atoms bond snaps open, it reaches out for another ethylene molecule to build butene a longer hydrocarbon containing four carbon atoms.

The conversion of ethylene to butene takes place over a nickel-based catalyst and releases a significant amount of heat, which can support the dehydration reaction.

Butene also contains a highly reactive carbon double bond. When several butene molecules are combined, very long hydrocarbons are created in a polymerisation reaction. If this reaction were left to proceed, the product would be polyethylene, a plastic polymer. To produce kerosene, the reaction must be initiated and then curtailed. This partial polymerisation is known as oligomerisation.

The oligomerisation proceeds using another zeolite catalyst such as ZSM-5. If it is conducted at high temperature, branched isomers of kerosene can be produced. These are desirable because they allow the fuel to be used at low temperatures (such as those at altitude) without freezing.

Hydrotreating and fractionation

The synthetic crude (syncrude) produced by oligomerisation may still contain some residual oxygen atoms from the ethanol feedstock. These must be removed to prevent corrosion of materials handling and storing the kerosene, and to prevent polymerisation of the fuel.

Hydrogen is reacted with the syncrude to remove oxygen and convert it into water. The deoxygenated syncrude is then distilled into fractions such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene for SAF.

The economics can be optimised by tailoring the process conditions to produce the most valuable fuel, which is SAF.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SAF-refuelling-768x512.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 02:56:14.951099

With the rapeseed processing volume expected to reach around 24.68 million tonnes, it also makes the EU less dependent on imports.

Cumulative imports into the EU-27 in the first half of the crop year 2025/26 amounted to approximately 1.85 million tonnes, representing a nearly 43 per cent decline from the previous year's level of 3.23 million tonnes.

Ukraine remains the leading supplier country with just over 1.06 million tonnes to date and a 57 per cent share of imports. Nevertheless, the country's shipments remain clearly below the previous year's volume of 2.02 million tonnes.

The second wave of imports from Australia will increasingly come into focus later on in the season. By January, Australia had placed 249,869 tonnes of rapeseed on the EU market, ranking second among the major countries of origin with a share of just under 14 per cent, but trailing well behind Ukraine. According to investigations conducted by Agrarmarkt Informations-Gesellschaft (mbH), deliveries remained approximately 71 per cent below the level recorded in the reference period.

Canada continued to lose market share.

The country delivered 140,915 tonnes of rapeseed to date, which compares to 161,347 tonnes the previous year.

Because Canadian farmers grow genetically modified varieties, the use of rapeseed oil derived from Canadian rapeseed is restricted in the EU. As a result, imports from Canada are primarily used for biofuel production.

The event was open to the public and included six presentations by researchers and market experts.

Doors opened at 8:30, and after a welcome from KDIX Radio’s Mike Renner, Chris Augustin, director of the Dickinson Research Extension Center, took the floor for his presentation, “Acid Soil Management in North Dakota No-till Soils.”

During his talk, Augustin gave a rundown on the basics of soil acidity and pH, mainly differentiating soil salinity or solidicity from soil acidity, which has to do with the concentration of hydrogen. Augustin explained that as soil pH decreases, that means that soil acidity increases. One of Augustin’s main points was that when soil pH measures as low as 5.5, that should register immediate concern. According to his research, incorporating lime into acidic soils helps to neutralize it.

Following Augustin was Chandler Mazour, who is a Nebraska native and product manager for GEVO and Verity Tracking. Mazour’s talk was titled “Carbon Intensity Counts: Monetizing Farm-Level Data.”

Mazour’s company acquired the Red Trail Energy facility in Richardton last year, and part of his presentation updated the crowd on that project, including the “carbon capture and sequestration efforts,” Mazour said. In the long term, it is GEVO’s goal to produce sustainable aviation fuel at their Richardton location. Mazour also said that his company is building out a grower program, working directly with farmers who want to track the carbon intensity of their own grain.

For the last presentation of the morning session, the forum welcomed Tommy Grisafi as its keynote speaker. Grisafi is a Risk Advisor and Commodity Broker for Advance Trading Inc., and is the owner of Ag Bull Media, which produces a popular agricultural podcast by the same name. Grisafi’s presentation was geared toward the risk management side of farming.

In addition to his own musings on stocks and market prices, Grisafi shared some observations he has made over the years of successful grain marketers and offered some practical advice for emulating their tactics, such as not second guessing one’s decisions, and not being afraid to invest in new technologies or equipment.

“The Soil Management Summit is a great opportunity for farmers, ag professionals and scientists to get together and talk about sustainability and protecting our soils,” said Cabello Leiva, who joined MSR&PC in spring 2025.
The MN Organic Conference was unique in that it spearheaded conversations and interactions with a different group of soybean producers who share similar production concerns, such as weed management.

–Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council","MANKATO, Minn. — The Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council (MSR&PC) has been on the road in the northern half of the state to begin 2026, interacting with farmers and sharing information on the latest checkoff research, including stops at the Soil Management Summit and DIRT Conference, MN Organics Conference and Small Grains Update Meetings.

For MSR&PC Director of Research Sergio Cabello Leiva, the northern Minnesota ramble was a return to his research roots.

“It’s a very exciting time of year because it’s an opportunity for us at Minnesota Soybean to deliver information to our audience of farmers and ag professionals all throughout the state,” said Cabello Leiva. “I love the northern part of the state as I spent several years working in North Dakota and northern Minnesota, so it’s good to be back.”

The Soil Management Summit and DIRT conference, a combined effort of the University of Minnesota and North Dakota State University, puts an emphasis on farmer experience and applied science on the topic of soil health and sustainability. The conference, which was held Jan. 14-15 in Fargo, N.D. on Jan. 14-15, featured presentations, Q&As with researchers, farmers and ag professionals, trade show and ample learning and networking opportunities.

“The Soil Management Summit is a great opportunity for farmers, ag professionals and scientists to get together and talk about sustainability and protecting our soils,” said Cabello Leiva, who joined MSR&PC in spring 2025. “The way I see things is that if we have a healthy soil, we have high organic matter; basically we are saving money for our future. We are giving more nutrients to our crops, more healthy crops, more healthy balance. It’s a win-win situation.”

As a sponsor of the event, MSR&PC hosted a table talk at the conference, providing a chance for producers and researchers to have an informal, roundtable discussion about research and agronomic practices.

“The presenter at the table doesn’t have a PowerPoint, maybe a small handout, but it’s meant to be informal, meant to stimulate discussion, and it’s meant for researchers and farmers to learn from one another,” said Dr. Angie Peltier, U of M Extension Educator who hosted the table talk on behalf of MRS&PC. “Everyone at the table has an equal voice and can share their own experiences. The learning that happens during those interactions is tremendous.”

Peltier spoke at her table talk about some of the latest checkoff=supported research projects and how that research can drive yield and long-term profitability for Minnesota farms.

“We chatted a lot about soybean cyst nematode and knowing that risk, because a lot of producers still have no idea that their field could be infested and that is our No. 1 yield impactor in soybean fields,” said Peltier. “We also discussed one of the newest pathogens found in the state called Red Crown Rot, so it’s important that farmers keep an eye out for that and other emerging threats and that we collaborate to come up with workable management practices to address those threats.”

In addition to the Soil Management Summit, MSR&PC also sponsored and participated in the MN Organic Conference Jan. 8-9 in St. Cloud, followed by Small Grains Update meetings throughout northwest Minnesota. The MN Organic Conference was unique in that it spearheaded conversations and interactions with a different group of soybean producers who share similar production concerns, such as weed management.

“We have a lot of tools for weed control from the conventional side that apply to organic soybean producers,” Cabello-Leiva said. “It’s a good partnership and there are a lot of mutual benefits for our food-grade soybean producers, of which we are developing new varieties for right here in the state with the University and Minnesota Soybean together.”

The Small Grains Update meetings made stops all throughout the Red River Valley, including Dilworth, Halstad, Crookston, Lancaster, Roseau and St. Hilaire. In a time where market prices are low and inputs are high, Cabella Leiva spoke to producers on how they can get the best bang for their buck through utilizing available research, applying only what farmers need and staying on top of agronomic issues that impact yield.

“A good variety, a good seed treatment, good fertility in our soils and just apply the absolute necessary to obtain the biggest yield and best quality,” he said. “There’s an opportunity to improve by just applying what we need. We have a lot of research about that, and we invite people to take a look at our research book for those solutions.”

Throughout the slate of conference and meetings, farmers had the opportunity to pick up MSR&PC’s latest research report, From Seed to Solutions. The publication can be viewed online here. Cabello Leiva and checkoff researchers will also be in attendance to visit with producers Jan. 20-21 at MN Ag Expo in Mankato.

Julie Bushell of Global Sustainability Developers, LLC (GSD) and DG Fuels CEO Mike Darcy were on site to also address any concerns from Phelps County residents. The Phelps County Development Corporation (PCDC) hosted the town hall meeting at the Phelps County Ag Center on Wednesday, January 14.

A lot of those concerns addressed the use of corn stover and how the facility may affect resources in the area. On more than one occasion, Darcy and Bushell assured the audience that great care is being taken to ensure the SAF facility would not cause many difficulties for Phelps County residents. Darcy made it clear that a SAF facility runs cleaner than a conventional petroleum refinery, while producing an environmentally friendly product.

Following the wave of disapproval from local residents regarding the initial plans to bring fresh water in by train, Bushell announced that an environmental study was being conducted on the state’s surface water sources and the Ogallala Aquifer. The study is expected to be completed and made available to the public by the end of March.

Members of local public power districts were also in attendance. Courtney Dentlinger of NPPD and Chad Waldo of Southern PPD assured residents that they were behind the project, noting that the facility would not be a drain on the area’s electrical resources.

Bushell confirmed that a location in Phelps County has been chosen but will not be made public out of respect to the landowner’s privacy.

PCDC executive director Jeff Hofaker recognized that while there a few things that still need to be worked on, he remains enthusiastic about the project. The news of the pellet facility was especially welcome to Hofaker.

But from many different respondents, a mood emerged: a kind of exhaustion with “climate” as the right frame through which to understand the fractious mixture of electrification, pollution reduction, clean energy development, and other goals that people who care about climate change actually pursue. When we asked what piece of climate jargon people would most like to ban, we expected most answers to dwell on the various colors of hydrogen (green, blue, orange, chartreuse), perhaps, or the alphabet soup of acronyms around carbon removal (CDR, DAC, CCS, CCUS, MRV). Instead, we got:

Not everyone was as willing to shift to decarbonization, but most welcomed some form of specificity. “I’ve always tried to reframe climate change to be more personal and to recognize it is literally the biggest health challenge of our lives,” the former official said.

One think tanker wanted to nix “climate emergency.” Another scholar said: “I think the ‘climate justice’ term — not the idea — but I think the term got spread so widely that it became kind of difficult to understand what it was even referring to.” And one climate scientist didn’t have a problem with climate change, per se, but did say that people should pare back how they discuss it and back off “the notion that climate change will result in human extinction, or the sudden and imminent end to human civilization.”

There were other points of agreement. Four people wanted to ban “net zero” or “carbon neutrality.” One scientist said activists should back off fossil gas — “I know we’re always trying to try convince people of something, but, like, the entire world calls it ’natural gas’” — and another scientist said that they wished people would stop “micromanaging” language: “People continually changing jargon to try and find the magic words that make something different than it is — that annoys me.”

Two more academics added they wish to banish discussion of “overshoot”: “It’s not clear if it's referring to temperatures or emissions — I just don't think it's a helpful frame for thinking about the problem.”

“Unit economics,” “greenwashing,” and — yes — the whole spectrum of hydrogen colors came in for a lashing. But perhaps the most distinctive ban suggestion came from Todd Stern, the former chief U.S. climate diplomat, who negotiated the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.

“I hate it when people say ’are you going to COP?’” he told me, referring to the United Nations’ annual climate summit, officially known as the Conference of the Parties. His issue wasn’t calling it “COP,” he clarified. It was dropping the definite article.

“The way I see it, no one has the right to suddenly become such intimate pals with ‘COP.’ You go to the ball game or the conference or what have you. And you go to ‘the COP,’” he said. “I am clearly losing this battle, but no one will ever hear me drop the ‘the.’”

Now, since I talked to Stern, the United States has moved to drop the COP entirely — with or without the “the” — because Trump took us out of the climate treaty under whose aegis the COP is held. But precision still counts, even in unfriendly times. And throughout the rest of this package, you’ll find insiders trying to find a path forward in thoughtful, insightful, and precise ways.

You’ll also find them remaining surprisingly upbeat — and even more optimistic, in some ways, than they were last year. Twelve months ago, 30% of our insider panel thought China would peak its emissions in the 2020s; this year, a plurality said the peak would come this decade. Roughly the same share of respondents this year as last year thought the U.S. would hit net zero in the 2060s. Trump might be setting back American climate action in the near term. But some of the most important long-term trends remain unchanged.

The Heatmap Insiders Survey of 55 invited expert respondents was conducted by Heatmap News reporters during November and December 2025. Responses were collected via phone interviews. All participants were given the opportunity to record responses anonymously. Not all respondents answered all questions.

Hyperscalers with sustainability goals are already reporting higher emissions, and technology companies are telling investors that they plan to invest hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars, into new data centers, increasingly at gigawatt scale.

And yet when we asked our Heatmap survey participants “Do you think AI and data centers’ energy needs are significantly slowing down decarbonization?” only about 34% said they would, compared to 66% who said they wouldn’t.

There were some intriguing differences between different types of respondents. Among our “innovator” respondents — venture capitalists, founders, and executives working at climate tech startups — the overwhelming majority said that AI and data centers are not slowing down decarbonization. “I think it’s the inverse — I think we want to launch the next generation of technologies when there’s demand growth and opportunity to sell into a slightly higher priced, non-commoditized market,” Joe Goodman co-founder and managing partner at VoLo Earth Ventures, told us.

Not everyone in Silicon Valley is so optimistic, however. “I think in a different political environment, it may have been a true accelerant,” one VC told us. “But in this political environment, it’s a true albatross because it’s creating so many more emissions. It’s creating so much stress on the grid. We’re not deploying the kinds of solutions that would be effective.""

Scientists were least in agreement on the question. While only 47% of scientists thought the growth of data centers would significantly slow down decarbonization, most of the pessimistic camp was in the social sciences. In total, over 62% of the physical scientists we surveyed thought data centers weren’t slowing down decarbonization, compared to a third of social scientists.

Michael Greenstone, a University of Chicago economist, told us he didn’t see data centers and artificial intelligence as any different from any other use of energy. “I also think air conditioning and lighting, computing, and 57,000 other uses of electricity are slowing down decarbonization,” he said. The real answer is the world is not trying to minimize climate change.”

Mijin Cha, an assistant professor of environment studies at the University of California Santa Cruz, was even more gloomy, telling us, “Not only do I think it’s slowing down decarbonization, I think it is permanently extending the life of fossil fuels, especially as it is now unmitigated growth.”

Some took issue with the premise of the question, expressing skepticism of the entire AI industry. “I’m actually of the opinion that most of the AI and data center plans are a massive bubble,” a scientist told us. “And so, are there plans that would be disruptive to emissions? Yes. Are they actually doing anything to emissions yet? Not obvious.”

We also asked respondents to name the “best” and “worst” hyperscalers, large technology companies pursuing the data center buildout. Many of these companies have some kind of renewables or sustainability goal, but there are meaningful differences among them. Google and Microsoft look to match their emissions with non-carbon-power generation in the same geographic area and at the same time. The approach used by Meta and Amazon, on the other hand, is to develop renewable projects that have the biggest “bang for the buck” on global emissions by siting them in areas with high emissions that the renewable generation can be said to displace.

Among our respondents, the 24/7 “time and place” approach is the clear winner.

Google was the “best” pick for 19 respondents, including six who said “Google and Microsoft.” By contrast, Amazon and Meta had just three votes combined.

As for the “worst,” there was no clear consensus, although two respondents from the social sciences picked “everyone besides Microsoft and Google” and “everyone but Google and Microsoft.” Another one told us, “The best is a tie between Microsoft and Google. Everyone else is in the bottom category.”

A third social scientist summed it up even more pungently. “Google is the best, Meta is the worst. Evil corporation” — though with more expletives than that.

Francisco Brown (FB): With Autodesk’s rapid growth in cloud computing and AI, how do you reconcile the increased energy demands of data centers that power these technologies with the company’s commitment to environmental impact?

Joe Speicher (JS): We’ve been investing in what would now be considered AI capabilities for over a decade, and we feel well prepared to deal with both the opportunities and challenges this presents.

We procure cloud service providers and AI capabilities upstream from our vendors. We subsequently provide those same vendors with Autodesk technology and tools to design, build, and manage their cloud infrastructure . We are aware of the energy and emissions associated with the rise of AI, and we are leveraging all of our capabilities to help reduce that overall, by using some of our tools for energy modeling, materials optimization, and data management in these same servers .

The Role of Data in Sustainable Design

FB: You released Autodesk Forma, which features embodied carbon analysis and materials insights. What have you heard from your customers about these new options, and is it changing sustainability practices?

JS: It’s a broad spectrum. We have some customers who are incredibly advanced in their thinking about sustainability and others who are beginning to get their heads around these issues and are starting to address them .

As you mentioned, we created Forma, a platform that connects all phases of project delivery . At the moment, what is designed is not necessarily what gets built . We know this just from change orders alone, right? Now, with this integrated approach—from the architect’s original model, to construction, to the owner, to the [building] operator—they get a live digital twin of the project model to validate performance against the original design and specifications .

As we transition to this data-driven, end-to-end offering, we’re also becoming a platform company, which, by definition, means interoperability of data across the markets we serve, particularly in the built environment, because, for us, sustainability is a data problem . But, yes, we’re getting positive feedback from our customers overall, and interestingly, I will say, over the last few years, our customers are pushing us to do more .

Corporate Sustainability Targets

FB: What are the biggest challenges that Autodesk faces in meeting its own sustainability targets on time?

JS: We have three goals that we focus on from a sustainability perspective. The first: Reduce emissions associated with running our own business.

We have an SBTI [Science Based Targets initiative]-validated goal across scopes 1, 2, and 3 by this decade. Second: We subsequently commit to powering our business with 100 percent renewable energy. And thirdly, we address the residual emissions associated with our operations.

We are a technology company, so we don’t own much of anything, and we essentially ship only code . We have a relatively light footprint. We meet all our commitments with our customers in mind . What are the things that the industry needs that our customers need overall?

For instance, thinking about reducing carbon emissions, one of the really challenging things is business travel.

Aviation is a hard sector to abate. Therefore, we invest in a couple of sustainable aviation fuel companies and procure sustainable aviation fuel because we think the best thing we can do as a business is to drive the cost curve down so others can participate in this market.

Instead of buying a renewable energy credit, we invest in something called virtual power purchase agreements, which enable us to underwrite the development of renewables on the grid . Bringing more renewables onto the grid helps our industry overall by decarbonizing the grid itself and, lastly, by addressing residual carbon emissions . We invest in a rigorous carbon offsetting program because, again, if we can bring down the cost curve, others—including our customers—can participate in this market .

Workplace Strategy as Inspiration

FB: What are some internal design and workplace strategies that you have implemented that architects and designers might find inspiring in their own offices?

JS: Having an attachment to a workplace and wanting to be in the office are productivity enhancers for us as a business. One of the best ways we do that is by looking to lease office space that is LEED certified, meets the WELL standard, or meets the BREEAM standard.

We know that employees prefer working in office spaces when there’s a sustainability certification . For instance, in our Platinum LEED-certified San Francisco headquarters, we ensured our employees had the best possible experience .

For us, it’s all about the opportunity to move toward outcomes-based thinking, or as we call it, outcome-based BIM [building information modeling] . Rather than just square footage, architecture firms can start thinking about [spatial] utilization and the number of folks in the building in order to improve people’s lives in the future .

The Future of Creative Automation

FB: That is a fantastic lead to my last question, which is about the future. When we think about the future of design tools, what excites you most about the role Autodesk plays in making sustainable design easier, faster, and more creative?

JS: I’m excited about how AI can let designers focus more on the creative side of their work . We’re using AI to automate repetitive tasks and simplify workflows—the parts no one enjoys doing .

Some worry AI might be threatening, but the reality is there’s far more work than there are people or tools to handle it . Technology like ours helps bridge that gap. I often get asked how much carbon Autodesk has offset with our tools . The truth is, the process has traditionally been very siloed—architects design, builders construct, and data gets lost in between .

As we connect those stages through platforms like Autodesk Construction Cloud and Forma, we’ll be able to track a building’s lifecycle, validate its performance, and see measurable carbon reductions . That’s what really excites me—proving that sustainable design isn’t just an ideal but a quantifiable outcome .",https://metropolismag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gallery-SanFrancisco-6445-30-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 15:57:08.324051

Clean fuel projects are moving from pilots to industrial scale, proving that innovation and collaboration can deliver real impact, yet progress remains too slow.

A World Economic Forum white paper shows how business, finance and policy can turn ambition into investable projects and scale the market.

Clean fuels play a vital role in addressing the energy trilemma by providing secure, affordable and cleaner sources of energy. They offer pathways to make hard-to-abate sectors such as transport, industry and parts of power and heat generation cleaner, while simultaneously enabling competitiveness and driving innovation across the energy system.

Building on the momentum of the Belém 4x pledge, clean fuels are poised to scale and deliver tangible economic and social benefits. They can create two to three times more jobs than conventional fuels (particularly in rural areas) while reducing fossil fuel import dependence by 5-15% through domestic biofuels production. With fuels expected to meet 40-55% of global energy demand by 2050, scaling clean-fuel supply is essential to secure affordable energy and industrial competitiveness. Mobilizing the $100 billion in annual investment needed by 2030 can unlock this potential.

As the World Economic Forum's Future of Clean Fuels initiative marks its one-year milestone with the release of its white paper and digital playbook, members of the initiative’s steering committee share below how collaboration between business, policy and finance is already turning ambition into action – and what lessons can guide the next phase of scale-up.

1. Industrial innovation is proving that different clean fuels can scale

J.J.Imaz, Chief Executive Officer, Repsol

Industrial innovation is proving that clean fuels can scale and deliver real impact. Across Europe, companies are investing in technologies that turn ambition into reality, creating new value chains, reducing emissions and strengthening energy security. From biofuels to e-fuels, these initiatives show that clean fuels are not just a future promise, but a present solution. Repsol is at the forefront of this transformation, driving projects that demonstrate how low-carbon fuels can be produced at an industrial scale while supporting competitiveness and quality jobs.

""At Repsol, we believe clean fuels are indispensable for the energy transition. They not only reduce emissions, but also strengthen Europe’s energy security, industrial competitiveness and quality jobs. This is why we are investing across all pathways. Biofuels are already a reality and we are producing 250,000 tons per year in our Cartagena plant. We have approved the Final Investment decision of Ecoplanta, which will convert municipal solid waste into 240,000 tons of renewable methanol, cutting millions of tons of CO₂ emissions. We are building a demo-plant with a production capacity of 8,000 litres per day of synthetic fuels that will be located in the port of Bilbao.

Clean fuels are a real alternative for road transport, maritime, aviation and industry and they can scale using existing assets while creating new value chains. There is no single solution: biofuels, e-fuels and other low-carbon fuels all have a role to play.

Technological neutrality is key: let science and competitiveness decide the winners, not policy. For example, cars running exclusively on sustainable fuels can reduce emissions beyond 2035 and should be recognized in EU framework. By building the market, technology and infrastructure today, we ensure that Europe remains competitive and that the transition is both sustainable and realistic.""

2. Clean fuels can help reduce emissions using existing infrastructure and established value chains

Hans Olav Raen, Chief Executive Officer, Yara Clean Ammonia

Clean fuels can be integrated to today’s industrial and energy infrastructure, rather than replacing it entirely, which reduces costs and accelerates adoption.

""To scale clean fuels, we need real projects delivering real molecules, and we are proving that it can be done. In Porsgrunn (Norway), we now operate one of Europe’s largest renewable-hydrogen-based ammonia facilities, showing how industry, policy and technology can work together to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. At the same time, we are building a major carbon capture and storage facility at our Sluiskil plant in the Netherlands, which will be operational in 2026 and further reduce emissions from one of Europe’s largest fertilizer and ammonia hubs. But a single plant, or even two, is not enough. What we need next is coordinated global demand, clear certification frameworks, and accelerated investments in logistics and bunkering so clean fuels can move from pilot to global market. We can build this system together.""

3. Scaling clean fuels can only be done through more collaboration and investment

Hans Kobler, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Energy Impact Partners

Investments into clean fuels projects face a unique set of challenges and market risks, given that the value chains are complex, interdependent and often spanning multiple feedstocks. Global clean fuel ambitions require annual investments in production to quadruple from $25 billion per year today to $100 billion per year by 2030. Unlocking that scale depends on aligning investors, industry and policy-makers to share risk and build confidence in new value chains.

“At Energy Impact Partners, we are advancing the future of energy by bringing together incumbents, innovators and capital to find and scale innovative energy solutions. Clean fuels have a critical role to play in decarbonizing the global economy. Together with our partners, we invested in companies such as Electric Hydrogen, constructing one of the largest electrolyzers in the US or Metafuels, new sustainable aviation fuel pathways.""

Cate Hight, Partner Energy & Sustainability, Bain & Company

“At Bain & Company, we work with leading companies and investors to advance their clean-fuels ambitions. Our experience shows that those who succeed in clean fuels are often disruptive thinkers, exploring new business models and investment strategies to balance risk and reward. Because these markets and projects differ from conventional commodities, we work with clients to develop resilient commercial plans, build strategic partnerships, manage capital and risk with discipline and shape flexible operating models. These elements are essential to navigating the uncertainty and unlocking viable project economics in clean fuels.”

4. Accelerating innovation in first-of-a-kind projects will be critical

Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer, Occidental

Scaling low carbon fuels will rely on investing in scalable feedstock pathways today. In the US, Occidental’s first commercial Direct Air Capture (DAC) project – named STRATOS – is designed to capture up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, once fully operational. The captured carbon can create value in several ways, including combing the atmospheric CO2 with clean hydrogen to produce synthetic low carbon transportation fuels, like Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Occidental can also leverage 50+ years of experience safely and securely using carbon dioxide (CO₂) in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations, which injects CO₂ into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs to encourage flow, unlocking previously inaccessible hydrocarbons. When paired with CO₂ from carbon capture solutions, like Direct Air Capture (DAC), CCS-EOR can enable low-carbon fuels while using existing sites more efficiently.

“When we think about addressing emissions, we need to be firm in low-carbon performance and flexible in approach so we can achieve reductions at an accelerated pace and meaningful scale. Our team has used CO₂ for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years, which can store more CO2 underground than what is emitted during the product’s lifecycle. It's low-carbon fuel technology that works and is compatible with today’s infrastructure and value chain.

Moreover, we believe that innovative technologies, like DAC, will be instrumental in shaping the future energy landscape. STRATOS is a major first-of-a-kind energy infrastructure project, offering a valuable example of how industry can turn excess carbon into value and fuel a lower-carbon future. Our teams at Carbon Engineering continue to innovate the process so that advancements that drive costs down and make the technology more accessible can be introduced at scale.”

5. Policy is a catalyst for developing the clean fuels market

Policy will be a critical lever in developing the clean fuels market, particularly given the current cost premium compared with conventional fuels. As illustrated in our Playbook of Solutions, Brazil has shown how integrated measures ranging from blending mandates to carbon credit trading – under its RenovaBio programme – can stimulate private investment, create jobs and strengthen energy security. By advancing the Belém 4x pledge, Brazil is taking a leading role in promoting clean fuels globally and demonstrating how coherent national strategies can turn ambition into tangible market growth.

The way forward

From Europe to Brazil, these case studies show that scaling clean fuels is already underway, but progress must accelerate.

It additionally details plans for policy engagement and external partnerships.

The Climate Transition Plan provides more details on eBay’s 2045 net-zero target and interim 2030 climate goals, which have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (eBay).

By 2030, the business is aiming for a 90% reduction in absolute Scope 1 (operational) and Scope 2 (energy-related) emissions by 2030, against a 2019 baseline.

Within the same timeframe, it also wants to deliver a 27.5% reduction in absolute Scope 3 (indirect) emissions from downstream transportation.

These goals support a 2045 net-zero ambition under the SBTi’s Net Zero Standard for corporates. This standard mandates a 90% reduction in absolute emissions across all scopes. High-quality carbon offsetting should be used to address residual emissions.

eBay’s chief sustainability officer Renee Morin said the new Climate Transition Plan “reflects eBay’s long-standing commitment to climate resiliency, creating enduring value for our customers and community”.

Strategic priorities

The new Climate Transition Plan document states that eBay’s emissions would be likely to increase by 11% by 2030 with no interventions, due to growth. But this can be more than offset by the measures set out to improve energy efficiency, integrate renewable energy, adopt circular economy processes and collaborate with the downstream transport industry.

The document elaborates that the business’s low-carbon transition should be “inclusive and equitable”, creating new opportunities for SMEs, social enterprises and nonprofits.

It also emphasises the importance of engaging staff with the plan and “embedding sustainability into how we work and connect”.

It commits eBay to working with external partners to improve carbon data accuracy and industry standards for carbon accounting and carbon offsetting.

Solving the Scope 3 challenge

As is the case for most larger businesses, the bulk of eBay’s total climate impact is indirect. The business will have a different approach of managing Scope 3 emissions than traditional retailers which procure and sell new goods.

The Transition Plan document elaborates: “eBay does not own fleets, warehouses, or delivery networks, so our progress depends on influencing carriers and partners to invest in and adopt cleaner practices and technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which are currently limited in availability.

“The global parcel delivery system is, by the nature of our business model, highly fragmented with public and private carriers operating across diverse infrastructures, regions, and incentives. We are achieving meaningful progress through collaboration, data transparency, and shared accountability across every link in this chain.”

Stated priorities for measuring and reducing Scope 3 emissions include enhancing data completeness and quality; aligning with evolving best-practice standards and methodologies; re-evaluating assumptions based on changes in policy, technology and consumer behaviour; supporting the uptake of low-carbon technologies; collaborating with external partners and incentivising sellers to use low-carbon logistics options.

eBay’s plans for engaging with policymakers to decarbonise the systems in which it operates, while fostering business growth, are also set out.

The firm will continue to back the EU in producing the Circular Economy Act and the US in running the Congressional Recommerce Caucus. It will also advocate for regulations that reduce barriers to recommerce for small businesses; that promote the scaling of low-carbon logistics solutions; and that enhance the affordability and accessibility of renewable energy.

Following the announcement, BP’s share price rose 4.25% to $35.82 per barrel from $34.36.

Combining Corteva’s expertise in seed technology and agricultural innovation with BP’s refining and fuel marketing capabilities, Etlas aims to scale the production of vegetable oils from crops like canola, mustard and sunflower for the production of low-carbon fuels and meet the rising global demand for SAF and RD.

The strategy involves cultivating crops for the production of low-carbon fuels on existing farmland between food crop cycles and improving soil health while creating additional income opportunities for farmers without the need for additional land.

The new JV expects supply to commence in 2027, serving both refinery co-processing operations and dedicated biofuel facilities, and targets production of 1 million metric tons of feedstock annually by the mid-2030s — enough to generate more than 800,000 tons of biofuel.

Investors should note that this project has enabled BP and CTVA to align their business models with the current global shift toward cleaner fuel while generating additional future cash flow.

BP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present while CTVA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

A report catches Cathay Pacific's attention, showing China might grow its green jet fuel output more than expected. Not just policies alone, but better teamwork across companies, funding shifts, and joined-up planning could push cleaner fuels into wider use there. What stands out is how much room remains unused in today’s flight energy mix. Progress hinges on steady moves from regulators and businesses alike, not isolated efforts.

China stands out in the report as central to future use of cleaner jet fuels. Because its airlines cover vast distances, more people fly each year, while pressure grows to cut carbon output. Progress here might quietly shape global efforts to lower pollution from planes. How fast these new fuels spread will likely influence emission trends well beyond 2050.

Large Scale SAF Opportunity Identified

China shows solid groundwork for making plenty of sustainable aviation fuel. Diverse materials sit ready for use across its vast landscape. Refineries already hum in many regions. Air travel grows faster each year than before elsewhere. Together these pieces build momentum. A push through smart policies could turn potential into real output soon after.

Research shows SAF might play a bigger role in China’s plane fuel as carriers look for real ways to cut total carbon output. Early progress seems possible with today’s tech if rules become clearer and investors feel more secure.

Policy and Regulatory Alignment Highlighted

Better policy direction could open up funding for SAF. Clear rules over time - like required fuel mixes or rewards - might lower money risks, says the analysis. Producers and carriers both stand to gain stability if decisions are firm.

Few signs point further than general promises when it comes to China's green plans shaping cleaner fuel progress. Still, rules tailored for air travel lag behind those in similar large economies, holding back how fast new fuels take off so far.

A major news outlet says better federal rules plus teamwork across industries might speed up the use of sustainable aviation fuel while helping local suppliers grow.

Role of Airlines in Scaling Demand

Planes need fuel, so airlines play a big role in pushing for cleaner options. One key move? Signing deals that last years - these give makers steady income, making it easier to fund new plants. Stability here means progress down the road.

What Cathay Pacific says about the report shows airlines here are paying closer attention to cleaner fuels. Not long ago, they said these alternative fuels would play a big role in cutting emissions over time. Other steps include flying smarter and upgrading planes.

Beyond just numbers, progress hinges on how well airlines work with fuel makers, airport teams, one policy shift at a time. What matters most shows up when these groups align before prices spike or supplies shrink.

Feedstocks and Production Pathways

Now here comes the part about what we can use to make things. How it gets turned into something useful matters too.

Fuel made from trash might play a role in China's push for cleaner aviation options. One path being studied uses leftovers instead of raw resources. Another idea builds fuel molecule by molecule through chemical processes. Shifting to homegrown sources may ease pressure on foreign oil supplies. Progress here lines up with broader efforts to change how the country powers itself.

Out of China’s current know-how in refining and chemicals comes a chance to grow sustainable aviation fuel output. Shifting focus through smart funding might turn present facilities toward cleaner jet fuels - no need to build everything from scratch.

Right from the start, getting things moving fast can grow hands-on skills. Experience adds up, which slowly brings prices down. Momentum builds quietly, setting the stage for what comes next.

What This Means for Cutting Emissions in Air Travel

Planes still struggle to go green, especially on long trips - options are thin. Instead of waiting for new tech, many look to sustainable fuels; they fit today's jets while cutting down emissions over time.

A look at the data shows China's growing use of sustainable aviation fuel might shift things worldwide, simply because so many flights start or pass through there. As more airlines turn to cleaner fuel, the ripple effect on carbon output across continents may slowly add up.

Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in China

Though the research points to real promise, gains hinge on steady policies, drawing in funds, one hand, teamwork across sectors the other. Missing any of those, scaling up sustainable aviation fuel probably won’t go far soon.

Right away matters more than most realize when cutting future pollution spikes. Starting today on sustainable fuel research lets Chinese airlines help shape worldwide climate progress without losing edge down the road.",https://responsibleus.com/uploads/images/202601/image_750x415_69689e4388c28.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:57:13.934179
,,2026-01-15 15:37:09+00:00,Nebraska Public Media,Auditor flags possible Pillen 'favoritism' in $2.5M no-bid bioeconomy contract with lobbyist,Not Available,,,,,https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/auditor-flags-possible-pillen-favoritism-in-25m-no-bid-bioeconomy-contract-with-lobbyist/,"The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.
Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.
The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.
Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended.
“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said.","Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations.

State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.

In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.

That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”

Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815.

That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty.

According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”

“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”

Contracting with GSD

Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.

It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.

The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.

DED leaders did not know firm

State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Ak-sar-ben ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.

To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites.

Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell.

The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.

Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”

Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.

Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office.

“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said.

Contract facts

Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts.

Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself.

From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.

Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate.

Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.

Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.”

Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.”

“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.

The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.

Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds

Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans.

The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area.

Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital.

Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.

Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.

Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show.

Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.

The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive.

“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”

Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”

Questions about DG Fuels

Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.

The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.

Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email.

Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.

Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities.

Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.

DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”

“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.

Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.

“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”

Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.

But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024.

The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.

The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.

But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.

Contract obligations questioned

Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.

Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.

The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.

In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/pillen_ZJW_122723-04-1536x1024.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:56:46.731455

,,2026-01-15 15:33:48+00:00,biodieselmagazine.com,Moeve supplies SAF to Condor flights from Tenerife South Airport to several German cities,Not Available,,,,,https://biodieselmagazine.com/articles/moeve-supplies-saf-to-condor-flights-from-tenerife-south-airport-to-several-german-cities,"Moeve has completed the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Condor for flights departing from Tenerife South Airport on the Canary Islands, a location not yet legally subject to ReFuelEU Aviation requirements, underscoring both companies’ strong commitment to advancing the decarbonization of air travel.
The SAF was used on routes connecting Tenerife with major German cities including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf.
According to airport operator Aena, more than 450,000 passengers a year choose Condor for flights to and from Tenerife South Airport.
Working alongside Condor to accelerate this effort clearly shows both companies’ dedication to sustainability beyond what is mandatory regulation,” said Ángel Martínez Campos, sustainable aviation business development at Moeve.
“Since last year, Condor guests have had the opportunity to voluntarily round up their flight booking price or make direct contributions to advance sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and certified climate protection projects.","Moeve has completed the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Condor for flights departing from Tenerife South Airport on the Canary Islands, a location not yet legally subject to ReFuelEU Aviation requirements, underscoring both companies’ strong commitment to advancing the decarbonization of air travel.

The agreement covered more than 515 metric tons of SAF, produced from used cooking oils and agricultural waste, a supply expected to reduce 1,700 tons of lifecycle CO2 emissions when compared with conventional jet fuel. The SAF was used on routes connecting Tenerife with major German cities including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf. According to airport operator Aena, more than 450,000 passengers a year choose Condor for flights to and from Tenerife South Airport.

“This agreement reinforces Moeve’s commitment to lowering emissions in aviation and in an industry as vital to Spain and Tenerife as tourism. Working alongside Condor to accelerate this effort clearly shows both companies’ dedication to sustainability beyond what is mandatory regulation,” said Ángel Martínez Campos, sustainable aviation business development at Moeve.

“Since last year, Condor guests have had the opportunity to voluntarily round up their flight booking price or make direct contributions to advance sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and certified climate protection projects. These funds are exclusively allocated to procure and deploy additional SAF beyond regulatory mandates”, said Sina Rathgeber, director airport relations, government affairs and sustainability at Condor. “Our guests' strong commitment has enabled this significant step forward, including partnerships like Moeve for the procurement of additional SAF.""

The SAF supplied to Condor was produced at Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, where it is currently building a new second-generation biofuels plant with a flexible annual production capacity of 500,000 tons of SAF and renewable diesel. Construction on the new facility, one of the three largest industrial projects being built in Spain, is more than 50% complete and is slated to begin production at the end of 2026. Once operational, it will make Moeve’s second-generation biofuels complex the largest in southern Europe. Expanding production and supply of second-generation biofuels such as SAF is a key pillar of Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy, which aims to position the company as a European leader in the energy transition by 2030.

This is related to a wider question about how energy costs are distributed and paid for (see the Energy Markets section).
£17.8 billion of this initial spending will go towards gas networks, with £10.3 billion supporting high-voltage electricity infrastructure.
We also expect further work in relation to the proposed Hydrogen Storage and Hydrogen Transport Business Models.
The Clean Energy Jobs Plan commits to expanding the Energy Skills Passport beyond offshore wind into sectors including nuclear and electricity networks.","2025 was a turbulent year for renewable energy, with supply chain constraints and high interest rates continuing to impact delivery of projects. The sector also experienced unprecedented geopolitical uncertainty, particularly in the wake of the USA federal administration’s actions to revoke permits for offshore wind projects already under construction. Given the international nature of renewable energy investments, the impacts were, and continue to be, felt globally. Despite these challenges, the UK government has remained committed to its Clean Power 2030 Action Plan (CP30) and ambitious decarbonisation targets, driving the continued acceleration of renewable energy development.

In 2025, this support helped the UK reach 16GW of offshore wind installed capacity, providing more than 17% of the UK’s electricity needs. However, with only 1.2GW of new capacity added last year, the pace of development will have to increase significantly to meet the CP30 ambition of 43-50GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. On 14 January 2026, Contract for Difference (CfD) allocation round 7 (AR7) awarded support to 8.4GW of offshore wind capacity, an outcome that exceeded industry’s initial expectations and is intended to keep the UK on track to achieve its CP30 ambitions. AR7 originally allocated a budget for fixed-bottom offshore wind of £900 million and set an administrative strike price (ASP) of £113/MWh (2024 prices), with a separate price for projects in Scotland reflecting differences in grid network charges between the regions. However, the Secretary of State exercised his powers to double the fixed-bottom offshore wind budget for AR7 to £1.79 billion, awarding strike prices of £91.20/MWh for projects in England and Wales and £89.49/MWh in Scotland (each in 2024 prices), an increase compared to AR6. AR7 also saw two floating offshore wind (FLOW) projects receive support, with a strike price of £216.49/MWh (in 2024 prices) in a pot 4 auction, 20% lower than the ASP of £271/MWh. We expect to see a lot of activity in the offshore wind sector in 2026 and this will be a space to watch as industry digests the results. AR7 is also the first split auction, with the established (pot 1) and less established (pot 2) renewable technology auctions concluding in February (discussed below).

For FLOW, which is arguably facing similar but heightened challenges as compared to fixed-bottom offshore wind, the Crown Estate’s announcements in June and November 2025 of the awards under its 5th Celtic Sea leasing round were broadly welcomed. Three sites with potential for 4.5GW of capacity were awarded to Equinor and Gwynt Gas (two sites) and Ocean Winds (one site). In addition, public capital has been deployed to support the sector, with investment in the Pentland FLOW project (which also received support in AR7) by Great British Energy (GBE) and the National Wealth Fund (NWF). Industry will now be awaiting financial close of the Green Volt FLOW project.

AR7 implements important reforms to the CfD mechanism, including allowing repowering projects within the onshore wind category and extending the CfD term from 15 to 20 years for wind and solar projects, reducing exposure to merchant tail risk and market price volatility. Fixed-bottom offshore wind projects were also able to apply for CfD support without full planning consent, allowing projects at earlier stages of development to participate in AR7, increasing competition. In 2026, we will see further updates to the CfD terms ahead of AR8 following the outcome of an ongoing consultation, including decisions on a permanent restriction on previously surrendered capacity bidding into future ARs and introducing a new technology category for “Other Deepwater Offshore Wind” as a subset of the existing Offshore Wind category.

Aligned to the government’s growth mission, 2025 also saw the first Clean Industry Bonus (CIB) process for fixed-bottom and FLOW held ahead of AR7. The CIB provides financial rewards for projects on the condition they prioritise investment in regions of the UK that need it most or in cleaner supply chains, including traditional oil and gas communities. The government increased support to £544 million in the CIB round ahead of AR7 and anticipates that this will help leverage up to £9.3 billion in private sector investment over the next four years. In 2026, we expect to see the government response to a consultation on the CIB for AR8, including the potential expansion of the scheme to onshore wind projects.

The coming year is likely to see further deployment of funding from GBE and NWF to support CP30’s goals. Following the operationalisation and £8.3 billion capitalisation of GBE and its sister organisation GBE Nuclear in 2025, we expect GBE to drive clean energy development across the UK and seek opportunities to deploy capital as a developer, investor, and owner of clean energy projects. GBE’s strategic plan commits, by 2030, to deliver at least 15GW of clean energy generation and storage, and more than 10,000 jobs directly supported through GBE-backed and funded projects, including in areas historically dependent on oil and gas. GBE has already launched a £300 million Supply Chain Fund for Offshore Wind and Networks, aimed at building UK manufacturing capacity for key constrained components in the offshore wind and electricity network sectors such as wind turbine blades and transmission cables. Building on the Chancellor’s Statement of Strategic Priorities for the NWF in March last year, the fund will publish its strategic plan in early 2026. NWF chief executive Oliver Holbourne has indicated that it is likely to favour direct investments or co-investments (over funding via externally managed funds).

For solar, reforms to the CfD terms are expected to encourage deployment, with target commissioning windows for solar projects now extended from 3 to 12 months in AR7 to facilitate larger developments, supporting the CP30 ambition of 45-47GW of installed capacity by 2030. Up to £295 million is allocated to solar PV projects for AR7, a significant real terms increase on the maximum amount allocated to the sector in AR6. Solar projects may bid up to an ASP of £75/MWh in the AR, with results expected in late February. The government’s Solar Roadmap also includes initiatives in respect of the deployment of rooftop solar on domestic and non-domestic buildings. The sector is also expected to receive a further boost from the publication of the long-awaited Future Homes Standard and Future Buildings Standard which are expected to be published early this year.

Planning reforms to facilitate faster consenting of renewables projects are expected to be implemented in 2026. The Planning and Infrastructure Act (PIA) received Royal Assent on 18 December 2025 and will assist by streamlining the nationally significant infrastructure project (NSIP) regime. Under related secondary legislation, from 31 December 2025, onshore wind projects (subject to a de facto ban under the Conservative government) will be reintroduced into the NSIP regime, and the capacity threshold in England and Wales at which onshore wind and ground-mounted solar projects are NSIPs will be lifted to more than 100MW – allowing smaller projects to be approved at local authority level. Beyond planning, the PIA also increases the statutory deadline for the divestment of offshore transmission assets from 18 to 27 months, a timeframe more reflective of the practical realities of testing, commissioning, and divesting these assets. Separately, the government has also committed to fast-track renewables and other planning decisions on major infrastructure by the end of this Parliament as part of its pro-growth agenda.

Finally, developers of existing renewable generation projects currently supported under the Renewables Obligation (RO) will be considering their options for when government support for a swathe of early projects comes to an end in 2027. Whilst onshore wind developers now have the option to secure CfD support for repowering for projects which meet the eligibility criteria, many will be considering what other revenue streams might be available in the market, including Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (currently the subject of a government consultation, closing on 6 March 2026).

In July 2025, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ), Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) unveiled the Clean Flexibility Roadmap building on CP30. The roadmap sets out a vision for a dynamic, consumer-focussed electricity system where flexibility is integral to cost reduction, resilience and decarbonisation. The roadmap identifies actions to unlock short duration flexibility—such as consumer-led demand response (see the Energy Markets section) and grid-scale batteries—and long duration solutions such as low carbon dispatchable power and long duration electricity storage (LDES). It also establishes a governance framework to track delivery and hold stakeholders accountable.

In relation to electricity storage, 2026 will be a significant year for the implementation of the cap and floor scheme for LDES projects. Designed to overcome investment barriers, the scheme guarantees a minimum revenue floor to provide investor confidence while capping excessive returns to safeguard consumers. The first application window for the scheme opened in April 2025, with 77 projects shortlisted to proceed to the project assessment stage in September. The shortlisted projects represent a combined discharge capacity of 28.7GW and cover a range of technology types including battery storage technologies and pumped storage hydro. Ofgem aims to publish an “Initial Decision List” of projects offered a cap and floor in Q1 2026, with the final list of successful projects to be announced in summer 2026. In spring 2026, Ofgem also aims to publish the expected timing for opening the second application window, based on advice from NESO.

In relation to low carbon dispatchable power, towards the end of 2025, Drax Power Limited signed a new low carbon dispatchable contract-for-difference (LCD CfD) with the Low Carbon Contracts Company. The LCD CfD, which runs from April 2027 to March 2031, supports the continued operation of the four biomass units at Drax’s Yorkshire power station, with flexible operation to support high and low demand periods. This innovative arrangement complements intermittent renewable generation and helps maintain security of supply. For more information on the LCD CfD, please see our post here.

The Clean Flexibility Roadmap envisages that hydrogen to power (H2P) and gas-fired power plants using carbon, capture and storage (CCS) will also be required to support system flexibility. The government intends to launch the new H2P business model, using a dispatchable power agreement-style mechanism to support the deployment of H2P (for detailed information, please see the Hydrogen section). The government’s response to a consultation on how to categorise participation of H2P in the Capacity Market is still awaited. Trials are also underway to test co-firing of hydrogen with natural gas, as a decision on hydrogen blending into the gas networks approaches, with Centrica and HiiROC doing so successfully at Centrica’s Brigg Energy Park.

Following the final investment decision for Net Zero Teesside in December 2024, support for other gas-fired power plants using CCS technology is also under consideration by government to meet system flexibility requirements (also see the CCUS section).

In relation to the CM, we expect a range of reforms to take shape in 2026. Notably, early this year the government will publish its response to a consultation ahead of the auction prequalification round commencing in July. Proposals include measures to address the interaction between the LDES cap and floor scheme and the CM, managing the transition of generating units into the CfD regime, increasing termination fees and credit-cover requirements and the introduction of a Multiple Price Capacity Market that could, if needed, support investment in new build dispatchable enduring capacity so that these units can access a higher price cap, while other participants can continue to secure agreements up to the existing £75/kW/year cap. This builds on an earlier consultation in October 2025. The government also continues to consider how better integrate low-carbon and flexible technologies into the CM. The government’s response to its annual call for views on new generating technologies which could contribute to security of supply highlighted several forms of capacity including H2P, consumer-led flexibility and flexible compute capacity which might play a role in the CM in future. With the government’s Reformed National Pricing package expected to include changes to the CM and initiatives underway to consider engaging the demand-side in energy system balancing (see the Energy Markets section), we expect further changes to the CM in 2026.

After a busy year, the GB nuclear energy industry is looking ahead to 2026 with a renewed sense of optimism. Whilst all but one of the UK’s operational nuclear power stations are due to be retired in the early 2030s (subject to any lifetime extensions that may potentially be implemented – see below), two large-scale new nuclear plants are under construction and Secretary of State Ed Miliband has promised a new “golden age” for the sector.

New large-scale nuclear projects remain central to the UK’s future energy mix and ambition for sovereign capability in affordable, clean, homegrown power. The UK government’s final investment decision on Sizewell C in July 2025, followed by financial close in November 2025, marked a milestone for the 3.2GW plant and the first deployment of the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model in nuclear financing. Industry observers suggest the RAB model’s success for Sizewell C could prove crucial to unlocking further private investment in new nuclear projects. Meanwhile, Great British Energy - Nuclear has been tasked with identifying suitable sites across the UK (including in Scotland) for another large-scale nuclear project, with findings due in autumn 2026. In addition, the UK government is consulting on amendments to CfD legislation to enable existing nuclear assets to qualify for CfDs, with a view to incentivising investment in reactor lifetime extensions (such as Sizewell B).

At the other end of the spectrum, modular reactors are gaining momentum. In June 2025, Rolls-Royce was announced as the selected bidder in the UK government’s small modular reactor (SMR) competition, becoming the UK government’s technology design partner for the SMR design. In November 2025, the UK government confirmed it had designated Wylfa as the first site for deployment of that SMR technology and, in December 2025, it further confirmed that work was expected to begin onsite during 2026. 2025 also saw the announcement of several private sector partnerships: X-Energy and Centrica have teamed up to develop a project for the potential deployment of up to 12 advanced modular reactors (AMRs) in Hartlepool, whilst Holtec, EDF and Tritax are collaborating on developing data centres powered by SMRs at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. The Cottam project spotlights the potential for co-located nuclear assets to meet energy demand driven by the AI boom, with a 1GW data centre project targeted for the end of the decade. These developments underscore the significant role to be played by the private sector in the nuclear industry’s future. The UK government intends to publish imminently a framework to enable privately funded advanced nuclear projects in order to mobilise capital.

However, challenges remain before the UK government’s vision for a “nuclear renaissance for Britain” materialises. The Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce (established by the Prime Minister in February 2025) published its review in November 2025 and confirmed that the UK remains “the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear projects”. Industry participants have warned that regulatory requirements, particularly regarding permitting and siting, represent material barriers to accelerated deployment. The Taskforce’s recommendations seek to remedy fragmentation in regulatory oversight, and to streamline environmental and permitting processes, advocating for a “radical reset” through establishing a single, unified decision-making body—a Commission on Nuclear Regulation—to act as final arbiter on all major nuclear regulatory decisions. The UK government has accepted the Taskforce’s recommendations, and is expected to produce a full implementation plan in early 2026, marking a critical juncture for whether regulatory reform can deliver the cost reductions and acceleration necessary to realise the UK’s nuclear ambitions.

We expect the future shape of the GB energy market to become clearer in 2026 as the government crystallises its thinking to electricity markets and reviews gas security of supply (as described further below). In addition, we expect the consultation on the role of Ofgem to be on the agenda in 2026, following a call for evidence in December 2024. As highlighted in the Treasury’s Regulation Action Plan Update, published in October 2025, the review is nearly complete and “recommendations for streamlining Ofgem’s duties and strengthening its mandate on growth” are imminent. Ofgem’s current remit includes regulating gas and electricity markets, heat networks, the regulated asset base model for nuclear power and carbon dioxide transport and storage networks, as well as overseeing NESO. As we have noted previously, the outcome of the review may therefore have wide-ranging consequences across the GB energy regulatory landscape.

Electricity

2025 saw significant scrutiny of the wholesale market driven by the ongoing Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA) programme. In the REMA Update, published in July 2025, the government announced its decision to commit to a single national wholesale electricity market price, ruling out zonal pricing. DESNZ has, however, been clear that business-as-usual is not sustainable and indicated its intention to use a range of levers to incentivise both optimal locations for new assets and efficient system operation. For further details, please see our article here. 2026 is expected to see the publication of the Reformed National Pricing (RNP) delivery plan. Originally expected in autumn 2025, this will set out key activities for implementing RNP and an overview of the legislation required to deliver the package. The RNP deliver plan will be supported by broader market changes, including to electricity system planning, to the Balancing Mechanism, to Transmission Network Use of System charges and to the Capacity Market (see the Energy Networks and the Electricity Storage and Flexible power sections).

These market changes and interventions will need to factor in a possible future re-integration of the GB power market into the EU internal electricity market. Both the UK government and the European Commission (EC) have highlighted the benefits of reintegration, including lower consumer prices, investment in the North Sea and strengthening energy security. On 22 December 2025, they confirmed plans to begin negotiations for a European Union-United Kingdom Electricity Agreement to provide the framework for the UK’s renewed participation. It is intended that this agreement will cover wholesale and retail markets, aligning UK and EC rules for the promotion of renewables, environmental protections and State aid.

Gas

In relation to gas, 2026 is likely to see an open debate on the role of gas in the UK’s future energy mix following a consultation in November 2025 on the priorities for gas security of supply during the energy transition, and the associated challenges facing the sector. The consultation highlights that the pattern of gas supply and consumption is changing and that measures may need to be taken to ensure that security of supply is assured in rarer scenarios (e.g unprecedented failures or rare cold weather events). Whilst levers to manage this include gas storage facilities, LNG infrastructure and gas interconnectors, DESNZ highlights it would also like to explore the concept of a strategic gas storage reserve or longer-term gas contracting models. In addition, to ensure that the commercial model of gas supply works for asset owners and investors, the government is considering whether there could be a case for revenue support mechanisms for certain types of infrastructure and whether there is scope to reduce regulatory barriers to flexibility in the gas market. A response is expected in spring 2026 with further consultations to refine the detailed proposals.

Retail and supply

In relation to the retail market, following Ofgem’s publication of its Markets Regulatory Vision and Strategy in November 2025, in 2026 we expect to see continued focus on consumer energy bills and engaging consumers in the transition to net zero for example through developing skills and incentives to increase consumer engagement in electricity-system flexibility (following a consultation in 2025). Development of consumer-led flexibility will be supported by technical decisions on the sharing of customer smart data and to ensure greater visibility of distributed energy assets, as well as the migration to market-wide half-hourly settlement (currently underway and scheduled for completion in May 2027).

2026 will also see implementation of the government’s Autumn Budget and Industrial Strategy priorities to lower bills for domestic and non-domestic consumers. In particular, following the announcement of the removal of some social and environmental levies funding a range of schemes (see our briefing here), Ofgem and DESNZ will be looking to ensure the savings are fully passed on by suppliers. 2026 is also likely to see a decision (following a consultation in September 2025) on a new licence requirement on energy suppliers to offer customers at least one tariff with lower standing charges (i.e. charges designed to recover the fixed costs of the system). This is related to a wider question about how energy costs are distributed and paid for (see the Energy Markets section). Separately, following publication of its Debt Strategy, Ofgem is also consulting on a Debt Relief Scheme for customers in arrears on their energy bills for implementation this year.

Energy networks look set to continue their transition in 2026. Some analysts suggest that electricity demand is at a tipping point, predicting this is set to grow in 2026 for the first time in several years, driven by the rapid adoption of AI and the electrification of transport. Ofgem has approved an initial £28 billion investment in gas and electricity networks (with potential for this to rise to £90 billion over the five years to 2031) as part of the next price control period beginning in April 2026. £17.8 billion of this initial spending will go towards gas networks, with £10.3 billion supporting high-voltage electricity infrastructure. We are already seeing increased activity to deliver this level of new investment. Coupled with the launch of a new regulatory regime for heat networks and proposals to build the UK’s first hydrogen transport network (see the Hydrogen section), 2026 promises to be a significant year for energy network development.

The cost of increased energy network investment, as well as other costs (such as operating and policy costs), are currently collected through charges. In this context, Ofgem held a consultation in 2025 to consider whether there are more efficient ways to allocate and recover energy system costs. Following review of over 300 responses, Ofgem expects to consult on policy options in spring 2026.

2026 will also be a crucial year for network planning and the development of NESO’s centralised planning of the transmission and distribution networks with development of the first Strategic Spatial Energy Plan (SSEP) underway, following publication of the SSEP methodology in 2025. The SSEP is a long-term blueprint identifying where, and what types of, electricity and hydrogen generation and storage are needed for net zero. Originally planned for publication in the summer, final publication of the SSEP has shifted to 2027 to incorporate updated cost data into its modelling for accuracy and transparency. The SSEP will inform and complement NESO’s Centralised Strategic Network Plan (CSNP), a 25-year network blueprint for onshore and offshore transmission network requirements for electricity, hydrogen and gas, and eleven Regional Energy Strategic Plans (RESPs), comprising regional whole system energy plans across different energy types and including spatial models of future supply and demand. 2026 will see the publication of the RESPs methodology following a consultation.

Electricity networks

Increased electrification, coupled with accelerated renewable energy deployment, has exposed grid constraints as a critical bottleneck in the electricity market in Great Britain. Connection queues (for entry capacity and demand connections) now far exceed available capacity, highlighting the urgent need for substantial upgrades to the networks. Recognising that timely and efficient grid connections are essential, not only to deliver CP30 ambitions, but also to stimulate economic growth and reduce consumer costs, the government, NESO and Ofgem tackled management of the grid connection queue in 2025. Looking ahead, 2026 will see further implementation of these policies.

At the forefront is the continuation of Ofgem’s Connections Reform programme, which aims to clear speculative projects from the queue and prioritise those ready and critical to CP30 delivery. Ofgem’s approval of NESO’s “First Ready, First Needed” approach (TM04+) in April 2025 marked a decisive shift from the historic “first come, first served” model of managing grid connections. Under the new framework, Gate 2 readiness criteria were applied to determine revised queue positions and connection dates based on technology type, location, strategic alignment, and project readiness, enabling NESO to decide which projects advance in Phase 1 by 2030 and which will follow in Phase 2 by 2035. At the heart of reforms is the prioritisation of projects “where needed”, a key element of the government’s Reformed National Pricing package (see the Energy Markets section). In this regard, the development of the SSEP, CSNP and RESPs (mentioned above) will be key. Following the publication of the Connection Reform results on 8 December, the first batch of developers with connection dates in 2026/27 are now being issued with updated connection offers, with Gate 2 final customer notifications expected to be issued no later than Q3 2026. Projects failing Gate 2 criteria will receive Gate 1 offers—indicative, non-committed terms—allowing developers to terminate applications by the end of 2026. With the timeline still under review and some projects inevitably being de-prioritised, it remains to be seen whether these decisions will be challenged. Associated with this, Ofgem is currently consulting on changes to network company licence conditions and the broader regulatory framework for grid connections, to align this with the Connections Reform package.

The government, NESO and Ofgem are also looking to address the surge in demand connection applications, particularly from data centres, which has brought the total demand queue to 125GW as of June 2025. Targeted interventions are being considered to curate a viable demand queue, improve data quality and transparency, and prioritise strategically aligned demand connections. Proposed reforms include changes to grid securities, progression fees, and enabling greater participation in high-voltage asset ownership, all aimed at accelerating connection timeframes and supporting market-driven solutions. The government has also asked, Lucy Yu, the DESNZ-appointed AI Champion for Clean Energy, to carry out a review of the potential benefits and challenges of AI deployment to electricity networks, with a final report including recommendations to governments, regulators and industry, expected to be published by the summer.

Gas networks

On 30 June 2025 DESNZ published its Midstream gas system: Update to Market, setting out the government’s view on upcoming changes to the gas system in Great Britain and the measures being taken to ensure a secure, affordable and fair transition away from gas. As part of its public engagement plan, DESNZ launched a consultation in November 2025 (closing 18 February 2026) on its assessment of the priorities for security of supply. This includes consideration of the role of gas storage facilities, LNG infrastructure and gas interconnectors, and exploration of whether additional policy intervention is needed to ensure the commercial model supports the required capacity in the context of shrinking demand. In 2026, the government is expected to issue calls for evidence on network investment and affordability, and the transition of the gas system.

Heat networks

From 27 January 2026, Ofgem begins regulating heat networks in Great Britain, introducing a new authorisation regime for regulated heat network activities, strengthening consumer protections, and imposing technical standards requirements. The Heat Network Technical Assurance Scheme (HNTAS) provides the mechanism through which operators, which must register with Ofgem by 26 January 2026, evidence compliance. In parallel, the government is progressing heat network zoning, which will designate areas where heat networks offer the lowest-cost pathway to decarbonising heat. Authorities expect designations to commence in 2026 as the implementing framework takes shape.

The ambition to grow heat networks, from around 3% of heat supply today to 20% by 2050 carries an estimated investment opportunity of £60-£80 billion by mid-century. Capital grant funding—including the Green Heat Network Fund—supports this expansion. Heat pump installations have also accelerated, reaching 35,387 in the first nine months of 2025, whilst the Clean Heat Market Mechanism sets manufacturers’ Year 2 obligation at 8% of relevant boiler sales from 1 April 2026 (rising from 6%). Yet familiar constraints continue to shape delivery: the electricity-to-gas price differential blunts the household business case, grid capacity and connection timelines increasingly bite, and the supply chain—spanning manufacturing, installation, and skills—remains under pressure.

The UK CCUS sector has reached a key moment in its development with significant developments in 2025. Notably, Eni’s Liverpool Bay CO2 T&S network reached FID in April, becoming the UK’s second carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and storage (T&S) network to achieve FID (following the East Coast Cluster, developed by the Northern Endurance Partnership, in December 2024). Key emitter carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects connecting to HyNet, Padeswood cement works (Heidleberg Materials) and Protos Energy Recovery Facility (Encyclis), subsequently took FID in the autumn. £9.4 billion of additional devex funding for the sector was announced in the 2025 Spending Review, providing capital for these Track 1 projects along with devex funding for the next wave of projects in Track 2. Rounding off a busy year for the sector, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) also launched its second carbon storage licensing round, offering 14 sites in English and Scottish waters to developers for exploration and appraisal, with applications due by 24 March 2026.

2026 will see the government focus on using existing capacity in these two CO2 T&S networks. We expect continued negotiations in relation to the emitter projects shortlisted for negotiation as part of the HyNet expansion exercise. The government has also indicated it will launch a further selection process in early 2026 for connections for Teesside-based projects to the East Coast Cluster. This is likely to be a high priority given bp’s decision in December to withdraw plans to develop the H2 Teesside hydrogen with CCS project (amidst competing demands for a data centre at the site). Industry bodies such as the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) are also pressing government for progress in 2026 on negotiations with the Track 2 CO2 T&S networks: Acorn and Viking. In parallel, the market will be keen to gauge investor appetite in the proposed sale of Storegga’s stake in Acorn.

In this context, DESNZ is continuing its programme to deliver the CCUS regulatory framework. In 2026, government will consult on its view of future CCUS networks and the evolution of economic regulation for CO2 storage, following two Calls for Evidence in 2025. It will also seek stakeholder input on revisions to the framework for third party access to CCS infrastructure, and is expected to publish a long-awaited consultation on non-pipeline CO2 transportation which will be important for dispersed emitters.

The government took steps in 2025 to advance Greenhouse Gas Removals (GGR) and power with bioenergy and CCS (BECCS) to encourage private investment in large-scale GGR projects, including a £60 million Direct Air Capture and GGR Innovation Program to lower capture technology costs. In August 2025, details of the GGR business model terms for projects in the HyNet Track-1 expansion negotiation list were published. A UK GGR Standard is also under development, with interim methodologies for BECCS and direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) released by British Standards Institution in July 2025. The October 2025 Whitehead Review also recommended specific measures to accelerate GGR deployment, including establishment of an Office for Greenhouse Gas Removals.

In its Delivery Plan Update, published in December 2025, the CCSA highlighted the scale of development in the UK, which now has more than 100 CCUS initiatives under way with potential to capture and store roughly 77 million tonnes of CO2 annually. Despite this growth, the CCSA found that “policy uncertainty is slowing progress, stalling projects and risking investment”, noting that since 2023, 27 projects have been paused or delayed, with most experiencing average delays of around two years. As a result, industry is calling for the government to provide greater visibility of timelines for Track 2 and beyond in 2026, to increase confidence for investors in the development project pipeline.

On the international stage, the UK government used the COP30 summit to highlight its significant progress in CCUS, and leadership in emerging removal technologies. The UK and EU’s decision to link their respective Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) is also expected to be an area of focus in 2026, as this will facilitate cross-border CO2 storage and enhance the competitiveness of UK CO2 storage projects. Industry will be hoping for further details on arrangements as part of the government’s wider negotiations with the EU (also see the Carbon Markets section).

Whilst 2025 saw steady progress in the UK’s low carbon hydrogen sector with a range of positive announcements from both the public and private sectors (outlined below), the pace of development has slowed. Projects faced delays, raising concerns about project costs, demand for low carbon hydrogen and government funding constraints. With the publication of the Hydrogen Strategy Refresh delayed from 2025, industry will be looking for government to provide fresh impetus into the market in 2026. Looking back on 2025, DESNZ made several significant hydrogen-related announcements.

In relation to the Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HARs), under which DESNZ allocates revenue support to electrolytic hydrogen projects, DESNZ published its HAR2 shortlist in April, advancing 27 electrolytic projects to the next stage of the process. Each of the shortlisted projects will now need to pass a rigorous due diligence process (with strong emphasis placed on value for money) in order to progress further. DESNZ expects to announce the successful projects in early 2026.

The HAR2 announcement was followed in July 2025 by DESNZ’s ‘Hydrogen Update to the Market’ (the Hydrogen Update) in which DESNZ confirmed continued cross-government backing for hydrogen across key end-uses, notably in aviation where the newly introduced Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate (and the associated SAF revenue certainty mechanism which is designed to support SAF producers) provides opportunities for hydrogen-derived fuels (for further details on SAF, see the Alternative Fuels section). At the same time, DESNZ also confirmed the signing of ten HAR1 commercial scale green hydrogen projects. These projects, which include Hygen’s Bradford Low Carbon Hydrogen project and MorGen’s West Wales Hydrogen project, can now begin construction. DESNZ also confirmed it is currently aiming to launch HAR3 by 2026 and HAR4 from 2028.

From a regulatory perspective, green hydrogen producers also received a welcome boost when, in the November 2025 Budget, the government confirmed that it will make electricity used as part of hydrogen production via electrolysis exempt from Climate Change Levy costs, thus improving the operating cost profile of these projects. Separately, in relation to the funding of the Hydrogen Business Models, industry stakeholders are still awaiting the government’s response to the January 2025 consultation on the Gas Shipper Obligation.

Progress in relation to CCS-enabled hydrogen production was rather more limited in 2025 (for further details on CCUS, see the CCUS section). At present, no ‘blue hydrogen’ project in the UK has yet reached financial close and, in December 2025, bp decided against building a hydrogen plant in a site on Teesside, which will now be used to host a data centre instead (see the Digital & Telecoms Infrastructure section).

The government’s focus is turning to hydrogen networks and storage. The Hydrogen Update reaffirmed the ambition to develop the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, to be operational in 2031. This was accompanied by development funding. The Spending Review in June 2025 allocated £500m for the development of hydrogen infrastructure and Ofgem announced a total of £164m of funding for Project Union in October, which seeks to repurpose existing natural gas pipelines and build new pipelines as required to create a new 1500 mile core hydrogen network for Britain, laying the groundwork for connecting regional hydrogen industrial clusters across the North of England and Scotland.

We expect activity in 2026 will be focused on the delivery of the first network, building on a consultation response on the economic regulatory framework underpinning hydrogen pipeline networks in December. This confirmed the government’s intention to establish an effective economic regulatory framework for hydrogen pipeline networks through legislation, licences, and a new hydrogen network code. We also expect further work in relation to the proposed Hydrogen Storage and Hydrogen Transport Business Models. In addition, work is underway on system planning. In October 2025, DESNZ published a policy statement setting out its view on how NESO will carry out strategic planning for hydrogen infrastructure, whilst noting that DESNZ will remain the decision maker regarding the Hydrogen Business Models. The policy statement stressed the importance of NESO taking a ‘whole system’ approach and ensuring that hydrogen infrastructure is integrated into broader energy system planning.

In relation to H2P, the government confirmed in December 2024 that it will introduce a market intervention to de-risk investment in hydrogen to power by a Hydrogen to Power Business Model based on elements of the Dispatchable Power Agreement for CCS-enabled gas-fired generation. In March 2025 DESNZ launched a consultation seeking technical evidence on innovative H2P projects which can be delivered by 2030 ahead of large-scale enabling hydrogen infrastructure. We expect to receive more details of the Hydrogen to Power Business Model during the course of 2026. Please also see the Electricity Storage and Flexible Power section.

In 2025, the UK government’s commitment to a “phased and responsible transition” in the North Sea remained an organising principle, but fiscal and operational pressures have intensified. In her 2025 Autumn Budget speech, the Chancellor emphasised that the UK must “build the industry of the future”, whilst retaining the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) until 2030. While Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) described this as a “bitter blow” to investment confidence, the Budget at least brought some welcome clarity on the policy direction.

The Budget coincided with publication of the government’s North Sea Future Plan, which, whilst reaffirming Labour’s manifesto commitment not to issue new oil and gas licences for new fields, introduces limited flexibility through a Transitional Energy Certificates (TECs) mechanism. TECs will permit limited production from areas tied to, or adjacent to, existing fields, provided this involves no new exploration and is necessary for a managed, prosperous, and orderly transition.

The EPL remains scheduled to conclude on 31 March 2030 but could end earlier if the EPL’s price floor—the “Energy Security Investment Mechanism” (ESIM)—is triggered. The ESIM will terminate the EPL if six-month average prices for both oil and gas fall to, or below, $74.21 per barrel and 57p per therm. The Chancellor also confirmed plans for a new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) to take effect when the EPL concludes. Like the EPL, the OGPM is intended to operate as a windfall tax on upstream oil and gas companies operating in the UK, but will impose an additional 35% tax rate on oil profits only where oil exceeds $90 per barrel, or on gas profits where gas exceeds 90p per therm, well above the ESIM price floor.

Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts point to a prolonged “gap” scenario through 2030, during which oil and gas prices are expected to remain above the ESIM floor, preventing early termination of the EPL, while remaining below the substantially higher price thresholds required to activate the OGPM successor tax. The result is a misalignment between the termination conditions for the existing levy, and the commencement conditions for its replacement. During this period, the EPL would continue to apply to producers at relatively moderate oil and gas prices, while the successor windfall tax remains inactive. This arguably extends windfall-style taxation beyond genuine windfall conditions, reinforcing industry concerns that the UK fiscal regime risks remaining internationally uncompetitive throughout this intervening period.

Regulatory risk has also tightened. Following the Supreme Court’s Finch ruling in June 2024, the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) issued guidance in June 2025 on environmental impact assessments for offshore projects. OPRED applies a rebuttable presumption that all hydrocarbons produced over a project’s lifetime will ultimately be combusted when assessing scope 3 emissions, while setting out the evidentiary route to rebuttal.

The EPL, together with the UK government’s policy on exploration, and recent regulatory and other legal challenges to new developments, have dampened exploration and development activity in the North Sea, a trend which we expect to continue through 2026. Conversely, these factors contributed to an increase in oil and gas M&A activity in 2025, as producers sought to replenish reserves and to generate returns from operational and financial synergies.

On emissions performance, operators’ abatement efforts contributed to a 34% drop in UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) oil and gas production emissions between 2018 and 2024, exceeding the North Sea Transition Deal’s 25% target for 2027. Yet, the NSTA’s September 2025 report warned that, without sustained focus on electrification and the elimination of routine flaring, emissions intensity could worsen, leaving UK production “less clean and less competitive compared with imports over time”. The NSTA has therefore signalled stronger impetus for electrification projects, including through primary legislation to amend its statutory objectives.

Finally, the integrated energy opportunity has expanded, with offshore wind, CCUS, and low-carbon hydrogen sharpening the case for repurposing infrastructure and supply chains. The Clean Energy Jobs Plan commits to expanding the Energy Skills Passport beyond offshore wind into sectors including nuclear and electricity networks. A new North Sea Jobs Service—launching in 2026—will also provide end-to-end transition support for oil and gas workers moving into clean energy, defence, and advanced manufacturing roles. Overall, 2025 brought consolidation rather than wholesale change, but 2026 may test the credibility of the “phased and responsible transition” framework.

Digital infrastructure will remain a priority area for UK policymakers in 2026, as government focus shifts from recognising the sector’s strategic importance to actively shaping how it develops. Demand for data, connectivity and compute capacity continues to grow rapidly; the policy and regulatory steps taken over the past year make clear that the question for the next phase is not whether the sector will grow, but how that growth can be enabled at pace within increasingly visible system constraints.

The most significant regulatory development in the sector is the emergence of AI Growth Zones. Building on earlier announcements, the government confirmed additional Zone sites in 2025 and published a policy framework focused on accelerating delivery of AI‑driven data centre infrastructure. The approach explicitly prioritises strategically important digital infrastructure rather than reliance on a purely market‑led model. For developers and investors, AI Growth Zones will influence site selection, programme sequencing and financing structures. The framework also raises regulatory questions about transparency, competition and how prioritised projects interact with wider network planning and regional development objectives.

Less visible, yet highly determinative, are the power availability, connection costs, and delivery timelines. These factors now drive site selection and investment viability, as data centres compete for constrained grid capacity alongside broader electrification demands (see the Electricity Networks section). Developers respond through more integrated power strategies such as private wire arrangements, on-site generation, battery storage, and demand-flexibility solutions, blurring the traditional boundary between digital and energy infrastructure. These constraints reshape financing structures directly by heightening pre-FID risk, extending development horizons, and potentially sharpening focus on balance-sheet strength, phased deployment, and power-linked risk allocation. Simultaneously, environmental considerations, particularly water use, heat reuse, and emissions reporting, are evolving from secondary ESG matters into licence-to-operate imperatives, whilst shortages in specialist construction capacity and long-lead electrical equipment threaten programme certainty.

Planning reform to accelerate digital infrastructure deployment will be another key government priority for the year ahead. In December 2025, the government launched a call for evidence on reforming planning rules to accelerate roll‑out, targeting areas where low‑impact digital infrastructure upgrades face avoidable delay and cost. This process signals a clear intention to reduce friction at local planning level, and to move more digital infrastructure into a permitted development regime. These reforms could materially shorten delivery times for network densification and upgrades, supporting nationwide connectivity objectives, and providing greater certainty for developers and operators.

The designation of data centres as part of the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure reinforces their role as foundational assets for the economy and public services, supporting continued investment in the sector. The Cyber Security and Resilience Bill, first read in Parliament on 12 November 2025, will extend baseline security standards and accelerated incident‑reporting requirements to data centre operators, increasing regulatory scrutiny of governance and operational resilience.

These developments point to continued expansion for digital infrastructure in 2026. Growth remains strongly supported, but increasingly shaped through planning reform, strategic prioritisation, and national security regulation. Success will depend on effective coordination between policymakers, regulators, and industry participants as digital infrastructure becomes ever more integral to the UK’s economic and security framework.

The coming year will be transformational for the UK water sector, heralding a range of major regulatory and institutional reforms that could reshape how water companies operate, invest, and engage with customers and the environment. The challenge for government will be to strike the right balance between regulatory rigor and consumer confidence and maintaining the sector’s attractiveness to private capital.

Fundamental regulatory changes are likely to be implemented following the Independent Water Commission’s Final Report in July 2025 (for further details see our article here). The Final Report recommended significant changes to the regulation of the water industry in England and Wales, including: (i) abolition of Ofwat and establishment of new integrated water regulators; (ii) significant re-orientation of the Price Review process towards a ‘supervisory’ approach; (iii) establishment of a new water Ombudsman in England; (iv) establishment of nine new regional water system planning authorities to oversee translation of national priorities into local plans; (v) development of new National Water Strategies and Ministerial Statements of Water Industry Priorities to provide clear, strategic direction to the sector; (vi) significant reforms to Operator Self-Monitoring to assure public health outcomes; (vii) greater alignment of public and private sector interests, including a new public benefit clause in water company licenses. The government rapidly confirmed its intention to abolish Ofwat and to introduce a single regulator for the water system in England. Full details on this and the response to other recommendations is expected imminently, followed by a public consultation on reform proposals and the transition pathway, with a new Water Reform Bill to follow. With the 2029 Price Review 2029 already coming into view, industry will be keen to achieve greater clarity on the recommendations that will be taken forward and the potential implications of these on water company businesses.

Public trust in the industry is set to remain a significant priority for industry and government. The Water (Special Measures) Act—now in effect— has strengthened regulators’ powers to ban bonuses for executives who fail to meet specific environmental and financial standards, and to bring criminal charges for persistent lawbreakers. Ofwat has also consulted on new rules to ensure senior executives meet standards of fitness and propriety to carry out their responsibilities and for involving consumers in water company decision making. Industry stakeholders will continue to monitor how these, and a raft of other new powers, are applied. In 2025, six water companies triggered the bonus ban rule under the Act for a variety of performance failures, mostly involving pollution incidents. Taken together with new minimum service standards and associated customer compensation levels, stricter enforcement and an emphasis on accountability are expected.

Final clarity on most PR24 spending plans is expected in March, when the CMA publishes its final re-determinations for the five companies that appealed Ofwat’s original determinations. The CMA has provisionally indicated that it may permit 21% - an additional £556 million in revenue – of the headline £2.7 billion the appellants collectively requested and a slightly higher average rate of return (4.29% up from 4.03%). However, it also cautioned that it would “largely reject” funding requests for new activities and projects “beyond the significant increases already allowed by Ofwat”. These headline results also belie an uneven distribution among the appellants.

Along with sector level reforms, the financial sustainability of individual water companies looks set to be tested further in 2026 with Thames Water’s long-awaiting recapitalisation plans still unresolved, its PR24 determination reference deferred indefinitely by Ofwat, and the government so far resisting temporary renationalisation under the special administration regime.",https://www.slaughterandmay.com/media/gjlnjqob/crst2510-dt003_hs26-og-share-images-energy-trans.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:57:00.121941

Despite this strong feedstock base, Mexico lacks pilot plants, industrial-scale projects and refineries adapted for SAF production, as well as intersectoral consortia.
Meanwhile, Chile has promoted green hydrogen as a key energy vector and set a target to begin SAF production by 2030, with projections extending to 2050.
Current SAF production relies primarily on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from used cooking oil.
Mexico, despite being Latin America’s second-largest aviation fuel consumer, is expected to supply only about 3% of SAF demand by 2050.","Latin America must develop a clearer understanding of its potential to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and implement public policies that enable industrial development, according to Daniel Chereau, Head Fuel, International Air Transport Association (IATA), in an interview with A21.

Chereau said global adoption of SAF will advance at different speeds depending on regional conditions and regulatory frameworks. “What is missing in Latin America is understanding the potential as producers and that governments establish public policies that deliver incentives” he said.

He noted that Brazil is among the most advanced markets in the region, largely due to ethanol policies that have been in place for more than 50 years. “From that perspective, it is natural to expect Brazil to have a more developed SAF industry,” Chereau said.

In Mexico, discussions are underway with sugar producers amid declining demand for sugar and growing interest in biofuels as an alternative outlet. Chereau recalled that Mexico’s airport and fuel services agency, Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA), previously developed a “flight plan” aimed at integrating stakeholders across the aviation value chain. Despite long-standing interest, he said the initiative lacked the incentive policies needed for implementation.

ASA, Mexico’s main jet fuel supplier, serves 52 airports and supplies more than 90% of the domestic market. The agency aims to promote clean energy use and support the aviation sector’s sustainable transition through the development and deployment of SAF. Infrastructure, Communications and Transportation Minister Jesús Esteva said at ASA’s 60th anniversary event that SAF implementation is “one of the biggest challenges” facing the aviation sector and that ASA must lead efforts to expand supply.

ASA Director Carlos Merino said the agency has launched a pilot project to blend imported SAF with conventional jet fuel, with a long-term goal of producing SAF domestically by 2030. In the near term, imports—likely from the United States—will remain necessary. Mexico also participates in ICAO’s CORSIA scheme, which includes a voluntary phase from 2024 to 2026 and mandatory targets from 2027 to 2035.

According to Guillermo Gómez, CEO, Consultoría Sustentable G2H, Mexico’s primary SAF advantage lies in its biomass resources, including agricultural, forestry and urban waste, used cooking oils and potential power-to-liquid pathways. Sugarcane and sorghum stand out due to their scale and integration potential. Sugarcane alone covers more than 800,000 hectares across at least 15 states and supports the production of sugar, bagasse, bioelectricity and ethanol.

Despite this strong feedstock base, Mexico lacks pilot plants, industrial-scale projects and refineries adapted for SAF production, as well as intersectoral consortia. Gómez said this gap represents an opportunity to build capacity through research, financing and innovation, but would require coordinated efforts among government, industry and rural producers.

In Colombia, palm oil producers have expressed interest in entering the SAF market, a process Chereau described as similar to Mexico’s engagement with the sugar industry. Meanwhile, Chile has promoted green hydrogen as a key energy vector and set a target to begin SAF production by 2030, with projections extending to 2050. “Latin America is a vast region with regulatory fragmentation and differing sustainability policies, but there are emerging signals in certain countries,” Chereau said.

He emphasized that technology will be critical to lowering costs. Current SAF production relies primarily on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) derived from used cooking oil. “Once we have the appropriate technology for each feedstock, costs will come down and prices will become more accessible,” he said.

Chereau added that incentive mechanisms should support technological development while leveraging the region’s role as a major producer of raw materials. “We are talking about incentives that favor technology development and take advantage of our position as feedstock producers,” he said.

According to the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), the region’s lack of SAF production and active projects could increase aviation costs by up to US$318 billion. Mexico, despite being Latin America’s second-largest aviation fuel consumer, is expected to supply only about 3% of SAF demand by 2050.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202026-01-15%20091026.png?h=353d28b9&itok=cPGhDXvM,N,,2026-01-15 10:57:31.018859

Combined, the companies already produce over 600 million tonnes of iron ore globally, and this partnership builds on a 2023 deal covering shared tenements.

The strategy reflects a push to squeeze efficiencies from existing assets, address declining ore quality, maintain capital discipline, and recycle funds from non-core infrastructure sales, such as BHP’s recent US$2 billion stake sale in a power network.

eBay unveils first climate plan, targets net-zero by 2045

eBay has released its first climate transition plan, aiming to achieve net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2045. The corporation has already achieved 100% renewable electricity for its facilities by 2024 and reduced operational emissions by 92% from 2019 levels, while transportation emissions are down 21%, with a 27.5% reduction objective by 2030.

Chief Sustainability Officer Renee Morin called shipping, which accounts for 84% of eBay’s Scope 3 footprint, the “toughest challenge,” stressing that “we have to be creative to achieve our goals,” including collaborating with carriers on local pickup and shifting from air to truck transport.

The plan includes boosting renewable energy deployment, scaling low-carbon shipping solutions, and promoting resale and reuse. This puts eBay in line with Amazon and Alibaba, who have already committed to long-term carbon neutrality.

Salesforce signs deals to purchase carbon removal from 19 early-stage suppliers

Salesforce, via Milkywire, has signed $5 million in carbon removal pre-purchase deals with 19 early-stage suppliers across biochar, BioCCS, next-gen DAC (Direct Air Capture), enhanced rock weathering, biomass storage, and mineralisation, backing “first-of-a-kind and research-intensive projects” not yet served by mainstream buyers. The agreements contribute to Salesforce’s First Movers Coalition pledge to contract $100 million of CO₂ removal solutions by 2030 to help scale CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal).

Jamila Yamani, Salesforce Director of Climate and Energy, said companies must “invest in solutions before they are fully proven at scale” and that the partnership helps move “durable carbon removal from concept toward commercial reality,” including the use of AI tools for monitoring and scalability. Projects include Kairos Carbon’s wet organic-waste BioCCS pathway, DAC firms Norma and Arbon, and Flux’s mineral feedstock that doubles as a fertilizer, improving soil health and harvests. Milkywire’s Robert Höglund framed the strategy as “enabling technologies and the ecosystem that we need tomorrow.”

(NASDAQ: GEVO), a company focused on renewable fuels, sustainable chemicals, and carbon management solutions, has secured a new U.S. patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The newly issued U.S. Patent No. 12,486,207 B2 strengthens Gevo’s intellectual property coverage by extending protection across a range of catalyst configurations and formally covering the application of Ethanol-to-Olefins (ETO) technology for fuel production.

The ETO platform is being advanced through multiple collaborations. Gevo is working with LG Chem, Ltd. to apply its next-generation ETO process to renewable chemical manufacturing, while fuel-related applications are being developed alongside Axens and IFP Energies nouvelles (IFPEN). The patented method converts ethanol into light olefins, which can then be upgraded into transportation fuels using established Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technologies. These olefins also serve as key inputs for producing competitively priced renewable chemicals, including bio-based propylene. As development progresses, the ETO approach is projected to reduce both capital and operating expenses by as much as 35% compared with existing alternatives.

According to Gevo President Dr. Paul Bloom, the patent represents a meaningful step forward in the company’s strategy to streamline the conversion of ethanol into fuels and chemicals. He noted that expanding Gevo’s proprietary technology base supports a more economical route to sustainable aviation fuel and reinforces the company’s long-term ambition to achieve cost leadership in ATJ solutions.

Looking ahead, Gevo plans to lead the initial rollout of its ETO technology in North America, a move expected to stimulate rural economic growth and job creation. On a global scale, Axens is anticipated to support wider adoption by offering licensing, equipment supply, and engineering services.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ethanol-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 09:57:54.065802

Copper demand continued to grow in 2025, driven by energy-transition requirements originating in the transportation sector, as well as emerging demand from data centers. The market enters into a deficit in 2026. Copper supply faces acute long-term pressure, as a boom in copper-intensive data centers coincides with mine disruptions and slow permitting.

A tight copper market in 2026 signals higher price risk and potential supply-chain constraints for electrification projects. The proliferation of EVs, the expansion of grids and the manufacturing of batteries could face cost inflation or delays.

Japan power – Average baseload power price for 2026 will fall to ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour

Japan’s power prices are set to trend downward over the next five years as flat demand meets supply growth. BNEF expects Japan’s power prices to average ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour in the coming year, a 5.1% drop from 2025. Japan’s declining average power prices may relieve industrial cost pressures but will challenge merchant generators.

However, structural shifts – such as aging fossil fuel generators being displaced by nuclear and renewable generation, along with hotter, prolonged summers – could still create sharp peaks and stress the power system.

EU carbon – Carbon price hits €87 per ton

Prices in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System will rise 16% in 2026 to €87 per ton. This is primarily due to a 21% drop in allowance supply – the result of a downward revision on free allocation benchmarks, the phase-in of the levy for the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and shipping allowance cancellations. A tighter allowance market will raise compliance costs for heavy industry and power producers, increasing the incentive for fuel switching, efficiency measures and early decarbonization.

LNG supply – 29 million metric tons of new capacity to come online in 2026

The global LNG market is headed for a glut in supply, with new production capacity slated to commission from the US, Qatar, Australia, Mexico and Africa in 2026. About 8 million tons of export capacity is expected online from the major Qatari North Field Expansion project, and the Golden Pass LNG project in Texas adds two out of three production trains in 2026 – at 5.2 million tons capacity each.

The level of supply entering the market will depend on the commissioning timelines and ramp-up schedules set by the operators. Much of this new capacity is not directly tied to long-term LNG contracts and could find its way into the spot market, putting downward pressure on prices –already reflected in the forward curves for the European gas benchmark price and the Asian spot LNG price marker in coming years.

Renewable fuels – 1.07 billion gallons per year of new renewable fuels production capacity announced for China

China’s 15th five-year plan, to be announced in March, is widely expected to introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending target. As the market evolves from pilot programs to mandated consumption levels, the volume of announced production capacity targeted to come online in 2026 has hit a high over 1 billion gallons per year, almost half of all global additions announced in the year ahead.

China’s move toward a national SAF mandate positions it to dominate global renewable-fuel manufacturing capacity. This could shift supply chains, lower SAF costs globally, and intensify competitive pressure on Western producers.

Petrochemicals – 15.6 million metric tons per year of new ethylene production nameplate capacity

China’s rapid capacity expansion has cut into its imports, redirecting them to Europe and squeezing the region’s older and smaller assets that were already struggling with high costs and thin margins. The strain has triggered a wave of closures, the latest being Exxon Mobil Corp.’s 800,000 metric tons per year ethylene plant in Fife, Scotland. A massive wave of new Chinese-led ethylene supply will deepen global oversupply, pressure margins and accelerate closures in Europe. Petrochemical producers outside China face heightened competitiveness challenges.

Weather – +0.5°C temperature anomaly in summer

The US National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CSFv2) forecast puts the Niño 3.4 temperature anomaly at +0.5°C for June–August 2026. That suggests that La Niña may linger into early next year before easing toward neutral or even El Niño territory.

If this shift happens earlier than forecast, expectations for a cold La Niña winter could fade. That would reduce US heating degree days and leave natural gas supplies more comfortable by the end of winter.

US power – Power demand from data centers to reach 48.3GW

The rapid expansion of the US data center fleet will lead to a 7.7GW jump in average power demand from the sector in 2026.

Analysis of key power market regions like PJM Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) indicates that grid tipping points are already emerging, as planned power supply fails to keep pace with accelerating data-center growth.

Data centers are now a system-wide driver of grid stress. Major markets may face capacity shortfalls unless generation and transmission expansions accelerate, increasing reliability and pricing risk.

US gas – $3.90/MMBtu marginal supply cost for Haynesville, Texas, dry gas

The US needs to unlock more gas supply to feed a growing number of LNG export terminals along the Gulf Coast and support data centers’ rising power demand. The Haynesville shale basin is expected to be a key driver of US natural gas supply growth in the medium term, given its proximity to LNG terminals and pipeline constraints limiting growth in other regions. BNEF’s latest breakeven cost estimates place the Texas-side of Haynesville as the marginal gas producing region. US Henry Hub gas price futures for 2026, as of Dec. 15, were trading at an average of $3.86/MMBtu – just below BNEF’s marginal gas production cost estimate. Maintaining supply growth to meet rising demand may require higher US gas prices or further improvements in well productivity, drilling and completion costs.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.
The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.
Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended.
“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said.","LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations.

State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.

In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.

That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”

Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815.

That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty.

According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”

“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”

Contracting with GSD

Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.

It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.

The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.

DED leaders did not know firm

State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Ak-sar-ben ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.

To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites.

Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell.

The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.

Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”

Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.

Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office.

“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said.

Contract facts

Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts.

Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself.

From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.

Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate.

Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.

Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.”

Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.”

“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.

The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.

Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds

Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans.

The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area.

Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital.

Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.

Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.

Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show.

Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.

The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive.

“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”

Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”

Questions about DG Fuels

Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.

The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.

Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email.

Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.

Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities.

Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.

DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”

“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.

Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.

“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”

Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.

But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024.

The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.

The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.

But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.

Contract obligations questioned

Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.

Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.

The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.

In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pillen_ZJW_122723-04.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 09:58:22.574136

The projects span several key sectors, including bauxite and aluminum processing, sustainable aviation fuel development, oil refining, and poultry farming, Danantara Chief Executive Officer Rosan Roeslani said on Wednesday.

Rosan said the investment pipeline is expected to make a significant contribution to Indonesia’s economic growth by strengthening downstream industries and increasing domestic value creation.

“The projects include bauxite and aluminum processing in Balikpapan, bioavtur, refinery projects, and poultry farming operations in five locations,” Rosan said. Bioavtur is the government’s term for aviation fuel blended with plant-based oils.

Beyond these sectors, Rosan signaled that gasification projects producing dimethyl ether (DME) from coal could also move forward, although further studies are still needed to determine the most suitable technology for implementation.

According to Rosan, the strategic projects are designed to enhance the value added of Indonesia’s natural resources, generate large-scale employment, and reinforce the country’s industrial base.

“Five downstream project sites are being prepared to enter the groundbreaking phase early next month, with a total investment of around $6 billion as the foundation for strengthening national industrial value creation,” he said.

Ángel Martínez Campos, who oversees sustainable aviation business development at Moeve, said the collaboration reflects the company’s long-term focus on reducing emissions from air travel.
These funds, she said, are used only to buy additional sustainable fuel beyond what regulations require, helping make initiatives like the Moeve partnership possible.

The airport is not yet covered by the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation rules, making the initiative an early step beyond regulatory requirements, reports Chemanalyst.

Under the agreement, Moeve supplied more than 515 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel to Condor. The fuel was produced from waste-based materials such as used cooking oil and agricultural residues. Over its full life cycle, the fuel is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 1,700 tons compared with conventional jet fuel.

The fuel was used on several busy routes connecting Tenerife with German cities including Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Düsseldorf. Airport operator Aena estimates that more than 450,000 passengers travel each year on Condor flights to and from Tenerife South Airport, highlighting the potential impact of using cleaner fuel on these services.

Ángel Martínez Campos, who oversees sustainable aviation business development at Moeve, said the collaboration reflects the company’s long-term focus on reducing emissions from air travel. He noted that tourism plays a key role in the economy of Spain and Tenerife, making lower-emission flights an important priority. He added that working with Condor on a voluntary basis shows a shared commitment to sustainability that goes beyond minimum requirements.

From Condor’s side, the airline pointed to strong passenger involvement in supporting the use of cleaner fuel. Sina Rathgeber, Director of Airport Relations, Government Affairs and Sustainability at Condor, said customers have been able to voluntarily add small amounts to their ticket price or make direct contributions to support sustainable aviation fuel and certified climate projects. These funds, she said, are used only to buy additional sustainable fuel beyond what regulations require, helping make initiatives like the Moeve partnership possible.

The fuel supplied under the agreement was produced at Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, southern Spain. Moeve is currently building a new second-generation biofuels facility at the site, with a planned annual capacity of up to 500,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. The project is more than halfway complete and is expected to begin operations by the end of 2026. Once operational, it will be the largest second-generation biofuels complex in southern Europe.

The supply agreement forms part of Moeve’s wider strategy to expand advanced biofuel production and availability. The company aims to play a leading role in Europe’s energy transition by 2030, while supporting the aviation sector’s efforts to reduce its environmental footprint.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2026-01-15 09:58:34.054361

While the core experience of flying remains familiar, the digital and operational layers surrounding your journey are being completely rebuilt. For the modern traveler, these changes may prove to be the difference between a high-stress trip and a seamless, cost-effective adventure across the globe.

This list includes seven ways air travel will change this year, evaluated by their impact on the passenger experience and the scale of their rollout across major carriers. The focus will be on trends with active 2026 implementation dates, ranging from behind-the-scenes financial shifts to radical changes in how you move through the airport. From the rise of AI to the fall of the traditional boarding pass, here is what to expect in aviation this year.

Hyper-Dynamic AI Offers

The Move To Digital, Real-Time Retailing

In 2026, the airline industry is officially shifting its focus from orders to offers. Using modern airline retailing frameworks, carriers like the Lufthansa Group and American Airlines are now leveraging generative AI to assemble custom travel bundles in real-time. This digital retail approach means the price you see is no longer just for a seat, but a tailored package that includes your specific WiFi, baggage, and meal preferences.

This shift is enabled by the widespread adoption of new distribution capability standards, which allow airlines to bypass old, static fare ladders. Instead of generating a price weeks in advance, AI-driven systems now adjust the offer based on search intent, macro-economic events, and even real-time load factors. For passengers, this means the end of universal baseline pricing in favor of highly personalized, dynamic quotes.

While it fundamentally changes the economics of your ticket, it remains a non-visible evolution. It alters how you pay and what you receive in your digital wallet, but it doesn't physically change the boarding process or the aircraft itself. However, as it becomes the industry standard this year, the old methods of trying to outsmart the booking system are effectively obsolete.

Universal Free High-Speed Inflight WiFi

Connectivity Becomes a Basic Amenity, Not a Luxury

The WiFi paywall has finally crumbled for the majority of global travelers. What was once a $20 luxury is now a standard amenity, with major carriers treating high-speed internet as a basic infrastructure requirement rather than a premium upsell. This shift allows passengers to stream, game, and video call with the same ease they experience at home or out and about on the ground.

The primary catalyst has been the rapid rollout of low-earth orbit satellite constellations like Starlink. United Airlines is currently outfitting its fleet at a rate of 40 planes per month, while American Airlines officially launched free, AT&T-sponsored WiFi for all AAdvantage members on January 6, 2026, covering over 90% of its domestic fleet.

The greatest benefit is that eliminates a significant stressor for modern travelers, staying connected to work and family. While it is a massive quality-of-life win, it is primarily an evolutionary change. It makes the time spent on a plane more productive, but it does not physically alter the core logistics of the airport journey like the items appearing higher on this list.

No More Physical Passport?

Biometric Face-ID Becomes the Global Standard

The era of fumbling for paper passports at border control is officially ending across Europe and major Asian hubs. The European Union’s Entry-Exit System is in full swing, replacing manual passport stamps with a centralized biometric database. Travelers now use their faces and fingerprints as their primary identity tokens, but queues have been even longer than usual, with some lasting up to three hours because the process requires various scans.

This ""frictionless"" shift allows passengers to move from the curb to the gate without having to show a physical document more than once. Airports in Singapore and the United States are following suit, integrating facial recognition into every touchpoint, including bag drop, security, and boarding gates, to shave an average of 15 minutes off the departure process.

Introducing this kind of technology is a massive logistical leap that fundamentally changes the physical chore of travel for many. It doesn't rank as high as other changes due to the delays as passengers register their biometrics for the first time, but the long-term result is a significantly faster airport experience that rewards digital-first travelers.

AI Travel Assistants

From Simple Chatbots to Digital Cabin Crew

Once again returning to an ever-present theme, AI tools have evolved from simple search engines into assistants capable of making decisions on your behalf. Recently, Qatar Airways unveiled Sama, the world’s first integrated digital cabin crew member. Unlike basic chatbots, these agents can help with a wide range of requirements in real-time.

This technology is powered by the new partnership between the Lufthansa Group and Amadeus, which uses an AI-native retailing platform known as Nevio. This allows the airline to manage your Order ID as a single, fluid record. If a flight is delayed, the AI proactively suggests a new itinerary and automatically updates your hotel and ground transport bookings.

The use of AI for customer facing services solves the biggest pain point in aviation: disruption management. By giving travelers an actual concierge in their pocket, airlines can finally provide personalized service at scale. As these digital assistants learn your habits when traveling, the stress of managing travel logistics is becoming a thing of the past.

The Point-to-Point Long-Haul Revolution

Narrow-Body Jets Are Ready To Take Over

The Airbus A321XLR has officially arrived, fundamentally breaking the hub-and-spoke model that has dominated aviation for decades. Starting in January 2026, IndiGo is launching the first nonstop service between India and Athens, while American Airlines is set to debut its JFK-to-Edinburgh route in March 2026. This allows airlines to fly thin, long and skinny routes that were previously unprofitable for giant widebody planes.

For travelers, this means more direct flights from secondary airports to international hubs, bypassing the need for a stressful connection at a major hub such as London Heathrow or New York JFK. The trade-off is the physical experience of the flight, as you are now flying eight to nine hours on a single-aisle aircraft. To compensate, 2026 aircraft are being delivered with flagship suites featuring lie-flat beds and direct aisle access, bringing widebody luxury to the narrowbody cabin.

The widespread adoption of far more versatile, smaller aircraft represents a permanent shift in how global geography is connected. It saves the average passenger three to five hours of travel time by eliminating layovers. As nearly 10% of Iberia's long-haul fleet now consists of these high-efficiency narrow-bodies, the once-laborious single-aisle flight has become the new industry standard this year as more airlines follow suit.

Mandatory Green Levies and SAF Surcharges

The Real Cost of Sustainability Hits the Receipt

This is the year environmental costs became a line item that can't be ignored. In April 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will implement its sustainable aviation fuel levy, which applies to all tickets sold for travel departing from October 2026. Simultaneously, the EU's ReFuelEU mandate has tightened, requiring 2% of all jet fuel to be sustainable, leading to a visible green surcharge on most transatlantic flights.

While the surcharges are currently modest, ranging from $1 for short-haul economy to $25 for long-haul premium cabins, they represent a major psychological shift. Airlines are no longer absorbing the 3x to 5x higher cost of SAF; they are passing it directly to consumers. This transparency is designed to fund the massive infrastructure needed to reach net-zero by 2050, making 2026 the true starting line for the green travel economy.

With SAF becoming far more relevant to airline economics, it demonstrates how, now, there is a global policy shift that affects the pricing of every single ticket. It is the first time in history that the environmental externality of flying has been standardized into a mandatory fee, marking the end of the era of artificially cheap, high-carbon air travel.

The 2026 World Cup Infrastructure Pivot

The Debut of Air Taxis and the Smart Border

To round out this list, the single biggest change in 2026 isn't a specific plane or a fee; it's actually not part of aviation at all. It is the unprecedented pressure of the 2026 FIFA World Cup across the US, Canada, and Mexico, specifically how this will bring changes and significantly affect global air travel. With millions of extra visitors expected this summer, security is evolving significantly for how people travel to the US. This has forced airports in host cities like Los Angeles and Miami to implement mass-scale biometric ""walk-through"" security and digital customs apps just to keep the gates from collapsing under the weight of the crowd.

Most importantly, 2026 marks the first public demonstration phase for electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. While full commercial service for the general public is slated for 2028, companies like Archer and Joby are using the World Cup as a global launchpad, showcasing in key host cities like Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. For the first time, travelers will see piloted air taxis ferrying VIPs and athletes over gridlocked city traffic, signaling the dawn of the urban air mobility era.

The World Cup is the stress test that has forced every other technology on this list to mature. From AI-driven crowd management to the first real-world flights of electric air taxis, the innovations deployed for this tournament will become the permanent blueprint for global air travel for the next decade.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/airtravel.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-15 10:57:56.518304

This study proposes an innovative supply chain producing SAF according to the REFuelEU Aviation’s progressive targets for 2050, the international ICAO-CORSIA mandates and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive for greening the transport sector. The study focuses on camelina (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) grown in Southern European regions on marginal land affected by severe soil degradation. In this case, according to the most recent policy requirements, “severely degraded lands” suitable for advanced biofuels production are currently defined as those under erosion with poor soil organic matter content or with high salinity. Unlike other common oilseeds, camelina can successfully grow in degraded and eroded soils making it particularly well-suited to produce low indirect land-use change (iLUC) risk feedstocks for SAF. The challenges of achieving profitable yields under marginal conditions are examined and discussed. The results show a potential of 116 thousand km2 of available lands that can produce 3.2 Mtoe per year of SAF, corresponding to 175 % of bio-SAF mandates in 2030. The calculated carbon intensity of SAF ranges between 10.5 and 30.8 gCO2eq MJ 1 depending on the carbon accumulation performances achieved in the cultivated soil and green energy used in the supply chain. By combining economics and greenhouse gas emission savings, the study explores the current gaps between conventional and innovative SAF production.

State, industry, Tribal and non-profit leaders from Washington are coming together to develop the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator (CSAA). The goal of the CSAA is to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Sustainable aviation fuel is developed from biological products like agricultural and forestry waste. Improving SAF technology, affordability and availability can reduce the carbon footprint of flying. This would not only improve air quality and climate outcomes, it also creates new jobs and economic opportunities.

The Puget Sound region has been at the forefront of the new sustainable fuel industry since the development of a research and development center for SAF at Paine Field that built on the area’s long history of innovation in aviation.Learn more about the SAF Center.

The CSAA is made possible by a 2025 State of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million. It will function as a nonprofit in partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce.

The global aviation industry currently generates $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, but accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions. SAF could reduce those emissions by 80% compared to fossil-based fuels.

The new center was announced at an event held at the Boeing Future of Flight facility in Mukilteo last week.

Overall, the previous decade marked a decisive shift in which renewable energy evolved into a cost-competitive, scalable and indispensable component of global energy supply.
“Any-and-All” Energy to Power the Next Decade: 2026-2035 Looking ahead, meeting the enormous power needs of the future will require maximizing energy options.
From Innovation to Speed and Scale Undoubtedly, the next decade will be defined by unprecedented energy growth—future global productivity, competitiveness and economic expansion will depend directly on scaling energy supply at speed.
Those who can deliver scale at low cost and high speed will shape not only the next decade of energy, but the next decade of global growth.","In a remarkably short time, electricity has shifted from a stable, assumed resource to the defining bottleneck for economic and productivity growth across the world’s governments and corporations. Energy is one of the most significant gating requirements for nearly every economic development opportunity, from manufacturing to artificial intelligence (AI).

And right now, supply is struggling to keep up with growing demand. Global electricity demand—driven by electrification, industrialization and the rapid expansion of AI—is accelerating faster than at any time in modern history (see Figure 1). At the end of 2020, forecasts predicted that it would take 10 years for global energy demand to increase by 25%. It took only four.2

Governments and corporations are driving this transformation, shaped by three powerful forces: deglobalization, as nations pursue energy independence; digitalization, as AI and data consumption accelerate demand for reliable power; and decarbonization, as industries electrify and invest for sustainable growth. Each is accelerating the same outcome: delivering cheap, fast and scalable energy—power, in every form, faster than ever before.

No single form of energy will be sufficient to meet this unprecedented level of demand. It will take “any-and-all” power solutions: Clean, conventional and hybrid systems alike have distinct and complementary roles to play. Renewable energy will be at the center of this mix, providing the scalable, low-cost foundation for the future grid.

Savvy investors will find tremendous opportunities for long-term value creation in developing diverse power solutions. Capitalizing on this moment requires a deep understanding of the past, present and future of energy technologies and markets.

A Decade of Falling Costs and Rising Opportunities: 2015–2025

The renewable energy market that powers today’s global economy was largely built over the past 10 years. While government support was an important driver in the first half of that decade, renewable energy quickly proved it could stand on its own over the second half, thanks to supportive market dynamics, dramatic improvements in technology and reductions in cost.

The rise of gas in the U.S.

After the global financial crisis, flattened energy demand led utilities to shift their capital and focus toward grid maintenance and upgrades. New generation favored gas plants, driven by the shale boom’s low prices, lower capital costs and faster build times, as well as facilities’ inherent operational flexibility. This shaped the energy sector’s trajectory.

A government push for sustainability and security

Governments around the world led the charge toward emissions reductions, passing stronger policies and regulations and joining together to sign the 2015 Paris Agreement, ushering in historic political and market signals for decarbonization. By COP26 in 2021, over 90% of global GDP was covered by some form of net-zero national commitment3 —with corporates following suit, unleashing capital into renewables at unprecedented scale.

Government policy also prioritized energy independence and security. Investments in domestic natural gas, which was replacing coal as a source of baseload power, offered countries relative stability to manage any geopolitical challenges. For countries that do not have a natural gas supply, renewables have proved to be a powerful method to ensure energy security and self-reliance.

The emergence of renewables

As energy demand started growing again, renewables soon became an attractive choice to corporates, thanks to their low cost and scalability. Renewable energy technologies went from development to deployment at a breakneck pace to meet new demand. Battery costs also began to fall. Regional power markets in the U.S. further spurred the growth of renewables, proving that renewables could be cost-competitive without relying on subsidies. By 2019, solar and wind, a small but growing component of the energy mix, had generally achieved cost parity with conventional sources of energy (see Figure 2).4

Corporates seeking the lowest-cost scalable resources started going directly to renewable suppliers to meet their power needs and decarbonization goals through power purchase agreements (PPAs) that increasingly offered stability over longer terms. Since 2015, the PPA market has grown by an average of 33% annually.5 These PPAs proved vital during periods of geopolitical instability and price volatility.

Byzantine bureaucracy and other limitations

This decade was not without its challenges, as clean energy buildout was constrained by limited transmission capacity and complex permitting; transmission buildout for all forms of energy slowed sharply starting in 2014 until 2023.6 Around the globe, projections for energy demand significantly underestimated the need for energy—well before the AI demand soared. Less than 20% of projects in the U.S. transmission queues between 2000 and 2018 were built by the end of 2023.7 The effects of slower growth will require sustained focus and managed solutions for decades to come.

Specific forms of energy faced specific challenges. Offshore wind, for example, contended with escalating capital expenditure costs and regulatory delays. Nuclear power saw early growth but soon faced stop orders and major losses.

Developers with strong supply chain relationships, deep operational and power market expertise, and a disciplined development approach could weather these challenges and capitalize on the growing demand. They were able to avoid the significant supply chain crunches usually associated with rapid scaling, steer clear of risks associated with very early-stage pipeline projects, and align construction costs with long-term contracted revenues from well-positioned counterparties.

Growing demands for energy capacity increased prices and have impacted the ability of utilities to keep the lights on. Clean power had surpassed 40% of global electricity generation by 2024, reflecting its emergence as both an affordable and stable option for power (see Figure 3).8 The expansion was driven primarily by solar and wind, supported by steady output from hydro and nuclear. Overall, the previous decade marked a decisive shift in which renewable energy evolved into a cost-competitive, scalable and indispensable component of global energy supply.

Current Market Dynamics

We are now in an era defined by soaring power demand, compounded by a shortfall in supply from the past decade’s limited growth. The largest demand driver is the explosive growth of data centers—reshaping energy consumption, while still needing to supply basic energy needs. Total data center capacity is expected to reach roughly 82 gigawatts by 2034—more than a tenfold increase in a decade (see Figure 4).

The growth in power demand has catalyzed a 12x surge in PPAs since 2016, tilting decisively toward clean energy suppliers.9 Corporations worldwide are seeking cheap, reliable, clean power that can scale quickly. For example, in 2024, Brookfield signed a landmark renewable energy framework agreement to develop more than 10.5 gigawatts of renewable capacity globally for Microsoft. And in June 2025, Brookfield announced the world's largest framework agreement for hydroelectricity with Google. These relationships provide unique insight into corporate power demand and evolving needs, enabling asset developers and operators such as Brookfield to build bespoke solutions and secure additional landmark agreements.

In parallel, energy independence remains a defining policy priority for many governments. The recent decade underscored the vulnerability of nations overly reliant on imported fossil fuels and exposed to the volatility of international natural gas prices. Governments are accelerating domestic investment in renewable generation, nuclear power and other low-carbon sources to strengthen energy security and stabilize long-term costs.

As governments pursue this new era of energy self-sufficiency, technological progress is reinforcing the shift— bringing greater reliability and consistency to power systems. Nuclear power is uniquely positioned to deliver that stability, supported by improved public sentiment, but also from better capital market access and supportive regulatory frameworks. There is no credible net-zero pathway without a substantial and expanding role for nuclear power.

As nuclear power shows great promise for providing the baseload capacity needed to meet demand, advancements in battery technology are unlocking the potential of solar and wind. Batteries are fast to install and scalable, and pairing them with renewables is increasingly effective at tackling intermittency and spot pricing challenges—moving us closer to delivering around-the-clock clean power. Large-scale lithium-ion batteries are more effective at storing excess energy and discharging it when needed. The price of these batteries has fallen by 92% since 2010, including a 50% drop in the past two years alone—one of the fastest price declines of any energy technology in history.10

Finally, with intermittent renewables expanding and coal in decline, natural gas will remain a vital component of the energy mix. It plays a dual role: meeting immediate surges in demand while acting as a flexible, dispatchable source to ensure stability during peak periods and balance grids as renewables scale. This dynamic is especially pronounced in emerging markets, where continued demand growth heightens the need for reliability.

More opportunities will arise as the U.S. and many other governments seek to onshore their energy production through protectionist policies like tariffs, as well as through incentives for domestic development. Doing so not only strengthens energy security and independence, but also expands domestic power supply—the foundational input to compute capacity, which is increasingly treated as a national strategic resource. As compute and AI infrastructure become primary drivers of productivity of future economies, governments are acutely focused on ensuring that sufficient power generation is available to support and scale these capabilities. Governments are increasingly prioritizing the reshoring of supply chains for critical technologies—from domestic mining of rare earth minerals to manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear reactors and batteries. This shift confirms that national energy strategies are also about independence and security, alongside resilience, affordability and decarbonization.

Still, renewable energy faces significant bottlenecks and permitting challenges. Transmission issues continue to hamper clean energy penetration, with many renewable energy projects held up in interconnection queues—long waiting lists that are created because the existing grid lacks the capacity to absorb new generation. Moreover, large parts of the electricity grids in advanced economies are over 20 years old—and require significant modernization and investment to keep up with demand or absorb energy from new sources.

In sum, both corporate-driven demand for scaled power and decarbonization, as well as government-driven demand for energy independence, are significant and persistent. As long as there is a supply and demand imbalance, buyers will be willing to pay a premium for dispatchable baseload power. These dynamics create opportunity for large clean energy developers and operators with access to capital, understanding of the market, and strong corporate partnerships to develop assets for value.

This past decade proved that policy can catalyze markets, but technology and capital ultimately sustain them. It is clear that the most successful operators are not those who chase subsidies, but those who are disciplined and build diversified portfolios, balancing exposure across geographies, technologies and counterparties to capture enduring value.

“Any-and-All” Energy to Power the Next Decade: 2026-2035

Looking ahead, meeting the enormous power needs of the future will require maximizing energy options. Future productivity gains from AI will be governed by the speed of the energy buildout. Global electricity demand is expected to grow by 4% each year through 2027,11 with 85% of that growth driven by emerging markets.12 Only with a diverse energy landscape—“any-and-all” forms of energy scaled with the focused investment of private capital—will it be possible to power the global economy into the years ahead.

While industrialization and electrification of sectors like transportation and heating will remain the largest use of power, data centers are expected to represent the single fastest incremental source of electricity growth, potentially reaching 9% of total U.S. electricity generation by 2030.13 Global electricity needs from data centers alone are expected to nearly triple by 2030, to a level that is slightly higher than the entire electricity demand of Japan today (see Figure 5).14 15

Hyperscalers are likely to prioritize contracted capacity with a flat generation profile, reflecting a focus on operational risk mitigation over marginal cost optimization. Specifically, hyperscalers need energy now, so they will increasingly seek out partners that can quickly deploy guaranteed reliable power at scale to prevent any disruption in business functions.

With technological advancements, some energy sources can offer benefits beyond simply meeting energy demand: Batteries and hydro, for example, can help stabilize the grid and increase project revenue. In turn, they improve the economics of those projects, compared with other power sources that have exposure to curtailment, weather-event and intermittency volatility.

In emerging markets, the surge in power demand is being driven first and foremost by rapid population growth and the expansion of the middle class—reinforced by strong macroeconomic trends such as rising GDP per capita. Urbanization and industrialization are further accelerating this demand, with data centers increasingly becoming part of that industrial landscape—Malaysia, in particular, is rapidly emerging as a key hub for data centers and semiconductors. Renewable energy has become a mainstay in these markets, especially after it became difficult to import natural gas due to war in Ukraine. Together, these forces are creating an urgent need for large-scale infrastructure investment, not only in energy generation but also in the transmission and distribution networks required to support sustained economic growth. To capture these opportunities, local operating teams with deep knowledge of regulatory environments and market dynamics are essential.

In the next decade, governments’ commitment to energy independence and security will continue to accelerate decarbonization trends. With greater domestic energy resources, nations are less vulnerable to volatile global energy markets and supply chain disruptions. An increasingly electrified global economy can mitigate threats of energy manipulation as nations gain the ability to generate more power from resources within their own borders. The need to strengthen energy security provides powerful motivation for expanding clean energy capacity while decreasing fossil fuel dependence. This requires investment in comprehensive energy systems and supply chain approaches that will be critical for ensuring future security.

As demand accelerates, the commitment to an “any-and-all” energy strategy will only grow. Private investors will play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between technological innovation and the large-scale deployment required to power the next decade.

Nuclear power

The role for nuclear power is growing as it becomes a critical technology for providing low-carbon baseload power and as developers continue to advance its commercial viability.

Nuclear continues to benefit from strong policy support and renewed prioritization, highlighted by the U.S. commitment to build 10 new reactors by 2030 with up to $80 billion in investment using Westinghouse technology, a company owned by Brookfield. This initiative will cement nuclear’s role as a key element of U.S. energy and AI growth, providing a reliable, carbon-free source of baseload power to meet rising demand.

This transformational commitment is set to catalyze a large-scale buildout of the domestic nuclear supply chain—from component manufacturing to workforce development and engineering capacity—while creating meaningful opportunities for Westinghouse, whose AP1000 remains the only new reactor design to be deployed in the U.S.

Batteries

Battery technology is advancing rapidly, and costs are falling, setting the stage for accelerated large-scale deployment worldwide. Batteries have become a cornerstone in power systems, with forecasts more than tripling in the past five years—representing a significant investment opportunity (see Figure 6).

Governments and corporations are increasingly prioritizing renewable sources that co-locate batteries next to solar and wind projects and share a grid connection. Efficient and cost-effective, these co-located systems create a major opportunity to turn intermittent wind and solar generation into a more reliable and consistent power source. They are also increasingly able to provide storage over longer time periods: The average duration for utility-scale storage today is around four hours and is expected to continue to lengthen in the years ahead as the need for longer-duration storage grows.

The applications for batteries are wide-ranging and global. In the Middle East, they can help meet surging peak demand, while in markets with rapid data center growth, they can firm up quick-to-market renewable projects and provide the reliability customers require. As penetration of renewables into power grids increases, demand for storage solutions will only intensify.

Natural gas and carbon capture and storage

As renewables scale and coal usage declines, natural gas will play a key role in keeping the grid balanced and easing the intermittency of renewables. This reliability is especially critical in emerging markets, where rapid growth requires stable power to support industrialization, urbanization and data center development.

When paired with CCS, natural gas becomes one of the few technically and commercially viable options for low-carbon baseload power production, reducing emissions intensity by more than 80% when compared to unabated plants.16 In this way, natural gas is a critical link in the global transition to a more diversified, lower-carbon energy system.

CCS can be deployed in new greenfield gas power projects and in brownfield retrofits of existing sites that have suitable technical characteristics. In addition, CCS technology is flexible enough to be utilized across the full range of commercially available gas power generation facilities, including reciprocating engines, simple cycle turbines and combined cycle turbines.

Energy for AI, and AI for energy

Finally, it is notable that AI is not simply driving up demand for energy but making important contributions to transforming and modernizing grid operations. For instance, some grid operators in the U.S. have been piloting AI-driven platforms to forecast solar and wind generation more accurately, allowing them to balance supply and demand more efficiently.

AI is increasingly embedded in battery dispatch and optimization platforms, enabling owners and grid operators to maximize real-time battery performance. These battery storage systems help power grids balance fluctuating demand and intermittent supply with sub-second response times. With grid operators increasingly requiring new load to be paired or to come with a firm dispatchable power solution at relevant locations, batteries are seen as the technology of choice to help new load obtain interconnections from grids. As grids worldwide are already strained, these new applications of AI can help ease the additional strain from future data centers.

From Innovation to Speed and Scale

Undoubtedly, the next decade will be defined by unprecedented energy growth—future global productivity, competitiveness and economic expansion will depend directly on scaling energy supply at speed. Vast amounts of incremental power will be required to support economic growth never before seen in our lifetimes.

Nations and corporations will take the lead in the trends of deglobalization, digitalization and decarbonization, demanding energy independence and fast, but sustainable, growth. The main drivers for this unparalleled demand will come from growth in data centers, industrialization and electrification. Offtakers will rationally seek the lowest-cost, most readily available electrons first, making renewables the first-choice alternative for new generation. But renewables alone cannot meet the challenge.

Renewables deliver cost-effective and low-carbon power; storage provides consistency; nuclear adds reliable baseload; and natural gas remains a critical backstop. All will be required to balance availability, cost, reliability and decarbonization. And all need to scale as quickly as possible.

The stakes for striking this balance are significant. The imbalance between rapidly growing demand and constrained supply could drive energy prices higher if new capacity fails to keep pace. Worse, it could limit global growth and productivity. Such an outcome would trigger a cascade across the economy, raising production costs and ultimately the cost of living. International macroeconomic conflicts can also add to the volatility in energy prices, mostly from fossil fuel sources. To avoid these risks, governments will continue to pursue energy independence and will remain central in catalyzing investment and accelerating the growth of all forms of power—and especially the most cost-effective sources, such as renewables and storage. While such technologies can stand alone economically, supportive regulatory frameworks and targeted policies will be helpful both to attract the scale of private capital required and to maintain affordability and stability in the broader economy.

With unprecedented energy demand comes compelling investment opportunities. But capitalizing on these opportunities requires more than capital. The best outcomes will come from applying a disciplined investment philosophy: maintaining a long-term horizon, exercising rigorous due diligence, recognizing complexity at every stage, hedging project costs against revenues, locking long-term contracts with strong counterparties, and protecting against other development risks. Equally, if not more critical, are the operational capabilities behind the capital. A global procurement team that can negotiate in different regions—and with scale—will be better positioned to protect against supply chain disruptions. Deep local expertise and strong operating teams are also essential to navigate regulatory frameworks, supply chain challenges and geopolitical uncertainty—and drive value, wherever the winds may shift.

Meeting this moment demands an “any-and-all” strategy with disciplined capital, operational excellence and long-term vision to galvanize today’s constrained supply to meet tomorrow’s massive demand. Those who can deliver scale at low cost and high speed will shape not only the next decade of energy, but the next decade of global growth.

Zurich Airport braces for WEF 2026 surge with 1,000 extra flights

Zurich Airport officials confirmed on 13 January that they expect roughly 1,000 additional flight movements in the week surrounding the World Economic Forum (WEF), which takes place in Davos from 19 to 23 January. The influx will be dominated by business jets, state aircraft, and helicopter shuttles supporting heads-of-state, Fortune 500 executives and security teams. Although the airport handled a similar volume during WEF 2025, operations managers say the compression of arrivals into an even tighter window—combined with stricter slot-allocation rules—will test apron capacity and air-traffic-control staffing.

To cope, Zurich will extend ground-handling shifts, reserve auxiliary stands at the military airfield in Dübendorf, and keep Observation Deck B open from 08:00 to 20:00 between 17 and 23 January so that public viewing does not interfere with secure zones. Jet Aviation will again supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel, allowing corporate flight departments to lower carbon footprints by up to 80 percent compared with conventional Jet A1—an increasingly important selling point for image-conscious multinationals.

As corporate travel planners juggle these operational details, they also have to secure the correct travel documentation for each delegate. VisaHQ can streamline the process of obtaining Swiss business or tourist visas with an online platform that handles application preparation, embassy appointments, and status tracking. Especially in the run-up to the WEF, the company’s Switzerland page (https://www.visahq.com/switzerland/) offers a quick way to confirm requirements and avoid last-minute complications at the border.

Temporary security measures may close popular spotting mounds and pedestrian paths at short notice, but passenger flows in the terminal should remain unaffected. Advance passenger-information sharing between airlines and border-police units has been tightened; carriers that miss data-transmission deadlines risk losing scarce slots. Customs officials also warn that ad-hoc charter arrivals after 23:30 will face hefty noise-abatement penalties unless flights are medically or diplomatically exempt.

For mobility managers, the practical takeaway is to lock in slots, parking space, and ground transport as soon as delegate lists firm up. Hotels within two hours of Davos are reporting occupancy above 90 percent, and last-minute crew rooms near the airport now exceed CHF 400 per night. Companies sending multiple executives are advised to consider helicopter shuttles from Zurich or St. Gallen-Altenrhein to avoid four-hour road journeys through likely snow.

Despite the operational squeeze, Flughafen Zürich AG stresses that the event remains a showcase for Switzerland’s capacity to host high-level dialogue with minimal disruption. The airport’s decision to keep all commercial passenger facilities fully open underscores its commitment to balancing security, sustainability, and everyday connectivity.

“It could really change production for generations if we take advantage of it.”

Scott Piggott tells Brownfield bipartisan, bicameral legislation to create a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Incentive Program passed out of committee at the end of December and is now before the full House.

“Outside of the corn growers wanting to move this legislation, Delta Airlines has been a huge proponent and partner, and they’re not alone,” he says. “Folks like FedEx, others who fly out of the state continuously are all needing to meet this standard.”

Piggott says creating more demand for corn is especially important as farmers face several back-to-back years of low margins.

“This is about an opportunity for our Michigan corn growers to fill a need, but also to help our rural communities get stronger,” he shares. “Those are the things that we’re going to continue to fight for.”

Duckworth met with a variety of renewable energy leaders today, including Illinois-based companies such as Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) of Chicago and John Deere of Moline.

In the Senate, Duckworth has been a leader in advancing biofuels. As a founding co-chair of the Senate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Caucus, she has been a strong advocate for expansion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by utilizing the domestic biofuels and agricultural sectors. To help increase the availability of E15 biofuels, Duckworth helped introduce the bipartisan Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025 and the bipartisan Next Generations Fuel Act to allow the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10 percent. Duckworth additionally helped introduce the bipartisan Home Front Energy Independence Act to ban Russian oil and expand use and production of biofuel that’s grown in the American heartland, while providing American families with a less expensive option to fuel their vehicles. Earlier this year she helped introduced the Farm to Fly Act to help accelerate the production and development of SAF.

While the Trump Administration continues to do everything in its power to decimate the international trade and domestic agricultural sector, Duckworth, as a member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, remains an outspoken advocate for increased trade of Illinois pork, biofuels and agricultural goods across the globe and helped secure significant wins for Illinois and American agriculture. After Duckworth’s visit in 2023, Japan announced a regulatory change that will lead to an increase in imports from U.S. biofuel producers, supporting our farmers and growing Illinois’s economy, and following a prior trip to Taiwan in 2022, she helped secure a commitment from Taiwan to purchase an estimated $2.6 billion of our Illinois’s corn and soybeans.

Is nuclear power back on the energy agenda?

Authors: Andrew McDougall, Ximena Vasquez-Maignan, Peter Berg, Julien Bocobza, Martin Menski, Michael Yates

Nuclear power's comeback is being driven by ambitious climate goals, the need for energy security and the rise of artificial intelligence, which has led to skyrocketing demand for data centers. The advantages of nuclear power include reliability and efficient land use, making it a practical complement to renewable energy sources. But before nuclear is fully embraced, challenges related to its past safety issues, financing and regulation must be addressed.

Can sustainable aviation fuel get off the ground?

Authors: Kamran Ahmad, Peter Berg, Ryan Gawrych

As governments chase net zero targets, some are implementing regulations meant to boost the aviation industry's use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is made from renewable and waste-derived sources, like cooking oil. But SAF has yet to become commercially viable for airlines. It costs far more than conventional jet fuel, presents challenges for investors and is plagued by supply chain and output issues. Still, momentum behind SAF is building as more countries deploy mandates aimed at reducing aviation industry emissions.

Will sustainable data centres power the future?

Authors: James Johnson, Tim Fourteau, Stephen Shergold, Victoria Delacey, Lis Blunsdon

Amid dramatic global growth in the number and size of power-hungry data centers, concerns about their environmental impact have become a priority. Governments, policymakers and data center operators themselves are focused on making this critical infrastructure sustainable and ensuring that data centers do not detract from efforts to reach net zero. In addition to offering environmental benefits, sustainable data centers may be a boon to investors, who could benefit from the centers' short construction cycle and ability to quickly generate cash.

Sustainable aviation fuel is rising up the industry's agenda. But can governments and industry overcome the commercial drawbacks?

""A complete momentum shift"" is how Ryan Gawrych, Local Partner at law firm White & Case, describes what is happening in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market. Between 2022 and 2030, global production of SAF is expected to grow by 30 times to 18.2 billion litres1 because of demand for the aviation industry to reduce its emissions.

The forces behind the rise of SAF

As governments pursue net zero targets, some are regulating aviation in ways that favour SAF. In Europe, for instance, ReFuelEU2 promotes greater use of SAF at EU airports as part of efforts to reduce CO2 emissions by 55 per cent by 2030. Similar rules have come into force in South Korea, where the government mandates that international flights departing from the country in 2027 will have to use fuel with a 1 per cent SAF blend, rising to 3–5 per cent in 2030 and 7–10 per cent in 2035.3

Meanwhile some governments are taxing jet fuel, which has historically been exempted from many taxes. In the UK, campaigners estimate that taxing jet fuel could raise £6bn.4 Phasing out these tax exemptions is also improving the case for SAF, according to Gawrych. ""A heavy price is being placed on the carbon output of jet fuel in Europe,"" he says. ""This is driving a lot of the airlines, fuel traders and producers to look at developing and creating more SAF for the market.""

Closing the gap to commercial viability

There is an appetite to shift towards SAF, but it has to be commercially viable. That is not yet the case, for a number of reasons.

""There is an obvious cost gap issue,"" says Gawrych. ""Conventional jet fuel is currently about €700 a tonne; HEFA, which is the most available SAF product in the market right now, is about €2,500.""

This creates significant extra costs for airlines. The European Regions Airline Association warns that ReFuelEU risks penalising regional airlines and cutting off remote communities. Some airlines, it says, could be bankrupted by the regulation.5

Getting investors on board to fund the switch to SAF is also difficult. ""Airlines don't have the best credit rating, and they also have a very unique procurement cycle for their jet fuel,"" says Gawrych. ""They don't sign up for 10–15-year contracts for the procurement of their fuel, which would ordinarily be necessary to underpin financing for the development of a SAF facility. So over the past couple of years a lot of the SAF producers have been trying to structure projects around airline offtake, and those projects have not really been able to get to FID.""

Another barrier to SAF's mainstream adoption is producing it at consistent and reliable levels. Waste cooking oils and feedstock are used as the raw materials for HEFA-SAF, but because these inputs are inconsistent and finite, supply chains cannot yet guarantee steady or scalable output. ""There is only so much you can produce,"" says Gawrych.

The road ahead for SAF

Despite these challenges, momentum behind SAF is growing. And it will only increase as more countries create SAF mandates and regulations.

""The reality is that more and more countries are starting to deploy SAF mandates,"" concludes Gawrych. ""And if China introduces blending mandates in the next year or so, then it will be transformational.""

If policy, investment and innovation start to align, SAF could become a viable option for airlines. However, governments will need to pay close attention to the unintended consequences of the rise of SAF, such as the impact on smaller airlines and communities.

Meanwhile, Hawaii positions itself as an energy laboratory for sustainable aviation.","Hawaii has begun charting a new energy course by bringing together airlines, fuel producers, and local farmers in a pioneering sustainable aviation fuel project. Thus, the archipelago seeks to concretely reduce air transport emissions, one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize, with companies already set to use locally produced biofuel.

In this context, Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines have partnered with Par Hawaii to develop locally produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In this way, the energy transition ceases to be an abstract concept and becomes a productive chain anchored in the territory.

Furthermore, the initiative aims to strengthen the energy resilience of the islands. By reducing dependence on imported fuels, the project combines climate action with economic and environmental security.

Agriculture and energy: a locally rooted alliance

To advance this transformation, the airlines and Par Hawaii are working with Pono Pacific, through its subsidiary Pono Energy. Consequently, the focus is on camelina, a fast-growing oilseed crop with a low environmental impact.

This crop can be rotated with food crops, matures in a few weeks, and requires fewer inputs. Therefore, it presents itself as a viable alternative to produce energy without displacing food production.

At the same time, camelina allows for the utilization of every stage of the process. While the oil is destined for SAF, the by-products are transformed into feed for cattle and poultry, closing a more efficient production cycle.

Local production and 2026 horizon

The project already has a defined schedule. The airlines will be the first to use SAF manufactured in Hawaii, with deliveries expected in the first quarter of 2026. Thus, the sustainable fuel will move from the laboratory to the runways.

In parallel, Par Hawaii is advancing in adapting its industrial infrastructure. The modernization of the refinery will allow for the processing of vegetable and used oils, expanding the renewable production capacity.

This process is supported by strategic investments and international alliances. However, the central focus remains local: land, agricultural knowledge, and employment on the islands.

The biofuel and its multiple advantages for the industry and the environment

The use of SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle. Therefore, its adoption represents one of the most effective tools to decarbonize aviation without modifying aircraft or airport infrastructures.

From an industrial perspective, the measure drives innovation, generates employment, and creates a new energy sector. Additionally, it diversifies the Hawaiian economy and offers additional income to rural producers.

In environmental terms, the impact goes beyond CO₂. Less fossil fuel means less air pollution and less pressure on ecosystems affected by oil extraction and transportation.

Challenges and long-term cooperation

Even so, the path is not without obstacles. SAF remains more expensive than conventional fuel and its global supply is limited. Therefore, collaboration between companies, investors, and governments is essential.

Public policies, incentives, and long-term planning will be crucial to scaling this solution. Meanwhile, Hawaii positions itself as an energy laboratory for sustainable aviation.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2026/01/emisiones-aereas.jpg.webp,N,,2026-01-14 15:57:28.274151

Announced at the Boeing Future of Flight, the initiative is the most comprehensive and well-funded across the region of its kind to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Funded through a 2025 state of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million, the CSAA positions the Pacific Northwest as a global leader in an accelerated transition to SAF while capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation economic opportunity of scaling local SAF production.

In partnership with the state’s commerce department, CSAA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is formulated from sustainable feedstocks, like crop seed oil, agricultural and forestry waste.

Advancements in SAF technology and greater availability of affordable SAF will reduce the carbon footprint of air transportation, improve air quality and contribute to a more sustainable future while creating new industries, jobs and economic opportunities.

“Sustainable aviation fuel puts the Cascadia region at the forefront of the next major chapter of the clean-energy transition that will shape how the world is powered,” said Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson. “This is the opportunity to do for clean fuels what this region did for the technology economy, creating lasting economic growth and leading the global effort to cut aviation emissions.”

The Cascadia region has been a trailblazer in aerospace innovation for over a century, and today it is uniquely positioned as a global center of aviation innovation, with an opportunity to unlock the next generation of sustainable fuel.

With access to local, low-carbon feedstocks, affordable clean energy, established infrastructure and a skilled workforce, the region has all the elements necessary to support production of up to 1 billion gallons of SAF by 2035.

Scaling production at this level would drive economic prosperity and development, strengthen regional energy security and independence, support state and regional climate initiatives and build on Cascadia’s long legacy as an aviation innovator.

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2 percent to 3 percent of global carbon-dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts.

SAF is a safe, effective drop-in solution projected to be used for the next 70-plus years that can reduce emissions by 80 percent compared to fossil-based fuels and the transition to a thriving circular economy through locally produced SAF.

“This initiative will be successful because it is grounded here, in the communities where aviation, manufacturing and clean energy intersect,” said Dave Somers, Snohomish County executive and chair of the CSAA board of directors. “CSAA builds on the infrastructure, workforce and partnerships we have already put in place, and this is just the beginning. Coalition partners like Washington State University are eager to partner in the establishment of a world class research and development facility adjacent to Paine Field. Combined with our region’s aviation industry cluster, these developments ensure we will be a leader in global aviation sustainability and investment well into the future.”

The region’s strength is built on advanced science, technology and aviation expertise, supported by leaders like Washington State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Boeing.

This research foundation provides the technical backbone needed to move SAF from small-scale production to commercial scale.

“For the last six decades in Snohomish County, Boeing has relied on strong community partnerships to turn ambitious ideas into reality,” said Bill McSherry, Boeing’s vice president of government operations. “Cascadia is a concrete example of that collaboration toward meaningful progress on a sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem right here at home.”

Local aviation and technology leaders recognize that scaling SAF research and production will require coordinated action across the entire aviation ecosystem.

Manufacturers like Boeing bring the technical expertise to integrate SAF into aircraft and operations, while operators including Alaska Airlines and Amazon provide the operational expertise and market demand for cost-competitive SAF.

Lawmakers, like Washington State Sen. Marko Liias, have championed these partnerships at the state level by advancing legislation that supports SAF development and unlocks long-term investment.

“Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are committed to this journey to reduce carbon emissions for a more sustainable future for aviation, and while we are proud to be the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carrier, SAF remains the biggest lever for us to meaningfully lower our emissions and reach our decarbonization goal,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. “We’re thrilled to be a founding partner of CSAA because regional, cross-sector efforts like this are critical to align policy, public and private investment, to identify and invest in the right technologies and to incent and scale local production.”

Combined with existing infrastructure, affordable clean energy and access to feedstocks, research institutions are advancing the science that makes SAF viable, and policymakers are ensuring sustainability and airport community impacts remain central as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels.

“Washington has led the world in aerospace innovation for generations, and now we face a defining moment for the next generation of aviation,” said State Sen. Liias. “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it. This is the moment to act, and CSAA gives us the vehicle to lead.”

Scaling sustainable aviation fuel Delta’s biggest energy milestone came from its investment in SAF, an area where global supply remains tight.","For an airline celebrating 100 years since its founding in Macon, Georgia, Delta’s 2025 was anything but nostalgic. From operational energy gains to novel aircraft technologies, its progress over the past 12 months speaks to how aviation’s big players are now acting as energy companies in their own right.

In the first quarter alone, Delta surpassed its short-term fuel efficiency goal, saving more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel through operational improvements.

These savings equated to over US$125m and made a meaningful dent in its carbon footprint.

Energy performance and smarter operations

At the heart of these gains lies Delta’s cross-enterprise Carbon Council, a team tasked with driving energy efficiency through precision measures. These included weight reduction across the fleet, enhanced APU tracking, optimised flight routing, new landing procedures and aerodynamic refinements such as 'winglets’.

Individually modest, these projects collectively delivered significant energy savings across Delta’s network. The company also launched its ‘Green Station of the Year’ initiative, designed to embed energy-conscious practices among ground and flight crews.

Through friendly competition, staff have been encouraged to rethink their own energy habits, which is proof that behaviour change remains a cornerstone of any meaningful energy transition.

Delta's new wave aircraft partnerships

Technology partnerships were another energy milestone for Delta this year. In March, it joined forces with aerospace start-up JetZero to support the development of a blended wing-body (BWB) design.

The futuristic aircraft is predicted to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than current models, with Delta offering operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to help bring the project to market.

Later in the year, Delta entered a separate collaboration with Maeve Aerospace aimed at accelerating hybrid-electric aircraft for regional routes. Maeve’s aircraft could cut fuel emissions by up to 40% when using conventional jet fuel, and potentially even more when operating on SAF.

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences, and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

The airline also added Australian start-up MicroTau to its Sustainable Skies Lab, which has created shark-skin-like coatings for aircraft to reduce drag. This has the potential to improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Alongside this, new component upgrades such as finlets and split-scimitar winglets have been introduced to reshape airflow and reduce drag across older fleets.

While these energy savings are not particularly large when taken individually, combined they can really turn the dial. This is the story of the energy transition in the notoriously hard-to-abate aviation sector: small, marginal gains in pursuit of net zero.

Scaling sustainable aviation fuel

Delta’s biggest energy milestone came from its investment in SAF, an area where global supply remains tight. In 2025, the airline partnered with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland to facilitate the first commercial-scale SAF delivery to Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% and may even achieve net negative impacts when produced from advanced feedstocks. Delta’s commitment to scale its SAF use by 50% year-on-year demonstrates the growing role of low-carbon fuels in reshaping aviation’s energy mix.

Fast Company recognised Delta among the world’s Most Innovative Companies for its SAF leadership, underscoring how energy transformation and business innovation increasingly go hand in hand.

What do energy-efficient aircraft look like?

Delta aims to introduce more than 35 next-generation aircraft by early 2026, each delivering an average energy efficiency improvement of over 25% per seat mile compared with the aircraft retired since 2019.

Given that around 90% of the airline’s carbon output stems from jet fuel, these gains mark a critical lever in cutting aviation’s energy intensity while newer propulsion technologies continue to mature.

Rethinking energy on the ground

Sustainability on the ground received attention too. In 2025, Delta transitioned entirely from plastic to paper cups across all flights, a move supported by new energy-aware logistics systems.

Grant Trahant

Hey friends,

As we move into the new year, a clear pattern is emerging across the impact landscape. The lines between philanthropy, private equity, policy, and innovation continue to blur, and long-term capital is increasingly backing systems that scale dignity, resilience, and access.

This week’s edition reflects that shift.

We explore how global nonprofits are structuring impact at scale, how companies are embedding values into their business models, and how capital is flowing into climate, healthcare, food systems, and workforce infrastructure.

From community-driven healthcare finance to patient dignity in medical settings, from mobility and infrastructure investment to AI-powered drug discovery, these stories show impact becoming more coordinated, more institutional, and more durable.

Let’s dive in.

Meet GIV Gowns: Why Patient Dignity Starts with What You Wear

In this spotlight interview, we speak with Shawn Gibbs, founder of GIV Gowns, a healthcare apparel company rethinking what patients wear during treatment.

After 15 years in clinical practice, he repeatedly heard the same story from patients. People delayed or avoided care because they felt exposed, embarrassed, or powerless the moment they were handed a standard medical gown.

Over time, that pattern became impossible to ignore. What started as individual patient conversations turned into a clear systemic failure.

,,2026-01-14 17:04:05+00:00,BioEnergy Times,"UK SAF use near 2% mandate level, final compliance to be confirmed in 2026",BioEnergyTimes,,,,,https://bioenergytimes.com/uk-saf-use-near-2-mandate-level-final-compliance-to-be-confirmed-in-2026/,"During the period, 163 million litres of SAF were supplied out of a total 10 billion litres of aviation fuel, reports GreenAir.
According to the data, all SAF supplied during the period was produced from used cooking oil.
The data also shows how much of the SAF supplied has already been certified.
Under the SAF Mandate, fuel volumes must be fully validated before they can be counted toward suppliers’ compliance obligations.
The UK SAF Mandate increases each year to reach a 10% requirement by 2030.","Data released by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) shows that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) accounted for 1.63% of total jet fuel supplied between January and late October 2025, raising questions over whether the UK will meet the first-year target under its SAF Mandate. During the period, 163 million litres of SAF were supplied out of a total 10 billion litres of aviation fuel, reports GreenAir.

Some industry observers say the figures suggest the UK may fall short of the 2% requirement for 2025. However, the DfT has said the data is provisional, as not all fuel suppliers have submitted final returns. The department has indicated that confirmed figures will not be published until November 2026. Industry group Sustainable Aviation has said it remains confident that the mandate target for 2025 will be achieved.

According to the data, all SAF supplied during the period was produced from used cooking oil. China accounted for 72% of the feedstock, with the remaining volumes sourced from Japan and Taiwan. At the same time, legislation aimed at supporting SAF producers through a revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) is progressing through Parliament, and the DfT has opened a new consultation on how contracts under the scheme would be awarded.

The DfT statistics cover all aviation fuel reported as supplied up to October 27, including volumes that have not yet been verified. This includes SAF that has not been formally certified as sustainable or issued with certificates. The data also shows how much of the SAF supplied has already been certified.

Under the SAF Mandate, fuel volumes must be fully validated before they can be counted toward suppliers’ compliance obligations. This requirement creates a delay between the physical delivery of SAF and its formal recognition for mandate purposes.

Commenting on the figures, Sustainable Aviation Chief Executive Duncan McCourt said the data shows that SAF use in the UK is already significant and that the industry expects the mandate to be met, with SAF use increasing steadily in the coming years.

Even if the 2% target is narrowly missed, the UK’s SAF use in 2025 is expected to exceed global progress. The International Air Transport Association has estimated that SAF will account for only 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8% in 2026.

The UK SAF Mandate increases each year to reach a 10% requirement by 2030. From 2027, limits will be introduced on fuels made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, including those derived from used cooking oil. By comparison, the EU’s SAF mandate also sets a 2% requirement for 2025 but has a lower target of 6% by 2030, which includes a 0.7% requirement for synthetic fuels.

The UK government is advancing legislation to introduce the RCM, which it expects to have in place by the end of 2026. The mechanism is designed to support investment in new SAF projects by providing predictable revenues and is to be funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The DfT has held several public consultations on the scheme and has now launched another covering two key areas: proposed contract terms for RCM agreements and the process for allocating contracts to projects. The consultation is open until April 3.

Explaining the mechanism, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the contracts would set a fixed reference price for SAF. If market prices fall below that level, producers would receive payments to cover the difference, while higher prices would require producers to pay the excess back. She said the approach is intended to remove a major barrier to investment and demonstrate that the UK is a serious location for SAF development.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-4.png,N,,2026-01-14 12:57:43.613679

Decarbonization of the aviation and maritime sectors will require large amounts of low-carbon fuels to reach global net-zero targets. For SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), 2025 was undoubtedly a pivotal year. In both the UK and EU, regulation such as ReFuelEU Aviation meant binding blending targets for SAF came into effect, creating unprecedented large-scale mandatory demand for SAF. This demand will continue to grow as decarbonization regulation ramps up. Based on current projections, IDTechEx forecasts in the “Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts” report that the global SAF market may reach US$50 billion in 2036.

There are several different ways to produce SAF, with the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway being a major contributor to early SAF growth. HEFA feedstocks can include used cooking oils and animal fats. This is the lowest cost production pathway for SAF, with a selling price not too far from conventional jet fuel.

However, these HEFA feedstocks are limited, and beyond 2030 the global SAF market will be faced with the “HEFA tipping point”. This is when demand for SAF will keep growing due to increased global decarbonization regulation, but HEFA SAF supply will become insufficient. This will trigger a pivot to emerging SAF pathways such as alcohol-to-jet, gasification+Fischer Tropsch, and e-SAF. These technologies are less mature, but scaling up has already begun. For example, LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels alcohol-to-jet facility came online in 2025, producing 9 million gallons of SAF and 1 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. However, for many emerging SAF pathways, high costs remain a significant barrier that technology development and regulation need to address.

Aviation is not the only promising market for sustainable fuels. Renewable diesel production is also expected to grow. The US will remain a leader in renewable diesel, with stackable policy support available, including the Renewable Fuel Standard, the 45Z tax credit, and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Globally, the sustainable fuel market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade with IDTechEx forecasting the global renewable diesel and SAF production capacity will exceed 67 million tonnes annually by 2036, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% between 2026 and 2036. This impressive growth trajectory underscores the increasing importance of sustainable fuels in the global energy mix.

Renewable methanol production is also rapidly increasing, with several ~100,000 tonnes per annum facilities already under construction. China will soon emerge as the leading region given its dominant position in existing methanol markets, its low CAPEX construction, and its plentiful biomass and green hydrogen resources for emerging biomass gasification and e-methanol technologies. Demand for low-carbon methanol is being driven by the need for clean marine fuels, decarbonization of the chemical sector, and as a feedstock for the SAF (via the methanol-to-jet pathway).

The major drivers for sustainable fuel market growth are policy developments, such as SAF fuel mandates in the EU and UK or the US' 45Z tax credit, as well as a push from vehicle fleet operators and airlines to reduce carbon emissions. However, the sector also faces significant challenges associated with overall energy efficiency (especially when comparing e-fuels to EVs for road transport), feedstock availability, project development issues (long development timelines and significant funding needed) and achieving cost parity with conventional fossil fuels. Together, these drivers and challenges are shaping this rapidly developing market.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEnS_PS8q1IzA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B4EZu8ykmXHkAI-/0/1768398934184?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=G9JnI9MBMnv5Xwc7QtkSSA8E14sw_zM5EGjkvlzVwcQ,N,,2026-01-14 14:57:25.168004

The budget push comes at a time when the sugar industry is navigating what Ballani described as a challenging phase despite strong production.
“The sugar industry is going through very challenging times,” he said, noting that the current crushing and harvesting season is progressing well.
ISMA has also sought a revision in ethanol prices.
“These policy measures are essential to stabilise the sugar industry, protect farmer incomes and support India’s clean energy transition,” Ballani said.","New Delhi [India], January 14 (ANI): The Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) has sought a budgetary outlay of Rs 15,000-20,000 crore to support advanced biofuel projects, including second-generation ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as the sugar industry grapples with surplus production, weak prices and constraints in ethanol diversion, said Deepak Ballani, Director General, ISMA.

“We have requested around Rs 10,000 crore for second-generation ethanol and about Rs 1,500 crore for SAF capacity, and overall an outlay of Rs 15,000-20,000 crore to support pilot projects and new technologies for the advanced biofuels,” he told ANI in an exclusive interview.

ISMA has sought budgetary support funds for second-generation ethanol, green hydrogen and SAF to enable pilot projects, new technologies, equipment innovation, along with GST rationalisation this budget, he said.

“We want the government to rationalize GST on Flexi and strong hybrids. We want them to give some support fund, because sugar industry, sugar cane is a major feed stock for our advance for biofuel,” he said.

The budget push comes at a time when the sugar industry is navigating what Ballani described as a challenging phase despite strong production. “The sugar industry is going through very challenging times,” he said, noting that the current crushing and harvesting season is progressing well.

“As per ISMA estimates, we are heading for a very high production of sugar, almost 34.3 million tonnes, which is much better than last year,” Ballani said. However, he added that higher production has intensified pressure on ex-mill prices, affecting mill viability.

Ethanol diversion, a key stabilising mechanism for the sector, has fallen short this year. “Ethanol diversion is very critical because it balances sugar stocks and helps ensure timely payment to farmers,” Ballani said. “But this year, in cycle one tender, diversion has been limited to only 34 lakh tonnes, which is far below what was anticipated.”

In volume terms, ethanol allocation this year stands at around 290 crore litres, compared with industry expectations of nearly 450 crore litres, Ballani said. “This creates an imbalance in sugar stocks and puts downward pressure on ex-mill prices,” he said.

ISMA has also raised concerns over pricing. Ballani said ex-mill prices have started falling below the cost of production. “Prices at the level of cost of production are extremely important to maintain the economic viability of the industry,” he said.

He pointed out that the fair and remunerative price (FRP) of sugarcane has increased from Rs 275 per quintal in 2018-19 to Rs 355 per quintal currently, nearly a 30% increase, while the minimum support price (MSP) of sugar has not been revised since 2018-19. “Based on today’s cost of production, MSP needs to be increased to around Rs 40-41 per kg,” Ballani said.

ISMA has also sought a revision in ethanol prices. “Around 70-75% of ethanol cost is raw material cost,” Ballani said. “FRP has gone up by 16-17% over the last three years, but ethanol prices have not been revised, which is affecting distillery viability.”

India has already achieved 20% ethanol blending (E20) five years ahead of the original 2030 target, Ballani said. However, surplus capacity remains a concern. “Total ethanol capacity today, across sugar and grain, is close to 2,000 crore litres, while E20 requires only about 1,100 crore litres,” he said.

ISMA has called for a roadmap beyond E20, including higher blending levels, flex-fuel vehicles, ethanol-diesel blending and SAF. “We have submitted a roadmap prepared with Deloitte, and we are waiting for the government to come out with a comprehensive plan, especially for SAF,” Ballani said, citing international mandates under CORSIA.

On exports, the government has permitted sugar exports of 15 lakh tonnes this season. Ballani said export contracts for 2-2.5 lakh tonnes have been signed so far, though shipments remain slow due to weak global price parity.

Domestic demand has also softened. “Last year consumption was around 281 lakh tonnes, and this year we expect around 285 lakh tonnes, which is a concern,” Ballani said, adding that ISMA studies show demand growth of only 1-1.5% annually going forward.

To boost ethanol usage, ISMA has sought GST cuts for flex-fuel and strong hybrid vehicles. “GST on flex-fuel vehicles should be reduced from 18% to 5%, similar to EVs,” Ballani said, adding that GST on E100 and E85, currently 18%, should also be cut to 5%.

“These policy measures are essential to stabilise the sugar industry, protect farmer incomes and support India’s clean energy transition,” Ballani said.

These approvals confirm that the project meets state and local environmental standards, including requirements related to land use, water protection, and fuel transportation. Project Wigeon will be among North America’s first commercial-scale SAF projects producing jet fuel from renewable natural gas (RNG).

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to reduce harmful emissions, which is why SkyNRG is building SAF facilities such as Project Wigeon around the world,” said John Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of SkyNRG Americas. “The Department of Ecology’s environmental review and Walla Walla County’s approval demonstrate our commitment to building this facility the right way— using industry-leading technology and conducting robust analysis of environmental impacts. This milestone allows SkyNRG to continue delivering clean fuel to major airports, building economic opportunity in Eastern Washington, and protecting natural resources and community health for years to come.”

“For several years, Boeing has supported SkyNRG’s efforts to develop SAF in the Pacific Northwest to enable our industry’s long-term growth, innovation, and efficiency,” said Allison Melia, Vice President of Sustainability at Boeing. “We look forward to leveraging SAF supply from SkyNRG and others for our operations as we increase airplane production to meet strong demand for our products.”

SkyNRG’s new facility supports a fast-emerging SAF global market as the aviation industry looks to develop new, domestically produced fuel options to meet rising demand and reduce emissions. Demand for SAF is accelerating, with global demand projected to reach five billion gallons by 2030 and more than 12 billion gallons by 2035.

Environmental permitting progress

In December 2025, Walla Walla County issued Project Wigeon its Critical Areas Permit, which documents the facility’s compliance with local environmental regulations.

The Critical Areas Permit was preceded by the Washington State Department of Ecology’s Mitigated Determination of Nonsignificance (MDNS) pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) in September 2025. The MDNS reflects the state’s conclusion that there are no significant adverse outcomes resulting from the project that are not mitigated.

The facility’s mitigation measures address local air emissions, clean fuel transportation, use of local water supplies, and groundwater impacts. This includes energy-efficient technologies built into the facility’s design and operations, creating a durable foundation for both environmental protection and long-term economic growth in the region.

Key aspects of the project include:

• Closed-loop industrial water system (Zero Liquid Discharge): All industrial and process water produced at Project Wigeon will be treated and reused on site, avoiding discharge, storage in ponds, or dispersal into groundwater.

• Water conservation: The facility will use water from the Port of Walla Walla water system and will maximize recycling to reduce overall water demand.

• Energy Production: Project Wigeon will utilize by-products of SAF production and excess steam to produce electricity on-site to offset impacts on the state’s electricity grid and reduce the overall lifecycle emissions of SAF.

• Air quality protections: The facility will be designed to operate under stringent air permit conditions set by state regulators, with ongoing monitoring and reporting.

• Stormwater management: Engineered containment systems will manage and control stormwater to protect surrounding land and water resources to limit impacts to local groundwater.

• Transportation safety and coordination: The transportation plan for SAF deliveries prioritizes safe, reliable methods for rail and trucks, purpose-built loading and containment areas that are aligned with federal and state requirements. Coordination with local partners and emergency services will be factored into project development and regular operations.

These measures, and the secured state and county approvals, are the result of more than three years of analysis and studies provided to state regulators, local officials, technical experts, and community leaders. This collaboration ensures the facility meets Washington’s highest environmental and community standards.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sky_NRG_Logo_New_eb6b13b8ce.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:58:22.217410

This reduction highlights the tangible climate benefits that can be achieved through early adoption of sustainable fuels in commercial aviation.
Commenting on the collaboration, Ángel Martínez Campos, responsible for Sustainable Aviation business development at Moeve, emphasised that the agreement reinforces Moeve’s long-term commitment to cutting emissions in aviation.
According to Rathgeber, the high level of participation by Condor’s guests has been instrumental in enabling meaningful progress, including partnerships such as the one with Moeve to secure additional volumes of sustainable fuel.","Moeve has successfully completed a major delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to support Condor-operated flights departing from Tenerife South Airport in Spain’s Canary Islands, marking a significant voluntary step toward reducing aviation emissions. Notably, Tenerife South Airport is not yet covered by the mandatory requirements of the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, making this initiative a clear demonstration of both companies’ proactive commitment to decarbonising air travel beyond regulatory obligations.

Under the agreement, Moeve supplied more than 515 metric tons of SAF to Condor. The fuel was produced using waste-based feedstocks, including used cooking oils and agricultural residues, aligning with the principles of circular economy and advanced biofuel production. When assessed across its full lifecycle, the supplied SAF is expected to deliver an estimated reduction of around 1,700 tons of carbon dioxide emissions compared with conventional fossil-based jet fuel. This reduction highlights the tangible climate benefits that can be achieved through early adoption of sustainable fuels in commercial aviation.

The SAF was used on multiple high-demand routes linking Tenerife with major German cities such as Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt, and Düsseldorf. According to airport operator Aena, more than 450,000 passengers travel each year with Condor to and from Tenerife South Airport, underlining the scale and potential impact of introducing SAF on these connections. By integrating SAF into these popular leisure and tourism routes, the initiative sends a strong signal about the role sustainable fuels can play in reducing emissions in one of Europe’s most travel-intensive regions.

Commenting on the collaboration, Ángel Martínez Campos, responsible for Sustainable Aviation business development at Moeve, emphasised that the agreement reinforces Moeve’s long-term commitment to cutting emissions in aviation. He highlighted that tourism is a cornerstone of the economy in Spain and particularly in Tenerife, making it essential to decarbonise air transport linked to the sector. Working jointly with Condor on a voluntary basis, he noted, demonstrates a shared dedication to sustainability that goes beyond minimum compliance with existing regulations.

From Condor’s perspective, the initiative also reflects strong passenger engagement. Sina Rathgeber, Director of Airport Relations, Government Affairs and Sustainability at Condor, explained that since last year the airline has offered customers the option to voluntarily round up their ticket price or make direct contributions toward SAF and certified climate protection projects. These contributions are ring-fenced exclusively for the purchase and deployment of additional SAF above regulatory mandates. According to Rathgeber, the high level of participation by Condor’s guests has been instrumental in enabling meaningful progress, including partnerships such as the one with Moeve to secure additional volumes of sustainable fuel.

The SAF supplied under this agreement was produced at Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, southern Spain. At this site, Moeve is currently constructing a new second-generation biofuels facility with a flexible annual production capacity of up to 500,000 tons of SAF and renewable diesel. The project, one of the three largest industrial developments currently underway in Spain, is already more than 50% complete and is expected to begin operations by the end of 2026. Once commissioned, it will form the largest second-generation biofuels complex in southern Europe.

Expanding the production and availability of advanced biofuels such as SAF is a central element of Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy. Through initiatives like this supply agreement with Condor, Moeve aims to position itself as a leading European player in the energy transition by 2030, while helping the aviation sector make measurable progress toward lower-carbon operations.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-14 10:57:07.581454

Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the parties intend to establish a jointly governed special purpose vehicle (""SPV"") to be named the ""Fayafi x DevvStream Investment Platform"" within ninety (90) days of the Investment Agreement's effective date. The SPV is targeted to scale upward, reaching US$100 million in capital commitment by the end of 2027, and intends to pursue high-impact, scalable opportunities across decarbonization and the energy transition, including environmental infrastructure, carbon solutions, and related technologies. The Investment Agreement supersedes the parties' previously announced memorandum of understanding and establishes agreed economic terms, governance principles, and fee arrangements. However, the investment amount constitutes a non-binding target, not a commitment or guarantee of capital deployment by either party.

Profits from the SPV, including carbon credit revenues, are expected to be distributed 80% to Fayafi and 20% to DevvStream. An Investment Committee is expected to be established with representatives from both parties, proportionate to their equity holdings, with a Fayafi representative serving as Chair, and with funding allocated only to projects approved by the Investment Committee. In consideration of its efforts to provide initial platform setup, project sourcing, and preliminary diligence services, DevvStream is expected to receive a one-time setup fee payable upon successful completion of feasibility confirmation and Fayafi's approval to proceed. DevvStream is also expected to receive a recurring consulting fee equal to a percentage of assets invested through the platform, payable monthly from initial capital deployment.

The Fayafi x DevvStream Investment Platform is intended to expand DevvStream's business beyond individual projects by establishing a global origination and investment engine to support the development, aggregation, and management of environmental assets. Management believes the platform can strengthen DevvStream's pipeline of opportunities, support recurring advisory and asset-management revenues, and enhance the Company's ability to structure and monetize environmental attributes at scale.

The platform is also expected to support DevvStream's investments across adjacent infrastructure such as sustainable feedstock supply chains, carbon capture and environmental-attribute frameworks, and other project-enabling capabilities. Management believes this ecosystem approach may improve project bankability, expand monetization opportunities, and support long-term growth, subject to Investment Committee approval and definitive agreements.

""This Investment Agreement is an important step forward toward the goal of expanding DevvStream's international reach and advancing a structured investment platform with a differentiated partner,"" said Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream. ""The proposed SPV framework aligns strong sourcing and execution capabilities with strategic capital and cross-border sponsorship, and we believe it can accelerate the pace at which high-quality energy transition projects are developed and monetized.""

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Market to Reach US$50 billion in 2036

Decarbonization of the aviation and maritime sectors will require large amounts of low-carbon fuels to reach global net-zero targets. IDTechEx forecasts that the global sustainable aviation fuel market may reach US$50 billion in 2036.

Globally, transportation accounts for ~20% of all CO2 emissions. Decarbonization of the aviation and maritime sectors will require large amounts of low-carbon fuels to reach global net-zero targets. For SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), 2025 was undoubtedly a pivotal year. In both the UK and EU, regulation such as ReFuelEU Aviation meant binding blending targets for SAF came into effect, creating unprecedented large-scale mandatory demand for SAF. This demand will continue to grow as decarbonization regulation ramps up. Based on current projections, IDTechEx forecasts in the new ""Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"" report that the global SAF market may reach US$50 billion in 2036.

How is SAF made?

There are several different ways to produce SAF, with the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathway being a major contributor to early SAF growth. HEFA feedstocks can include used cooking oils and animal fats. This is the lowest cost production pathway for SAF, with a selling price not too far from conventional jet fuel.

SAF production pathways covered in IDTechEx's ""Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"" report. Source: IDTechEx

However, these HEFA feedstocks are limited, and beyond 2030 the global SAF market will be faced with the ""HEFA tipping point"". This is when demand for SAF will keep growing due to increased global decarbonization regulation, but HEFA SAF supply will become insufficient. This will trigger a pivot to emerging SAF pathways such as alcohol-to-jet, gasification+Fischer Tropsch, and e-SAF. These technologies are less mature, but scaling up has already begun. For example, LanzaJet's Freedom Pines Fuels alcohol-to-jet facility came online in 2025, producing 9 million gallons of SAF and 1 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. However, for many emerging SAF pathways, high costs remain a significant barrier that technology development and regulation need to address.

Renewable diesel market continues to grow

Aviation is not the only promising market for sustainable fuels. Renewable diesel production is also expected to grow. The US will remain a leader in renewable diesel, with stackable policy support available, including the Renewable Fuel Standard, the 45Z tax credit, and the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Globally, the sustainable fuel market is expected to grow significantly over the next decade with IDTechEx forecasting the global renewable diesel and SAF production capacity will exceed 67 million tonnes annually by 2036, growing at a CAGR of 8.1% between 2026 and 2036. This impressive growth trajectory underscores the increasing importance of sustainable fuels in the global energy mix.

Increased demand for renewable methanol

Renewable methanol production is also rapidly increasing, with several ~100,000 tonnes per annum facilities already under construction. China will soon emerge as the leading region given its dominant position in existing methanol markets, its low CAPEX construction, and its plentiful biomass and green hydrogen resources for emerging biomass gasification and e-methanol technologies. Demand for low-carbon methanol is being driven by the need for clean marine fuels, decarbonization of the chemical sector, and as a feedstock for the SAF (via the methanol-to-jet pathway).

IDTechEx's ""Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"" report offers an in-depth analysis of the renewable methanol market, covering technology suppliers, key project developers, and announced project capacities, providing a detailed outlook on the future of renewable methanol.

Outlook

The major drivers for sustainable fuel market growth are policy developments, such as SAF fuel mandates in the EU and UK or the US' 45Z tax credit, as well as a push from vehicle fleet operators and airlines to reduce carbon emissions. However, the sector also faces significant challenges associated with overall energy efficiency (especially when comparing e-fuels to EVs for road transport), feedstock availability, project development issues (long development timelines and significant funding needed) and achieving cost parity with conventional fossil fuels. Together, these drivers and challenges are shaping this rapidly developing market.

SAF production has still risen, though it is running far short of current capacity.
Unlike biomass-based diesel, SAF is especially vulnerable to such perceptions because it’s a market still in its infancy.
Since aviation isn’t easily electrified, growth of SAF is seen as critical for U.S. ethanol and corn, the biggest U.S. crop.","Bigger-than-expected corn and soybean supplies are the latest challenge facing financially strained U.S. farmers.

Crop price pressures, high farming costs and demand woes are intensifying pressure on Congress and policymakers to advance pro-biofuel policies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is especially vulnerable to policy uncertainty after Congress lowered the value of a key tax credit.

America’s crop farmers got hit with a fresh wave of market woes this week, ramping up pressure on the Trump administration and Congress to move faster on biofuel policy the industry says is crucial to its future.

Domestic supplies of corn and soybeans are bigger than previously estimated, with the current corn crop at a record, the the Department of Agriculture said in its closely watched monthly crop report on Monday. Grain and soy prices fell.

The full bins collide with murky demand outlook and a surge in farm production costs. Ag and biofuel groups are doubling down on calls for Washington to take action. The wish list includes passing congressional legislation to allow year-round, nationwide sales of higher blends of corn-based ethanol, known as E15, and for the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize overdue 2026 biofuel-blending regulations.

The administration took power last January “very supportive of the biofuel program,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for StoneX Group. ""But then that momentum got lost in the bogged down process of writing policy.""

The National Corn Growers Association warns that surplus supply will keep corn prices low amid higher input costs.

“We need long-term market solutions, and we need them quickly, or this is going to deepen the economic crisis in the countryside,” Ohio farmer and NCGA President Jed Bower said following release of the USDA’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report. “The urgency for Congress and the president to open new markets abroad and expand consumer access to ethanol just increased exponentially.”

Renewable Fuels Association Chief Executive Officer Geoff Cooper said pollution-related concerns about summertime ethanol sales are outdated by decades and that marketplace restrictions ""are literally choking off demand and shortchanging America’s farmers.”

The administration has already set aside $12 billion to help farmers hurt by higher costs, lower crop prices and soft demand. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson, R-Pa., said last month that at least $10 billion more in federal aid will be needed.

Green jet fuel stalled

Another bearish note in this week’s WASDE was a pullback in the estimate for U.S. sales of soybeans to other countries. USDA said the trim was due to higher Brazilian production and exports, amplifying broader concern about the future of American competitiveness. Many analysts said the agency didn't cut enough.

Just a few years ago, a flurry of announced plans to make more sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. boosted investment in the fuel and triggered talk of massive amounts of new crop acreage. That came amid a boom in renewable diesel production. Both fuels can be made with a wide array of raw materials, including corn-based ethanol and soybean oil.

More recently, biomass-based diesel output stumbled due to policy uncertainty, including EPA's pending biofuel-blending rules and the Treasury Department's guidance on the new 45Z clean fuel production tax credit. SAF production has still risen, though it is running far short of current capacity.

The slowdown in investor interest, at least for now, is yet another headache for U.S. farmers, especially soybean growers struggling after China stopped buying their crops for a big chunk of last year due to President Donald Trump's tariff wars.

Montana Renewables CEO Bruce Fleming says the lack of policy clarity means there's not funding for new U.S. biofuel projects.

“Investors can’t make any money available because of uncertainty, which means we are going to run into a supply shortage probably sooner than people think, particularly in SAF,” he says.

Meanwhile, Montana Renewables, which makes both renewable diesel and SAF, has plans to sell as many as 150 million gallons of SAF a year, up substantially from current capacity, according to Fleming. The company is one of three leading green jet fuel producers in the U.S.

The lower-emitting fuel was a top priority of the Biden administration, though has drawn scant attention from Trump. The president's disdain for climate change-related policy also has caused some companies to ease off sustainability plans.

After World Energy temporarily halted SAF production last year due to its operating partner, Air Products, cutting its partnership with the company, founder and CEO Gene Gebolys told Fastmarkets that the Trump administration’s stance on environmentally friendly energy was partly to blame.

Unlike biomass-based diesel, SAF is especially vulnerable to such perceptions because it’s a market still in its infancy. Since aviation isn’t easily electrified, growth of SAF is seen as critical for U.S. ethanol and corn, the biggest U.S. crop.

More than a third of America’s corn harvest each year goes to making the gasoline additive. Ethanol, facing an existential crisis with the rise of electric vehicles, is among pathways to make SAF.

In November, LanzaJet Inc. said it started commercial operations at its demonstration-sized SAF plant in Georgia after a string of delays, marking the world’s first production of jet fuel using ethanol. Still, a slew of plans to build full-size ethanol-to-jet plants by various companies have yet to materialize.

Soy-heavy green diesel is also viewed as crucial for U.S. agriculture, but it’s further along as an industry. The fuel used to power trucks and other heavy machinery is currently favored by many fuel producers over SAF, after federal lawmakers last summer cut the base value of the 45Z credit for SAF from $1.75 to $1 a gallon. That put it at the same level as green diesel, which is less costly to make.

There's bipartisan legislation in Congress to restore the value of the credit.

In a November report, BloombergNEF analyst Jade Patterson said U.S. SAF capacity could increase to 760 million gallons by the end of 2027, up from roughly 400 million now, as more capacity comes online. But demand at the moment is in question, in part due to the reduction in 45Z.

Overall, StoneX's Suderman said the policy question is coming at a big cost.

Cathay said the study provides practical analysis and recommendations to help scale SAF adoption in the Chinese Mainland by addressing both supply and demand through market-based measures.

The study reviews the challenges and growth potential for SAF in the Chinese Mainland, drawing comparisons with global best practices and China’s solar photovoltaic industry. It highlights China’s advantages in feedstock and manufacturing and examines long-term cost trends across different production pathways. The study notes that the Power-to-Liquid pathway, which produces electro-sustainable aviation fuel, has the strongest potential for long-term cost reduction and could reach price parity with conventional jet fuel, including China’s projected 2030 carbon price, once cumulative output reaches 1.6 million tonnes, with appropriate policy support.

It also recommends a combined approach to developing the national SAF industry, including policy integration, stimulating market demand, expanding international market access and setting up procurement mechanisms to ensure stable supply and demand.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said the development of a domestic SAF industry in the Chinese Mainland would support national carbon targets and improve the availability and affordability of SAF for global airlines. She added that the study highlights the potential for SAF to achieve long-term cost parity with conventional jet fuel, provided there is sufficient support for new technologies, large-scale production and policies that encourage SAF deployment on both the supply and demand sides.

Decarbonizing the aviation sector requires low-carbon sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to fossil jet fuel while preserving compatibility with existing fuel distribution infrastructure and conventional aircraft engines. This study assesses a novel sustainable fuels production pathway based on highly wet and difficult-to-handle biomass, with the objective of maximizing SAF yield. The process integrates hydrothermal carbonization with sorbent-enhanced conversion, where three scenarios are evaluated: biomass-to-liquid (BtL) with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), power-biomass-to-liquid with CCS and PEM electrolyzer (PBtL), and a Benchmark configuration embedding PEM with no CCS. The BtL scenario achieves the highest energy efficiency (51.16%) and the highest carbon-negative potential (−115.89 g-CO2/MJ), driven by limited electricity consumption, minimal grid dependence, and a high capture and sequestration rate. The PBtL scenario shows lower efficiency (39.44%) but remains carbon-negative (−41.96 g-CO2/MJ). Its performance is constrained mainly by high electricity demand and suboptimal use of electrolytic hydrogen, which is largely combusted for process heat and power. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the strong resilience of BtL to variations in grid carbon intensity, whereas the PBtL and Benchmark scenarios exhibit high vulnerability. Economic analysis reveals relatively high production costs (0.155–0.271 €/MJ), approximately 10-17 times higher than current fossil jet fuel, due to substantial capital expenditure and high operating costs. Pairing revenue from voluntary carbon markets with SAF mandate-linked incentives while preventing double-counting income substantially improves economic viability. Recognizing and rewarding carbon-negative performance in policy frameworks at carbon credit prices exceeding ~200 €/t-CO2 sequestered would strengthen SAF competitiveness from these pathways with fossil kerosene, particularly under existing fuel taxation incentives.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2026-01-14 06:58:19.644695

About Abundia Global Impact Group, Inc. Abundia Global Impact Group, Inc.

Revenue from commercial grade drop-in fuels and chemicals anticipated in 2029

HOUSTON, TX, Jan. 13, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abundia Global Impact Group, Inc. (NYSE American: AGIG) (“Abundia” or the “Company”), announces it has issued its first letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer Ed Gillespie, which highlights the Company’s 2025 transformation to the public markets to accelerate its strategic direction and outlines priorities and milestones expected in 2026.

Dear Valued Shareholders,

As we embark on the early days of 2026, and on behalf of the Abundia team, I would like to begin by thanking our shareholders for the ongoing support of Abundia’s long-term strategy. Our team remains committed to driving shareholder value through our strategy of producing high value renewable fuels and chemicals from waste streams that are destined for landfill or incineration by deploying already commercially proven technology solutions that can power the renewables economy.

In December 2025, Abundia debuted as a NYSE American listed company. Our public transition was the result of the July 2025 merger between Houston Energy Corp. (HUSA), formerly a publicly listed upstream oil & gas company, and Abundia Global Impact Group, a private company offering a technology platform that converts waste plastics and biomass into renewable fuels and chemicals. As the CEO of the prevailing Abundia business, this unique opportunity to utilize the HUSA public company vehicle was an attractive proposition to accelerate Abundia’s strategic direction.

Abundia’s vision has been to create a vertically integrated, commercially proven, technology stack to provide a commercially viable solution for the waste to value industry. With clear and growing secular demand, and regulatory tailwinds in Europe and the US, we initiated our capital deployment strategy in 2025 with the acquisition of the Cedar Port site in Texas to develop our centralized innovation hub.

Abundia’s Pathways to Product and Long-term Value

As an integrated renewables company and producer of low carbon fuel alternatives, our business strategy is rooted in our technology partnerships which are the pathways or processes that combine with upgrading technology to produce our drop-in low carbon fuels and chemical products that deliver our differentiated waste to value strategy. In terms of identifying technology partners, our key criteria sourced a narrow lens of proven, validated, commercially viable technology that de-risked this pivotal component of our business.

In 2021, we secured our licensing agreement with Alterra Technology, which provided Abundia with access to its advanced continuous pyrolysis processes. This is our plastics waste-to-fuel segment, which will ultimately produce high value renewable fuels and chemicals such as diesel, naphtha, and jet fuel.

Our second pathway supports our biomass waste-to-fuel strategy and was secured through our agreement with BTG Bioliquids for its fast pyrolysis technology, with which we intend to specialize in the production of renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Both base technologies are commercially proven and operational at full scale, at various locations in the US and Europe. After the additional upgrading steps that bolt on to these base technologies, our output will be commercial ready fuel and chemical products that can be used directly or blended into existing distribution infrastructure. We are confident that our market and technology readiness provides a solid platform to build and accelerate a path to revenue generation and scalable opportunities for Abundia.

Accomplishments in 2025

Asset Acquisition: In July, we completed the site acquisition at Cedar Port in Baytown, TX, a 25-acre industrial site which will serve as Abundia’s Innovation Center, the hub for the end-to-end lifecycle of producing renewable fuels and chemicals, and our operational headquarters.

Project Partners Appointed: In August, we confirmed Nexus PMG as engineering and services lead for the plastics recycling facility and innovation center development at Cedar Port.

Solidified Strategic Technology Agreement: In October, Abundia locked in a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) agreement with BTG Bioliquids to collaborate on SAF projects through the use of BTG’s pyrolysis technology to convert biomass to produce Fast Pyrolysis Bio-Oil (FPBO).

Operations Project Launch: We officially broke ground at the Cedar Port site in October, which initiated Phase 1 of the development project with design, permitting and construction of the innovation center including an on-premises R&D facility.

Optimized Balance Sheet: In November, the Company reduced our debt by restructuring a senior secured convertible note with lead strategic investor Bower Family Holdings, providing financial flexibility for capital expenditures related to construction and development of the Cedar Port site.

Successfully Completed a Capital Raise: In November, the Company announced the completion of an $8 million capital raise with institutional investors, allowing the company to accelerate its strategy for commercial deployment and develop the Cedar Port site.

Official Transition to a Pure Play Renewables Company: On December 8th, we officially began trading on the NYSE American as Abundia.

Activation of the Alterra License Agreement: On December 9th, we delivered formal site notification to Alterra Energy for the first recycling facility at our Cedar Port site. Subsequently, on December 15th, we announced the expansion of rights to operate two additional sites in the US, providing an additional revenue opportunity.

Our judicious execution in 2025 represents significant milestones and opportunities for the company’s long-term value generation.

Aligning components of a vertical integration strategy

The leadership team at Abundia is comprised of a diverse team that bring proven abilities in management, finance, project development and operations. The combined depth and knowledge of this team and their ability to develop, build, execute, and scale commercial projects is a core competency and quite frankly, a competitive advantage driving our vertical integration strategy.

Our leadership’s strategic approach to securing technology partners that were essentially plug and play contributors due to their validated and proven product, combined with an upgrading strategy to produce high quality and high value renewable fuels and chemicals has been executed with a similar approach to solidifying our infrastructure of partners. When I reference infrastructure, this extends beyond the current innovation hub development at Cedar Port. Abundia’s infrastructure includes deploying a full scale of operations, and is the component that is under our control, to accelerate our time to market with commercial grade low carbon fuels. To this end, we have employed our network of market readiness partners with a robust history of delivering, strengthening and ensuring successful project outcomes. We are focused on execution and have appointed reliable, at scale, partners for each segment of the project. This began with our Phase 1 construction of the innovation center at Cedar Port by securing Corvus Construction as a general contractor and the appointment of Nexus PMG as its lead engineering and project advisor to oversee the technical, engineering and design aspects of the projects.

2026 Plan

2025 was the transformational year for Abundia, and with the acquisition of Cedar Port completed as the critical infrastructure to build the Abundia Innovation Center, along with our market integration partners, we have entered 2026 on a firm foundation. Our strategy in 2026 is driven by our achievements to date, operational excellence derived from management to our strategic partners who remain committed to disciplined actions that position the company for long-term growth.

Project and Operational Roadmap:

Q1 2026 Strategic Catalyst: Finalization of the RPD Acquisition, an R&D company offering a combination of intelligence and hard technology assets that will augment Abundia’s operations to deliver rigorous analysis and trials for refining, petrochemical, gasification and renewable energy technologies. Merging RPD into Abundia’s operations provides a force multiplier to accelerate our commercial readiness plan, sustainable growth and future expansion opportunities.

2Q 2026 Infrastructure Milestone: Targeted completion of Phase 1 at the Cedar Port Innovation Center, establishing our operational headquarters, technology hub, and an R&D facility. This will essentially serve as Abundia’s “command center” for end-to-end deployment of processes towards commercialization of our final renewable products.

Disciplined Capital Allocation: With the support of our long-term strategic investors and their confidence in our products, technology, and management team, we’ve made meaningful progress toward positioning Abundia’s vertically integrated infrastructure prior to entering the capital markets. Importantly, capital investments from our lead investors during the early stages of our site project reinforces our business transformation and the strategy that we’ve assembled to deliver long-term value and anticipated growth of this invested capital. We will continue to make efficient use of our balance sheet and optimize capital expenditures through our vertical integration structure.

These strategic priorities, combined with our strengthened balance sheet, have positioned Abundia for completion of Phase 1, the Renewable Energy Complex development, on an accelerated timeline by 2Q 2026. Furthermore, based on our current targets and assumptions, the Phase 2 Waste Plastic to Renewable Fuels and Chemicals Plant, is expected to be completed in 2029. Upon completion, we expect the production and commercialization of high yield, high quality renewable fuel and chemical products to generate revenue in the same year. The sale of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is subject to completion of the accreditation and certification process.

Transparency and communications to the market relative to our 2025 execution is a priority for our management team, and we are committed to continued – and perhaps even increased - transparency to our shareholders regarding 2026 milestones and achievements. We believe the Abundia ecosystem as established in 2025 provides the structural drivers that set a trajectory to seeing the results unfold in 2026 and maintains progression towards commercialization by 2029. With a focused strategy, differentiated technology, and a lean operating model, we are committed to maximizing Abundia’s long-term value for our shareholders.

On behalf of the Abundia team, I’d like to once again express our deepest appreciation to our shareholders and other stakeholders for your continued confidence and support. We look forward to providing the market with regular updates on our progress in the year ahead.

What sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is doing today may shape the future, but right now it asks passengers to fund an idea that has yet to prove itself at scale.","Airlines have found a new way to make you pause at checkout. Just after seat selection and before you hand over your card details, a neat little box appears inviting you to chip in towards the climate impact of your flight. The wording feels worthy, the price feels tolerable, and the implication is obvious. If you care, you’ll pay. If you don’t, well, that’s on you. This is the moment most people first ask what sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is, and why it has suddenly become their personal responsibility – a small, optional guilt tax slipped in just before payment.

The idea sounds simple enough. SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from waste oils or synthetic processes rather than crude oil. It can be blended with existing fuel and used in today’s aircraft without modification. On paper, it promises lower lifecycle carbon emissions than standard jet fuel. That all sounds reassuring, until you look at how it actually shows up in the real world.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Explained – what airlines don’t make clear

The first thing to understand is that ticking that box does not change what powers your aircraft. Your flight still burns regular jet fuel from pushback to touchdown. The money you contribute goes into a central pot that allows the airline to buy a small amount of SAF somewhere else in its network, at another time, on another aircraft. The benefit exists on a spreadsheet, not in the wing of the plane you are sitting on.

This book-and-claim approach is rarely spelled out. Passengers are nudged into believing they are cleaning up their own journey, when in reality they are funding a marginal system-level adjustment with no measurable impact on their individual flight. Once you grasp that, the whole proposition starts to wobble.

Why passengers are being asked to fund it

The uncomfortable truth is that SAF is expensive and scarce. It costs several times more than conventional jet fuel and makes up a tiny fraction of global supply. Airlines face growing pressure from governments to use it, but few are willing to absorb the cost or reprice fares accordingly. The easier option is to pass the hat around.

By positioning SAF as a voluntary add-on, airlines can talk loudly about climate action while keeping base fares competitive. The financial risk shifts quietly to passengers, wrapped in language that suggests personal agency rather than corporate obligation. It is a clever move, but not an especially honest one.

Why this doesn’t change the climate maths

SAF itself is not imaginary. It exists, it flies, and it may well play a role in aviation’s long-term decarbonisation. The issue is scale. Today’s production volumes are nowhere near high enough to deliver meaningful reductions, and feedstocks remain limited. Synthetic fuels promise more supply in theory, but at eye-watering cost and energy demand.

At this point you start thinking, what is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) actually achieving here, beyond a bit of corporate signalling? Even generous passenger contributions cover only a sliver of the fuel burn of a long-haul flight. Any genuine climate benefit only appears when SAF is adopted at scale across entire fleets, driven by mandates and supply-side investment, not optional checkout donations.

That is why accusations of greenwashing are hard to dismiss. If SAF genuinely mattered in the way it is marketed, airlines would treat it as a non-negotiable cost of operating in a carbon-constrained world. Instead, it sits alongside extra legroom and lounge access, sold as a feel-good add-on rather than a structural shift.

So where does that leave us? Curious, informed, and unconvinced. What sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is doing today may shape the future, but right now it asks passengers to fund an idea that has yet to prove itself at scale. Until that changes, we’ll keep scrolling past the box and keeping our money firmly in our pocket.",https://media.boardinggroup.one/2026/01/13-210116/image.png,N,,2026-01-14 01:12:10.247424

California-based JetZero—which has ditched the conventional tube-and-wing for a blended-wing body (BWB) or “all-wing” configuration—said Tuesday that it raised $175 million in a Series B round led by B Capital, a new investor.

The round also included participation from United Airlines Ventures, RTX Ventures, and Northrop Grumman, all of which have existing ties to JetZero.

United Airlines Ventures in April made an undisclosed investment and signed a purchase agreement for up to 100 aircraft and 100 options, contingent upon the flight of a full-scale demonstrator in 2027, among other conditions. JetZero in 2023 won a $235 million Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) contract to build and fly an early version of its flagship Z4 that is expected to deliver fuel efficiency gains of 30 percent, with added lift and improved mobility.

Northrop’s Scaled Composites division is working with JetZero toward that demonstration.

“A fleet of these could save the U.S. Department of the Air Force up to $1 billion in fuel costs per year,” Ravi Chaudhary, former assistant secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment—and an adviser for JetZero for six months in 2025, per his LinkedIn—told The American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 2023.

RTX is tied to JetZero through its Pratt and Whitney and Collins Aerospace units. The former is supplying its PW2040 turbofan engine and auxiliary power units for the Z4, while the latter will provide nacelles, fairings, and engine support structures.

JetZero in 2025 also secured a formal partnership with Delta Air Lines and is part of the carrier’s Sustainable Skies Lab, which it said will provide maintenance, operational footprints, and other resources to validate the Z4’s technology. The two had been working together informally since 2021. Delta will also consult on the Z4’s interior design.

Alaska Star Ventures, the investment arm of Alaska Airlines, participated in JetZero’s 2023 Series A round and has options for future aircraft orders.

“If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, in April.

JetZero said the fresh funding will accelerate development of the full-scale demonstrator, reiterating its target for first flight in 2027. With Tuesday’s raise, the company added, it has secured more than $1 billion in funding and commitments.

The Path to JetZero

Despite the novelty of BWB aircraft, airlines such as United and Delta view the technology as a tool to drive down costs and meet commitments to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2050.

Few BWBs have advanced beyond the prototype phase, and none have been certified to carry passengers. The concept was first studied in earnest in the 1990s, after NASA challenged the industry to develop revolutionary gains in fuel efficiency compared to airframes like the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas MD-11, or Airbus A320.

McDonnell Douglas accepted the challenge. It devised a 450-passenger concept that was used to develop two 8.5-percent dynamically scaled test vehicles, the X-48B and X-48C. Combined, the two aircraft flew 122 times between 2007 and 2013.

All-wing designs like the Z4 integrate the wings and fuselage into a single shape, eliminating the traditional tail section. The result is a smooth airframe that reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wing, lowering fuel consumption.

For example, JetZero estimates that a 3,400 nm flight from New York to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, would use up to 45 percent less fuel versus twin-aisle aircraft that fly that route today. The Z4’s 45,000-foot service ceiling and top-mounted engines—akin to NASA and Lockheed Martin’s X-59 supersonic demonstrator—are further expected to reduce noise.

The model is designed for up to 250 passengers, similar to existing widebodies. But JetZero bills it as a “mid-market” aircraft due to its projected range of 5,000 nm. It is designed to fly on conventional jet fuel but in the future could use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends or, potentially, liquid hydrogen.

Per JetZero, the Z4 will fit into existing airport infrastructure, with no new jet bridges, runways, or taxiways required. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) air taxis, by contrast, will eventually require vertiports and charging infrastructure. The company plans to certify the model under FAA Part 25, with planned passenger transport, commercial freighter, and military tanker and refueling variants.

Beyond fuel efficiency, the Z4’s other standout feature is its spaciousness. Its vertical interior walls offer increased cabin space to accommodate larger doors and 18-inch-wide seats, with dedicated overhead bin space for each. It will be configurable as a 2-by-3 or without middle seats.

JetZero in June announced plans to pour $4.7 billion into a Z4 production facility at Piedmont Triad International Airport (KGSO) in North Carolina.

Competing with JetZero for airline customers is another California-based developer, Natilus.

Natilus is developing two BWB models, the Kona for cargo and Horizon for passenger. Kona has a projected maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 19,000 pounds, speed of 250 knots, and range of 200 to 300 miles. Horizon is predicted to have a 160,000-pound MTOW and cruise at Mach 0.8. The latter is billed as a replacement for single-aisle narrowbodies such as the Boeing 737 Max 8 and 10 and Airbus A320neo.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/JetZero-Z4-United-livery-1-portrait-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 00:56:49.789695

Walsh highlighted “worrying developments” and said: “I’m disappointed at the pace of progress. We’re not seeing SAF produced in the volumes we hoped or expected.”

He noted: “We said when we committed to net zero by 2050 that it would be extremely challenging and expensive. It will be more challenging now. The regulation has not been helpful. Mandates have led to huge increases in price [of SAF].”

Walsh accused fuel suppliers of “price gouging and ripping us off ”, saying: “If you mandate a product that is in short supply, it will increase in price. Airlines that need to comply with the mandates can’t get the supply. Governments will have to review these mandates.”

He suggested the UK mandate target of 10% SAF use by 2030, which some airlines have committed to across their operations, is “now impossible to achieve” and said: “The EU’s 6% SAF target will be challenging, [but] 10% SAF use by 2030 is beyond the reach of most airlines. SAF is not available. A lot of airlines will have to reassess their commitments.

“About 70% of airlines have made commitments on SAF use by 2030. There is just no way those commitments can all be met. We’re not seeing the supply stimulated.”

Walsh noted fuel suppliers pay the costs of compliance with the mandates but “just pass them on”, saying: “They’re in a position to adjust the price to protect themselves.

“This is a wake-up call. SAF is just not available. The regulators need to look urgently at what is happening versus what they thought would happen.”

Walsh said Iata had not set a 2030 target for SAF use “because what we thought achievable wouldn’t look ambitious”.

Global SAF production is forecast to reach 2.4 million tonnes (MTs) in 2026, up from 1.9 MTs in 2025. That was almost double the 1 MTs produced in 2024 but represented only 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption while adding $3.6 billion to airline fuel bills.

From global trade to personal travel, air transport plays a vital role in modern life. At the center of this system is aviation fuel an essential component that enables flight but also represents one of the industry’s greatest challenges as sustainability becomes a global priority.

Traditional aviation fuel, commonly known as jet fuel or Jet A-1, has long been valued for its reliability, energy density, and safety performance. These qualities are critical in an industry where operational margins are tight and safety standards are uncompromising. However, conventional aviation fuels are derived from fossil sources and contribute significantly to carbon emissions, placing aviation under increasing scrutiny as countries work toward climate goals.

Unlike other transport sectors, aviation faces unique limitations when it comes to electrification. Long-haul flights require high energy density that current battery technologies cannot yet provide at scale. As a result, fuel innovation—not replacement of aircraft is the most immediate and realistic pathway to reducing aviation’s environmental impact.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are emerging as a key solution. Produced from renewable sources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or synthetic processes using captured carbon, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Importantly, SAF is designed to be compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, allowing airlines to adopt cleaner fuels without overhauling fleets.

Despite this promise, widespread adoption remains a challenge. Production volumes are still limited, costs are higher than traditional fuels, and supply chains are uneven across regions. Airlines, fuel producers, and governments are therefore working together to scale production, introduce incentives, and create long-term demand certainty.

Alongside SAF, research is advancing into synthetic e-fuels and hydrogen-based aviation fuels. E-fuels, created using renewable electricity, water, and captured carbon, offer a potential route to near-carbon-neutral flying. Hydrogen, while still at an early stage for commercial aviation, is being explored for short-haul routes and future aircraft designs. These innovations signal long-term change, even if they are not yet ready for widespread deployment.

Regulation and policy are shaping the pace of progress. Blending mandates, carbon pricing, and international frameworks are pushing the industry to move faster while maintaining safety and economic stability. At the same time, passengers are becoming

more aware of aviation’s environmental footprint, influencing airline strategies and brand positioning.

The future of aviation fuels will not hinge on a single breakthrough. Instead, it will be built through gradual transition, steady investment, and collaboration across the aviation ecosystem. Cleaner fuels are becoming an essential part of aviation’s license to grow in a carbon-constrained world.

,,2026-01-13 22:22:25+00:00,www.spa.gov.sa,KAUST and Arabian Petroleum Supply Company Partner to Advance Sustainable Aviation ...,Not Available,,,,,https://www.spa.gov.sa/N2455611,"Jeddah, November 30, 2025, SPA -- King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) has signed a new material transfer agreement (MTA) with the Arabian Petroleum Supply Company (Apsco), under which Apsco will supply KAUST with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for research on next-generation low-emission fuels.
    According to a KAUST press release, the collaboration comes at a critical time for the aviation industry. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulations, airlines are required to use a 2% SAF blend by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050—targets that remain out of reach with today’s fuel technologies. Meanwhile, global SAF demand is expected to surge from 2 million metric tons in 2025 to 10 million in 2030 and 75 million by 2040.
    Professors Mani Sarathy, Thibault Guiberti, Aamir Farooq, and Hong Im will lead the research, which will focus on the chemical properties, reaction pathways, and combustion behavior of the provided fuels. The new data on fuel behavior, emissions characteristics, and performance metrics will build a comprehensive database that will develop models for the creation of future SAF formulations of higher efficiency and lower environmental impact.
    “This partnership allows us to combine world-class experimental facilities with advanced artificial intelligence to fundamentally reimagine how sustainable aviation fuels are designed,” said Sarathy. “Using the new data generated, our models will help identify efficient, cleaner, and more scalable fuel formulations that can support the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals.”
    The release also highlighted that globally, the aviation industry is increasingly turning to create predictive models for fuel behavior from partial datasets, reducing development cycles from years to months. Beyond fuel design, the project will help bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently slow SAF adoption worldwide, from understanding emissions behavior to assessing how fuels perform across a range of operating environments. By answering these fundamental questions, the partnership will enable industry and regulators to make faster, more informed decisions about future SAF deployment.
    Apsco CEO Dr. Azzam Qari stated, “This collaboration with KAUST marks an important milestone for Apsco and for the future of sustainable aviation in the Kingdom. As the global aviation sector moves rapidly toward lower-carbon solutions, investing in local research and national capabilities in SAF is no longer optional; it is strategic. Through this agreement, our role goes beyond supplying fuel for testing; we are helping build the scientific and technical foundation that can enable Saudi-developed SAF technologies in the years ahead.”
    Moreover, as Saudi Arabia expands its aviation network and explores domestic SAF production opportunities, the ability to test and validate fuel properties within the Kingdom scientifically becomes increasingly essential. Building local research infrastructure accelerates certification, supports national sustainability targets, and strengthens the country’s position in the future global aviation fuel market. With research facilities already in place, KAUST will provide the scientific foundation needed to accelerate domestic SAF research in the Kingdom, supporting the goals of the Saudi Aviation Strategy to advance low-carbon, next generation energy technologies.
