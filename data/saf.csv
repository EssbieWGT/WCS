Beyond Aero has highlighted that this engine configuration, which has been scaled up to 2.4MW of power, can be further scaled up in the future if needed.
The hydrogen storage system has also been modified to enhance safety by mounting it above the wing box structure, improving its chances of surviving a crash.
According to Beyond Aero, these changes will also enhance the cost profile of the executive jet the company is developing.
This is due in part to the expected lower cost of hydrogen, which Beyond Aero projects to be 65% cheaper than synthetic sustainable aviation fuel and 17% cheaper than Jet A1 by 2030.","Beyond Aero, a French startup developing a hydrogen-powered executive aircraft, announced on March 17, 2025, that it has added several modifications to its original design in order to add technological advances and bring the aircraft closer to certification.

These enhancements cover three different aspects of the aircraft’s propulsion system.

The hydrogen-fuel system will be battery-free and have built-in redundancy, with two separate electric engines, each with its own power source. Beyond Aero has highlighted that this engine configuration, which has been scaled up to 2.4MW of power, can be further scaled up in the future if needed.

The hydrogen storage system has also been modified to enhance safety by mounting it above the wing box structure, improving its chances of surviving a crash. This design also eliminates high-pressure fuel lines inside the pressurized cabin.

Last, but not least, the new design uses an advanced, computer-controlled thermal management system with built-in electric fans which improve the aircraft’s performance in all types of weather and extreme temperatures.

According to Beyond Aero, these changes will also enhance the cost profile of the executive jet the company is developing. This is due in part to the expected lower cost of hydrogen, which Beyond Aero projects to be 65% cheaper than synthetic sustainable aviation fuel and 17% cheaper than Jet A1 by 2030. The French company also aims to deliver a drastic reduction in maintenance costs with its future aircraft, the result of having fewer moving parts and not using a high-temperature turbine.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/03/BYA_TopView.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 04:50:07.950938

Low SAF prices will result in higher revenue certainty mechanism payments for UK fuel suppliers.
Responses to the March 2025 industry funding consultation process will be considered when drafting the provisions of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to implement a revenue certainty mechanism and any subsequent regulations.","In January 2025 the UK government published its response to last year's consultation on the possible forms of a SAF revenue certainty mechanism, which confirmed the government's decision to implement a Guaranteed Strike Price (GSP) model to help attract the necessary long-term funding to support the SAF industry meet the demand generated by the UK SAF Mandate.

As anticipated in the government's January response, in March 2025, the UK government initiated a consultation to seek the views of stakeholders on how the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded. The government has proposed for the revenue certainty mechanism to be funded by industry, preferably by introducing a levy on jet fuel suppliers. In addition to reducing risk for SAF producers, the revenue certainty scheme aims to limit costs and protect consumers from significant cost increases.

This article explores how the GSP model works, why it was selected, the key considerations for its implementation, and how it is proposed that the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded.

How GSP works and why it was chosen

The GSP model provides revenue stability by ensuring SAF producers receive a fixed price per unit of fuel through private law contracts with a government-backed counterparty.

If the market price falls below the agreed strike price, the counterparty compensates the SAF producer for the difference.

If the market price rises above the strike price, the SAF producer repays the difference to the counterparty.

The GSP model was chosen as the preferred revenue certainty mechanism because, when compared to the possible alternatives, it was seen to provide the highest level of investor confidence with the private law contract with a government-backed counterparty protecting against potential policy changes and legislative uncertainty.

To implement the GSP model, the government aims to leverage the experience of contracts for difference (CfD) used in the renewable power sector which were first introduced over a decade ago. Although the existing CfD model will need to be adapted to cater for the differences between energy and fuels (such as the absence of a national grid), the government believes that the precedent set by CfD in the low-carbon energy sector demonstrates that the GSP model can (i) effectively attract investment, (ii) offer a clear and predictable claim process, and (iii) ensure fair risk-sharing, making it the most viable option for scaling UK SAF production.

GSP contract considerations

While the response identified the GSP as the government's preferred revenue certainty mechanism, key elements of how the mechanism will operate remain unclear.

Scope: In their response to the consultation stakeholders raised concerns about the scope of the GSP mechanism, including whether it should cover: (i) SAF produced in the UK but exported, (ii) hydrogen from the Hydrogen Production Business Model, and (iii) all production costs, including electricity and feedstocks.

Duration: Responses also questioned the appropriateness of the proposed 10-15 year contract length, suggesting that different durations based on technology type (such as nuclear-derived power-to-liquid (PtL) SAF) or dividing contracts into stages to support varying SAF volumes. Other concerns included contract flexibility, differential treatment for SAF technologies, feedstock supply, and incentives for competitive pricing.

Allocation Method: While the government sought feedback on the preferred method of allocating GSP contracts (such as through market-led proposals, tendering processes, competitive auctions), no strong preference was expressed in the responses to the consultation. However, many respondents suggested bilateral negotiations or a tendering process for early rounds, transitioning to competitive auctions as more projects enter the market. Some recommended grouping SAF technologies into separate categories based on costs and emissions. Concerns were raised about ineffective selection criteria allowing underdeveloped projects to bid. Standardised pricing received little support due to varying SAF production challenges.

The government acknowledged these complexities and said it will work with stakeholders to ensure a balanced approach that supports investment, affordability, and sustainability, while refining key policy details.

The consultation also considered which entity should act as the counterparty to manage GSP contracts. While some respondents suggested alternative bodies such as the Civil Aviation Authority, the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC) emerged as the preferred choice, backed by most respondents due to its credibility, financial strength, and experience with CfD scheme. The government has confirmed that it will work with LCCC to integrate best practices from CfD into the GSP scheme.

Industry funding for the revenue certainty mechanism

Consistent with the ""polluter pays"" principle, the government has confirmed its position that the revenue certainty mechanism should be funded by the aviation industry. Industry funding would need to cover the cost of payments issued under a GSP mechanism and the costs incurred by the counterparty to administer the scheme.

The government's proposed approach is for the GSP mechanism to be funded through a variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers that would cover the cost of payments to SAF producers and the cost of administering the scheme. The consultation notes that the proposed approach is similar to that taken for other schemes where industry provides funding support for low carbon technologies (such as the Electricity Supplier Obligation where a levy is imposed on licensed electricity suppliers to fund the CfD scheme for renewable energy projects).

The aviation fuel suppliers that would be subject to the levy would be consistent with those suppliers that are subject to the SAF Mandate (ie suppliers owning 15.9 terajoules or more of aviation turbine fuel at the duty point for use in the UK, during a calendar year). Individual contributions for each obligated supplier would be determined by market share, with the period for calculating market share and scheme costs to be determined.

It is envisaged that a forecast will predict the expected scheme costs over a specified period and determine each supplier's contribution in advance of payment. The levy will include a 'reserve payment' to cover any minor divergences from the forecast. The levy amount can adapt and change between collection periods and where an interim levy is collected based on forecasts, there would be a reconciliation based on actual data.

Ahead of any scheme introduction, the government intends to further consult and engage with industry regarding the detail of how the levy will work in practice.

Costs associated with the revenue certainty mechanism

Under the proposed levy on suppliers of jet fuel, UK fuel suppliers' costs include the difference between the agreed strike price and the market price of SAF when the SAF price is lower than the agreed strike price. This cost is additional to the price of purchasing SAF under the SAF Mandate.

The reality of the GSP mechanism is that fuel suppliers will see the effective price of the SAF volumes that are covered under the revenue certainty mechanism fixed at the strike price. Low SAF prices will result in higher revenue certainty mechanism payments for UK fuel suppliers.

To limit the cost impacts of the revenue certainty mechanism, the scheme's liability can be managed by agreeing the strike price within contracts and limiting the support to a pre-determined volume of SAF. The GSP mechanism is only intended to provide interim support to help establish inaugural plants in the UK and deliver the UK SAF mandate targets. The government has indicated that it will continuously monitor the impacts of the scheme to ensure that they are not disproportionate.

Next steps

The government has decided that the initial tranche of GSP contracts will be awarded to UK SAF projects utilising non-hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technologies. This is due to the comparative maturity of HEFA-based SAF and the current supply and availability of HEFA fuel. By focusing on non-HEFA technologies, the government aims to encourage the development of advanced SAF production methods.

The eligibility criteria and the quantity of available contracts will be published by the government as soon as possible for business planning and viability.

The Government has reiterated its commitment to working closely with industry and other stakeholders to finalise details of the GSP contracts, the allocation method, and scheme administration. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Revenue Support Bill was announced during the King's Speech on 17 July 2024 and the government has confirmed that its aim is to have all required legislation for the revenue certainty mechanism in place by the end of 2026, allowing GSP-backed contracts to be awarded as soon as possible.

The race for cleaner, greener fuels is accelerating, with a handful of companies leading the charge in advanced biofuels. Whether it’s aviation fuel made from algae, synthetic diesel from agricultural waste, or jet fuel created using captured CO₂, these innovations are already transitioning from the lab to real-world applications.

With governments setting aggressive carbon reduction targets and industries seeking low-carbon alternatives, these companies are at the forefront of the biofuel revolution. Let’s take a closer look at who’s leading the advanced biofuel industry.

The Big Names: Industry Giants Leading the Advanced Biofuel Industry

As demand for sustainable energy solutions rises, a few key industry leaders are taking charge in the biofuels revolution. These companies are not only developing cutting-edge technologies to produce cleaner fuels but are also securing major investments, partnerships, and policy backing to scale their impact globally.

Neste – The Global Biofuel Powerhouse

Headquarters: Finland

Key Focus: Renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

What Neste is Known For: Neste is the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel, transforming waste fats, oils, and residues into high-performance biofuels. Its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been adopted by major airlines like Lufthansa and KLM, reducing emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel. Neste has aggressively expanded its refining capacity, including sites in Singapore and the Netherlands.

Why We Think They’ll Succeed: With a robust supply chain, a strong regulatory push for SAF, and long-term partnerships with airlines and logistics companies, Neste is well-positioned for growth. The company’s commitment to innovation keeps it ahead of competitors in the renewable fuel sector.

Successes to Date: Neste’s renewable diesel is already in commercial use, and the company has secured major contracts with fuel distributors and airlines. It is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Helsinki under the ticker NESTE.HE. More on Neste’s stock.

Gevo – A Leader in Net-Zero Fuels

Headquarters: USA

Key Focus: Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel, renewable gasoline & diesel

What Gevo is Known For: Gevo specializes in creating low-carbon fuels for aviation and road transport using fermentation technology. By converting industrial waste and biomass into biofuels, Gevo’s sustainable aviation fuel has been approved for commercial flights. Their Net-Zero 1 plant in South Dakota aims to produce fuel with minimal carbon intensity, setting a new benchmark for the industry.

Why We Think They’ll Succeed: Gevo has positioned itself as a leader in net-zero fuels through its proprietary technology and partnerships with major airlines and fuel distributors. Its ATJ fuel is already in demand, and government incentives for sustainable fuels provide additional tailwinds.

With pilot projects already underway, Synhelion’s technology could revolutionize how we produce liquid fuels in the future.

These startups may be small, but their impact is anything but. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and sustainable feedstocks, they’re proving that clean energy solutions don’t have to be decades away—they’re happening now. As funding increases and commercial projects take shape, these innovators could become the next big players in the biofuel industry, redefining how we power transportation in the years to come.

Policy & Market Influence: The Role of Governments and Investors in the Advanced Biofuels Industry

While companies drive innovation, policy support, and investment incentives play a crucial role in shaping the biofuel industry’s growth. Key global initiatives include:

EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED II): Mandates increased use of biofuels in transport.

U.S. Inflation Reduction Act: Offers tax credits and subsidies for sustainable fuel production.

Corporate & Venture Capital Investments: Billions are being poured into biofuels as part of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) strategies.

Governments and businesses alike recognize that advanced biofuels are among the most viable solutions for decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and heavy-duty transport.

What’s Next? The Road Ahead for Advanced Biofuels

The future of advanced biofuels depends on technological breakthroughs, cost reductions, and continued policy support. While challenges like feedstock availability and high production costs remain, the momentum is undeniable.

With industry leaders investing heavily, innovative startups disrupting the market, and global policies supporting clean energy, advanced biofuels are poised to become a mainstream alternative to fossil fuels in the coming decades.

Will they scale fast enough to meet climate goals? That remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: the future of fuel is getting greener.

Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.","Readers,

Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.

Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.

We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.

We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.

One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.

Help us save her.

A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.

Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.

Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.

We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.

Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.

In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and lightning fast website you deserve.

Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.

We can save America together.

The Asia-Pacific region's SAF production capacity is set to reach 3.5 million metric tons per year (77,671 barrels per day) by end-2025, forecasts from Argus Consulting showed, versus 1.24 million metric tons in 2024.
These requirements are expected to lift SAF demand from these countries to about 14 percent of their production capacity by 2026, Reuters calculations based on trade data showed.
IATA said one million metric tons of SAF was produced globally in 2024, below forecasts of 1.5 million metric tons, and described production as disappointingly slow.
But Neste, which expects global demand to hit at least seven million metric tons in 2030, and newcomer Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres remain upbeat about growth prospects.","SINGAPORE -- Asia's ability to supply sustainable aviation fuel will outpace regional demand this year and next as more production comes online, increasing exports and potentially lowering prices for the fuel, oil executives and analysts said.

Planned SAF production could take a hit if regional demand remains tepid and prices fall below production costs, industry sources say, though Asia's increased capacity is good news for airlines that have been complaining SAF is too expensive and hard to source.

At least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production this year, targeting exports regionally and to Europe.

Unlike in Europe, where flights departing EU and UK airports must now use two percent SAF in their tanks, Asia's mandated demand remains low with compulsory use of the renewable fuel in some nations to start only later this decade.

Low consumption and a lack of policy guidance have led to delays of some SAF projects in China.

""Asian airlines are still more focused on ramping up flights and SAF is not a top priority given it is still costlier than jet fuel and airlines will make less profit,"" said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.

Aviation accounted for 2.5 percent of global carbon emissions in 2023. SAF, made from waste oil and biomass, is key toward reducing those emissions, but is costlier than conventional fuel and only accounted for 0.3 percent of global jet fuel production, global airlines body IATA said.

The Asia-Pacific region's SAF production capacity is set to reach 3.5 million metric tons per year (77,671 barrels per day) by end-2025, forecasts from Argus Consulting showed, versus 1.24 million metric tons in 2024.

However, the first compulsory use of SAF in Asia will not begin until 2026 when Singapore and Thailand enforce a one-percent mandate. These requirements are expected to lift SAF demand from these countries to about 14 percent of their production capacity by 2026, Reuters calculations based on trade data showed.

Anticipated production capacity does not mean that much SAF will actually be produced given an industry focus on profitability and actual demand.

IATA said one million metric tons of SAF was produced globally in 2024, below forecasts of 1.5 million metric tons, and described production as disappointingly slow.

Recent project delays point to a very real risk that SAF penetration may actually begin to fall even as demand grows, said Ellis Taylor of aviation analytics firm Cirium.

South Korea's one-percent SAF use will start in 2027, and Japan has a 10-percent mandate by 2030.

""Demand in Asia is expected to lag behind supply due to the absence of uniform policies and mandates across the region,"" said Lamberto Gaggiotti, the head of biofuels firm Apical's green energy business.

Voluntary use

Outside of government mandates, some Asian airlines are voluntarily using SAF to boost their green credentials among customers and as part of industry sustainability commitments.

The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, which counts many Asian flag carriers as members, has a target of five-percent SAF usage by 2030.

Many Asian airlines do not disclose SAF consumption.

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) said it used more than 6,800 metric tons of SAF in 2024, but did not provide a forecast for 2025.

Air New Zealand (AIR.NZ) expects to use 1.6 percent SAF in the financial year ending in June, up from 0.4 percent a year earlier, but last year halved its SAF target to 10 percent by 2030 from 20 percent, citing its affordability and availability.

Export plans

Japanese refiner Cosmo Energy (5021.T) will produce SAF from April. Investments in Southeast Asia this year have totalled more than $500 million, with Thailand's PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC.BK) having started its plant and Bangchak Petroleum (BCP.BK) to follow in the second quarter.

Asia exported more than 370,000 metric tons of SAF in 2024, ship tracking data from Kpler showed, mostly from Neste's (NESTE.HE) Singapore plant, the world's largest.

""As the SAF market develops, it is to be expected that there will be gaps between where it is produced and where there is demand,"" IATA's director of energy transition Hemant Mistry said.

Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical (6505.TW) plans to produce up to 6,000 metric tons SAF for local airlines this year, its spokesperson KY Lin said, down from an earlier target of up to 10,000 metric tons in 2025.

The cost of producing SAF from used cooking oil is estimated at $500 to $600 per ton, including pre-treatment costs, he said, compared with SAF spot prices at around $1,700 per ton in Asia, according to industry sources.

With slower demand, Lauren Moffitt, head of Asia biofuels pricing at Argus, said Asia is likely to remain a net SAF exporter through 2026 with oversupply to pressure prices.

The price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel narrowed from nearly three times last year to 2.4 times this year on a free on board (FOB) Singapore basis, Argus data showed.

But Neste, which expects global demand to hit at least seven million metric tons in 2030, and newcomer Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres remain upbeat about growth prospects.

EcoCeres will bring online its 420,000 metric tons per year (tpy) SAF and biodiesel production unit in Johor, Malaysia, by the fourth quarter, CEO Matti Lievonen said, bringing the firm's total capacity to 770,000 tpy along with an existing plant in Jiangsu, China, as it eyes exports.

""While this new production further strengthens our supply to Europe, we are also exploring global opportunities such as Japan, Korea, Australia, China, and North America, all of which represent significant potential for growth.""",https://static.tuoitrenews.vn/ttnew/r/2025/03/17/rd2z34vrbzlddjwcviigv33jsy-1742194853.jpg,N,,2025-03-17 04:50:37.169067

Deutsche Airline startet City-Verbindungen ab Flughafen Frankfurt

Von: Thomas Peters

Condor fliegt vom Flughafen Frankfurt aus wieder Berlin und Hamburg an. Mit modernsten Fliegern soll dabei ordentlich Kraftstoff gespart werden.

Frankfurt – Von Frankfurt nach Berlin in einer Stunde. Die Condor City-Verbindung soll es möglich machen. Die Airline startet ab März mit Flügen vom Flughafen Frankfurt aus zum Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg (BER) und auch zum Flughafen Hamburg (HAM). Dabei sollen modernste Flugzeuge zum Einsatz kommen.

In einer Pressemitteilung spricht Condor von einem kleinen Stück Firmengeschichte. Nach vielen Jahren bietet die Airline wieder Inlandsflüge in Deutschland an. Mit den sogenannten City-Verbindungen will das Luftfahrtunternehmen Frankfurt mit Berlin und Hamburg per Flieger verbinden. Condor hat kürzlich zudem eine Erweiterung des Streckennetzes für den Sommer 2025 angekündigt.

Erste Flüge von Flughafen Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg gestartet

Der erste Linienflug seit langem zwischen Frankfurt und Berlin startete am 1. März um 10.30 Uhr mit der Flugnummer DE409. Eine Viertelstunde später hob der Flug DE4179 nach Hamburg ab. Seit dem 2. März verbindet Condor die Städte Hamburg und Berlin mit Frankfurt zweimal täglich, jeweils morgens und abends.

„Mit unseren City-Verbindungen passen wir unseren Flugplan an die Bedürfnisse unserer Gäste an“, sagt Peter Gerber, CEO Condor. Berlin und Hamburg seien sowohl privat als auch geschäftlich für viele Passagiere von Interesse und beliebte Reiseziele. Die Flüge werden mit einer Zwei-Klassen-Konfiguration angeboten: Economy und Business-Class.

Moderne Flugzeuge von Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg sollen Treibstoff sparen

Laut Condor kommen bei den Flügen die werksneuen Flugzeugtypen Airbus A320neo und A321neo zum Einsatz. Diese sollen über modernste Triebwerke vom Hersteller Pratt & Whitney verfügen und 20 Prozent weniger Treibstoff verbrauchen. Sie werden mit Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) betrieben, ein nachhaltig hergestellter Treibstoff aus nichtfossilen Rohstoffen.

Die neuen Flugzeuge sparen laut Condor 20 Prozent CO₂-Emissionen ein und sollen außerdem 50 Prozent leiser sein. Der Kerosinverbrauch pro Passagier liege an Bord einer A320neo bei umgerechnet 1,9 Litern auf 100 Kilometern.",https://www.fnp.de/assets/images/36/376/36376835-ein-condor-airbus-im-landeanflug-am-flughafen-frankfurt-3bfe.jpg,N,,2025-03-17 04:50:58.337207

“JFK has been JetBlue’s home for 25 years, and our operations here should set the standard we envision for our entire network,” said Ursula Hurley, Chief Financial Officer, JetBlue. “Thank you to the many teams and partners who have helped make this possible. Incorporating SAF into our flights is an important lever in decarbonising the aviation industry and expanding its availability to our Northeast airports is a big step.”

To ensure a consistent supply of SAF, Diamond Green Diesel – a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and Darling Ingredients affiliate – produces the fuel and Valero then blends it with conventional jet fuel to create blended SAF. The blended SAF is then delivered by World Fuel via existing jet fuel distribution infrastructure where it is claimed by JetBlue for use in their fleet at JFK Airport. Blended SAF is a drop-in product for existing aircraft and infrastructure and can lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to approximately 80%, when compared to current conventional jet fuel.

“Working with JetBlue and Valero to bring blended SAF to one of our largest airport locations supports our ambition at World Fuel to grow a consistent supply network for SAF on the U.S. East Coast,” said Brad Hurwitz, Senior Vice President, Supply and Trading, World Fuel Services. “This collaboration enhances our ability to provide regular Sustainable Aviation Fuel and improves access to lower carbon fuels for our aviation customers.”

The delivery of SAF to the New York region was first explored in a 2021 study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National Renewable Energy Lab, evaluating the ways in which SAF could be transported to Port Authority airports using existing fuelling infrastructure. The study found that SAF could be successfully delivered to Port Authority airports, paving the way for airline partners to fuel an aircraft with SAF at LaGuardia Airport successfully in June 2022 and for JFK Airport to welcome the world’s first transatlantic flight fuelled by SAF in November 2023.

“We are proud to collaborate with JetBlue on the use of SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “As the international gateway to the US, JFK is leading by example through our work on safe SAF delivery to our regional airports and promoting sustainable air travel. We look forward to facilitating more SAF operations across our airport system.”

Rick Cotton, Port Authority Executive Director, commented: “The Port Authority looks forward to continue working with our partners as we all strive toward more environmentally friendly air travel. Our work testing the safe delivery of SAF to our airports was a key first step demonstrating the possibility of more sustainable airport operations. As our agency works to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we hope more business partners like JetBlue will want to work together to advance our mutual sustainability goals while delivering a world-class air travel experience.”

Much like traditional petroleum refineries, green refineries integrate various processes and technologies.
With coordinated efforts under the guidance of such an apex body, Pakistan can successfully develop a nascent green refining industry.
The world is on the brink of a green refining boom, similar to the telecom boom.
Pakistani political leadership and policymakers should seriously explore all possibilities to facilitate the development of an indigenous green refining industry.","MELBOURNE:

Pakistan's oil and chemical sectors are at a critical juncture. With increasing imports of petroleum products and petrochemicals and the global shift towards green fuels and chemicals, the country, though confronted with enormous challenges, has a unique opportunity to capitalise on.

By adopting a green refinery industrial base, Pakistan could not only meet its national demand but also build the capacity to export green oil and chemicals, turning a challenging situation into a strategic advantage.

Pakistan does not have an extensive petrochemical industry compared to many developed countries. This presents a unique opportunity to bypass traditional petrochemical infrastructure, similar to how mobile phone technology leapfrogged landlines. Transitioning to green refineries also promises to align with global environmental standards, ensuring a cleaner and more efficient energy future.

Green refineries are facilities that use green energy to process crops, wastes, air, and water to produce a diverse array of oils, chemicals and fertiliser products. Much like traditional petroleum refineries, green refineries integrate various processes and technologies. Bioethanol plants are the most well-known example of green refineries, albeit now considered the older generation of such facilities.

Many green refinery projects are currently at various stages of development, with a strong global focus on producing ammonia, methanol, aviation fuel, and diesel. Numerous refineries are expected to become operational by the end of the decade, with some larger projects anticipated to have an annual production capacity of up to one million tonnes.

Recent advancements in green refining technologies in Australia have shown the production of plastics from carbon dioxide using microbes, which not only mitigates climate change but also has the potential to reverse it. This technology also produces dimethyl ether, a viable replacement for natural gas. Various trials of dimethyl ether usage have already been conducted worldwide, from powering natural gas grids to vehicles.

As the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change, carbon dioxide utilisation technology is expected to emerge as a pivotal solution, effectively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reducing greenhouse gas concentrations.

These developments demonstrate a global focus on establishing green refineries, with continuous research advancing the technology. In this context, there is already a list of ideal candidates for Pakistan, including aviation fuel, ammonia, dimethyl ether, methanol, acetic acid, diesel, and even plastics.

A sustainable aviation fuel refinery requires water and crops or crop waste as inputs. The land supplying these inputs should be fertile enough to yield two or three crops a year or provide a continuous waste supply to ensure the refinery's smooth operation.

The energy requirements are met within the refinery itself. For a green ammonia refinery, the input feeds are water and air, providing hydrogen and nitrogen, respectively, and are powered by green energy sources such as solar or wind. Therefore, a green ammonia refinery requires land suitable for solar or wind energy, or it should be powered by a hydropower station.

While green ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel refineries can be scaled up to produce a million tonnes or more, newer technologies like green plastics are currently suitable for smaller-scale production. However, as commercial plants come into operation worldwide, these technologies are expected to become suitable for large-scale production in the future.

To embark on this journey, policymakers in Pakistan need to pay attention to two critical issues: machinery and the availability of qualified and competent human resources. The country lacks not only the capacity to produce the machinery needed for green refineries but also the HR base.

Therefore, foreign partnerships will be essential, at least for the initial projects. Europe, China, and North America are the leading technology providers for the current generation of green refineries.

Regarding developing a skilled workforce, the existing local workforce with relevant experience can upgrade their expertise to support the initial green refineries. Simultaneously, universities, in collaboration with overseas institutions, can develop courses and training programmes to educate the next generation of the workforce locally. Given the continuous technological advancements in this field, partnering with countries leading in research and development to utilise the best technologies would be highly beneficial. Building research collaborations between local and foreign research institutions will be essential.

Financing green refinery projects is generally more accessible than financing traditional fossil fuel projects. This is due to several factors, including global interest, investment trends, governmental incentives, private sector interests, green bonds, international grants and aid, and carbon credits.

Ideally, Pakistan needs a dedicated apex body solely focused on the ""green refining industry."" Such an autonomous but accountable body should then, in consultation with multiple stakeholders, develop a 10-year roadmap for the adoption and development of green refining infrastructure in the country.

With coordinated efforts under the guidance of such an apex body, Pakistan can successfully develop a nascent green refining industry.

The world is on the brink of a green refining boom, similar to the telecom boom. Pakistani political leadership and policymakers should seriously explore all possibilities to facilitate the development of an indigenous green refining industry.

This would be one of the most significant achievements in the goal of producing critical products indigenously, ensuring energy security, employment-oriented economic growth, and environmental sustainability for Pakistan.

Pilatus PC 12 Pro: Modernes Cockpit mit Garmin G3000

Das Herzstück der PC-12 PRO ist das neu gestaltete Cockpit, das auf dem Garmin G3000 Prime Avioniksystem basiert. Drei hochauflösende 14-Zoll-Touchscreens und zwei kleinere 7-Zoll-Displays bieten den Piloten eine intuitive Steuerung.

Laut «Fliegermagazin» ermöglicht ein Cursor Control Device präzise Navigation ohne direkten Kontakt mit den Bildschirmen. Ergonomisch orientiert sich das Cockpit an dem Businessjet PC-24, was die Bedienung erleichtert.

Pilatus hat zudem den Fensterrahmen des Direct Vision Cockpits entfernt, um die Sicht nach aussen zu verbessern. «SkyNews» hebt hervor, dass die neue Autothrottle-Technologie den Leistungsoutput optimiert und den Treibstoffverbrauch reduziert.

Sicherheitsfunktionen für maximale Zuverlässigkeit

Ein Highlight der Pilatus PC-12 PRO ist das serienmässige Autoland-System ab 2026: Dieses System kann im Notfall das Flugzeug eigenständig landen.Ausserdem berücksichtigt es dabei Wetterbedingungen sowie die beste Landemöglichkeit.

Ergänzt wird es durch Smart Glide, das bei Triebwerksausfällen automatisch eine optimale Gleitflugroute berechnet. Zusätzlich integriert Pilatus ein verbessertes Electronic Stability & Protection-System (ESP).

Auch ein optimiertes Stall Warning & Protection-System wurde verbaut, um Strömungsabrisse zu verhindern. Wie «AeroTelegraph» berichtet, sorgt eine grössere Wetterradar-Antenne für bessere situative Wahrnehmung.

Kabine mit futuristischem Design

Die Kabine der PC-12 PRO wurde komplett überarbeitet. Neue Einbaumöbel schaffen zusätzlichen Stauraum, während moderne Materialien und Designs den technologischen Fortschritt des Flugzeugs widerspiegeln.

The report, produced by ‘Airports of Tomorrow’, a WEF initiative bringing together leaders from across the aviation industry, says industry stakeholders are increasingly looking to advance aviation decarbonisation activity in tandem with boosting growth post-Covid-19, posing challenges to progress on sustainability.

The actions that industry and governments across the world take this year will be vital to ensure the aviation sector remains on the right flight path to meet internationally agreed targets, including reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5 per cent by 2030 and attaining net-zero international aviation by 2050, according to the report.

Alignment of SAF policies across regions and longevity of subsidies are crucial for encouraging investment and ensuring consistent SAF adoption across regions. In 2024, Asia Pacific emerged as a key market: several countries introduced supportive policies, while China is expected to unveil detailed SAF policies this year.

In Pakistan, the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank group is providing up to $35 million in equity and debt financing to SAFCO Venture Holdings Ltd (SAFCO Ventures) to help establish Pakistan’s first greenfield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility, which will convert thousands of tonnes of used cooking oil and other waste oils into aviation fuel, helping to reduce global emissions.

The WEF report says the availability and cost of SAF are the biggest challenges for aviation decarbonisation in 2025. Airlines need to commit to long-term SAF offtake agreements, but de-risking mechanisms are vital as the risks of advanced SAF production technologies and varying regional policies pose significant hurdles.

More corporate involvement and favourable policies are essential to attract capital and support SAF projects globally.

Geopolitics is the top non-sustainability challenge affecting progress on decarbonising aviation. The withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement in early 2025 and the “America First” trade policy are being closely monitored by the aviation community, as increasing protectionism and tariffs pose significant risks.

Geopolitical tensions are destabilising feedstock exports and fuelling domestic energy security concerns. International scrutiny on fairness and competitiveness adds to the complex dynamics at play, report fears.

As aviation’s reliance on SAF increases, scrutiny of the sustainability credentials of feedstocks will intensify.

Concerns around land-use change, deforestation, poor agricultural practices, food security and biodiversity impacts have led to regulatory restrictions and bans on certain biofuels.

Improved transparency, research, and consistent sustainability standards are essential to address these risks and support the development of alternative SAF production pathways.

The report says despite easing inflationary pressures and encouraging profitability figures, the global economic outlook remains a concern for aviation executives, particularly in emerging markets. Rising costs in labour, supply chain bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty are impacting profitability and affecting the sector’s focus on the net-zero agenda.

Fostering a circular economy can help Pakistan cope with economic, environmental, and social crises, economic nationalists said.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, they highlighted the need to create a climate in which businesses can prosper and the national economy can grow by leaps and bounds.

Developed and many developing countries are shifting from a linear to a circular economy for better opportunities.

They said the circular economy presents a tremendous opportunity for large-scale manufacturing job creation in Pakistan through waste valorisation. For instance, the widespread burning of crop residues, which annually poses severe environmental hazards, can be transformed into an asset by converting this waste into high-value fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel or into valuable chemicals like acids. Establishing new facilities for this purpose would generate numerous onsite jobs, including skilled roles for technicians, process engineers, and logistics specialists to manage biomass collection. Indirect job creation would span supply chain management, transport logistics, storage solutions, and distribution networks, alongside the development of supportive industries like equipment manufacturing, maintenance, and renewable energy.

Moreover, additional roles in research, development, and innovation would further expand employment opportunities.

They said the concept of a circular economy represents a transformative shift from traditional linear economic systems, which are characterised by the extraction of raw materials, production of goods, and disposal of waste.

In a circular economy, raw materials such as metals and oil are utilised to manufacture products like steel, car engines, and plastic bottles. At the end of their lifecycle, these products are recycled into new ones, thereby minimising the need for the continuous extraction of new resources and significantly reducing waste. This sustainable approach not only mitigates environmental impact but also enhances resource efficiency.

In contrast, the prevailing linear economic model, widely implemented across global economies, perpetuates a cycle of resource extraction, production, and disposal, leading to increased waste and the continuous need for new material extraction. The transition to a circular economy is imperative to address growing environmental challenges and foster a more sustainable and resilient economic system.

Eminent energy scientist and expert in a circular economy, Dr Adeel Ghayur, said, ""Pakistan can strategically leverage the circular economy to address pressing environmental, economic, and social challenges through a multi-sectoral, policy-driven approach spearheaded by experts and technocrats. A key focus should be on sector-specific initiatives that deliver the greatest value for sustainable development, particularly in agriculture, textiles, construction, petrochemicals, and renewable energy.""

He said that by integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and accessing global green financing mechanisms, Pakistan can accelerate its transition to a circular economy and maximise its potential benefits.

Industry 4.0 technologies refer to the fourth industrial revolution, characterised by the integration of advanced technologies such as 3D printing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analytics, aimed at creating smart, automated, and interconnected manufacturing systems.

Additionally, establishing university degrees in a circular economy and a centre of excellence can meet the global demand for experts, positioning Pakistan as a leader.

He said the circular economy will address Pakistan's waste management challenges, reduce import dependency, and foster manufacturing job creation while bolstering energy and food security. By prioritising import-intensive products, Pakistan can gradually achieve self-sufficiency in these areas. Focusing on specific industries has the potential to establish Pakistan at the forefront of key sectors, such as solar panel recycling. Furthermore, Pakistan can unlock revenue generation from waste streams that currently pose significant environmental threats, such as crop residues. These residues can be converted into fuels like sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel, exemplifying the core principle of a circular economytransforming waste into value.

He said the transition to a circular economy begins with the formulation of a comprehensive national strategy, integrating incentives, standards, regulatory frameworks, and public-private partnerships. Priority initiatives should include waste management systems, tax incentives, and support for innovation hubs that drive recycling and remanufacturing. Significant sectors in this transition include petrochemicals, plastics, water, renewable energy, and construction materials.

He said to fully realise this potential, it is essential to streamline policies and channel investments into renewable and green technologies, which are crucial for achieving economic self-reliance. These efforts, combined with consistent monitoring and evaluation, will promote long-term economic and environmental resilience for Pakistan's economy.

Climate Action Centre (CAC) Director Yasir Hussain said the circular economy is part of the emerging green economy. The circular economy is the circulation of materials as they move from industry to industry and product to product, minimising the production of waste, pollution, and carbon emissions while protecting and regenerating nature.

He said that in Pakistan, on the one hand, environmental laws restricting the dumping or release of harmful materials are not being implemented. On the other hand, there is circulation and reuse of material waste in industrial processes and society, but generally at a low-value level.

He said value addition requires the recovery of high-value molecules and substances, which necessitates recent technologies, redesigning, and eliminating materials beyond the lifecycle of products in society.",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/circular-economy1742087588-0/circular-economy1742087588-0.jpeg,N,,2025-03-16 03:51:26.722509

Yael Katzwer How have you seen the attitude towards sustainability and saf change in the aviation industry in recent years?
Yael Katzwer Yeah, so IATA has set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net zero by 2050 based on where we are now.
So in developing a mandate, you need to develop it in such a way that it doesn’t interfere with a voluntary market, that it coexist with the voluntary market.
Yael Katzwer All right.","Jeff Lee

Hello and welcome to this episode of cargo facts connect, the podcast of cargo facts, the newsletter of record for the air cargo and freighter aircraft industries for over 40 years. I’m Jeff Lee, editor of cargo facts and it’s Friday, the 14th of March. Over the past two years, we’ve seen SAF initiatives gaining momentum as companies continue to try and make aviation more sustainable. My colleague, deputy editor Yael Katzwer, recently spoke with Jeroen van Heiningen, founder and managing director of carbon insetting company 123Carbon, to discuss how 123Carbon works with IATA to make its platform interoperable with the IATA SAF registry that will launch next month..

Yael Katzwer

Tell me about 123, carbon and what you do.

Jeroen van Heiningen

So I have a background in sustainable transportation for over about 18 years after my career at Accenture, and we noticed that book and claim as a methodology was one of the most efficient ways to decarbonize transportation. So we developed into that, and it’s especially in aviation, is required that we have book and claim in place to correctly allocate saf. So in 2019 I initiated the development of a new platform that allows the creation, the allocation and the verification of among saf but also other types of low carbon transportation, so that fuel suppliers and carriers could create certificates that they could allocate to their cargo owners and forwarders to in order to basically share the costs of decarbonization and also share the the benefits, the carbon reductions. So we are, we are an independent platform that operates across all modalities, and that has transparency and integrity as a key and they we basically offer a registry for everyone, but also a branded platform for airlines and other carriers to interact directly with their customer with so we’re very much focused and specialized in in book and claim.

Yael Katzwer

And what are environmental attribute certificates and how exactly do they work?

Jeroen van Heiningen

So in principle, environmental attribute certificates are the carbon reductions that have been realized, or the carbon equivalent reductions that have been realized through the use of a low carbon technology, which could be saf, it could be bio methanol, it could be electrification, it could be hydrogen, anything that provides a, let’s say, a discount or an advantage compared to a certain baseline. We have that verified by external parties, we log all the data surrounding that project. So where was it uplifted? What were the emission factors used? Was it? What kind of data was it? How was it verified, and that in an entire data package is through a certificate sent to a customer so that he fully understands what he is procuring. As you might be aware in book and claim, we separate the physical stuff from the environmental attributes. So the physical stuff goes into an airport, for instance, and then the carbon reductions are allocated to airlines and to freight forwarders and cargo owner. So you need a water tight system to make sure that there’s no double issuance, double claiming or double selling. And that’s what we that’s what we provide as an independent platform.

Yael Katzwer

And I know you guys are working on interoperability with I add a staff registry partially to, you know, reduce redundancies and things like that. As you were just saying, you don’t want someone double claiming, even accidentally. So do you have interoperability with any other registries at the moment?

Jeroen van Heiningen

I think this is a first in the market. There’s we are part of an ecosystem of of book and claim specialist government or organized by NGOs, like like RSB or especially smart freight center. We have, we’re in part of the committee, committees that deal with registry interoperability. However, we also agreed that at some point you just need to start doing it. And and we were spending quite some time on discussing how we want to do it, how we want to pick it up. As an industry, everyone has their own innovative motivation, so together with IATA, who said, Well, I think we’re advanced enough. Let’s just make this happen. And then also invites, because the publication was also an invitation to other industries to join that and take a pragmatic, bilateral approach to to registry interoperability. And this is just the first step, but obviously we expect to to announce more of these partnerships, not only in in aviation, but as we said, we are a multi modal player. So for us, it makes sense to to be aware of the environment of registries out there. There’s not, not a whole lot, apart from aviation, but potentially they will come.

Yael Katzwer

You said, this is a first step. What are some of the other steps that you foresee down the line?

Jeroen van Heiningen

Yes, so registry interoperability can be quite a few things. It’s the way that registries communicate, and they can communicate about a lot of things. The first step we do with within IATA, and that’s the scope, what we’re doing now is, as you said, to avoid the redundancies and the double issuance, so to make sure that fuel is not registered on a registry twice with that immediately would lead to double counting. Now the. Also means that we are aligning the data models that we are using. We’re using the same taxonomy and using the same wording. So we’re also standardizing the data structure that we are dealing with in the second phase, and then we’re also developing a protocol. If we find these redundancies, what do we do? Who gets priority? Who needs to back off? Things like that are being mentioned there. However, you can also argue that in a later phase that some people are transacting on one registry and the other ones are transacting on another, so that it would make sense also to create some kind of transfer between the registries, where maybe a fuel supplier would use registry A, but an airline would look at it from registry B, and then they would ask, please, can you transfer from register one to registry B so that I can continue to do to to proceed with, with my customers. That’s not the part of the scope of this first phase with IATA. But you can imagine that that that is where potentially they they will go. Another element is also obviously that book and claim is primarily for the voluntary market. You can also imagine that in technical interactions with the mandated market systems that are there are also that to avoid that things are correctly divided between a voluntary and a mandated market. So I think there are different ways that registries or systems need to be integrated, but also standardized. So integration is one, but also standardization in the interpretation. There’s a lot of work to be done on that space as well. And then over seeding that all, if I this is, allow me over seeding that all is also a movement from where you see airlines now all having individual book and claim methodologies, which all differ a little bit and all have different, slightly different certificate than a slightly different approach, and also deliver different levels of transparency. That this the standardization of the registries is also a pulling mechanism to move the airlines from using their own methodologies or Excel based and on board onto a registry, because obviously we can check between the registries. But there are also airlines, obviously out there, the majority that run their own programs on Excel and have them verified by their own auditors. And this is what we’re hoping to achieve with this movement.

Yael Katzwer

How have you seen the attitude towards sustainability and saf change in the aviation industry in recent years?

Jeroen van Heiningen

I think what you do see happening is that there are shifts in interpretation on sustainability, and there will always be When, when, let me give you an example, maybe beyond soft, but when, when biofuels was first introduced, we were very happy, and this was first gen bio fuels. Now, at the moment, everyone’s looking at advanced bio fuels, and in a few years time, there’s even, especially a marine we’re looking to go beyond bio fuels, and we need to move into E fuels or even zero emission and hydrogen electrification. So we will, I think the society as a whole has always demonstrated that it keeps raising the bar on what it perceives as sustainable, and that definition there will become a time where maybe some of electricity will not be seen as sustainable because we keep on shifting, shifting that, raising that bar. And therefore where I think as soon as long as those differentiations are there and people want to be more sustainable than someone else, then I would imagine that that systems like book and claim will be there to allocate the most greenest of molecules, to those customers that are willing to pay. If that, if that answers your question.

Yael Katzwer

Yeah, so IATA has set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net zero by 2050 based on where we are now. Do you believe we can reach that goal by 2050?

Jeroen van Heiningen

We must say that as a whole, we have not been very well positioned to achieve the tar any targets on this purpose that we’ve set and and as you are well also, geopolitical movements are infecting, affecting The whether or not we can use these targets, but it’s not on the political side. It also has to do with the companies that are willing to invest in this. So I don’t think we ever should say the the politics should make this happen, or should we whatever? No, it’s also society as a whole that needs to move. It’s not just the mandates or whatever that needs to bring this together is is to come. Communicating barrels of the voluntary market and the mandated market, and if they can work together, there’s a lot we can do. Unfortunately, we also see that, if you look at saf a lot of production has been announced, and not all of that production is, in the end, also hitting the market, which is obviously unfortunate. But there’s for us as a registry. Obviously, we are not involved basically in the discussion on the type of fuels or whatever. We take the reductions that the fuel bring and create our certificates based on that through a globally approved methodology, and we are not, let’s say, a body that sets the targets or sets the methodology that should be done through stakeholder dialog. We’re here to facilitate the process, but either I think, I think there, there, it will flow up and down, as will the pricing. But if you look at the general trend, I think it’s non reversible and and we also come into that a little bit. We also need institutes like sbti that set the science base target, if that set the targets for these corporates, and they make the fortune 500 move, and they need to start moving them towards investing in their supply chain, so moving them a little bit away from maybe the planting trees, but investing in their own supply chains, paying the actual abatement costs that it takes to decarbonize supply chain, because that’s what it’s all about. If I can plant a tree for one euro, why would I spend 300 euro on soft if it has the same value? So it needs to make be made clear that if you want to achieve certain targets, and we want those companies to invest in supply chains, we need to facilitate that process. Because you can imagine, corporates will always try to find the most cost efficient way to achieve their targets while still maintaining the approval from the sbti. So there’s also, there’s also major role there, where, where do we put the bar?

Yael Katzwer

And you mentioned there’s obviously the voluntary component and then the regulatory component. What more do you think should be done or could be done in terms of regulations to move this along? What are you hoping to see?

Jeroen van Heiningen

Yeah, no, this is, this is the most fundamental question. I think under under SAF, we need to be aware that you don’t solve everything with mandates. Mandates and the voluntary markets are communicating barrels that need to coexist. So the way I see it is that mandate is for basically, for the laggers is to make sure that the entire industry is moving, and then the voluntary part is so that corporates, or anyone that wants to achieve their target faster, or want to do more that they can do that. So if, if all the market was a mandate, then why would companies like like Microsoft still invest they wouldn’t, because it would only regulate it for them. So we need them. We need the mandated market to shift up and raise the bar. And then there will be companies like the Amazon or the Microsoft that want to do more, and they need food access to the voluntary markets to make that to make that happen. So in developing a mandate, you need to develop it in such a way that it doesn’t interfere with a voluntary market, that it coexist with the voluntary market. And and a lot of players are not that aware. The mandated markets are just looking at the mandates to solve everything. The voluntary markets look at the voluntary markets do everything, and we need to look more at that cross field, where they do Where did the two meet, and how can they, how can they coexist? That will be my goal going forward, to see that improving. For us as a positioning we position yourself multi modal, which is not typically the discussion of book and claim, but if you look obviously at the cargo owners or the freight forwarders, they are dealing with multi modality. So that’s why we position this as a multi modal play, to make sure that a big freight forwarder or a cargo owner can absorb certificates from air, road, marine and rail in a constant, standardized approach, and then introduce them into their infantry. So for us, it’s also important that we standardize across the modalities, so that’s something that fits in aviation. Also works in Marine, and that’s at the moment, not the case. The two have a different view on mandates, which is strange, because as an end user, if I’m buying a certificate, there will be other rules. For air, then it will be for real, whereas the company would say, these are all my emissions. So we are also a strong advocate of that multi modal view to solve it, and not just the silo view of within within saf.

PetroVietnam Power Corporation has also established an MoU with GE Vernova for the procurement of equipment and services for gas-fired power plants.

Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) has formalized an MoU with three leading U.S. ethanol suppliers – U.S. Grains Council, Renewable Fuels Association, and Growth Energy – to enhance biofuel cooperation.

Additionally, Petrolimex has partnered with Marquis Energy through another MoU to facilitate transactions and imports of biofuels. This collaboration holds particular significance as Vietnam accelerates efforts to expand biofuel adoption.

Beyond these agreements, negotiations are ongoing for additional deals, with an estimated total value of $36 billion in the near future.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Minister Dien emphasized the strong and growing relationship between Vietnam and the U.S. Over the past 30 years of diplomatic ties, a decade of comprehensive partnership, and two years of comprehensive strategic partnership, bilateral relations have expanded across multiple sectors.

Economic, trade, and investment ties remain central to this relationship. In 2024, bilateral trade reached nearly $150 billion, marking a 20.5 percent increase from the previous year.

The U.S. has become Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner and a key export market while also emerging as a major supplier of machinery, technology, and energy products.

In terms of investment, the U.S. remains one of Vietnam’s leading investment partners, with most major American corporations having established a presence and successfully conducted business in Vietnam.

At the same time, Vietnamese enterprises are increasing their presence in the U.S. market. As of early 2025, more than 100 Vietnamese companies have registered for the Select USA 2025 event to explore investment opportunities in the U.S..

Minister Dien highlighted the immense potential for further cooperation, particularly in science and technology, innovation, research and development, semiconductor and artificial intelligence (AI) industries, renewable energy, financial services, biotechnology, and healthcare.

Vietnam seeks continued U.S. support in facilitating business cooperation and investment, particularly in high-tech and innovation-driven sectors, the official stated.

According to the ministry, from this year onward, Vietnam and the U.S. plan to implement a series of economic and trade agreements valued at approximately $90.3 billion. These agreements are expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in both countries.

A significant portion of this investment, around $50.15 billion, will be directed toward purchases of aircraft, aviation services, oil and gas exploration, and imports of refined petroleum products.",https://static.tuoitrenews.vn/ttnew/r/2025/03/15/bo-truong-dien-17419621836632059238552-1742031091.jpg,N,,2025-03-16 03:51:48.505662
