As part of its growing sustainability efforts, Hecksher is implementing a new way for companies to address the climate impact of air freight: Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc).

SAFc is an established market-based mechanism decoupling the environmental attribute of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from the physical product through a ‘book and claim’ system and has become an important tool to reduce the environmental impact of essential business travel and air freight.

SAF is made from certified sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other residual waste materials.

It has emerged as a trusted solution to decarbonize the aviation industry as it can reduce life cycle CO2e emissions by up to 80%, according to IATA.

Niklas Olsson, Group CEO, Hecksher says: “We’ve already taken significant steps to reduce emissions in sea freight. Purchasing SAFc for air freight supports the replacement of fossil kerosene and offers a readily implementable, transparent and scalable solution for corporates looking to address their Scope 3 emissions without having to change carriers, routes or operational setup.”

How it works

Hecksher calculates the customer’s air freight emissions

The customer selects a SAFc amount – matching all or part of their emissions

The SAFc represents a volume of physical SAF used to replace kerosene in commercial operations. Via book & claim Hecksher owns the exclusive rights to the end-user emission reduction, which is recorded on the SAFc registry

The SAFc registry publicly records all claimed emission reductions and only allows the issuance of SAFc where the physical SAF meets stringent quality controls such as third –party verification, therefore assuring full transparency and avoiding double issuance/ claiming

The customer receives a digital certificate that includes all the characteristics of the SAFc supporting the environmental claim

Patrik Westraeus, Head of Sustainability at Greencarrier Group, which includes Hecksher says: “We have found a cost-effective solution that allows us to offer SAF at purchase price.

“This means our customers can buy SAF at a lower cost compared to several other providers.”

Delivered in partnership with STX Group

The SAFc initiative is delivered in partnership with environmental commodities trader STX Group.

Fabian Roobeek, Managing Partner at STX Group says: “We congratulate Hecksher and Greencarrier on taking this important step by implementing SAFc.

“It’s encouraging to see the shift toward renewable fuels, and at STX we are proud to support such pioneers by providing market access and liquidity in SAFc”.",https://caasint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/09/Hecksher-launches-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Certificates-SAFc-for-air-freight.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:56:29.196404

The pair participated in the inaugural Flinchbaugh Forum at Kansas State University to honor Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh, a flamboyant agricultural economist known for his cigars and blunt speaking style.
The Barry Flinchbaugh Center for Ag and Food Policy was created to bring together policy and economic discussions around agriculture and rural America.
They called on current Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to consider putting together a commission that would look at a new direction for agriculture going into the next 20 years.
Back to Freedom to Farm, Torrey recalled how Flinchbaugh came out to Washington to talk to policy leaders trying to negotiate the bill.","MANHATTAN, Kan. (DTN) -- Former Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns voiced his concerns Sept. 26 about the soybean market, competition with Brazil and the need to continue building out the biofuels industry to support domestic markets.

""I feel very, very strongly that if you're going to have this kind of trade policy, you absolutely have to build a market and you get, you have to, you've got to get 1-million percent on board with doing everything you can to expand this biofuels industry,"" Johanns said.

Johanns led USDA from 2005 to 2007 under the George W. Bush administration when the ethanol industry was aggressively expanding under the Renewable Fuel Standard. Johanns said a similar injection of domestic investment is needed for the soybean industry with the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

The former secretary noted that 20 years ago, the U.S. didn't have the same international competition that the country now faces because of South America. He pointed to the fact China has yet to make any purchases of 2025-26 U.S. soybeans.

""I probably worry most about the soybean piece of our ag production, just because Brazil is not going away. They're going to keep building,"" Johanns said. He added, ""What does that tell me? Man, if I was in the secretary's office now, I'd be pounding the table to build out biofuels. Really, really focusing some real attention on aviation fuels.""

INAUGURAL FLINCHBAUGH FORUM

Johanns spoke on a panel with fellow former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a Kansas native. The pair participated in the inaugural Flinchbaugh Forum at Kansas State University to honor Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh, a flamboyant agricultural economist known for his cigars and blunt speaking style.

""I've had a wheelbarrow full of manure delivered to my office front door and I've been burned in effigy,"" Flinchbaugh once said to describe his popularity.

Flinchbaugh, who passed away in 2020, had been an adviser to secretaries of Agriculture and leaders on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. He had worked on farm bills going back to 1968 and had served at Kansas State University since 1971, where he had taught agricultural policy to approximately 4,100 students during that time.

The Barry Flinchbaugh Center for Ag and Food Policy was created to bring together policy and economic discussions around agriculture and rural America.

Glickman said Flinchbaugh was a driving force behind support for the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, a farm bill that attempted to reduce the reliance of farmers on farm programs. Then-President Bill Clinton was leery about signing that version of the farm bill, but Glickman consulted with Flinchbaugh on the legislation.

""He had great influence on me and people in the academic world,"" Glickman said.

AGRICULTURE AT CROSSROADS

Johanns and Glickman each noted agriculture is at a crossroads because of trade and Brazilian competition. They called on current Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to consider putting together a commission that would look at a new direction for agriculture going into the next 20 years.

""Go out there and lead this effort and talks about what we want agriculture to look like in 20 years or 25 years,"" Johanns said. ""How are we going to compete? What brings a new day for agriculture? How do we keep people on the farm and on the range?""

Glickman noted Flinchbaugh had advocated for a commission that would basically look at long-term challenges. One of the problems now among policymakers is that ""everything is very short-term now,"" Glickman said.

FLINCHBAUGH'S LEGACY

The forum just off the Kansas State University campus included alumni from around the country who shared stories of humor and policy over Flinchbaugh's four decades at the university. A crop of current leaders explained how Flinchbaugh could communicate complicated issues simply.

""Dr. Barry Flinchbaugh had a profound influence on shaping ag policy at every level of government and influenced the lives of countless leaders in the industry,"" said Brad Lubben, an agricultural policy professor at the University of Nebraska and former student of Flinchbaugh.

Michael Torrey, who now leads Torrey Advisory Group in Washington, D.C., said he got to know Flinchbaugh by going into his office as a student and disagreeing with him. Flinchbaugh once told him, ""I should have given you an 'F.'"" Back to Freedom to Farm, Torrey recalled how Flinchbaugh came out to Washington to talk to policy leaders trying to negotiate the bill.

""He came out there, and he was able to help educate and to teach,"" Torrey said.

Another former student, Gregg Doud, president and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, credited Flinchbaugh as the godfather of the farm safety net. Flinchbaugh, though, also cautioned that the relationship between farmers and the government comes with strings attached.

Quoting Flinchbaugh, Doud said, ""Always remember, when you get in bed with the government, you get more than a good night's kiss.""

Scott Cutshall, president of real estate and sustainability at Clay Lacy Aviation, says the company’s environmental focus began at an industry trade show.
Socially, the company invests in developing its employees’ careers, supporting local communities, and bringing new talent into business aviation.
One of the challenges Clay Lacy faced was how to measure environmental progress while experiencing significant business growth.
“For our clients, we wanted to offer solutions that, if they wanted to, they could reduce their emissions,” Cutshall explains.","Since launching its first sustainability program in 2019, Clay Lacy Aviation has made remarkable strides in reducing its environmental footprint while continuing to grow its business operations across the USA.

Founded in 1968, Clay Lacy Aviation operates across four business lines — aircraft management, charter services, maintenance and repair, and fixed base operator services. The company has private jet terminals in Los Angeles, Orange County, and Connecticut.

Scott Cutshall, president of real estate and sustainability at Clay Lacy Aviation, says the company’s environmental focus began at an industry trade show. “I was walking around NBAA-BACE, and in the corner of a fuel booth, they had a vendor talking about sustainable aviation fuel and I got talking to them. That was my first exposure to the topic of sustainability and what was possible in the industry.”

This encounter led to the development of a comprehensive sustainability program built around three core motivations.

“We have three whys,” Cutshall explains. “The first one is we wanted to prepare for the future.

We felt that there would be regulation coming around environmental emissions. The second is we wanted to create a competitive advantage — we wanted to be ahead and be a leader in this area. And then the third is, we just feel it’s the right thing to do.

“If we can start to modify some of our actions today to reduce consumption of natural resources, to reduce unnecessary emissions, why wouldn’t we want to do that?” he says.

A triple bottom line

Clay Lacy’s sustainability strategy follows what Cutshall describes as a triple bottom line approach, balancing social, economic, and environmental considerations.

“There’s a social element, an economic element, and an environmental element, and we hold those three in tension with each other,” he says. “There’s a lot of things we could do to be more environmentally friendly, but they would harm the business from an economic standpoint. So, there’s a healthy tension there.”

This balanced approach extends to all facets of the company’s operations. For the environmental component, Clay Lacy focuses on reducing facility emissions and resource consumption. Socially, the company invests in developing its employees’ careers, supporting local communities, and bringing new talent into business aviation. Economically, initiatives must make business sense to ensure the company’s long-term viability.

One of the challenges Clay Lacy faced was how to measure environmental progress while experiencing significant business growth. The company developed innovative metrics to account for expansion.

“We’re a growing organization. In 2019, we were at around 80 airplanes; today, we’re at 160 airplanes that we manage,” Cutshall notes. “So how do you measure if you are reducing your environmental and carbon footprint, if you’re a growing organization?”

The company’s solution was to divide total emissions by three metrics, the square footage of facilities, the number of employees, and the number of managed aircraft. This approach allows the company to track efficiency improvements even as its overall operations expand.

The results have been impressive. Cutshall says, “Our facilities have grown by 51% while emissions per square foot have decreased by 26%. Employee count has grown by 145% where emissions per employee has dropped 54%.”

Client-focused solutions

An important distinction in Clay Lacy’s sustainability approach is how they handle aircraft emissions. As Cutshall points out, “We don’t own any aircraft. We manage them on behalf of individuals and corporations. So technically, the emissions from the planes are not Clay Lacy’s emissions, because we don’t decide when they fly.”

Instead of attempting to control these scope 3 emissions, Clay Lacy focuses on providing options to clients who want to reduce their environmental impact.

“For our clients, we wanted to offer solutions that, if they wanted to, they could reduce their emissions,” Cutshall explains.

“We started with a carbon offset program. When we started, we were one of the first 10 FBOs in the US to start selling a continuous supply of SAF,” he adds. “But it was optional to buy. And then we started generating complimentary emission reports for our aircraft owners.”

This approach extends to charter clients as well. “If a charter client would like an emissions report for all their charters for the year or the quarter, we can now generate that for them.”

Clay Lacy has implemented numerous sustainability measures throughout its operations. “We’ve installed solar panels on our facilities. We’ve transitioned all our ground service equipment to either renewable diesel or electric,” Cutshall says. While the transition to renewable diesel initially presented cost challenges, the company took a patient approach. “At first it was about US$1 more per gallon, which wasn’t financially feasible. So, we just monitored it, and it took about another year and a half for the price to come into about 10 cents.”

Other notable achievements include eliminating 227,280 plastic water bottles since November 2022, diverting thousands of pounds of rubbish from landfills through recycling and composting, sourcing one-third of all electricity from renewable sources, processing 40,000 pounds of e-recycling between 2019-2022, and providing EV charging at their Van Nuys facility, delivering 15,414 kWh of charging (equivalent to 6.7 metric tons of CO2 or 750 gallons of gasoline).

For aviation businesses starting their sustainability programs, Cutshall recommends measuring emissions first. “Step on the scale, find out what your scope one and scope two emissions are,” he says. “And then start to make a plan to do something. It doesn’t have to be everything. Just do something to start moving down that path.”

He advocates for widespread incremental action over comprehensive programs by a few companies. “I firmly believe that it’s about more organizations doing something, than a few organizations doing a lot. Because if every organization just did a little bit, the impact would actually be much larger.”

Business aviation’s small size creates networking opportunities, Cutshall notes. “Business aviation is not a big industry. Reach out for help. Chances are, everybody knows somebody that’s a bit ahead of them in the sustainability journey. Go ask them ‘How did you start? What worked for you? What didn’t work for you?’”

The company’s approach reflects a long-term commitment to environmental progress. “To be sustainable, you don’t get somewhere and say, ‘Okay, now I’m sustainable.’ It’s a never-ending journey.”",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2023-Scott-Cutshall-LR-Headshot-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:56:44.086383

This approach allows assigning biomass materials to produce stretch films with quality equivalent to those made from 100% petroleum-based raw materials.
The new stretch film incorporates polyethene with 100% biomass content assigned through the mass balance method, blended at approximately 25% biomass-based plastic.
At Narita Airport, JAL Cargo Service and JAL Cargo Handling have verified that handling quality equivalent to the conventional standard can be ensured, and have decided to proceed with the implementation.","Starting in October 2025, JAL will sequentially introduce cargo stretch films made from biomass materials using the mass balance method at domestic airports. This marks the first initiative within Japan’s aviation industry.

Compared to conventional methods, the mass balance method reduces concerns about raw material shortages and requires no large-scale capital investment. Additionally, this method achieves physical properties equivalent to those of conventional petroleum-based products. JAL expects to reduce CO₂ emissions by approximately 50 tons annually with the use of these films.

According to the JAL Group Medium-Term Management Plan (Rolling Plan 2025), efforts are underway to reduce single-use plastics derived from fossil fuels. The cargo division actively promotes the use of materials containing eco-friendly components, aiming for efficient use of limited resources and reduced environmental impact. With the introduction of these new stretch films, 100% incorporation of eco-friendly materials in cargo handling supplies will be achieved as planned.

About the mass balance method and the new stretch film

The mass balance approach is a method used during product processing and manufacturing where multiple raw materials are blended, and the characteristics of each material are properly allocated to the final product according to their blended proportions. This approach allows assigning biomass materials to produce stretch films with quality equivalent to those made from 100% petroleum-based raw materials. Furthermore, the biomass materials incorporated in the stretch films are derived from biomass naphtha—a byproduct obtained during the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—thereby maximising the effective use of limited resources.

The new stretch film incorporates polyethene with 100% biomass content assigned through the mass balance method, blended at approximately 25% biomass-based plastic. At Narita Airport, JAL Cargo Service and JAL Cargo Handling have verified that handling quality equivalent to the conventional standard can be ensured, and have decided to proceed with the implementation.

SAF is made from certified sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other residual waste materials. The fuel has emerged as a trusted solution to decarbonise the aviation industry as it can reduce life cycle CO2e emissions by up to 80 percent, according to IATA.

”We’ve already taken significant steps to reduce emissions in seafreight. Purchasing SAFc for airfreight supports the replacement of fossil kerosene and offers a readily implementable, transparent and scalable solution for corporates looking to address their Scope 3 emissions without having to change carriers, routes or operational setup.”, says Niklas Olsson, Group CEO, Hecksher

How it works

Hecksher calculates the customer’s airfreight emissions

The customer selects a SAFc amount – matching all or part of their emissions

The SAFc represents a volume of physical SAF used to replace kerosene in commercial operations. Via book & claim Hecksher owns the exclusive rights to the end-user emission reduction, which is recorded on the SAFc registry

The SAFc registry publicly records all claimed emission reductions and only allows the issuance of SAFc where the physical SAF meets stringent quality controls such as third -party verification, therefore assuring full transparency and avoiding double issuance/ claiming

Customer receives a digital certificate that includes all the characteristics of the SAFc supporting the environmental claim.

“We have found a cost-effective solution that allows us to offer SAF at purchase price. This means our customers can buy SAF at a lower cost compared to several other providers,” says Patrik Westraeus, Head of Sustainability at Greencarrier Group, which includes Hecksher.

Delivered in partnership with STX Group

The SAFc initiative is delivered in partnership with environmental commodities trader STX Group.

“We congratulate Hecksher and Greencarrier on taking this important step by implementing SAFc. It’s encouraging to see the shift toward renewable fuels, and at STX we are proud to support such pioneers by providing market access and liquidity in SAFc,” says Fabian Roobeek, Managing Partner at STX Group.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hecksher-flygbraIˆnsle-photo-press--1080x632.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 07:56:52.304835

The airport submitted an original planning application in 2023 seeking to increase total annual flights from 50,000 to 70,000 and non-weekday flights from 8,900 to 18,900. The revised application proposes increasing non-weekday flights to 13,500 annually while keeping the overall 50,000 flight limit unchanged.

The revised application retains existing restrictions on heavier aircraft, including an 80-tonne maximum weight limit and no more than 1,500 annual flights for aircraft weighing 50-80 tonnes. Non-weekday flights for heavier aircraft would increase from 270 to 405 annually, proportionate to the overall non-weekday flight increase.

According to Farnborough Airport, the application proposes removing aircraft weighing 50-55 tonnes that meet stringent noise standards from restricted weight category quotas. The change supports introduction of modern aircraft with improved environmental performance compared to older, lighter aircraft.

Simon Geere, chief executive of Farnborough Airport, said the revised application addresses medium-term growth without compromising long-term planning. “Supporting the long-term demand for flights from Farnborough Airport is essential if we are to maintain our role as one of the principle economic generators in the region,” Geere said. “The airport supports over 3,000 local jobs and is the UK’s largest business aviation gateway serving London and the South East.”

The revised application does not include changes to operating hours, which run from 08:00 to 20:00 on non-weekdays. The original application proposed extending hours from 07:00 to 21:00, but this was removed following consultation feedback.

Farnborough Airport has opened public consultation on the revised application until October 22. The airport will host two online webinars during the consultation period for community questions and feedback.

According to the airport, approximately 80% of flights are business-related, contributing £1.6 billion in gross value added to the UK economy annually. The facility supports 3,100 local jobs across hundreds of businesses in the region.

Farnborough Airport has committed to achieving net-zero emissions for operations under its control by 2030.

The round includes new investors Orlen VC, Safran Corporate Ventures, International Airlines Group (IAG), Hostplus, and TCVC, alongside continued support from existing backers Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, Braavos Capital, and the University of Oxford.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

OXCCU’s Series B is one of the larger deals in the European clean fuels/carbon conversion space to date in 2025, relative to the mid-single digit millions more typical of earlier-stage players. While many of the comparators remain at pre-Seed or Seed scale (e.g. the €2.3 million for Spark e-Fuels, or the €3.2 million for Crosstown), OXCCU is advancing into commercialisation and demonstration scale.

Its raise reflects investor appetite for more mature, de-risked technologies in the carbon-to-liquids/SAF domain, particularly where there is a credible pathway to cost reduction and industrial deployment.

Notably, Catalyxx in Spain is operating in a somewhat related niche (converting bioethanol into renewable chemicals/SAF intermediates), so there is a similar echo of interest in Southern Europe. But none of the comparators identified in 2025 reach quite the same scale or share exactly the same one-step carbon to hydrocarbon approach.

Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG), said: “We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably. IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

Founded in 2021, OXCCU is developing novel catalysts and reactor designs to convert waste carbon into liquid hydrocarbons with high conversion and selectivity for use as fuels and chemicals.

The new capital builds on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Their second demonstration plant, OX2, is underway and will be fully operational in 2026.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, the company says high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

Ireneusz Fąfara, President of the Management Board of ORLEN, added: “We invest in the technologies of tomorrow to effectively transform our business. This year, we introduced SAF – sustainable aviation fuel produced from renewable and waste raw materials – into our offering. In line with our strategy, by 2035 we aim to become one of the leading producers of SAF in Europe.

“Supporting the achievement of this goal is a new investment by ORLEN VC in the technology of OXCCU, a company enabling the conversion of green hydrogen and carbon dioxide into synthetic aviation fuel. Its commercialisation will strengthen our market competitiveness and support our pursuit of carbon neutrality.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale.

OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction.

This reportedly reduces capital and operating costs, and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

“This is a critical time for ClimateTech, as the urgency continues to increase,” added Symes. “Aviation needs a solution, and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.”",https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/OXCCU.png,N,,2025-09-29 07:57:35.828199

After a week of frying frites, the kitchen at Washington’s famous standby for French cuisine was full to bursting with used grease.

Two waist-high storage tanks in the back of the restaurant sloshed to the brim with dark, viscous oil. During the weekend rush, the staff stored some of the spent grease in plastic tubs, but they were quickly running out of places to put it.

Restaurants are prohibited from dumping grease down the drain because it would clog city sewers. So on a Tuesday afternoon, James Howell nimbly backed his truck into an alley behind Le Diplomate. He hopped down from the cab and snaked a rubber hose to the kitchen. Then with the flip of a switch and a loud drone, the hose slurped the used cooking oil into the truck’s gleaming steel 2,200-gallon tank.

The spent grease that restaurants unload as waste has become a valuable commodity. If you’ve been on a plane lately, there’s a chance that used cooking oil has helped launch you into the sky. Refineries recycle waste oil into kerosene pure enough to power a Boeing 777. The process is expensive — but it can create 70 to 80 percent less planet-warming pollution than making jet fuel out of crude oil, experts say.

Last year, airlines burned 340 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — nearly all of it made from used cooking oil or animal fat leftover from meat packaging.

That’s a drop in the bucket compared to the 114 billion gallons of fuel airlines burned overall, which create 2.5 percent of humanity’s carbon pollution, according to the International Energy Agency. But airlines have vowed to use much more SAF to lower their greenhouse emissions. European regulators have set strict rules requiring airlines to use more SAF over time, while U.S. regulators dole out tax credits to coax companies into buying it.

This is the airlines’ main plan for dealing with their greenhouse emissions. Upgrading new planes with more efficient engines helps a little. And, one day, planes may run on electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells — but those are still decades away and may never work for long flights. To manage most of their climate impact for the foreseeable future, airlines are betting everything on alternative fuels.

“Ninety-eight percent of [our greenhouse emissions] come from the fuel we burn,” said Lauren Riley, chief sustainability officer at United Airlines. “We’ll continue to look everywhere we can around technology and innovation of the aircraft itself and the engine, but we have to look at replacing our fuel.”

Experts say this plan can work, but it’ll require fuel refiners to dramatically raise SAF production and find new raw materials besides old cooking oil to turn into kerosene. Depending on what they use and how they refine it, this new class of fuel could make flying more sustainable or cause a whole new set of environmental headaches.

Harvesting the world’s grease

On his rounds one day in early May, Howell made about two dozen stops at commercial kitchens around Washington, including an upscale cafe in the Michelin Guide, an assisted-living facility, a soul food spot where old chicken bones clogged the hose and an Italian restaurant where two unfortunate rats had drowned in a grease bin while diving for a wayward meatball. By midafternoon, his truck had about 1,200 gallons of grease in its belly.

The company he works for, Mahoney Environmental, pays a few cents a gallon for the waste fat it collects from 90,000 businesses in the United States. Hundreds of companies gather grease around the globe — with an especially large haul in Southeast Asia, where densely packed restaurants serve up so much fried food that they’ve become the waste oil equivalent of Saudi Arabia’s rich petroleum fields.

Waste oil from kitchens and animal tallow leftover from meatpacking plants used to be recycled into livestock feed. But now, they are mostly turned into fuel: Fat molecules hold a lot of energy, and they’re relatively easy to rearrange into diesel and kerosene.

Turning fat into fuel keeps grease out of the landfill and petroleum in the ground. The demand, though, has begun to outstrip the supply.

“There’s only so many waste oils to go around, and … you can’t really squeeze out much more,” said Nikita Pavlenko, who leads the aviation and fuels team at the nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation. “People aren’t going to be frying more food or processing more cattle to get waste tallow to make fuel. You’re kind of stuck with what you have.”

As regulators push companies to buy and make more fuel from fat, the price of grease has been rising, along with the crime surrounding it.

Thieves sometimes steal grease from collection bins and sell it themselves. Once, Howell said, he stopped at a restaurant only to find an empty bin and a confused cook, who told him an unmarked van had come by earlier and siphoned off their oil.

Grease fraud is a problem, too. In some areas, used cooking oil sells for more than new cooking oil, prompting hucksters to sell virgin oil — including palm oil, which is associated with deforestation in Southeast Asia — as if it were used. It’s hard to catch, since fresh oil spiked with a little restaurant grease is almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

“You’re potentially paying a premium for something that is worse than fossil fuel,” Pavlenko said.

Fuel companies crack down on fraud by hiring inspectors to go out and check that their grease suppliers really are pumping their product out of deep fat fryers. On his route, Howell takes pictures of every bin before and after he drains it and uploads the proof to a Mahoney Environmental app that verifies where his oil came from.

At the end of the day, Howell unloads his truck at a depot, where the oil is filtered to remove water, flour, spices and any other floating food chunks.

Turning fat into fuel

Used grease is a global commodity. Once it’s collected, tanker ships and pipelines carry it to fuel refineries around the world — much like they do for crude oil.

Grease ships arrive a couple of times a week at a refinery in Rotterdam run by Neste, the world’s top producer of sustainable jet fuel.

Fueling the appetite for sustainable fuel

In 2023, a Boeing 777 flew across the Atlantic Ocean burning fuel made from nothing but waste fat and sugar. The flight was a first, but it was really a publicity stunt — carrying Virgin Atlantic bigwigs, not paying passengers. The fuel is too expensive, and too scarce, for that to make business sense.

Instead, Neste blends its french fry fuel with standard kerosene made from crude oil before delivering it to airports.

SAF is almost identical to standard jet fuel, and it releases just as much CO2 when it’s burned. But experts say there’s a key difference: Drilling for oil takes carbon that was locked away underground and releases it into the atmosphere. Making fuel from used cooking oil and tallow takes carbon that was already circulating through the air and the bodies of plants and animals and recycles it. No new carbon moves from underground storage into the atmosphere.

It takes energy to collect and transport used cooking oil, rearrange fat molecules into jet fuel and get that fuel to planes. But, overall, making and burning SAF adds as much as 80 percent less carbon to the atmosphere as making and burning fossil fuel from crude oil.

Because there isn’t enough waste oil in the world to satisfy the airline industry’s thirst, companies are developing other ways to make low-carbon jet fuel. One option is to grow more crops like soy that can be crushed for oil and turned into jet fuel — although that raises the risk that more land will be cleared for farming in fragile ecosystems like the Brazilian Amazon. Environmentalists have raised similar concerns about raising more corn, sugar cane or beets to create ethanol and convert it into kerosene.

“The problem with crop-based biofuels is it takes land to produce them at a time when we’re already expanding cropland … which means more deforestation, and the carbon losses are far greater than the potential savings from reducing fossil fuel use,” said Tim Searchinger, a senior research scholar at Princeton’s Center for Policy Research on Energy and the Environment.

Alternately, farmers could grow more cover crops on their fields between their regular planting seasons, which would create a new source of plant oils or ethanol without using extra land. Some companies have experimented with turning trash into jet fuel, but the most prominent player went bankrupt last year. Others are splitting water molecules to harvest their hydrogen and combining it with captured carbon to make fuel.

Experts say it will take a combination of all these methods to make enough green fuel to power the world’s planes.

The one thing every alternative fuel recipe has in common is that they are more expensive than fossil fuel — and experts say they always will be. Making SAF from waste oil is “locked in at a cost which is about two times the cost of fossil jet, and it’s going to be entirely reliant on subsidies,” according to Pavlenko. The other methods could be even more expensive, even after they’ve had time to raise production and lower costs.

The future of the industry will depend on whether the United States keeps tax credits in place and the European Union stands by its green fuel mandates. Neste is expanding its Rotterdam refinery in anticipation of stricter E.U. blending rules, and in the United States, the first large-scale SAF operations started pumping out fuel in recent years in response to new tax credits that have since been weakened.

The announcement comes at a time of growing regulatory momentum and market demand for sustainable fuels. However, despite mandates such as the UK SAF mandate and ReFuelEU, high production costs remain a major barrier to widespread adoption.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

The funding reflects increasing recognition that driving down SAF production costs is critical to unlocking aviation decarbonisation at scale. OXCCU’s process simplifies SAF production pathways by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. This reduces capital and operating costs and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The catalyst’s ability to operate with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen input gas compositions gives it the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

“We recognise the need for the world to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably” said Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at International Airlines Group (IAG). “IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”

OXCCU’s solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

In the Netherlands, a further increase in the air passenger tax is expected from 2027 onward. In Belgium the tax is EUR 10, Sweden has abolished it, and Germany is reportedly considering reversing its increase.

In addition to the development of new technologies in our own products such as engines and aircraft equipment, we are also supporting the de-risking and industrial scale-up of the most promising sustainable aviation fuel technologies.”

Daniel Goldman, Managing Partner and Co-founder of Clean Energy Ventures, said: ""OXCCU stands out not only for its differentiated technology but also for the speed of its progress toward commercial plants. In just a few years, the company has advanced from the lab to a commercial demonstration facility, proving that waste carbon and hydrogen can be converted directly into jet fuel at low cost. That rapid progress is reshaping the sustainable aviation fuel market, unlocking the affordability aviation needs to decarbonize. With the extraordinary leadership team and support of its strategic investors, we are confident OXCCU will lead the decarbonization of fuels and chemicals in the coming years.""

Dr Robert Trezona, Partner, Cleantech at IP Group, said: “This round is a significant milestone, not just for the Company, but for the sector – significant capital being put to work from established industry actors on a credible path to fully decarbonise aviation. OXCCU showcases the UK’s ability to lead in climate innovation, turning world-class science into global solutions, while generating jobs and lasting impact. We’re proud to continue to support the company as it scales its compelling single-step technology.”

OXCCU’s solution meets both environmental and commercial demands, with applications that extend beyond aviation into chemicals and plastics.

“This is a critical time for climate tech, as the urgency continues to increase” added Symes. “Aviation needs a solution, and the serious lever is SAF. The challenge is SAF cost and that is exactly what we are addressing at OXCCU.”

The programme uses the “book-and-claim” model (explained in full here), where companies co-fund the purchase of SAF and are able to claim the resulting emissions reduction for their sustainability reporting – even if the fuel is physically used on a different flight or route.

As you would expect, participating companies receive an audited SAF certificate from a verified third party, which can be used to report on Scope 3 emissions. The service also allows corporate customers to monitor the actual flight emissions generated by their business trips. Finnair says that a total of eight Finnair cargo and corporate customers have already signed up to support the use of SAF through the new service.

A new study published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, says the main obstacle to the aviation industry’s Net Zero by 2050 goal is the slow roll-out of technology for producing SAF, not the availability of sustainable feedstocks.

The study provides “unequivocal evidence” that there is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources – which meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not cause land-use changes – to meet the projected 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF required annually by 2050.

Instead, IATA says that it is instead the slow pace of technology rollout required to convert such diverse feedstocks into SAF at scale..Currently, the only commercially scaled-up SAF production facilities use HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) technology, which primarily converts used cooking oil. Alternative, non-commercial technologies, which are necessary to unlock other abundant feedstocks, are not being deployed fast enough.

The industry also faces the challenge of competition from other sectors for the same sustainable biomass feedstocks. IATA argues that policies should prioritise allocating these resources to hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, and urges policymakers and business leaders in the energy sector to invest in and deploy the advanced technologies that are currently holding back production capacity.

Additionally IATA calls on the implementation of co-ordinated government policies that de-risk investment and support innovation to create a fully functioning SAF market and improve conversion efficiencies, feedstock logistics, and invest in the necessary infrastructure for commercial-scale SAF facilities across all regions.

iata.org

Sticking with SAF, The Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Foundation has launched a new learning and collaboration hub called ‘SAF Corporate Connect’ to help the corporate travel industry integrate and accelerate the adoption of SAF.

The initiative is designed to address the knowledge gap among travel managers, procurement teams, and sustainability leaders, enabling them to confidently incorporate SAF into their programmes and better advise their clients and travellers.

The hub will provide corporate travel managers with the knowledge and practical tools needed to understand, evaluate, and integrate SAF into their company’s climate strategies and offers guidance SAF purchasing options – including book-and-claim models.

GBTA.org

Linking with IATA’s survey, The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has launched the Finvest Hub, a global platform designed to connect SAF and other low-carbon aviation project developers with the necessary public and private financing and investors.

The Finvest Hub will facilitate connections between SAF and low-carbon project developers worldwide and potential financiers, helping to de-risk investments while ensuring environmental integrity by using ICAO’s sustainability criteria. The platform is designed to unlock new financial mechanisms and create clear pathways for financial support to increase the production and deployment of SAF and other cleaner energy sources.

The first operational element of the hub is the Finvest@ETAF portal, launched in co-operation with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s Energy Transition Accelerator Financing (ETAF) platform.

A key focus is prioritising support for developing states that face challenges in funding aviation sustainability projects, providing them with technical assistance, capacity building, and guidance on legal and policy frameworks to attract investment.

Finally, Travalyst, a not-for-profit organisation founded by Prince Harry in 2019, has launched a Data Hub which will enable environmental data to be shared with travellers during the booking process.

The initial version focuses on providing accommodation data for establishments’ environmental footprint across five categories: energy, waste, water, biodiversity and ecosystems, and destination and community.

The data is reviewed by an Independent Advisory Group, then distributed by Travalyst’s partners – including Booking.com, Expedia and Google – and shared with travellers on these platforms. The hub also ensures the data is standardised, allowing providers to be compared and ranked.

The new initiative follows Travalyst’s similar initiative with flights, scaling up Google’s Impact Model. This enables travellers to see the CO2 emissions for flights when searching on platforms like Google Flights. Yannis Simaiakis, director travel and local partnerships EMEA at Google, said, “We believe that the accommodation space is the next big area for the industry to drive change.”

Later versions of the hub are set to incorporate biodiversity and social sustainability data, encompassing accommodation, destinations, rail, and end-to-end journeys.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","We came across a bullish thesis on Calumet, Inc. on The Pale Blue Dot’s Substack by Saad Khan. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on CLMT. Calumet, Inc.’s share was trading at $18.66 as of September 22nd. CLMT’s trailing and forward P/E were 23.06 and 11.35, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.

Calumet Specialty Products Partners ($CLMT) is a diversified specialty chemicals and fuels company with three core businesses: Specialty Products & Solutions (SPS), Performance Brands (PB), and Montana/Renewables (MRL). SPS and PB, generating mid-cycle EBITDA of roughly $285mm, are highly resilient due to a diverse customer base, flexible product offerings, and operational improvements including $42mm of cost reductions in H1 2025 and three consecutive quarters of strong throughput. Applying conservative industry multiples, these segments are valued at $2.3bn EV, or about $13 per share, implying an MRL EV of $1.1bn.

While MRL’s current EBITDA is modest at $65mm, there are compelling catalysts for a material inflection. Political support for biofuels, including higher Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) and reallocation of Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs), combined with MRL’s capacity expansion under the MAXSAF program, could lift EBITDA to $300mm+. MRL’s location in Montana allows feedstock optimization, and upcoming Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is expected to benefit from a $1–$2 per gallon margin premium over renewable diesel.

Regulatory support, including favorable RIN pricing and reduced CLMT RIN obligations, enhances the upside. If these scenarios materialize, total company valuation using an 8x EBITDA multiple could exceed $30 per share, creating substantial upside from the current $17 level. Risks include unfavorable regulatory decisions, slower-than-expected capacity ramp, and high leverage, which could pressure free cash flow and equity returns. However, current EPA guidance and political trends suggest strong support for biofuels, setting the stage for a potential rerating and significant upside for investors positioned ahead of these catalysts.

Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Calumet, Inc. (CLMT) by Zerosumgame33 in April 2025, which highlighted the biodiesel margin inflection, MRL’s feedstock advantage, and potential upside from the 2026–2028 RVO. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 88% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as regulatory support and MRL expansion continue to drive upside. Saad Khan shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes operational improvements in SPS and PB and the impact of SAF and MAXSAF capacity on long-term EBITDA.

Calumet, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 19 hedge fund portfolios held CLMT at the end of the second quarter which was 22 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of CLMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

READ NEXT: 30 Stocks That Should Double in 3 Years and 11 Hidden AI Stocks to Buy NOW

Disclosure: None.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

« L’E-2D Advanced Hawkeye a été ravitaillé en vol, avec succès, par ces avions ravitailleurs de fabrication française.
Quant au troisième, il prendra d’abord la direction de l’atelier industriel de l’aéronautique de Cuers pour y recevoir des équipements de guerre électronique et de communication propres à la Marine nationale.","Mis en œuvre par la Flottille 4F de la Marine nationale, les trois avions de guet aérien E-2C Hawkeye ne peuvent pas être ravitaillés en vol, ce qui, malgré leur autonomie d’environ 6 heures [ou 1 450 nautiques], peut être un facteur limitant pour les opérations du groupe aérien embarqué [GAé] du porte-avions Charles de Gaulle. Mais cela ne sera pas le cas de leurs successeurs.

En effet, en 2021, le ministère des Armées a commandé trois E-2D Advanced Hawkeye auprès du constructeur américain Northrop Grumman pour 360 millions de dollars. Or, ces appareils auront la capacité d’être ravitaillés en vol, ce qui permettra d’augmenter considérablement leur temps de patrouille et d’étendre leur zone d’opération.

Alors que le premier exemplaire doit être livré à la Marine nationale en 2027, la Direction générale de l’armement [DGA] s’est attachée à vérifier que le Rafale Marine doté d’une nacelle NARANG [en configuration dite « nounou »], l’A400M et l’A330 MRTT étaient en mesure de ravitailler un E-2D Advanced Hawkeye en vol.

En novembre 2024, la DGA a procédé à un premier essai de ravitaillement en vol par un Rafale M « nounou » d’un A400M censé tenir le rôle d’un E-2D. L’objectif était de vérifier le comportement de la nacelle NARANG à vitesse réduite.

« Pour mener cette opération, le Rafale ravitailleur doit adopter une vitesse adéquate au fonctionnement de la nacelle de ravitaillement. La vitesse permet de stabiliser le panier qui relie le tuyau de ravitaillement à la perche de l’avion ravitaillé et d’actionner les pompes par une petite hélice située à l’avant de la nacelle qui tourne grâce à l’effet aérodynamique de l’air. Plus l’avion vole vite, plus l’hélice aura de l’énergie pour faire fonctionner l’ensemble », avait alors expliqué la DGA.

Ces essais se sont poursuivis jusqu’à l’été dernier, mais, cette fois, avec un E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, aux États-Unis. Outre un Rafale M « nounou », ils ont aussi impliqué un A400M et un A330 MRTT de l’armée de l’Air & de l’Espace. Et, selon un communiqué publié par le Naval Air Systems Command [NAVAIR] de l’US Navy, ils ont été concluants.

« La Marine nationale et l’armée de l’Air & de l’Espace ont effectué des essais qualitatifs de ravitaillement en vol avec des avions ravitailleurs français Rafale, A330 MRTT et A400M dans le cadre d’une collaboration entre le Bureau du programme de systèmes de commandement et de contrôle aéroportés E-2/C-2 et la Direction générale de l’armement », a rapporté le NAVAIR.

« L’E-2D Advanced Hawkeye a été ravitaillé en vol, avec succès, par ces avions ravitailleurs de fabrication française. C’est une première historique qui étend considérablement la portée de l’Advanced Hawkeye et permet des opérations conjointes transparentes tout en offrant des capacités de surveillance aéroportée sans précédent », a-t-il fait valoir. « Grâce à ses capacités de ravitaillement en vol, l’E-2D demeure la plateforme de commandement et de contrôle la plus avancée au monde », a-t-il ajouté.

Pour autant, les travaux ne sont pas totalement terminés. « La DGA et la Marine nationale assureront des essais supplémentaires de ravitaillement en vol ainsi que la formation des pilotes en France à mesure que les E-2C seront remplacés à partir de 2028 », a précisé le NAVAIR.

Selon le contre-amiral David Desfougères, le commandant de la force de l’aéronautique navale [ALAVIA], le premier E-2D Advanced Hawkeye sera en pris en charge par le Centre d’expérimentations pratiques et de réception de l’aéronautique navale [CEPA/10S] dès qu’il aura été livré tandis que le second rejoindra la Flottille 4F pour la formation des équipages. Quant au troisième, il prendra d’abord la direction de l’atelier industriel de l’aéronautique de Cuers pour y recevoir des équipements de guerre électronique et de communication propres à la Marine nationale.

Sans attendre la livraison de ces trois avions, « la formation du premier pilote d’essai a déjà commencé aux États-Unis », a confié le contre-amiral Desfougères à Var Matin.

Pour rappel, l’E-2D Advanced Hawkeye est équipé d’un radar à balayage mécanique et électronique AN/APY-9 capable de suivre simultanément, à 360°, un plus grand nombre de pistes, qu’elles soient navales ou aériennes. Il est aussi doté d’un système de mesure de soutien électronique [MSE] AN/ALQ-217, de la Liaison 16 et d’un dispositif IFF [identification amis/ennemis].

Invested as part of the government’s Future Flight programme, delivered by Innovate UK, the funding is designed to secure the UK’s global leadership in the future of aviation and the fast-growing field of drones and unmanned aircraft systems.

The technologies have the potential to transform industries from healthcare to energy and will become increasingly important to help deliver goods – including vital medical supplies – more quickly and efficiently, while cutting costs for the public sector and businesses. The sectors are also supporting increased numbers of highly-skilled jobs across the UK, boosting regional economies and delivering the Plan for Change.

Projects working on next-generation zero-emission aircraft and the development of vertical take-off and landing technology will also receive funding.

Aviation Minister, Keir Mather, said:

We’re backing the next generation of British aviation businesses whose transformative technologies will reshape how we live and work in the years to come.

Investing in emerging technologies like drones and unmanned aircraft is key to build a greener and more efficient transport system. But this isn’t just good news for the environment – this tech will also save our public sector and businesses valuable time and cash, while helping to boost skills and support high quality jobs across the country.

The announcement is the latest move by the government to build on the UK’s position as a leader in aerospace innovation, and follows a commitment to invest a record £14.9 billion in research and development, strengthening industries including life sciences, green energy and engineering and supporting careers that will grow the UK’s research ecosystem.

Among the successful projects are:

Beyond Restoration – a project transforming land restoration efforts across multiple UK sites by using long-range, heavy-lift drones to deliver environmental materials to remote and ecologically sensitive areas

the London Health Bridge Project – the UK’s leading medical drone delivery service, which will use the funding to significantly scale up its operations, aiming to increase from 1,000 to 50,000 medical sample deliveries per month

the Regional Offshore Cargo Drone Demonstrator – a pioneering Scottish project that will pilot the UK’s first heavy-lift drone logistics service tailored to support offshore wind farms

Simon Masters, Deputy Challenge Director for Future Flight at Innovate UK, said:

Innovate UK is proud to continue supporting the UK’s future flight ecosystem, accelerating the route to commercial operations and delivering real-world impact.

These ambitious new projects highlight the strength of the sector and its diverse applications, from reducing emissions, advancing healthcare delivery and protecting our environment.

By focusing on regional adoption, we aim to drive faster, more impactful growth and societal benefits for communities across the UK.

The government is committed to accelerating airspace modernisation across the sector to unlock growth, including by backing the development and use of sustainable aviation fuel, including through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which will boost green fuel production in the UK and help deliver cleaner flights.

The government has committed £2.3 billion in funding over the next 10 years to the Aerospace Technology Institute programme, which helps the sector to manufacture newer, more efficient, electric aircraft.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68d6957029e2934106866444/s960_drone-technology.png,N,,2025-09-28 20:56:54.477784

Since April 2025, when trade tensions between China and the U.S. began increasing, China has effectively stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans.
“It’s a perfect storm of ugly.” Joel Schreurs underscored the importance of agriculture to rural towns throughout Minnesota and the country.
“Farmers want open markets more than anything, but the current situation is unsustainable,” Joel Schreurs said.
“We’re going to lose a lot of good farmers without an assistance package.” Joel Schreurs, who sits on the board of the U.S.","ST. PAUL, Minn. — Prior to attending the 40th Farm Aid benefit concert Sept. 20 in Minneapolis, Sen. Amy Klobuchar felt that perhaps the emerging crisis unfolding in the farm economy had fallen on deaf ears across the country.

Not so, Klobuchar said during a visit to the Tyler, Minn., farm of Joel Schreurs, a director with the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association (MSGA).

The dire message is being received.

“After Farm Aid, I think people are waking up to how bad it is right now (in agriculture),” she said during a roundtable discussion in Schreurs’ garage, where she was flanked by Schreurs and MSGA Director Bob Worth. “It’s gotten into their psyche, and I think they’re starting to see it.”

Worth said the current economic landscape reminded him of conditions that led to the creation of Farm Aid four decades ago.

“This is the 1980s farm crisis all over again,” Worth said.

Tariffs on many of U.S. soy’s largest trading partners have wreaked havoc on not just producers, but the entire ag supply chain. Since April 2025, when trade tensions between China and the U.S. began increasing, China has effectively stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans. In the 2023/2024 marketing year, China imported over $13 billion in U.S. soybeans. Replacing that market takes years, not weeks or months. Additionally, in contrast to the 2018-2019 trade war, tariffs have gone beyond China to affect U.S. soy customers across the globe. Combine low commodity prices with a widening basis and input costs that remain stubbornly high, and it’s hard to look for a bright economic spot as farmers head out into the fields to harvest what’s predicted to be a near-record soybean crop.

“It’s a weird combination of bad circumstances,” Klobuchar said, adding, “We’ve got to find a way out.”

Matt Schreurs, Joel’s cousin and vice president of ag lending with First Farmers and Merchant Bank, explained to the senator that the numbers aren’t adding up for producers in his region. Some growers are seeing losses totaling $180 per acre.

“I’m looking at a lot of red ink,” said Matt Schreurs, a member of MSGA. “It’s a perfect storm of ugly.”

Joel Schreurs underscored the importance of agriculture to rural towns throughout Minnesota and the country. He’s also concerned how younger farmers will be impacted.

“When ag does well in southwest Minnesota, so does our local economy,” he said.

Instead of wallowing in bad news, Joel, Matt, Worth and Executive Director Joe Smentek offered a series of recommendations to Sen. Klobuchar that could lead to economic improvement across farm country in the months ahead:

Removal of tariffs on U.S. soybeans through negotiations

Unfreeze USAID funding. Food aid programs through USAID help build a positive, long-tern reputation for U.S. agriculture across decades. In FY2024, about $110 million worth of U.S. soy was purchased by USAID for Food for Peace

Passing a skinny Farm Bill before year’s end to ensure critical programs continue to receive funding

Supporting renewable fuels through higher blends of biodiesel and using soybean oil as a primary feedstock in sustainable aviation fuel

“There’s got to be some sort of resolution,” Klobuchar said.

Without a trade deal with China, the farmers agreed, financial assistance will likely be warranted to prevent a full-blown catastrophe in the ag economy.

“Farmers want open markets more than anything, but the current situation is unsustainable,” Joel Schreurs said. “We’re going to lose a lot of good farmers without an assistance package.”

Joel Schreurs, who sits on the board of the U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC), thanked the senator, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, for supporting policies that are helping to grow market access beyond China and invited her to visit emerging markets that are working with USSEC through the Soy Excellence Center.

“We had great discussions and let her know what we’re thinking and where we want to go from here,” he said.

Schreurs’ efforts to grow markets continue. On Sept. 30, he’s hosting a Southeast Asian trade delegation alongside Northern Soy Marketing.

La inversión prevista supera los 100 millones de euros, según informó la compañía.

El proyecto se plantea como una instalación de transición energética preparada para adaptarse a la evolución normativa, del mercado y de la demanda industrial. La terminal estaría habilitada para operar con productos convencionales y combustibles sostenibles como amoniaco renovable, CO₂ capturado, metanol verde, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) y biocarburantes.

El diseño contempla una capacidad aproximada de 165.000 metros cúbicos, distribuidos en varios tanques atmosféricos, criogénicos y presurizados, ubicados en dos parcelas diferenciadas pero conectadas. Estos equipos permitirán almacenar combustibles de bajas emisiones, productos químicos, amoniaco y CO₂. La infraestructura incluiría un cargadero ferroviario de ancho ibérico con conexión directa a la red nacional, enlaces a dos atraques para buques mediante una red de tuberías y bombas de gran capacidad, además de isletas de carga para camiones cisterna y sistemas auxiliares de seguridad y operación.

Las actividades previstas abarcan el almacenamiento, mezcla y expedición de biodiésel, HVO, bioetanol, metanol, naftas, SAF, materias primas para biocombustibles e hidrocarburos tradicionales, así como operaciones de blending y distribución multimodal. En el caso del CO₂ criogénico, la planta está concebida para su recepción, almacenamiento en condiciones presurizadas y refrigeradas, y expedición tanto marítima como terrestre, con opción de conexión futura por ducto. El amoniaco podría llegar por vía marítima o terrestre, almacenarse en tanques criogénicos y distribuirse mediante distintos medios de transporte.

El proyecto busca configurarse como una infraestructura logística multimodal e integrada, orientada a optimizar el sistema logístico regional, incrementar la eficiencia operativa y garantizar un suministro energético seguro y sostenible en Galicia y el noroeste peninsular.

Debido a la complejidad de la instalación y a la diversidad de productos que manejará, la entrada en funcionamiento será escalonada. Exolum prevé iniciar las operaciones en 2029.

La compañía considera que la futura terminal reforzará la posición del Puerto de A Coruña como nodo logístico de referencia en Europa, con conexiones hacia el norte del continente, América, el sur de Europa y Oriente Medio.

Jorge Guillén, Aviation & Spain Network Lead de Exolum, explicó que la iniciativa responde a la necesidad de nuevas infraestructuras logísticas que acompañen la transición energética. También señaló que el Puerto Exterior de A Coruña ofrece condiciones operativas, accesibilidad marítima y conexiones multimodales adecuadas para este tipo de proyectos.

-OneArabia

The UAE recently celebrated the winners of the third Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Aviation Award (SMBR), distributing a total prize of USD 1 million. This award recognises excellence in aviation, with a focus on sustainability and innovation. The event highlighted the UAE's commitment to advancing global civil aviation through research and development.

Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Minister of Economy and Tourism and Chairman of the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), stated: ""The SMBR Global Aviation Award embodies the UAE’s commitment to supporting research and innovation, motivating young talents and research institutions to develop practical and sustainable solutions that will shape the future of global civil aviation.""

The third edition of the award concentrated on sustainability, particularly sustainable aviation fuel solutions. This aligns with international goals for carbon neutrality by 2050. The UAE's role in fostering innovation and global cooperation was evident through this initiative. The award is organised every three years in collaboration with ICAO, having been launched in 2016.

Winners in the Academic Research and Development category hailed from universities in Brazil, the United States, and Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) secured victory in the Research Institutions category. These achievements underscore the global reach and impact of the award.

During the 42nd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), Abdulla Al Marri delivered an official statement emphasising aviation as a bridge for human communication. He noted that under UAE leadership, aviation has become central to national vision and global mission, with 189 air service agreements reflecting open skies as key to shared prosperity.

Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi, Director General of the GCAA, remarked: ""We are proud to host this reception as a platform to honor innovators and showcase their achievements to global aviation leaders. The SMBR Global Aviation Award reflects the UAE’s pioneering role in supporting the aviation industry and enhancing its position as an incubator for initiatives that inspire the world and advance sustainability.""

Commitment to Global Cooperation

The UAE has implemented significant measures towards sustainability, including a roadmap for sustainable aviation fuel production. Initiatives like a digital platform for CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) have been developed alongside establishing the Global Sustainable Aviation Marketplace (GSAM).

Al Marri further stated: ""The UAE believes that progress in aviation cannot be achieved unless it includes everyone, and sustainability can only be realized through investment in human capital. To this end, the UAE has developed several initiatives to build sector competencies in collaboration with its international partners.""

The evening saw an official state reception hosted by the UAE in Montreal as part of ICAO assembly protocol. This event blended formalities with cultural elements, attended by ministers, civil aviation directors from ICAO member states, and officials from regional and international organisations.

He added: ""The UAE has repeatedly opened its doors to host the world, serving as a hub for partners, a supportive voice for international cooperation, and a bridge between regions as a trusted and constructive ally."" This highlights their ongoing dedication to fostering international partnerships within aviation.

The gathering highlighted the need for good governance, strategic planning and inclusive policies to ensure that tourism’s benefits reach local communities while protecting cultural and natural heritage.

Malaysia used the occasion to showcase its own initiatives — from expanding high-value tourism segments and digital nomad hubs to investing in sustainable aviation fuel and community-led ecotourism. It also announced plans to join the UN Tourism International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO) with a pilot project in Mersing, Johor, reinforcing its commitment to measuring and managing tourism’s impact.

“World Tourism Day 2025 in Melaka has shown the world that tourism can be a force for good when guided by sustainability and inclusivity,” UN Tourism Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said. “By working together, we can transform tourism into a tool for empowerment, cultural preservation, and environmental protection.”

Speakers throughout the day emphasized the pillars of sustainable transformation: investing in education and skills, especially for women, youth, and marginalized groups; accelerating innovation and digital transformation by supporting start-ups and closing the “digital gap”; promoting micro and small enterprises to strengthen local economies; and preserving cultural heritage as a cornerstone of authentic travel experiences.

“Tourism is a powerful driver of transformation,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres in his official message. “It creates jobs, fuels local economies, and builds bridges across cultures. Yet, it must be sustainable to protect the very places and communities it celebrates.”

Looking ahead, UN Tourism’s secretary-general, Pololikashvili, stressed that World Tourism Day 2025 marks the start of a new chapter for the sector.

Malaysia formally handed over the hosting of World Tourism Day to El Salvador for 2026, which will take place under the theme “Digital Agenda and Artificial Intelligence to Redesign Tourism”, setting the stage for the industry’s next wave of innovation and transformation.

Morpheus largely alleged that Brunello Cucinelli was violating EU sanctions on the sale of luxury goods to Russia based on import data, interviews with former executives, and photos from secret shoppers showing the company’s active presence in Russia.

Morpheus also said that Brunello Cucinelli “has resorted to aggressive discounting to manage bloated inventory” and “trades at ~46x next year’s earnings, a higher multiple than any luxury peer, despite slowing revenue growth, average operating margins, and rising competition.”

Blue Orca Capital published on Aya Gold & Silver (Toronto: AYA — CAD$2.08 billion), a Canadian silver mining company with operations in Morocco. Blue Orca alleged that “there is overwhelming evidence that Aya inflated its silver resource at Zgounder, its only producing asset, by over 100%, potentially reflecting as many as 50+ million phantom ounces.” Blue Orca specifically raised concerns about the legitimacy of a bullish December 2021 resource estimate report for the company’s mine. Blue Orca alleged that the resource estimate was “created by a conflicted geologist who appears to be a close business partner of the CEO” and had other anomalies which suggest the report data was manipulated to show artificially inflated silver reserves.

Jehoshaphat Research published a 54-page report on goeasy (Toronto: GSY — CAD$2.80 billion), a Canadian subprime lender. Jehoshaphat alleged the company “is sitting on ~$300m worth of improperly delayed credit losses and unreported serious delinquencies that have been buried in the balance sheet like dead bodies in the snow.” Jehoshaphat highlighted that the company has recently “changed its accounting rules for charge-offs, credit risk scoring, and expense recognition,” which has “pushed hundreds of millions worth of bad debt and other expenses into the future.” Jehoshaphat also raised concerns about the recent departures of the company’s CEO and CFO, as well as high insider selling by company executives.

Fugazi Research published on Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA — $75 million), an Irish holding company that owns four association soccer clubs and one volleyball club. Fugazi raised concerns about the company’s recent pivot to a “digital asset treasury” model that would likely lead to high levels of shareholder dilution.

BMF Reports published on US Gold Corp (NASDAQ: USAU — $233 million), a Nevada-based gold miner that BMF alleged is engaged in paid stock promotion and has “heavy dilution risk ahead.”

Should I buy TruAlt Bioenergy stock?

It is India’s top ethanol producer and is also working on biogas, aviation fuel, and petrol pumps. The company is making good money and profits, but it has some risks like heavy loans, depending too much on government rules, and relying on only a few plants and big buyers. The company could grow well because India is pushing for clean fuel, but it is also risky, so it’s safer to invest only a small amount instead of a big one.

TruAlt Bioenergy earnings results (Financials)

Is TruAlt Bioenergy stock good to buy? (bull case & bear case)

Bull Case:

The company earned ₹1,907 crore in revenue in FY25 and a net profit of ₹146.6 crore.

Its operating profit margin (EBITDA) improved from 14% in FY23 to 16.2% in FY25.

Return on Equity (ROE) is around 28%, which is higher than many other companies in this sector.

It has a big ethanol capacity of 2,000 KLPD, with about 1,800 KLPD already running, making it the largest producer in India.

The company is also moving into biogas, aviation fuel, and fuel retailing, which can bring more business in the future.

Bear Case:

It’s 80% of its revenue comes from ethanol, so changes in government rules or raw material prices can hurt profits.

The company has loans of about ₹1,557 crore compared to equity of ₹769 crore, giving it a high debt-to-equity ratio of ~2.0.

Even though it has a capacity of 2,000 KLPD, it is not using the full amount yet, which reduces earnings.

TruAlt Bioenergy IPO Promoter Holding

Vijaykumar Murugesh Nirani, Vishal Nirani and Sushmitha Vijaykumar Nirani are the company promoters.

Objects of the Issue (TruAlt Bioenergy IPO Objectives)

₹150.68 crore will be used to upgrade the ethanol plant (300 KLPD at TBL Unit 4) so it can also use grains as raw material.

₹425.00 crore will be used for the company’s day-to-day business needs.

The rest will be used for the company’s general purposes.

Singapore was voted in at the 42nd session of the ICAO held in Montreal, Canada, on Saturday (Sep 27) evening.
In a media statement on Sunday, Siow said: “Singapore is honoured to be re-elected to the ICAO council.
The assembly also votes on the ICAO council, which is the organisation’s permanent governing body that continually sets direction and adopts standards, amongst other work.
It received the lowest number of votes in the first ballot – 87 – short of the 93 required.","[SINGAPORE] The city-state has once again been elected to the council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), garnering the highest number of votes of any council member thus far.

Singapore was voted in at the 42nd session of the ICAO held in Montreal, Canada, on Saturday (Sep 27) evening. The country was represented by a delegation led by Acting Minister for Transport Jeffrey Siow.

In a media statement on Sunday, Siow said: “Singapore is honoured to be re-elected to the ICAO council. The strong international leadership by ICAO, with support from member states and industry, will enable governments, industry and international organisations to work together to address challenges ahead.”

In a LinkedIn post on Sunday morning, he added that Singapore had been re-elected with “a record number of votes”.

Siow, who is also senior minister of state for Finance, said: “In a world where rules matter less and small countries find it harder to exert influence, we have to work harder with like-minded partners to secure our interests. Well functioning international organisations like ICAO remain important platforms for us to build a world that Singapore can continue to do well and prosper.”

The city-state was first elected to the ICAO council in 2003 and has been a member of the body ever since.

ICAO is an agency of the United Nations that is responsible for developing and maintaining the standards for aviation, including those related to safety, air navigation and security.

Formed in 1944, it became the UN’s official aviation standards agency in 1947.

The ICAO assembly is its policymaking entity. It is made up of representatives from ICAO’s 193 member states and gathers every three years to further the organisation’s broader work, such as adopting resolutions and deciding its priorities.

The assembly also votes on the ICAO council, which is the organisation’s permanent governing body that continually sets direction and adopts standards, amongst other work.

Singapore led with 176 votes

Balloting for the council is held three times for different categories:

Countries of chief importance in air transport

Countries that make the largest contribution to the provision of facilities for international civil air navigation

States ensuring geographic representation.

The first two sections of balloting have concluded, with 22 of the 36-seat council now elected. The remainder will be voted in with the final ballot on Sep 30.

Singapore, eligible for election under the second ballot, won with 176 votes. Saudi Arabia was the second highest with 175, and Brazil was third with 167.

Russia failed to be elected. It received the lowest number of votes in the first ballot – 87 – short of the 93 required. It lost its spot in 2022, following the outbreak of the Ukraine war.

At the opening of the assembly on Sep 23, ICAO council president, Salvatore Sciacchitano, reiterated the need for strengthening oversight, modernising infrastructure and implementing the organisation’s standards, as well as accelerating towards its 2050 goal of net-zero carbon emissions.

“A system currently built to serve 4.6 billion passengers will not accommodate three times that number, unless we ensure its transformation,” he said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/df32406a617c1a0ce3d090e3300c5494d8749248aea9f9560058a94582695f0e?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-09-28 06:56:41.664822

Currently, most commercial SAF production relies on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology, which converts waste oils into fuel.
He urged industry stakeholders to accelerate investments and build the infrastructure necessary to scale up SAF production rapidly.
Energy producers and investors are called upon to align their strategies with global decarbonization goals to ensure the rapid commercialization of SAF technologies.
The study serves as a critical reminder that while SAF feedstocks are abundant, turning this potential into actual production hinges on the acceleration of technologies, infrastructure readiness, and cross-sector collaboration.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in collaboration with Worley Consulting, released a study on September 23, 2025, confirming that the main barrier to achieving the airline industry’s goal of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 is not a shortage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock but rather the slow pace of rollout for SAF production technologies. According to the study, sufficient sustainable feedstock exists globally, meeting strict environmental standards without causing adverse land use changes, to support the required 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050.

Currently, most commercial SAF production relies on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology, which converts waste oils into fuel. The study pointed out the need to accelerate the development of new technologies to diversify SAF production methods, especially power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies that rely on renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure. It also highlighted competition for biomass feedstock among various hard-to-decarbonize sectors, stressing the importance of prioritizing aviation in feedstock allocation.

IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, emphasized that feedstock availability should no longer be viewed as a limiting factor. He urged industry stakeholders to accelerate investments and build the infrastructure necessary to scale up SAF production rapidly. “We now have unequivocal evidence that the challenge lies in technology deployment, not feedstock,” Walsh said. “To meet net zero goals by 2050, shovels must be in the ground now.”

The study projects that biomass feedstock could sustainably supply over 300 million tonnes of bio-SAF annually by mid-century, with the remainder of the 500 million tonnes coming from PtL fuels. However, unlocking the full potential will require coordinated global policies, enhanced supply chain logistics, infrastructure investment, and technological innovation.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted SAF’s potential to create jobs, boost local economies, and support energy security. She stressed the critical need for governments, investors, and industry stakeholders to collaborate on policy frameworks and investment incentives to de-risk projects and hasten the development of a fully functioning SAF market.

The report underscores regional leadership from key global players such as North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN countries as vital to scaling up production and meeting global demand. Energy producers and investors are called upon to align their strategies with global decarbonization goals to ensure the rapid commercialization of SAF technologies.

The study serves as a critical reminder that while SAF feedstocks are abundant, turning this potential into actual production hinges on the acceleration of technologies, infrastructure readiness, and cross-sector collaboration. With only 25 years remaining to meet the ambitious net zero target, timely action and focused investments are paramount to decarbonizing the aviation sector and securing a sustainable future for air travel.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Iata-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 06:56:53.049911

This gives immediate confidence to airlines, freight and heavy industry that local feedstocks meet global benchmarks,” Mr Galligan said.
“This footprint shortens supply chains, cuts costs, and de-risks a rapid scale-up of domestic low-carbon liquid fuels.
Towns like Cairns, Mackay, Bundaberg, Townsville, Childers and Tully could become bio precinct hubs, producing clean liquid fuels, biogas and renewable electricity.
The sugar industry already supports 20,000 jobs and contributes $4.4 billion annually to the economy, and can grow even further.","The government’s new 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program commits $1.1 billion “to help unlock the vast economic opportunities on offer from low carbon liquid fuels” such as biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

Canegrowers chief executive officer Dan Galligan said Queensland sugar was ahead of the game, with sustainability and infrastructure advantages already locked in.

“Almost half of Queensland’s sugarcane is recognised by the world’s three biggest sustainability gatekeepers as a global leader in sustainable farming. This gives immediate confidence to airlines, freight and heavy industry that local feedstocks meet global benchmarks,” Mr Galligan said.

He also highlighted the industry’s infrastructure advantage, saying Queensland’s cane rail network could be the backbone of a bioeconomy that could collect and process feedstocks from right across the state.

“Our growing region stretches along the Queensland coastline, alongside major population hubs. We also have a cane rail network stretching thousands of kilometres, linking farms to mills and multiple deep-water ports,” Mr Galligan said.

“This footprint shortens supply chains, cuts costs, and de-risks a rapid scale-up of domestic low-carbon liquid fuels. “ With sugarcane feedstock alone, Queensland could deliver more than 30% of Australia’s aviation fuel demand.

“This is about positioning Queensland as the nation’s biofuels hub. It means cleaner fuels for airlines and motorists, thousands of new jobs, and billions in regional investment.”

Australian Sugar Manufacturers (ASM) chief executive officer Ash Salardini said the Federal Government deserved credit for seizing the moment.

“The government must be commended for grabbing this once-in-a-generation opportunity with both hands,” he said.

“We have to get the foundations right on biofuels. The challenge isn’t technology anymore – it’s standing up a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective supply chain.

“This agenda requires a laser-like focus on targeted support for feedstock logistics and infrastructure. Without it, we risk building a biorefining capability that relies on imported feedstock – swapping our reliance on imported liquid fossil fuels with a vulnerability for imported bioethanol from places like Brazil and India.”

Both Canegrowers and ASM said the benefits for Queensland were enormous if government and industry got the model right.

Towns like Cairns, Mackay, Bundaberg, Townsville, Childers and Tully could become bio precinct hubs, producing clean liquid fuels, biogas and renewable electricity.

Feedstock supply chains would be the source of tens of thousands of new jobs in farming, transport, processing, manufacturing and logistics.

The sugar industry already supports 20,000 jobs and contributes $4.4 billion annually to the economy, and can grow even further.

“If we get it right, we’ll unlock thousands of jobs across regional Queensland and beyond, demonstrating that the net-zero ambition will bring good paying jobs to regional communities across Australia,” Mr Salardini said.",https://mareebaexpress-4634.kxcdn.com/img/containers/assets/news/lan_sugar-biofuel-1758520674.jpg/c2244eb03b0d2d5057cdf317b99ee4f4.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 06:57:01.211671

This isn't the first time Jenner has faced criticism for her private jet use.
While people are urged to recycle, conserve water, and switch to reusable bags, the emissions from a single private flight can outweigh the lifetime impact of those daily choices.
Still, many argue that meaningful change requires policy shifts — from taxing private jet travel to investing in greener alternatives that make sustainable choices accessible to everyone.","Kylie Jenner is once again under fire for her use of private jets — and this time, the backlash is tied to flight data that has left social media users stunned.

A TikTok from Monique and Alfredo (@dr.a1andmonique) broke down the reality star's Sept. 7 trips to Budapest and Paris, noting that the journey racked up an estimated $31,000 in fuel costs and a hefty carbon footprint.

The video uses public flight radar data to track Jenner's travel, pointing out that both her private jet and one belonging to Travis Scott landed back in Los Angeles within hours of each other. The pair have two children together from an on-off romantic relationship.

This isn't the first time Jenner has faced criticism for her private jet use. In 2022, she drew similar backlash, posting an Instagram picture with the caption ""You wanna take mine or yours?"" in reference to her plane and Scott's.

Short-haul flights are especially problematic because takeoffs and landings create disproportionately high emissions, making them far more polluting per mile than commercial flights. They also carry far fewer passengers, resulting in a significantly higher pollution-per-passenger ratio.

The outrage online is tied to a bigger concern: Luxury air travel by celebrities contributes massively to the release of planet-warming pollution while ordinary people are being encouraged to reduce energy use, drive electric cars, or fly less.

By contrast, more sustainable options are increasingly available — like commercial airlines investing in cleaner fuels, or even eco-conscious flight alternatives such as high-speed rail.

Critics have pointed out that the issue isn't just about one celebrity — it reflects a growing gap between individual climate responsibility and the behavior of the ultra-wealthy.

While people are urged to recycle, conserve water, and switch to reusable bags, the emissions from a single private flight can outweigh the lifetime impact of those daily choices. That imbalance fuels frustration and calls for stronger regulations on private aviation.

There are solutions on the horizon, though. Some airlines and innovators are exploring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and electric short-haul planes, while improved public transportation options could also help reduce transportation pollution.

Still, many argue that meaningful change requires policy shifts — from taxing private jet travel to investing in greener alternatives that make sustainable choices accessible to everyone.

On TikTok, viewers expressed frustration.

One commenter wrote: ""It's so wasteful.""

Another joked: ""Don't worry I've already offset the emissions with my paper straw.""

Kehadiran kargo ini menjadi tindak lanjut arahan pemerintah melalui Menteri ESDM Bahlil Lahadalia, dalam mendorong kolaborasi pemenuhan kebutuhan BBM antara Pertamina dan badan usaha (BU) swasta.

Sebelumnya, Pertamina bersama BU swasta telah menggelar dua kali pertemuan, yakni pada 19 dan 23 September lalu.

Dalam pertemuan perdana, BU atau penyedia BBM swasta menyatakan kesediaan untuk membeli produk BBM berbasis base fuel yakni BBM yang belum dicampur aditif maupun zat pewarna.

Kesepakatan juga tercapai terkait mekanisme harga menggunakan sistem open book, serta pelibatan pihak independen atau join surveyor guna memastikan kualitas produk bahan bakar yang hendak diperjual belikan. Langkah ini dinilai penting untuk menjamin transparansi dan kepastian pasokan di lapangan.

Pertamina Buka Ruang Kolaborasi

Pj. Corporate Secretary Pertamina Patra Niaga, Roberth MV Dumatubun mengatakan, Pertaminq telah membuka ruang kolaborasi dengan semangat saling menghormati aturan dan tata kelola.

“Pertamina Patra Niaga menawarkan mekanisme penyediaan pasokan dengan menggunakan prosedur yang ada. Harapan kami, BU swasta dapat berkolaborasi dengan niat baik, sambil tetap menghormati aturan dan aspek kepatuhan yang berlaku di BUMN,” jelas Roberth lewat keterangan pers, Rabu 24 September 2025.

Ia menambahkan, seluruh aspek komersial dengan pihak terkait akan dibahas lebih lanjut. Hal ini difokuskan agar mekanisme tetap berada dalam koridor hukum, regulasi pemerintah, serta prinsip good corporate governance.

BU Swasta Siap Lanjutkan Proses

Dalam pertemuan kedua pada Selasa silam, seluruh BU swasta hadir, termasuk Vivo, AKR, Exxon, BP, dan Shell. Beberapa di antaranya masih membutuhkan waktu berkoordinasi dengan kantor pusat global.

Segenap pihak BU swasta juga tetap menyatakan komitmennya untuk segera menyampaikan kebutuhan kuota tambahan.

Lebih lanjut, Pertamina Patra Niaga turut memastikan kargo base fuel yang dibutuhkan telah tiba sesuai spesifikasi Direktorat Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi (Ditjen Migas).

Adapun kualitas pasokan akan dipastikan melalui join surveyor, disertai pertemuan satu per satu dengan masing-masing BU swasta untuk membahas lebih detail soal kebutuhan dan rencana distribusi ke masyarakat.

Roberth menegaskan, seluruh rangkaian pertemuan dilakukan atas dasar niat baik dan semangat kolaborasi dalam menjaga ketersediaan energi bagi masyarakat.

“Harapan kami adalah segera mendapatkan informasi kebutuhan pasokan dari BU swasta, sehingga penyaluran ke masyarakat bisa berjalan lancar. Langkah ini sejalan dengan arahan Menteri ESDM agar stok BBM, baik subsidi maupun nonsubsidi, dapat segera tersedia sesuai kebutuhan masyarakat,” tutupnya.

The stock just hit a new 52-week high, riding a wave of optimism driven by management’s aggressive share buyback plan and a boost in analyst outlooks. Adding to the momentum, the company is benefiting from broader market tailwinds, including a reduction in Russian petroleum exports that has shaken up the sector and put a spotlight on domestic players like Par Pacific. Looking back over the past year, Par Pacific Holdings has delivered a standout run fueled by rising investor confidence. The share price has climbed over 108% during this stretch and more than quadrupled over five years, which is a stark contrast to its sharp, short-term swings. This recent surge follows a season of upbeat analyst commentary and signals that momentum, at least for now, is building. But here is the real question: after such a substantial run, does Par Pacific still have room to grow, or has the market already priced in all the good news?

Most Popular Narrative: 12.6% Overvalued

The most widely followed narrative concludes that Par Pacific Holdings is trading above its fair value. This collective outlook signals concern that recent gains may have gone too far ahead of the company's fundamentals.

The strategic partnership with Mitsubishi and ENEOS, along with the upcoming SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) project launch, positions Par Pacific for growth in renewable fuels. This enhances market access, leverages global feedstock procurement expertise, and is expected to positively contribute to earnings and net margin expansion starting in 2026.

Ready to see what powers this market call? There is a surprising mix of aggressive margin expansion, rapid profit transformation, and a significant multiple uplift driving analyst conviction here. Ever wondered which specific improvements underpin this swift turn toward profitability? Discover which bold projections are behind the “overvalued” label in the full narrative.

Result: Fair Value of $33 (OVERVALUED)

However, operational concentration in Hawaii and aging refinery assets could quickly undermine the upbeat forecasts if disruptions or costly outages occur.

Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model

Looking at things from a different angle, our DCF model currently sees Par Pacific shares as trading above fair value. This takes into account expected future cash flows and not just earnings multiples. Could market optimism be running too far ahead, or is something being missed?

The global celebration brought together leaders, policymakers, and industry experts to discuss strategies for building a more resilient and inclusive tourism sector.

The event was hosted in collaboration with Malaysia’s Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture and coincided with the 7th World Tourism Conference. Delegates from across the globe gathered in the historic city to share innovative ideas and showcase sustainable practices that align with global tourism development goals.

Global Leaders Call for Sustainable Transformation

The opening ceremony featured remarks from Malaysian officials and international representatives. Malaysia’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, H.E. Dato Sri Tiong King Sing, welcomed participants and underscored the importance of tourism in promoting resilience and inclusivity. The Right Honourable Dato’ Sri Haji Fadillah bin Yusof, Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, officiated the opening on behalf of the Prime Minister, stressing the need for sustainable growth supported by innovation and cooperation.

In his official address, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres stated, “Tourism is a powerful driver of transformation. It creates jobs, fuels local economies, and builds bridges across cultures. Yet, it must be sustainable to protect the very places and communities it celebrates. Let’s harness tourism as a force for resilience, sustainability, and shared progress.”

UN Tourism Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili emphasized the global significance of the Melaka gathering. “World Tourism Day 2025 in Melaka has shown the world that tourism can be a force for good when guided by sustainability and inclusivity.

The celebrations in Melaka included panel discussions, cultural showcases, and exhibitions focusing on sustainable tourism strategies. These sessions emphasized the importance of investing in education and skills development, particularly for women, youth, and marginalized communities. Delegates also discussed accelerating digital transformation in tourism, supporting local economies, and reinforcing cultural heritage through tourism-driven exchange.

“Growth must be inclusive and resilient, underpinned by sustainability, innovation, and global cooperation,” said the Deputy Prime Minister, noting that Malaysia aims to serve as a model for responsible tourism development in the Asia-Pacific region.

The 7th World Tourism Conference, held alongside the World Tourism Day celebrations, provided a framework for international collaboration on sustainable tourism. Discussions centered on digital transformation, community-based tourism, and climate-neutral travel solutions, aligning with the year’s theme of “Tourism and Sustainable Transformation.” The conference also highlighted how technology and innovation can address challenges in tourism while expanding opportunities for growth.

Aero, a boutique airline, now offers a 12-passenger Gulfstream IV flight from Van Nuys to Kahului at a starting price of $5,495 each way.

The flights operate as ""scheduled charters,"" a loophole that allows Aero to sidestep Van Nuys Airport's ban on scheduled service. The airport, considered a haven for private jet users, has long been shielded from commercial operations. That exclusivity is part of why the move has sparked backlash, with some wealthy jet owners and residents worried about increased traffic.

Critics point out that small-scale charter flights contribute to aviation's already hefty environmental footprint. Private and semi-private flights emit more planet-warming carbon pollution per passenger than commercial airlines. And with AI-fueled tech expansions driving electricity demand and rising temperatures across the globe, lavish short-haul flights highlight a disconnect between luxury and sustainability.

Communities have seen similar battles before. For example, JSX's operations in New Jersey's Teterboro Airport prompted regulatory pushback, while airlines like Southwest and American have lobbied against scheduled charters to protect their turf.

In fact, the California EPA found that children living in Lake Balboa near Van Nuys Airport are in the 90th percentile of lead exposure in the state.

While Aero's flights may appeal to a small, affluent audience, the controversy underscores the need for better climate-friendly aviation policies. Alternatives, such as electric planes and investments in sustainable aviation fuel, could make a difference.

The airline, which had been navigating a post-pandemic recovery, now faces new headwinds as it seeks to restore operational stability and passenger confidence.

Labour Dispute hits Peak Travel Season

The strike by cabin crew union CUPE in August led to the cancellation of over 3,000 flights, impacting both domestic and international schedules during the critical summer travel window. Passengers faced delays, refunds, and re-bookings, while the airline scrambled to mitigate reputational fallout. Although the labour dispute has since moved to binding arbitration, the operational and financial effects were swift and severe.

Revised Outlook Reflects Caution

Air Canada has now revised its expectations for the remainder of 2025. While the airline stopped short of painting a bleak picture, it acknowledged that the disruption forced a rethink of capacity plans and cost forecasts. Executives pointed to continued strength in passenger demand but noted rising unit costs and lower-than-expected cash flow projections. The carrier is taking a more measured approach to network growth heading into the winter season.

Updated guidance now pegs full-year adjusted EBITDA between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, down from an earlier range of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. Capacity growth has been revised to 0.5% to 1.5%, while unit costs are expected to rise to 14.60 to 14.70 cents per seat mile. Free cash flow is projected between $50 million and $150 million, with the labour disruption estimated to have cost the airline $375 million.

Focus Shifts to Recovery and Stability

Despite the setback, Air Canada remains focused on long-term recovery. Management highlighted ongoing investments in fleet modernisation and digital infrastructure. However, rebuilding customer trust and avoiding further industrial unrest will be key as the airline looks to end the year on steadier ground.

Lebih dari 40 ribu putra-putri bangsa, bernaung di Pertamina Group. Perwira (sebutan bagi Pekerja Pertamina) berkarya dari Sabang sampai Merauke, bahkan hingga ke wilayah kerja Pertamina di luar negeri, untuk memastikan tersedianya energi di Indonesia.

Vice President Corporate Communication PT Pertamina (Persero) Fadjar Djoko Santoso mengungkapkan, wilayah operasional Pertamina yang berada di seluruh Nusantara menjadi bagian tak terpisahkan dari kebutuhan tenaga kerja. Untuk memenuhi kebutuhan tersebut, Pertamina secara berkala merekrut putra-putri daerah, guna menjalankan bisnis serta memastikan produktivitas dan kehandalan operasional berjalan dengan baik.

“Kami menyadari, energi merupakan kebutuhan dasar dan hajat hidup orang banyak. Sehingga, Pertamina mempersiapkan Perwira, tak hanya untuk sigap dalam menghadapi tantangan energi, juga melayani pelanggan dan konsumen Pertamina dengan lebih baik,” jelas Fadjar.

Peningkatan layanan terus dilakukan dengan berbagai perbaikan, agar dapat memenuhi kebutuhan energi selama 24 jam per hari, dari berbagai aspek. Perwira dari sektor hulu, pengolahan, distribusi, hingga berada di garda depan penjualan ke konsumen, memahami pentingnya layanan terbaik bagi masyarakat.

Salah satu contoh peningkatan layanan melalui SPBU Signature, yang memberikan pengalaman baru bagi konsumen saat mengisi bahan bakar.

Berlokasi di Jalan Sultan Iskandar Muda, Jakarta Selatan ini memilik fasilitas umum yang lengkap, mulai dari musala bersih dengan perlengkapan salat (mukena, sarung, dan Al-Quran), area wudhu, hingga toilet yang bersih. Selain itu, keramahan Operator SPBU makin terasa karena Operator dapat menawarkan paket semir ban gratis.

Pertamina juga terus memperluas jaringan gas rumah tangga, sebagai diversifikasi energi yang dapat mempermudah masyarakat menggunakan gas alam untuk huniannya.

Pertamina juga berinovasi pada energi transisi dan ramah lingkungan seperti Biosolar, Pertamax Green, hingga yang terbaru Sustainable Aviation Fuel, menjadi langkah Pertamina untuk menjaga kelestarian lingkungan.

Seiring dengan meningkatnya kebutuhan energi, Pertamina bahkan terus membuka lapangan kerja sejalan pengembangan fasilitas-fasilitas operasi Pertamina. Sepanjang tahun 2024, Pertamina menjaring 1.603 talenta baru yang tak sekedar bekerja, namun terus dibekali pemahaman dan keterampilan sehingga produktivitasnya selalu meningkat.

“Beberapa tahun terakhir, Pertamina terus melakukan rekrutmen pekerja baru. Hal ini dimaksudkan untuk menjaga tingkat produktivitas, kaderisasi dan memastikan hadirnya talenta-talenta untuk mendukung peningkatan layanan Pertamina kepada masyarakat,” ujar Fadjar.

Salah seorang Perwira yakni Ferdy Saputra, saat ini bertugas di Kilang Pertamina Internasional Refinery Unit VII Kasim (Papua). Sudah hampir dua tahun, ia meninggalkan keluarganya yang tinggal di Jakarta, untuk mengabdikan dirinya di wilayah timur Indonesia.

Bekerja jauh, ia tak leluasa untuk sering pulang. Dalam satu bulan, Ferdy hanya bisa sekali pulang ke Jakarta, sesuai ketentuan Perusahaan. Namun, ijin libur tak serta merta diberikan terutama bila operasional kilang ataupun situasi tidak memungkinkan.

“Saya memahami pentingnya keberlangsungan energi, terutama di Kilang Kasim yang kapasitas pengolahannya terbatas namun sangat diperlukan untuk menopang suplai energi di Papua. Tanggung jawab berada disini cukup besar, Perwira Kasim harus menjaga operasional sekaligus menjaga stabilitas sosial dengan masyarakat,” jelasnya.

Yang terpenting baginya, Ferdy menambahkan, adalah menjaga keandalan operasional kilang untuk berjalan aman, lancar dan berproduksi optimal meskipun berada jauh dari perkotaan. Ia pun bangga, dapat berkontribusi bagi masyarakat, turut membangun ekonomi di Papua Barat Daya, serta memberi energi bagi kebutuhan nasional.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Seluruh upaya tersebut sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.(RA)",https://www.dunia-energi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG-20250927-WA0044.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 15:56:40.336349

“Very soon we will be putting up coal blocks with potential for underground coal gasification up for auction,” said Additional Coal Secretary Rupinder Brar, highlighting the government’s intent to integrate UCG into India’s commercial coal mining ecosystem.

These blocks will be offered under the Commercial Coal Mine Auction regime, marking a significant policy shift towards enabling in-situ gasification of deep-seated coal reserves.

UCG: A Cleaner Way to Tap Deep Coal Reserves

With nearly 43% of India’s coal reserves located at depths greater than 300 meters, UCG presents a viable method to convert otherwise unmineable coal into syngas, which can be processed into hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, synthetic diesel, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), and petrochemical feedstocks.

UCG involves the controlled combustion of coal seams underground using oxidants like air or oxygen, eliminating the need for traditional mining. The government is targeting gasification of 100 million tonnes of coal by 2030, positioning UCG as a cornerstone of its energy strategy.

Inter-Ministerial Committee to Oversee UCG Guidelines

To facilitate this transformation, an inter-ministerial committee has been established to draft mining guidelines and integrate UCG into the auction process. The committee comprises experts from the Coal Ministry, DGH, DGMS, Central Ground Water Board, CMPDIL, and the Coal Controller Organisation (CCO).

Coal Gasification Incentive Scheme: Rs 2,500 Cr RfP to be Issued

In parallel, the Ministry of Coal will issue a Request for Proposal (RfP) next week to allocate the remaining Rs 2,500 crore under its Rs 8,500 crore coal gasification incentive scheme. The scheme, launched in 2023, has already allocated around Rs 6,000 crore across three project categories:

Category I (PSU/JVs):

Bharat Coal Gasification and Chemicals Ltd (CIL-BHEL JV) – Rs 1,350 crore for Lakhanpur, Odisha

CIL-GAIL JV – Rs 1,350 crore for Sonepur Bazari, West Bengal

Category II (Private and PSU Projects):

New Era Cleantech Solution Pvt Ltd

Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL)

Greta Energy Ltd

Category III (Demonstration Projects):

New Era Cleantech’s coal-to-ethanol project in Chandrapur, Maharashtra – Rs 100 crore

Challenges Remain, But Opportunities Expand

While underground coal gasification remains technologically complex and capital-intensive, the government believes the auction of UCG-designated blocks will unlock private sector innovation and investments in large-scale gasification technologies.

Though India has yet to commission a commercial-scale UCG plant, the recent pilot project at Kasta coal block in Jharkhand—executed by Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) in collaboration with Canada’s Ergo Exergy Technologies Inc (EETI)—is a key step in demonstrating UCG’s feasibility.

Now, that incredible journey has officially come to an end. Boeing has closed the production line of this iconic jet, marking the conclusion of one of the most successful widebody aircraft programs in aviation history.

A Historic Chapter Closes

According to Boeing’s 2024 delivery records, the company handed over just one final 777-300ER this year. That delivery quietly closed the book on a legendary aircraft that has shaped commercial aviation since its debut in 2004.

The development was first reported by The Air Current and represents a major milestone—not only for Boeing, but for the entire airline industry.

The Aircraft That Changed the Game

When the 777-300ER entered service two decades ago, it revolutionized long-haul air travel. With a remarkable range of 7,370 nautical miles, powered by the mighty General Electric GE90 engines, it delivered what airlines had long been waiting for: a reliable, fuel-efficient, twin-engine aircraft that could carry nearly 400 passengers across oceans with ease.

It quickly became the world’s best-selling widebody aircraft. Carriers from every corner of the globe added it to their fleets, cementing Boeing’s reputation for engineering innovation and market foresight. Its balance of performance, passenger comfort, and operational efficiency made it the backbone of international routes for years.

The Shift Toward the 777X

Despite Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope’s announcement in December about resuming production across several aircraft lines following a machinists’ strike, the 777-300ER will no longer roll off the assembly line.

The future now belongs to the 777X, Boeing’s next-generation widebody that carries forward the 777 legacy with new technology, improved aerodynamics, and advanced passenger comfort features.

Certification Challenges Ahead

Even as Boeing celebrates the legacy of the 777-300ER, the company faces ongoing regulatory hurdles. It has requested relief through October 2028 to achieve full compliance and retrofit delivered aircraft. These certification delays mirror challenges with the 737 Max 7 and Max 10 variants.

A key part of this process involves safety systems. While all 737 Max aircraft use similar Stall Management Yaw Damper (SMYD) systems, the Max 10 introduces an Enhanced Angle of Attack (EAOA) feature.

This improvement, designed in the aftermath of earlier Max accidents, aims to boost error detection in angle-of-attack data across the fleet. Boeing argues that without regulatory exemptions, its ability to roll out these safety upgrades could be slowed—leaving uncertainty around FAA decisions and timelines.

A Legacy That Will Endure

With the last 777-300ER now delivered, the aircraft takes its place in history as one of Boeing’s greatest successes. For airlines, crews, and millions of passengers who have flown aboard it, the jet represents more than just engineering excellence—it represents reliability, progress, and the thrill of global connection.

The skies may no longer see new 777-300ERs taking flight, but its legacy will live on for decades, both through the aircraft still in service and the new 777X generation it inspired.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/boeing-777x-production_70961.jpg?resize=800%2C532&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-27 23:56:21.179848

Speaking at the opening of World Tourism Day (WTD) 2025 and the seventh World Tourism Conference (WTC) 2025, Fadillah, who represented Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, announced that the country’s first biomass-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility is scheduled to begin operations in 2027.

“The elephant in the room is tourism emissions, especially from aviation, which accounts for half of the sector’s direct emissions. No country can shift an industry of this scale alone, so multilateral cooperation is crucial for a sustainable future,” he said in his keynote address at a hotel in Taman Melaka Raya.

Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing and Melaka Chief Minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh were also present.

SAF, produced from waste oils and agricultural residues, is seen as a key tool in cutting aviation emissions. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates global production will double to two million tonnes this year, but that still makes up less than 1% of total airline fuel use.

Fadillah said Malaysia’s tourism strategy places environmental protection at its core. As one of the world’s 12 megadiverse nations, Malaysia is home to more than 15,000 plant species and 175,000 fauna species. “We must protect rainforests, mangroves and coral reefs not only as a national duty but a global responsibility,” he said, adding that healthy ecosystems also attract visitors and support local livelihoods.

Highlighting Johor’s Mersing as a success story, he said the former fishing village is now a pioneer of sustainable coastal tourism and will soon host Malaysia’s first UN Tourism-recognised observatory under the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO).

He said the country is prioritising high-value tourism segments such as nature-based travel, adventure tourism, Muslim-friendly services, medical and wellness tourism, educational journeys, business events and digital nomad hubs. “The backbone of our plan is to grow meaningfully, sustainably and with resilience,” he added.

Meanwhile, Tiong urged the industry to move beyond rhetoric. “This cannot be another feel-good meeting where we shake hands, make statements and return a year later to the same unresolved issues and call it ‘progress’,” he said.

Tiong stressed that innovation and measurable outcomes are essential to tackle issues such as over-tourism, inequality and environmental strain. He pointed to local models such as Sabah’s Miso Walai Homestay, which safeguards rainforests while supporting 350 families, and Penang’s conservation-driven initiatives, including the Penang Heritage Trust.

To strengthen accountability, he said his ministry is working with the Statistics Department to pilot UN Tourism’s sustainability indicators and embed them in the Tourism Satellite Account. Businesses are also being encouraged to adopt benchmarks such as GSTC, ESG, B-Corp and INSTO.

This year, five Malaysian hotels won ASEAN Green Hotel Awards. “Growth alone is no longer enough. We must protect ecosystems, ease congestion, spread visitor flows and ensure value stays with local communities. Sustainable, inclusive transformation is not optional but essential,” Tiong said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-4.png,N,,2025-09-27 10:56:16.070700

Operated by a cooperative of local farmers, the plant will use pig and cattle manure along with other agricultural residues from the region.
However, liquefied biogas (Bio-LNG) and regional gas grids are growing in importance, offering new opportunities for industry and transport connections.","Biogas Västra Skaraborg AB (BVS) has officially begun building its first combined biogas and gas upgrading plant in Vara, Sweden, with a groundbreaking ceremony marking the start of construction, reports Renewable Energy Magazine.

The facility, developed in partnership with EnviTec Plant Construction, is expected to produce up to 70 GWh of biomethane annually. “This is a real milestone for us in the Swedish market,” said Maurice Markerink, Managing Director of EnviTec Plant Construction.

Operated by a cooperative of local farmers, the plant will use pig and cattle manure along with other agricultural residues from the region. It is designed to process around 370,000 tonnes of feedstock every year. “With this project, we are fostering rural development and unlocking the potential of bioenergy production for transport, maritime, and industry sectors,” said Tomas Carlmon of BVS. He added that the plant would help make “Fully Green LBG” available across the Nordics.

The facility will feature five digesters with a total capacity of nearly 32,000 cubic metres. Each digester will handle feedstocks separately to ensure optimal processing. To maintain hygiene, the digestate will undergo heating at over 52°C for ten hours before storage. Heat exchangers and industrial heat pumps will improve energy efficiency by recycling heat, which also helps lower the carbon intensity of the biomethane.

The project also includes cooperation with Dutch bio-LNG specialist Nordsol. EnviTec’s EnviThan technology will upgrade biomethane to 98% methane, while Nordsol’s patented Flash-2-Sweep process will purify and liquefy it into bio-LNG without using chemicals or molecular sieves.

Backed by Sweden’s climate investment program Klimatklivet, the project is expected to make a significant contribution to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Klimatklivet, administered by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, supports large-scale investments in sustainable energy, agriculture, and transport solutions.

Sweden’s biomethane market is currently spread across small local and regional networks, with most gas transported by road in compressed form. However, liquefied biogas (Bio-LNG) and regional gas grids are growing in importance, offering new opportunities for industry and transport connections.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biogas-14.png,N,,2025-09-27 10:56:23.649635

For corporate customers, the Lufthansa Group integrates the same offset model into ticket prices for European flights, issuing CO₂ mitigation certificates for SAF contributions.","The Lufthansa Group’s loyalty program, Miles & More, is enhancing its sustainability focus by awarding both miles and Points to members who purchase CO₂-offsetting packages. These packages, available during booking, before departure, or even after flights, allow travelers to offset their flight-related emissions through a mix of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and contributions to certified climate protection projects. Members can also use previously earned miles to redeem these packages, adding flexibility and incentivizing more sustainable travel choices. Depending on the SAF share selected, travelers earn significantly more Points and Qualifying Points—up to 80 percent more, along with up to 20 percent additional HON Circle Points—accelerating their progress toward frequent flyer status or rewards.

The new offering complements the Green Fares tariff, introduced in 2023, which already provides bonus miles and Points for more sustainable bookings. According to Lufthansa Group Chief Commercial Officer Dieter Vranckx, the initiative reflects the company’s commitment to expanding customer options while responding to passenger demand for climate-conscious flying. He emphasized that the Group remains a global pioneer in creating incentives for sustainability.

CO₂-offsetting packages are accessible through the booking platforms of Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Lufthansa, and SWISS, as well as via the Miles & More app. Miles and Points are automatically credited, including retroactive recognition for packages booked since January 2025. The offsets are calculated using factors such as distance, fuel use, and travel class, with the SAF contribution integrated into Lufthansa Group operations within six months. The remainder supports an extensive portfolio of 18 high-quality climate projects worldwide, ranging from Gold Standard-certified nature-based initiatives to innovative technology-based solutions like biochar and CO₂ capture in concrete.

Since June 1, Airbus employees traveling domestically in Germany with Lufthansa have been booking the Lufthansa Group’s Sustainable Corporate Value Fare, a tailored business tariff that directly supports CO₂ offsetting. The fare mitigates up to 30 percent of each flight’s calculated emissions by funding the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which cuts lifecycle CO₂ output by around 80 percent compared to fossil kerosene. Lufthansa guarantees that every SAF contribution purchased is integrated into its operations within six months, ensuring a measurable climate impact. Beyond this fare, corporate clients can also engage in larger SAF procurement agreements, further advancing carbon reduction efforts. By embedding CO₂ offsetting into everyday travel, Lufthansa and Airbus are setting a new benchmark for sustainable business travel.

The Lufthansa Group has steadily expanded its portfolio of sustainable travel products and became the world’s first airline group to introduce Green Fares in February 2023. These fares allow passengers to offset their flight-related CO₂ emissions with a single click by combining 20 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use with 80 percent contributions to certified climate protection projects. Available on more than 730,000 flights per year within Europe and to North Africa, Green Fares can be booked in both Economy and Business Class across Lufthansa, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, SWISS, Edelweiss, Eurowings Discover, and Air Dolomiti. The fare also provides extra status miles and free rebooking, offering both sustainability and flexibility.

For corporate customers, the Lufthansa Group integrates the same offset model into ticket prices for European flights, issuing CO₂ mitigation certificates for SAF contributions. This initiative complements the Group’s long-term climate strategy, which aims to halve net CO₂ emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 and achieve full climate neutrality by 2050. The roadmap has been validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), making Lufthansa the first airline group in Europe to align its goals with the Paris Climate Agreement. To reach these targets, the Group is focusing on accelerated fleet modernization, expanded SAF deployment, optimized operations, and innovative offers that make sustainable flying accessible to both leisure and business travelers.",https://www.breakingtravelnews.com/images/sized/images/uploads/airline/Lufthansa-Group-Expands-Climate-Protection-Efforts-with-Loyalty-Benefits-for-CO₂-Offsetting-and-SAF-Use-1536x1024-700x467.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 10:56:30.259354

Finnair’s Innovation in Ancillary Bundles

In May 2025, Finnair became the first airline to fully implement Amadeus’ ‘native order’ technology, replacing legacy systems with a single integrated customer record. This shift enables more sophisticated, retail-style offers and marks a milestone in Finnair retail innovation 2025.

The airline introduced its first ancillary bundles in September. The debut package pairs seat selection with in-flight Wi-Fi connection at discounted rates during booking. The rollout will begin in selected European markets before expanding across all Finnair routes later this autumn.

While airlines offer bundles in various forms, they key innovation is Finnair’s use of the new-generation booking platform to create dynamic and personalised product combinations. Future bundles are expected to include lounge access, meals and priority boarding.

How it worked before

Previously, airlines relied on multiple records for a single journey: A Passenger Name Record (PNR) for bookings, an electronic ticket for the flight, and separate documents for every add-on, such as: baggage, meals, or Wi-Fi. This fragmented system was inefficient. If a flight changed, multiple records had to be updated manually, slowing the process for both passengers and airlines.

How it works now

Simpler self-service: Passengers can add extras like baggage or upgrades directly into the same record.

A future ‘journey pass’: One digital file could eventually replace tickets, boarding passes and receipts.

Better support during delays: With the full trip stored in one order, Finnair can rebook flights and update connecting services, such as taxis and hotels, more efficiently.

Personalised bundles: Airlines can combine products in flexible ways, similar to online shopping. For Example, the Finnair ancillary bundle pairing seat selection with in-flight Wi-Fi at a discounted price.

With the new system, everything is combined into a single ‘order’, recording different elements into one place for the entire journey. This make it easier to manage information and allowing the integration of more personalised services.

Finnair is Scaling Up SAF investment

In parallel with its retail initiatives like ancillary bundles, Finnair is expanding its Sustainable Aviation Fuel program, aiming to boost voluntary SAF purchases by 50% in 2025, while meeting the EU’s 2% SAF blending requirement. The mandate requires fuel suppliers must mix a minimum of 2% SAF into the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports starting in 2025, with the requirement set to rise progressively to 70% by 2050.

Passengers can also contribute directly. Since late 2024, Finnair has offered customers the option to co-fund SAF during the booing process. The first passenger-supported fuel purchase was completed in July 2025.

In September, the airline expanded its reach with the Finnair for Business SAF service, giving corporate and cargo clients the ability to co-invest in SAF. Using a ‘book-and-claim’ system, companies receive audited certificates for their sustainability reporting, aligning with Finnair SAF investment strategy goals.

Finnair is also engaged in SAF innovation. In August, the carrier partnered with Finnish technology company Liquid Sun, along with ABB, Fortum and Finavia, on a demonstration pilot to produce eSAF, a synthetic fuel made from atmospheric carbon and solar power.

Revenue Opportunities and Emission Commitment

The twin strategy of retail innovation and sustainability are closely linked. By introducing ancillary bundles, Finnair is opening new revenue channels, while its expanded SAF program underpins its Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) goals.

Finnair aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, relying on a mix of increased SAF use, operational efficiencies and eventual fleet renewal. By aligning retail innovation with its SAF investment strategy, the airline is working to balance commercial growth with long-term climate commitments in aviation.

""The elephant in the room is tourism emissions, especially from aviation, which accounts for half of the sector’s direct emissions.

""No country can shift an industry of this scale alone, so multilateral cooperation is crucial for a sustainable future,” he said when reading Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's keynote address at the opening of World Tourism Day (WTD) 2025 and the seventh World Tourism Conference (WTC) 2025 at a hotel in Taman Melaka Raya here on Saturday (Sept 27).

Also present were Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing and Melaka Chief Minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh.

In June, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projected SAF output to roughly double to two million tonnes this year, still just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel use.

With fuel forming the bulk of aviation emissions, SAF made from sustainable resources such as waste oils and agricultural residues remains a key decarbonisation tool.

Fadillah, who represented Anwar at the event, said Malaysia’s tourism strategy places environmental stewardship at its core.

""As one of the world’s 12 megadiverse nations, Malaysia is home to over 15,000 plant species and 175,000 species of fauna

""We must protect rainforests, mangroves and coral reefs not only as a national duty but a global responsibility”, he said, adding that healthy ecosystems become “natural magnets for tourists” while sustaining local livelihoods.

He highlighted Mersing, Johor, as proof of concept as once a humble fishing village, it is now a pioneer of sustainable coastal tourism and on track to host Malaysia’s first UN Tourism-recognised sustainable tourism observatory under the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories.

He said nature-based tourism is among the high-value segments Malaysia is prioritising, alongside adventure travel, Muslim-friendly services, medical and wellness offerings, educational journeys, business events and digital-nomad hub.

""The backbone of our plan is to grow meaningfully, sustainably and with resilience"" he added.

Meanwhile, Tiong, in his address, warned that the sector must confront hard truths and deliver measurable outcomes.

“This cannot be another feel-good meeting where we shake hands, make statements and return a year later to the same unresolved issues and call it ‘progress’.

""The WTD and WTC 2025 must break from old approaches. We cannot rely on yesterday’s methods to solve today’s problems.

""Innovation is no longer a luxury but it's a necessity,” he said.

He said global tourism faces mounting pressures, among others, over-tourism strains fragile sites, inequality limits local benefits and competitiveness now hinges on real change.

Tiong said solutions are already taking shape at home.

In Sabah, he said the Miso Walai Homestay safeguards rainforest ecosystems while supporting over 350 families.

""Penang's habitat reinvests tourism receipts into conservation and training, while the Penang Heritage Trust protects living heritage.

""Mersing’s upcoming UN-recognised observatory will add data-driven oversight to coastal sustainability efforts,"" he said.

Tiong said to track progress nationally, his ministry with the Statistics Department is piloting UN Tourism’s sustainability indicators (MST) with plans to embed them in the Tourism Satellite Account.

He encouraged businesses to adopt international benchmarks such as GSTC, ESG, B-Corp and INSTO participation, noting that five Malaysian hotels received Asean Green Hotel Awards this year.

NEW YORK, USA – His Majesty the King has expressed appreciation for American investors endorsing Eswatini as an ideal investment destination.

This too place yesterday during a business seminarhosted by the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry, held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.

Facilitated by the Eswatini Investment promotion Authority (EIPA), the seminar featured testimonials from US companies, highlighting Eswatini’s stable environment and high-return potential. His Majesty praised the commitments as a vote of confidence in the Kingdom’s vision for economic growth.

The Vice President for Global Public Policy, Environmental Sustainability, and Social Impact at The Coca-Cola Company, Michael Goltzman, delivered a strong endorsement. “It is a pleasure to be here on behalf of The Coca-Cola Company and our system, including 30 authorised franchise bottlers across Africa,” he said.

“Founded in the US, we have grown globally, producing and distributing locally. We have been in Africa since 1928 and in Eswatini for four decades. In 2024, our system contributed over US$10 billion in added value to African economies, supporting more than one million jobs through local sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution,” he said.

He noted Coca-Cola’s state-of-the-art facility in Eswatini, which manufactures and exports concentrates to over 24 African countries, employing more than 200 locals. “Eswatini offers efficient logistics, infrastructure, and ease of capital movement. Eswatini’s growth represents our growth, and we are thankful for the government’s support. We encourage others to explore these opportunities ” he urged.

Several US firms announced investment intentions, underscoring Eswatini’s appeal.

A representative from Powerlink International said: “We will bring micro-hydro units to Eswatini’s canal systems, which are among the most pristine assessed globally. Eswatini is our preferred place for micro-hydro and wave energy solutions.”

A member of Sun Africa added: “As the largest solar energy company operating abroad, we are working with the Minister of Electricity on comprehensive renewable energy projects to support energy and water sustainability, security and growth.”

A representative from GTI Energy, stated: “We are pleased to bring specialised technology converting waste into valuable products like power, fuels, chemicals, and ammonia, offering these to Eswatini.”

Speaking on the second day of the International Conference on Bio-energy and Technologies’ (IBET) ‘Transition to Net Zero’ session at Yashobhoomi, the Minister stressed the unique potential of bio-energy to be a pillar of energy security, create rural jobs, and drive climate action.

A message conveyed via video conference at IBET 2025 from Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, reaffirmed the commitment to the 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity goal, confirming that as of September 2025, India has already installed 251.5 GW of this capacity.

Bio-energy, Naik explained, is the critical missing links that can help India achieve its clean energy transition while simultaneously empowering its vast agricultural sector. By converting surplus agricultural residue, animal dung, and municipal waste into energy, the sector embodies a true ‘waste-to-wealth’ model, effectively turning farmers from traditional food providers (Annadata) into energy providers (Urjadata).

The Minister highlighted the remarkable progress already achieved under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. He stated that India has already surpassed one of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets years ahead of schedule.

“Currently, 50 per cent of country’s installed power capacity now comes from non-fossil fuel sources, placing India among the top renewable energy markets globally. Despite this early success, he cautioned that this momentum must be scaled up significantly. He underscored, “Reaching 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030 and net zero by 2070 requires bio-energy to play its full role.”

The Minister specifically urged policymakers, industries, innovators, and farmers to immediately scale up technologies, strengthen research and development (R&D), and ensure fair and robust biomass supply chains.

The core message from the conference was that bio-energy represents more than just a climate solution; it is a model for inclusive and sustainable growth. Investing in biogas and biomass projects directly empowers rural communities, Naik stated.

“By supporting these projects, we provide clean cooking solutions, involve women in sustainable livelihoods, and turn agricultural residues and waste into both energy and income.”

To accelerate this national transformation, the Government of India has launched a series of flagship initiatives. These include the National Bio-energy Programme, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme, the Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBAR-Dhan) initiative, the National Green Hydrogen Mission, and the SAMARTH Mission.

These programmes are designed to drive massive investment, foster innovation, and fast-track the adoption of bio-energy across the country. The Minister also noted India’s leading role internationally, actively engaging with BRICS, ASEAN, and the Global Biofuel Alliance, positioning the nation as a global hub for sustainable biofuels.

The conference also detailed the immense environmental benefits of advanced biofuels. Dr. SSV Ramakumar, Chairperson of IFGE (Sustainable Aviation Fuel Forum), discussed the significant carbon reduction potential of next-generation ethanol. He pointed out that while first-generation ethanol reduces the carbon footprint from 94 CO2 equivalents per megajoule to 55, “with second-generation ethanol, the carbon footprint will come down to below 20 CO2 equivalent per megajoule of energy.” This vastly increases its power in achieving net-zero goals.

Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof, the Deputy Prime Minister, has emphasized the importance of these initiatives and the need to address tourism-related emissions, especially those from aviation, which accounts for a significant amount of the sector’s direct emissions. With a bold plan in place, Malaysia hopes to take the lead in developing eco-friendly travel options and promote economic expansion by generating green jobs.

A Bold Step Towards Sustainable Aviation

The Malaysian government has set a landmark goal for the aviation sector by announcing the creation of the country’s first biomass-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility, which is slated to begin operations in 2027. SAF, produced from sustainable resources such as waste oils and agricultural residues, holds the key to reducing aviation emissions, with the fuel being considered one of the most crucial decarbonisation tools in the industry.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global SAF output is expected to double in 2025, though it currently accounts for only 0.7% of total airline fuel use. Malaysia’s investment in SAF production will not only provide a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuels but also create a new sector within the economy, leading to high-value jobs and sustainable industry growth.

The Deputy Prime Minister further highlighted that collaboration on a multilateral scale is essential for the successful decarbonisation of the global aviation industry. Malaysia’s role in this larger context is crucial, as no single nation can shift an industry of aviation’s magnitude alone. Fadillah stressed that such efforts are necessary not only for the country’s sustainable future but for the global community.

Nature as the Cornerstone of Malaysia’s Tourism Strategy

Tourism in Malaysia is intrinsically linked to its abundant natural resources, with the country being one of the world’s 12 megadiverse nations. Malaysia is home to over 15,000 plant species and 175,000 species of fauna, which make it an unparalleled destination for nature-based tourism. Fadillah emphasized the importance of protecting the country’s rainforests, mangroves, and coral reefs, not only for national pride but also as a shared global responsibility. These ecosystems, when preserved, become powerful magnets for tourists, while supporting the livelihoods of local communities.

The government has also made it clear that tourism in Malaysia will be shaped around sustainability and environmental stewardship. This approach is already being implemented through several pioneering initiatives, including sustainable coastal tourism projects in Mersing, Johor. Once a modest fishing village, Mersing has transformed into a leader in sustainable tourism practices. The village is now preparing to host Malaysia’s first UN-recognised sustainable tourism observatory under the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories.

Embracing Nature-Based Tourism

Malaysia is focusing on nature-based tourism as one of its high-priority segments. This approach taps into the growing demand for eco-tourism, which is seen as a way to protect natural heritage while providing meaningful travel experiences. Along with nature tourism, the country is also investing in other promising travel segments, including adventure tourism, Muslim-friendly services, medical and wellness tourism, educational journeys, business events, and digital-nomad hubs. These initiatives reflect Malaysia’s commitment to creating diverse, sustainable tourism experiences that benefit both visitors and local communities.

Innovation in Sustainable Tourism Practices

Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing, in his address at the World Tourism Day (WTD) and World Tourism Conference (WTC) 2025, called for a more proactive approach in addressing global tourism challenges. He pointed out that the sector must confront hard truths and avoid the trap of merely making statements without delivering tangible outcomes. He stressed that innovation in tourism is not a luxury but a necessity, as global tourism faces several pressures such as over-tourism, inequality in tourism benefits, and environmental sustainability challenges.

Malaysia has already begun implementing innovative solutions to address these concerns. For instance, in Sabah, the Miso Walai Homestay is not only preserving rainforest ecosystems but also supporting over 350 families. In Penang, the reinvestment of tourism receipts into conservation and local training programs further highlights the country’s focus on sustainable development. Meanwhile, the Mersing tourism observatory is expected to provide valuable data-driven insights into coastal sustainability efforts, allowing for better management and more informed decision-making in the future.

National Sustainability Indicators for Tourism

To ensure that sustainability efforts are on track, the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture is piloting the United Nations Tourism Sustainability Indicators (MST). This initiative is part of Malaysia’s commitment to embedding sustainability measures into the Tourism Satellite Account, a tool used to track the economic and environmental performance of the tourism sector. With these indicators, Malaysia aims to achieve transparent, measurable progress on its sustainability goals, ensuring that tourism growth does not come at the expense of the environment or local communities.

Commitment to Green Certifications and International Standards

In line with global efforts, Malaysia encourages businesses in the tourism sector to adopt international sustainability benchmarks such as the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC), Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, B-Corp certification, and participation in the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO). Malaysia’s recognition of five hotels with ASEAN Green Hotel Awards this year reflects the growing emphasis on sustainability within the local hospitality industry.

The Path Forward: Inclusive Growth with Environmental Responsibility

The government of Malaysia is clear about its priorities as it continues to steer the country toward sustainable tourism and aviation. In addition to increasing tourism, the objective is to do so in a way that benefits local communities, is inclusive, and is environmentally conscious. According to Tiong, sustainable growth in the tourism industry is crucial for the long-term well-being of both the industry and the environment.

To sum up, Malaysia has a bold, multipronged strategy for sustainable tourism and aviation that incorporates community engagement, innovation, and environmental preservation. The nation is establishing itself as a global leader in the development of sustainable tourism as it strives to reach its 2027 SAF milestone and expands its ecotourism offerings. In addition to protecting Malaysia’s natural beauty, this dedication to sustainability will provide its people with long-term economic opportunities, guaranteeing that tourism will flourish for many more generations.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Malaysia-60.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 10:57:15.423461

After a decade of turbulence, the flag carrier has entered what it calls a ""commercial elevation journey,"" opening new routes, modernising its fleet, and betting on premium service over low-cost competition.

Dersenish Aresandiran, chief commercial officer of Airlines at Malaysia Aviation Group, believes the airline has entered a bold new era of transformation, one defined by premium service, sustainability, and a return to global prominence. In this exclusive interview with The Daily Star's Commercial Editor Ehsanur Raza, he explains how Bangladesh and South Asia are at the heart of that comeback story.

Global Strategy & Recovery

The Daily Star (TDS): Malaysia Airlines has navigated a demanding decade. What is the current vision for its global brand positioning, and how do you see the airline competing against aggressive Gulf and low-cost carriers?

Dersenish Aresandiran (DA): We have entered a new phase of transformation. Our ""commercial elevation journey"" has seen nine new routes launched in just 24 months, a strong rebound in premium demand, and a clear shift from low-fare competition. Today, our vision is simple yet bold: to return Malaysia Airlines to the global top 10 by 2030, driven by network expansion, brand rejuvenation, and an elevated customer experience.

We are no longer competing head-to-head with low-cost carriers. Instead, we offer a full-service, high-value proposition anchored in authentic Malaysian Hospitality, supported by modern in-flight offerings and seamless connectivity via Kuala Lumpur. In competitive markets such as Bangladesh, where passengers prioritise reliability, comfort, and cost efficiency, this premium positioning truly sets us apart.

TDS: With sustainability now driving aviation strategy, what commitments or innovations are Malaysia Airlines pursuing to reduce carbon emissions?

DA: Sustainability is central to our growth model. We are rolling out fuel-efficient A330neos and expanding the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with plans to scale up local production by 2027.

We also enhance operational efficiencies through optimised flight planning, and the use of biodiesel for ground vehicles. For environmentally conscious travellers and corporate partners, especially in markets like Bangladesh, we offer carbon-offsetting options and will soon introduce a Corporate Carbon Programme to align business travel with sustainability goals.

TDS: How has customer behaviour shifted post-pandemic, and how is the airline tailoring its services to meet these evolving expectations?

DA: Post-pandemic, travellers are seeking greater flexibility, safety, and personalisation. In response, we have enhanced hygiene protocols, introduced more adaptable fare options, and invested heavily in digital tools across the customer journey.

In markets such as Bangladesh, this translates into smoother booking processes, enhanced in-flight comfort, and digital experiences designed to deliver both convenience and care.

Regional Positioning (South & Southeast Asia)

TDS: How important is South Asia, particularly Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, in your route network strategy?

DA: South Asia lies at the heart of our ambition. Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are key growth drivers. These are generating strong demand across education, VFR (visiting friends and relatives), and business travel segments. In response, we have expanded our regional footprint and introduced new routes including Krabi (KBV), Siem Reap (SAI), Cebu (CEB) via Firefly, and Chengdu Tianfu (TFU) via Malaysia Airlines. These additions reflect our commitment to improving accessibility and offering greater choice, all while maintaining that premium edge that defines Malaysia Airlines.

TDS: Are there plans to expand partnerships or codeshares that improve connectivity from Bangladesh to key hubs in ASEAN, the Middle East, and beyond?

DA: Absolutely. Through oneworld and our regional partnerships including collaborations with carriers such as IndiGo, we are enhancing connectivity for Bangladeshi passengers to ASEAN, the Middle East, and Europe. Our goal is to deliver seamless and convenient global access, underpinned by the trusted service that Malaysia Airlines is known for.

Bangladesh Market Focus

TDS: Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur is one of the busiest regional routes, with high passenger demand. How does Malaysia Airlines see this corridor evolving in terms of passenger growth and yield management?

DA: The Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur corridor remains one of our busiest routes. From 5 November 2025, we will increase to three daily flights, 21 per week to meet growing demand and enhance onward connectivity to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and across ASEAN.

This increased capacity allows us to offer competitive fares while optimising yield through premium service and digital personalisation. This aims to deliver value for both conscious travellers and those seeking a superior travel experience.

TDS: Malaysia is home to a large Bangladeshi diaspora. How is the airline catering to migrant workers while balancing the premium segment of students, business travellers, and tourists?

DA: We are proud to serve all segments of Bangladeshi travellers. For migrant workers, we provide reliable and affordable service that meet their essential travel needs. Simultaneously, we cater to students, business travellers, and tourists with enhanced comfort and upgraded services. This balanced approach allows us to honour both the practical and aspirational travel requirements of this important market.

TDS: Many Bangladeshi passengers are extremely price-sensitive. What strategies do you have to balance affordability with the premium service experience Malaysia Airlines is known for?

DA: We offer tiered fares and flexible packages, ensuring affordability without compromising the travel experience. One standout offering is our Bonus Side Trip programme which allows passengers transiting through Kuala Lumpur to explore up to seven domestic destinations, including Langkawi or Penang by paying only the applicable taxes. This delivers premium value while adding a sense of discovery to their journey.

TDS: Cargo plays a vital role for Bangladesh's economy, especially RMG (ready-made garments). How significant is freight uplift from Bangladesh to your overall business strategy?

DA: Cargo is key to our business model, and Bangladesh's RMG exports are pivotal. Our Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur route not only supports fast, secure garment exports but also strengthens onward connectivity to global markets. Reliable schedules and modern freighters ensure we deliver both speed and dependability that are critical to Bangladeshi exporters.

Customer Experience & Innovation

TDS: Digital booking and ancillary services are growing rapidly. What investments has Malaysia Airlines made in technology to enhance the customer journey, especially for emerging markets like Bangladesh?

DA: We have invested significantly in mobile-first booking platforms, self-service tools, and personalised ancillaries. This allows travellers to manage seats, baggage, meals, and more through digital touchpoints. These tools simplify the journey for tech-savvy Bangladeshi users, while our signature Malaysian Hospitality ensures that even digital interactions feel warm and human.

TDS: Will we see more collaborations with Bangladeshi banks, mobile wallets, or fintechs for easier payment options?

DA: Yes, payments remain a key focus area. We are actively pursuing partnerships with Bangladeshi banks, mobile wallets, and fintech providers to make booking simpler, faster, and more secure. These collaborations will ensure that our services remain accessible and convenient for local travellers.

Future Outlook

TDS: Where do you see Malaysia Airlines in five years in terms of global ranking, fleet modernization, and network coverage?

DA: Our ambition is clear, to be firmly back among the global top 10 airlines by 2030, powered by one of the youngest, most efficient fleets in the region. We will continue to expand our network by strengthening key corridors such as Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur and opening new routes across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and beyond. By combining premium service, sustainability, and innovation, we are positioning Malaysia Airlines as a trusted global connector for travellers from Bangladesh and across the world.

On 25 September 2025, the United States scrambled four F-16 fighter jets, four KC-135 tankers, and an E-3 Sentry airborne early warning aircraft to intercept two Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets operating inside the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).

The interception came as President Donald Trump urged NATO to “shoot down Russian jets violating its airspace,” against the backdrop of what many officials describe as an intensifying Russian hybrid campaign against NATO.

Russia’s escalating violation of NATO airspace

Russian aircraft have repeatedly tested NATO airspace boundaries in recent years. Crewed fighters have entered the skies over Sweden, Norway, and Estonia, while drones have violated the airspace of Poland, Romania, and Lithuania.

One of the most serious incidents occurred a week ago, when three armed MiG-31s penetrated Estonian airspace for more than 12 minutes. Italian F-35s were dispatched to intercept. Norway has separately reported that Russian military aircraft have breached its airspace three times so far in 2025.

Sweden, which formally joined NATO in March 2024, experienced its first violation just months later when Russian Su-24 Fencers crossed into its airspace. Images released by the Swedish Air Force in September 2025 show Russian MiG-31s operating inside Estonian territory, underscoring the increasing frequency of such incursions.

Bloomberg has reported that several European governments have privately warned Moscow that they are prepared to shoot down intruding jets. Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson has stated publicly that his country is ready to take that step if necessary.

Russia’s aerial capabilities vs NATO

Despite its large notional inventory, Russia’s air force has struggled to gain air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses. The Oryx open-source database estimates that Russia has lost well over 100 fixed-wing combat aircraft since the full-scale invasion began.

Many of the platforms deployed on NATO border patrols, including Su-24s, Su-27s, and MiG-31s, are older models largely absent from frontline missions.

By contrast, NATO air forces field a mix of advanced F-35s, Rafales, and Typhoons. Western analysts argue that Russia’s flights near NATO borders are less about projecting combat power and more about probing Alliance resolve.

Russia’s use of drones to violate NATO airspace

The aerial challenge is not confined to manned aircraft. Earlier this month, Poland reported that approximately 19 Russian drones deliberately crossed into its territory. Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s shot down the drones in what NATO described as the first kinetic defence of European airspace by its fighters.

Russian one-way-attack drones recently violating Romanian airspace were escorted by scrambled Romanian F-16s until they crossed back into Ukraine.

In Denmark, officials are investigating drone activity near four civilian airports, describing the events as the “work of a professional actor.” While attribution remains uncertain, suspicion has again fallen on Moscow, which is known to use modified cargo ships as drone launch platforms.

Russia’s hybrid war against NATO

Airspace violations form just one part of a wider Russian hybrid campaign against NATO members. Cyberattacks have long been a feature: in 2022, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre attributed a Europe-wide attack to Russian actors.

One of the most reported other forms of Russia’s hybrid war is jamming/GPS spoofing. This particularly affects areas in Nordic Europe, the Baltic states, and Poland near Russia and Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave. GPS spoofing has affected many flights for years and has forced some flights to be cancelled.

Perhaps one of the most audacious stories of Russian hybrid warfare came in November 2024, when the New York Times reported Russia was plotting to “place incendiary devices on cargo planes in Europe.” The publication said Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, was orchestrating the plots.

Russia went as far as performing a test run in the summer of 2024, setting off fires at shipping hubs in the United Kingdom and Germany. This included logistics hubs belonging to DHL.

Disinformation remains a persistent vector. Russia exploits the West’s open information space to spread narratives aimed at undermining democratic institutions, while suppressing dissent at home. In 2024, Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the presidential election after ruling that Russian interference had compromised the vote. Moldova continues to be a prime target of destabilisation efforts.

The eastern country of Moldova is particularly targeted by Russian campaigns in an attempt to destabilise the fragile country and remove its Europe-friendly government.

Russia’s disinformation campaigns against Ukraine, NATO, and the French in Africa

In Russia, there is little freedom of speech. Many international social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are blocked, while others like YouTube are difficult to use. People in Russia are not permitted to speak out against the war. According to Reuters, everything from perceived “discrediting the military” to “childfree propaganda” is banned.

But Russia is known to take advantage of the free speech of the West to spread its narratives, disinformation, paint distorted images of Russia, and unmine the credibility of Western institutions.

Western countries are between a proverbial rock and a hard place, trying to find a balance between free speech and preventing foreign actors from taking advantage of that freedom to undermine their democracies.

The African Defence Forum points out that one of the most extreme Russian disinformation propaganda campaigns is in the small African country of Burkina Faso. There, disinformation is used to justify the Russian-backed coup and create the illusion that the country’s economy is booming due to kicking the colonial French out.

In reality, Russia has taken over the exploitation of the country’s resources, and its Africa Corps acts as a sort of Pretorian Guard protecting the junta from another coup or the people.

At the same time, the ruling military junta continues to lose ground against advanced jihadist forces, and deaths from an ever-worsening security situation are skyrocketing. Around 30% of the territory is entirely outside its control, with the remaining 70% contested.

Burkina Faso is a comparatively small country in West Africa. However, it is being used by Russia to foment more instability across Africa, particularly against the French, and to allow Russia to fill the ensuing void.

Another mark of success in Russia’s hybrid war against the West came in 2024 when the US had to shut down its drone base in Niger, as reported by Reuters.

Testing NATO and risking retaliation

From Alaska to the Baltics, Russia’s actions are widely seen as deliberate tests of NATO’s readiness and resolve. So far, these encounters have been contained through professional intercepts, but officials caution that Moscow is edging ever closer to the line — and a single misstep could escalate quickly.

That risk sharpened yesterday, when the Kremlin warned that any attempt to shoot down Russian aircraft would “mean war.” While framed as a response to Western rhetoric rather than an imminent threat, the message underscored the dangers of miscalculation: what begins as routine interception could, with one wrong move, ignite a wider confrontation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sukhoi-Su-30-by-Sergey-Krivchikov.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:56:12.212059

Sustainable Travel with Finnair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines

Sustainable Travel with Finnair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines

Sustainable tourism in the world and tourism hub in Helsinki gets help from several airlines including, Finnair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines. These airlines help transport not only legs, but also help become a partner with eco-friendly Helsinki initiatives. For Finnair, the use of sustainable aviation fuel is a huge helping hand in green travel. For Lufthansa and American Airlines, Helsinki is a premier destination and their American Airlines eco friendly endorsed SAf programs also created a million conscience travelers programs.

On the Helsinki routes, American Airlines also eco endorsed self travel routes and Helsinki eco endorsed tourism network. These airlines now, with Helsinki, travel positively marketed eco tourism and the tourism is guilt free travel and guilt is the opposite of convenient and stress free travel.

Sustainable Travel with Finnair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines

Helsinki’s impressive rise as a global hub for sustainable tourism is supported by key players in the airline industry. Leading the charge are Finnair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines. These airlines are not just transporting passengers—they are partnering with Helsinki’s eco-friendly initiatives, making it easier for travelers to choose sustainability. Finnair, known for its commitment to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), plays a significant role in promoting green travel. Lufthansa and American Airlines, through their sustainable practices and programs, have also contributed to Helsinki’s recognition as a destination of choice for conscious travelers.

In addition to their eco-conscious travel routes, these airlines have started offering carbon-offset programs, allowing travelers to make more responsible choices when flying. By supporting Helsinki, these airlines are reinforcing the message that sustainable tourism doesn’t have to compromise on convenience or luxury.

Sustainable Hotels Like Scandic and Hotel Kämp Set the Standard for Eco-Friendly Stays

Helsinki’s hotels are, quite literally, an example to the world. Scandic and Hotel Kämp are just two of the city’s hotels to take the first steps to integrate accommodation to the needs of the environment. Scandic is one of the Scandinavian countries biggest hotels chains and is certainly the first to practice green hospitality. Scandic has nearly 99% of their rooms in Helsinki accredited for environmentally responsible hospitality. Scandic’s emphasis on energy efficiency, waste reduction, and locally-sourced and sustainable materials show that the hospitality industry can flourish, even thrive, and still practice green hospitality.

Helsinki’s Hotel Kämp is both luxury and green hospitality, a rarity. Hotel Kämp is known for their almost 200 years of history, their exquisite services and, now, hospitality to the environment. Hotel Kämp meets the standards of the Green Hotel Association with their water-saving practices, energy efficient light fixtures and comprehensive waste reduction system. Klemp’s hospitality is now matched with their sustainable practices. The services offered in these hotels to Helsinki, is to show the world it is possible to offer luxury accommodation without the environmental sins.

Finnair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines Drive Growth in Helsinki Tourism

Helsinki is seeing an increase in international visitors, and Finnair, Lufthansa, and American Airlines are fueling the city’s tourism growth. From January to July in 2025, the number of international tourist nights spent in the city grew 19% over the same period in 2024. The increase in visitors reflects not only the region’s easily accessible sustainable tourism offerings but also the level of access provided by these carriers.

Helsinki is more accessible to tourists because Finnair and Lufthansa have always had direct flights to the city from major hubs in the rest of Europe and North America. With American Airlines also providing direct flights to the city, Helsinki’s reputation as a European city of choice to visit has only improved. Given the growing preference for airline travel that is also environmentally responsible, these airlines have demonstrated that travel and comfort do not have to come at the expense of the environment.

Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Tourism in Helsinki

Tourism infrastructure in Helsinki is now developed with sustainable tourism in mind. Helsinki’s public transport system (buses, trams, and ferries) is powered by renewable energy sources and therefore decreases the system’s fuel emissions. Moreover, tourism Helsinki’s and the Metropolitan’s region “green” public parks (over 40% of the total city area) will keep city emissions lower.

Helsinki will be embraced sustainably by tourism whether visiting Esplanadi Park, or Suomenlinna Fortress, or simply the city streets and parks. For tourists who want to lessen carbon, the city of Helsinki especially promotes cycling with over 1,200 kilometers of cycle paths.Considerations For Tourist Visits To Helsinki

This landmark Boeing 737 order, announced on September 26, 2025, from the airline's headquarters in Fornebu, Norway, underscores a strategic pivot toward aggressive fleet expansion amid surging demand for affordable transatlantic and intra-European flights. Norwegian Air, renowned for its pioneering role in budget air travel, first inked a base agreement in May 2022 for 50 of these fuel-efficient workhorses, complete with the flexibility to add 30 more, a clause the carrier has now activated on highly attractive terms that remain undisclosed but are believed to leverage favorable financing amid Boeing's production ramp-up. This Norwegian Air Boeing deal not only revitalizes a partnership dormant since 2017 but also positions the airline as a frontrunner in sustainable aviation, with the 737 MAX 8's advanced aerodynamics promising up to 20% reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to older models. For travelers eyeing cheap flights to Oslo, London, or New York, this infusion of modern aircraft heralds enhanced reliability, more seat availability, and potentially lower fares as Norwegian Air bolsters its network across Scandinavia and beyond.

The genesis of this expanded Boeing 737 MAX order traces back to Norwegian Air's storied history with single-aisle jets, a lineage that began in 2007 when the carrier placed its inaugural order for Next-Generation 737-800s, transforming it from a modest regional player into a global low-cost aviation titan. Fast-forward to 2017, and Norwegian made aviation headlines as the first European airline to take delivery of the 737 MAX, swiftly deploying it on historic transatlantic routes that democratized long-haul travel for budget-conscious passengers. Yet, the path hasn't been without turbulence: a near-bankruptcy in 2020 amid COVID-19 groundings forced a painful restructuring, slashing long-haul ambitions and refocusing on short- and medium-haul efficiency. Today's commitment to 30 more 737 MAX 8s, bringing the fleet horizon to over 150 Boeing narrowbodies by 2031, marks a triumphant return to growth. Adjusted delivery slots, negotiated alongside the option exercise, stretch from 2025 through 2031, allowing Norwegian Air to phase in replacements for its aging 737-800s while scaling operations. CEO Geir Karlsen hailed the pact as a ""milestone"" that fortifies the airline's resilience, emphasizing how these jets' LEAP-1B engines and composite wings will slash operating costs, enabling competitive pricing on high-frequency routes like Copenhagen to Barcelona or Stockholm to Madrid. In essence, this Norwegian Air fleet expansion is less about sheer volume and more about precision-engineered scalability in an era where low-cost carriers must balance profitability with passenger expectations for greener, faster service.

Environmentally conscious travelers and industry watchers alike will applaud the sustainability edge embedded in this Boeing 737 acquisition, as the MAX 8's design inherently aligns with Europe's stringent emissions targets under the EU's Green Deal. Each aircraft in this 30-jet addendum boasts a 14% smaller carbon footprint per seat than its predecessors, thanks to innovations like split-tip winglets that optimize airflow and reduce drag, features that Norwegian Air plans to pair with its ongoing investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives. With 2024 seeing the carrier ferry 22.6 million passengers on a fleet of 86 Boeing 737 variants, this order promises to amplify capacity without proportionally hiking emissions, supporting Norwegian's pledge to net-zero operations by 2050. Moreover, the all-economy cabin layout, a hallmark of Norwegian Air's 737 MAX deployments, maximizes accessibility for leisure flyers seeking affordable European getaways or Nordic escapes, while quieter cabins enhance the onboard experience. Boeing's commercial chief, Ihssane Mounir, echoed this synergy, noting that the 737 family empowers airlines like Norwegian to ""expand networks sustainably across Europe and beyond,"" hinting at potential revivals of long-haul dreams deferred by past crises. As low-cost airlines grapple with supply chain snarls and rising fuel prices, Norwegian's proactive Boeing 737 order exemplifies how forward-thinking procurement can turn environmental imperatives into competitive advantages, drawing eco-aware millennials and families to its roster of direct flights from hubs like Oslo Gardermoen.

Looking ahead, this infusion of 30 additional Boeing 737 MAX 8s catapults Norwegian Air into a phase of unbridled ambition, potentially reshaping the low-cost carrier landscape from the fjords of Norway to the sun-soaked coasts of Spain. By 2031, with deliveries trickling in steadily, the airline anticipates not just fleet modernization but a surge in route density, think more daily hops between Helsinki and Paris, or expanded feeders to secondary airports that keep fares low and accessibility high. This growth trajectory, fueled by a workforce of 4,700 dedicated professionals under the broader Norwegian Group umbrella (which includes regional arm Widerøe), could see passenger numbers climb toward 30 million annually, bolstering market share against rivals like Ryanair and easyJet. Yet, challenges loom: Boeing's ongoing quality scrutiny post-737 MAX grounding demands vigilant oversight, and macroeconomic headwinds like inflation could test the ""attractive terms"" of the deal. Still, for Norwegian Air, this order is a clarion call of resurgence, affirming its ethos of making air travel an everyday luxury. As the aviation world watches, this Boeing 737 commitment positions the carrier as the go-to for budget-savvy explorers plotting their next Norwegian Air adventure, be it chasing auroras in Tromsø or tapas in Málaga, proving that in the skies, bold bets on efficiency and expansion pay dividends for passengers and planet alike.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKBtzVQ_Gh1RR4Vh5pg0uv7ZBQIGkCauPCHPef2A1UMY8SA91O5pJnLIfQ-UpYzPqHeSqutQoTnbeS-7iDPBcYcMZsOW42fPVL5l0N-O15w08HE6ycIspKEQ-lPR_1o5Q83CLTWR-cHXUzzvQZ2Hlec48ITMFwHpHIHx2rtUXnQfgZody0-gP3G-6PwwuJ/w1600/NorweginAir_Boeing_Order.png,N,,2025-09-27 10:58:35.877749

Underground coal gasification

India, which holds the world’s fifth-largest coal reserves, is banking on gasification to continue using coal in a cleaner way over the coming decades. Government officials estimate that nearly 43 percent of India’s reserves lie at depths greater than 300 metres, making them suitable for underground gasification rather than conventional mining. UCG involves converting unmineable coal seams in-situ into syngas using oxidants such as air, oxygen or steam. The process can produce hydrogen and liquid fuels such as methanol, ethanol, synthetic diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as feedstock for chemicals, fertilisers and petrochemicals. India plans to achieve gasification of 100 MT of coal by 2030.

The first-ever pilot project for underground coal gasification (UCG) in the country was launched in June 2024 at the Kasta coal block in Jharkhand. The project is being executed by Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited (CIL), along with the Canadian firm Ergo Exergy Technologies Inc (EETI).

Coal gasification financial incentive scheme: Rfp to be floated next week

Brar also said that the ministry will float a Request for Proposal (RfP) next week to allocate the remaining Rs 2,500 crore under its coal gasification financial incentive scheme. The scheme was announced last year with a total financial outlay of Rs 8,500 crore. Of the Rs 8,500 crore, about Rs 6,000 crore has already been allocated across three categories of projects.

Under Category I, which includes PSUs / joint ventures of PSUs, Bharat Coal Gasification and Chemicals Limited (BCGCL), a joint venture of CIL-BHEL has been awarded Rs 1,350 crore for its coal gasification project in Lakhanpur, Orissa. Another JV formed between CIL and GAIL for setting up a coal gasification project in Sonepur Bazari, West Bengal, has been awarded Rs 1,350 crore of financial incentive under the scheme.

New Era Cleantech Solution Private Limited, Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) and Greta Energy Limited are the three companies that have been selected by the Ministry of Coal under Category-II, which includes coal gasification projects being undertaken by both private sector and government PSUs.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is taking part in the 42nd Session of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly, hosted in Montreal, Canada.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, stated that safety, sustainability, and operational efficiency are the Association’s top priorities during this session.

Walsh emphasised the importance of securing stronger support for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and enhancing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), describing them as two essential elements for achieving the industry’s commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

He warned against the risks posed by some states continuing to impose national or regional taxes and levies on aviation, which contradict the spirit of the Chicago Convention. Such measures, he noted, create a patchwork of regulations that hinder air transport and inconvenience passengers without meaningfully contributing to sustainability.

Walsh also highlighted the need to strengthen safety by ensuring timely publication of accident reports, addressing interference with satellite-based navigation systems, and safeguarding critical radio spectrum essential to aviation safety.

He stressed that global standards – many of which are developed within ICAO in collaboration with governments – remain the cornerstone of safe, efficient, and sustainable aviation worldwide.

Walsh added that the Assembly provides an opportunity for states to align ICAO’s work programmes with the most pressing issues facing the sector.

He pointed out that many of IATA’s working papers call only for the implementation of commitments already made by states themselves. The coming weeks in Montreal, he said, will be decisive in setting the agenda, while the following three years will be even more crucial in delivering on agreed objectives.

Through its submissions, IATA is urging governments to review targets for SAF deployment, taking into account the cost implications of mandatory obligations without parallel increases in production. The Association also calls for enhanced economic incentives for fuel producers and corrective policy measures to address market distortions.",https://egyptian-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2adbbaf7-145e-4723-8a42-e4cf872c24e2.webp,N,,2025-09-27 01:56:08.227903

This policy inconsistency spans major markets, with fluctuating Green House Gas (GHG) reduction norms and changing acceptable feedstocks. This creates “deep uneasiness for producers” and prevents airlines from making the long-term commitments essential for net-zero targets.

The issue of cost competitiveness was also central to the discussion on the broader bioenergy sector. Samyak Pandey, Editor of Global Biofuels and Agriculture Markets at S&P Global, noted that for the Global South, the biggest hurdle is not the lack of feedstock, but its availability “at a certain price point” that makes it difficult for downstream suppliers.

A significant shift in the global market was also highlighted: Asian giants are pivoting. They are moving away from exporting raw, upstream feedstocks to instead focusing on exporting value-added downstream bio-products to Western markets.

Despite the challenges, speakers highlighted India’s immense potential. In the ethanol sector, India has moved from scarcity to abundance, holding over 2,100 crore litres of capacity with surplus sugar, corn, and rice. Harjeet Singh, Executive Director at Hero MotoCorp, termed India’s ethanol blending programme a “360-degree win-win,” citing benefits for farmers, reduced oil imports, and lower emissions. Ravi Gupta, Chairman of IFGE, called scaling flexible fuel vehicles the “low-hanging fruit” for the next phase of India’s green mobility.

For Compressed Biogas (CBG), India is seeing momentum. Inderjit Singh, Director, UPNEDA, announced that his agency has received around 700 applications for various bio-plants, with 45 already installed and 61 CBG projects under construction. Uttar Pradesh, in

particular, is exploring biomass-based green hydrogen as a cheaper alternative to electrolyser-based production, which could significantly reduce import dependence.

However, State policies add layers of complexity. Narendra Bhooshan, Additional Chief Secretary, Energy & Additional Sources of Energy Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh, pointed out that current policies limit subsidies to one CBG plant per location.

This is necessary to safeguard biomass supply, reserving 60 per cent for farmers' needs. He stressed that first-come, first-serve licensing and predominantly private fertile land require careful governance and “innovative pricing” to make CBG projects viable.

Financing institutions are stepping up. Dr RK Singh, CGM, Green Vertical, SIDBI, shared that as an accredited entity of the Green Climate Fund, SIDBI is blending $200 million from the Fund with $800 million from the market to support Indian MSMEs transitioning to green energy.

The conference ultimately underscored that while India possesses the biomass, technology, and policy intention, a globally and domestically aligned, long-term policy framework remains critical to unlock the massive capital required to move from potential to large-scale, net-zero reality.",https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2025/story/images/big/experts-warn-of----chaotic-global-landscape-----for-sustainable-aviation-fuel-at-ibet-2025-2025-09-27.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 21:56:16.742256

Regional business and public sector leaders outlined near-term airport upgrades, long range growth plans, and workforce partnerships during the Seattle Southside Chamber of Commerce’s annual SEA Airport Luncheon, held Sept. 19 at Sea-Tac Airport.

Chamber President and CEO Samantha Le opened the program by highlighting a recent partnership with SEA Airport and Port Jobs that brought 30 Highline and Tukwila high school students to explore careers on the airfield and in airport operations.

“We come together to connect, to learn, and to strengthen the partnerships that keep our economy moving forward,” Le said in her opening remarks (full video below).

SeaTac Economic Development Manager Alexsandr Yeremeyev

City of SeaTac Economic Development Manager Alexsandr Yeremeyev told attendees that South King County’s transportation access continues to draw investment and that market certainty helps businesses make informed decisions.

““As the world changes and as a lot of things feel uncertain, there are certain things that are certain,” Yeremeyev said. “And when we can anchor ourselves and our decisions to those things that are … that adds predictability and a sense of confidence that that is very important to business investment.”

Port Executive Director Steve Metruck

Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck said the port operates under a “triple bottom line” that balances business performance, equitable opportunity, and sustainability. He noted SEA’s role in jobs and commerce, citing about 175,000 jobs in 2023, $10.5 billion dollars in wages and benefits, and $33 billion dollars in business output, based on figures he shared at the luncheon. Metruck said the port’s goal is to be the greenest port in North America and that the organization rebuilt systems after a 2024 ransomware attack without paying a ransom.

He too mentioned the perils of uncertainty and inflation on the federal level.

“We’re also navigating some uncertainty within our operations,” Metruck said. “And I’m sure all the business leaders here can feel the same thing… we’re looking at different policies from the federal level… inflation is mixed into this as well and then international travel’s mixed into this too.”

Metruck detailed construction aimed at easing congestion and improving the traveler experience as SEA traffic sets new records. Projects include the relocated Checkpoint 1 on the baggage level, a C Concourse expansion targeted for 2026 with more than 30 dining and retail options and an all electric design with rooftop solar, a Gateway ticketing and art upgrade on the terminal’s north end, roadway widening and a new bus canopy beginning this winter with paving after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and a South Concourse modernization with major construction forecast for 2027. He said planning continues on the Sustainable Airport Master Plan, which contemplates a second terminal with 19 gates and an automated people mover linking the rental car facility, the new terminal, and the main terminal.

On air service and tourism, Metruck said cruise activity has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, driving visitor spending across the region, and that by 2026 SEA expects about 60 international routes to 36 destinations on roughly 30 airlines. He also pointed to the port’s push for sustainable aviation fuel, with an aim for at least a 10 percent blend on flights fueled at SEA by 2028, while acknowledging supply and cost remain challenges.

Alaska Airlines Managing Director Ben Brookman

Alaska Airlines Managing Director of Airport Affairs Ben Brookman told attendees that SEA is Alaska’s largest hub and that the carrier is investing alongside the port to improve throughput. Brookman previewed a new lobby targeted for early 2026, praised the new checkpoint, and said Alaska is developing a 40,000 square foot lounge in the C Concourse building. He said Alaska is adding widebody 787 aircraft to launch new long haul routes, with Tokyo already started and Reykjavik, London, and Rome slated for spring 2026. Brookman said customers “demand a more upscale and premium product” and that Alaska plans to grow to at least a dozen transoceanic destinations by the end of the decade while integrating operations with Hawaiian Airlines under a two brand strategy.

FIFA World Cup Coming in 2026

Looking ahead to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the port said it is coordinating with Sound Transit and encouraging cities and business districts to apply for economic development and activation grants tied to visitor readiness.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup™ is coming, and our region’s businesses have a chance to shine. The Port of Seattle and King County are proud to partner and support the Seattle Metro Chamber’s Community Business Connector program, which has launched Game Ready Activation Grants. This grant program supports local organizations in creating inclusive, family-friendly events, including cultural festivals, watch parties and community promotions.

Awards of $5,000, $10,000 or $20,000 will be granted, and this is open to business districts, cultural organizations, merchant associations and small businesses in King County. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis through Nov. 10 or until funds are exhausted.

Port Seeking Public Input on SEA Airport Leadership Search

The Port of Seattle is asking residents and travelers to share input on what qualities they want to see in the next Managing Director of Sea-Tac Airport (Previous Director Lance Lyttle left in March to take the same job in Orlando).

Community feedback will help shape the search for a leader to oversee daily airport operations, customer service, and long-term improvements at SEA, the Port said.

Visit the Port’s community feedback webpage to take a brief survey or email your feedback to AVDirectorSearch@portseattle.org.

By opting for more sustainable flying, status or desired rewards can be achieved more quickly

Miles & More, the loyalty program of the Lufthansa Group, now awards miles and Points for more sustainable flying with bookable CO2-offseting packages. By choosing to fly more sustainably, customers can now achieve the desired frequent flyer status more quickly.

Since 2023, Miles & More members have been able to earn extra miles and Points when booking the Green Fares tariff. This is now also possible with CO2-offsetting packages, which can also be redeemed with miles that have already been earned. With this step, Miles & More aims to encourage its customers to make more sustainable travel choices and thus contribute personally to climate protection.

“Responding to our passengers’ wishes with a wide range of services”

The offers include the full offset of calculated individual flight-related CO2 emissions: through the subsequent use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and a contribution to the Lufthansa Group’s high-quality climate project portfolio. Depending on the SAF share booked, up to 80 percent more Points and Qualifying Points and up to 20 percent more HON Circle Points can be collected when choosing a CO2-offseting package in addition to the Points credited for the flight. The higher the SAF proportion, the more Points are credited. Additionally, members can earn up to 6 miles per 1 euro spent. This allows them to reach their status or desired reward faster. The new offering complements the awarding of miles and Points for the Green Fares, which have been bookable since 2023: When booking this flight tariff, Miles & More members benefit from up to 20 percent additional miles and Points already today.

“We want to further raise awareness among our customers for more sustainable flying,” says Dieter Vranckx, Chief Commercial Officer Lufthansa Group. “Our goal is to respond to our passengers’ wishes with a wide range of offers and to provide them with attractive benefits. By choosing to make their flights more sustainable, Miles & More members can benefit from additional miles and Points and achieve their status or desired award faster. With our numerous offers for more sustainable flying, we at the Lufthansa Group are global pioneers.”

Flexibility and ease of use

CO2-offseting packages can be booked directly during flight booking, before departure in the personal booking area, and even after the flight on the websites of Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Lufthansa, and SWISS. They can also be booked after the flight via the Miles & More app or on miles-and-more.com. Additional miles and Points are now automatically awarded for all newly booked additional packages. If Miles & More members booked a CO2-offseting package for their flights since January 2025, the corresponding miles and Points will also be credited retroactively. This offers Miles & More customers maximum flexibility.

Both the CO2-offseting packages and the Green Fares as a separate tariff option enable passengers to offset their calculated flight-related CO2 emissions through the subsequent use of SAF and a contribution to the Lufthansa Group’s high-quality climate project portfolio. The calculation of flight-related emissions per passenger considers various factors such as flight distance, average fuel consumption, travel class, and load factor. Increasingly, guests are choosing the Lufthansa Group’s diverse offerings for more sustainable travel: currently, nearly five percent.

Background on the use of SAF and the Lufthansa Group’s climate project portfolio

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called “drop-in” fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be easily blended with it. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is mixed with fossil aviation fuel (blending) or produced through co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with crude oil) and then transported to airports in Europe where the Lufthansa Group refuels large quantities of kerosene. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group’s flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire lifecycle, the SAF used by the Lufthansa Group from biogenic residues has a CO2 footprint at least 80 percent lower than conventional kerosene from fossil crude oil.

The Lufthansa Group relies on a differentiated climate project portfolio for CO2 compensation. It is continuously developed and currently includes 18 projects. These are included in the portfolio in varying proportions and costs. The providers are myclimate, Climate Austria, SQUAKE, Ceezer, and ClimatePartner. All projects are certified according to the highest available standards, such as the Gold Standard. In addition to nature-based projects, the portfolio also includes three technology based projects: One project for the capture of CO₂ and long-term storage in concrete and two projects for CO2 removal with biochar. In this way, the Lufthansa Group aims to promote the development of the CO2 compensation market towards new technologies and offers with technically induced long-term binding of CO2.",https://loyaltylobby.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lufthansa-747.png,N,,2025-09-27 01:56:33.805839

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAFOpens in a new tab is an industry term used to reference an alternative aviation fuel and is a type of non-conventional jet fuel made from resources that can be continually replenished, also known as sustainable feedstocks. It is chemically similar to conventional aviation fuel but comes from non-fossil sources, making it a lower-carbon alternative on a lifecycle basis. SAF can be produced from a variety of alternative materials without necessarily depleting natural resources. Some bio-based materials it can be made from include cooking oil, animal waste fat and agricultural or forestry residues. SAF is compatible with existing airport infrastructure and aircraft, making it a safe ‘drop-in’ alternative to conventional aviation fuel.

What are SAF Environmental Attributes or SAF Attributes?

Environmental attributes associated with SAF or SAF attributes refer to the reduced environmental impacts of using SAF, such as the GHG emissions avoided by not extracting non-renewable resources like crude oil (used to make conventional aviation-fuel). These environmental attributes result from Air Canada using SAF instead of conventional aviation fuel.

How does my contribution support SAF?

Under this Offer, half of your contribution goes directly towards the purchase of SAF. Your contribution to SAF supports Air Canada’s long-term aspiration of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, and helps reduce reliance on conventional aviation fuel over time.

Kalin Ned — September 26, 2025 — Social Good

Korean Air is increasing the application of sustainable aviation fuel — also known as SAF — sourced from South Korean producers. The company is extending its use from an initial trial on a Tokyo route to include services to Kobe and Osaka.

Korean Air's SAF program involves blending one percent of this alternative fuel with conventional jet fuel on specific flights, a measure that will be in effect for a period exceeding one year. The SAF is manufactured by domestic energy companies using recycled cooking oil as a feedstock. The product from these South Korean producers meets the international certification standards established by the aviation sector's carbon reduction framework.

The airline positions this expansion as part of its broader strategy to support the industry's transition toward lower-carbon operations.

The slow rollout of production technology to take advantage of this feedstock is the main barrier to scaling up supply, however, with HEFA technology, which converts used cooking oil into SAF, currently the only available production type.

Other technologies

While HEFA will continue to play a role in the future SAF production matrix, other technologies will accelerate the aviation industry’s road to net zero, including biomass, which has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050.

‘This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades,’ the report noted.

Elsewhere, power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, which will require large-scale access to renewable energy, hydrogen and carbon capture infrastructure, will be needed to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050.

The report calls for action on a number of fronts, including strengthening feedstock supply chains, improving conversion efficiencies, scaling up new production methods, and aligning government and private-sector investment. On a regional basis, North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China and ASEAN have been identified as ‘key drivers’ of global SAF output.

‘Major acceleration’

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation,” commented Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general.

In the context of emission reduction, SAF also became one of the topics that received serious attention at the 2nd Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation in New Delhi, September 10-13, where the author was a member of the delegation.

This conference agreed on the 2024 Delhi Ministerial Declaration concerning aviation safety and security, navigation, facilitation, gender equality in the aviation world, resource provision, as well as the ratification of international air agreements to achieve civil aviation that is safe, secure, efficient, economically viable, and environmentally responsible.

In the medium term, there are at least three main components/actors that will shape the sustainable aviation (industry/business) ecosystem: SAF providers, airport operators, and airlines.

SAF/bioavtur manufacturer

During the transition period and in the medium term, SAF is seen as a solution to significantly reduce carbon emissions without fundamentally changing aircraft technology/engines, airport infrastructure, or the supply chain.

Bioavtur meets those requirements, whereas the direct use of hydrogen as a fuel gas for conventional aircraft still requires further research and testing related to engine modifications and safe storage tanks on the aircraft.

Recently, Pertamina received its first international trust to supply SAF to a foreign airline, Virgin Australia. During the BIAS 2024 event series, Pertamina supplied 160 kilograms of SAF to a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Virgin for departure from Ngurah Rai International Airport on August 18-19.

The SAF produced by Pertamina is a mixture of synthetic fuel processed from used cooking oil and conventional aviation fuel (fossil-based) with proportions of approximately 38 and 62 percent, respectively. This proportion of SAF is considered high compared to Singapore Airlines, which only uses 1 percent SAF.

However, there is no doubt that this Pertamina product has been certified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through the CORSIA (carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) scheme as a fuel that meets global requirements/standards. Pertamina's SAF product also meets the standards of the US, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.

Previously, last year, Garuda Indonesia completed the first commercial flight trial using SAF, a mixture of biofuel and conventional aviation fuel. The biofuel was processed from palm oil.

The achievement of SAF Indonesia's products has gone through a fairly long process. For that, Pertamina deserves a thumbs up.

In the article “Flight Tariff Intervention” (Kompas, 9/5/2019) the author criticized the large dependence on imported petroleum, including kerosene for aviation fuel, so that when the rupiah is weak, aviation fuel prices soar, and airline ticket prices skyrocket. In fact, we have abundant potential for green aviation fuel raw materials.

Initiated since 2010, Pertamina conducted research to develop products and catalysts. In 2021, PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional RU IV Cilacap successfully produced SAF J2.4 with co-processing technology from palm kernel oil raw materials that have undergone a bleaching process, fatty acid removal, odor-free, with a capacity of 1,350 kiloliters per day.

Through collaboration with related parties, this SAF product was then tested through a series of trials on engines and aircraft units. In addition to Pertamina, the development and testing involved Garuda Maintenance Facility, Garuda Indonesia, PT Dirgantara Indonesia, and ITB, until the successful flight test of Garuda's commercial aircraft on October 4, 2023 with a Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft.

Supported by the availability of abundant raw materials, Pertamina is ready to be part of the sustainable aviation ecosystem as a supplier of SAF. Indonesia has the opportunity to become the world's leading producer and exporter of SAF.

In the BIAS 2024 series, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between PT Pertamina and Airbus to cooperate in the development of SAF. Various international certifications for Pertamina's SAF products, SAF supplies to Virgin Australia aircraft, and development cooperation with Airbus will increase trust and demand for Indonesian SAF in the international market.

Indonesia must be able to manage the palm oil agro-industry well, to meet domestic consumption/exports of cooking oil, industrial raw materials, biofuel, and SAF as well as environmental protection. Palm oil will become an increasingly strategic material/commodity, such as nickel, bauxite, quartz sand, phosphate, and others.

All airports in Indonesia, especially those with international hub status, need to transform into green airports as an important part of the sustainable aviation ecosystem.

The airport ecosystem has a number of stakeholders, such as aircraft passengers, fuel providers, ground handlers, cargo operators, airlines, airport operators, airport retailers/SMEs, catering services, and transportation providers from/to the airport.

To form a green airport ecosystem, stakeholders need to play their respective roles with low-emission activities.

Airport operators implement best practices for green airport management, including using new and renewable energy (EBT)-based electricity such as rooftop solar power plants (PLTS), battery-based electric operational vehicles/hydrogen fuel cells, smart building systems, circular economy water management (especially for watering gardens), 3R waste handling systems and compost processing units, providing charging stations to recharge electric vehicles in the airport area.

Pertamina needs to build storage infrastructure for SAF distribution in the airport area, in the form of depots/storage tanks and SAF hydrant systems and/or electric/hydrogen fuel cell trucks to fill SAF into aircraft. The option is to mix SAF with conventional avtur at Pertamina's refinery or directly at the airport, depending on safety considerations and equipment completeness.

The development of SAF infrastructure at airports needs to be planned at all airports in Indonesia, both international and domestic.

Based on the Decree of the Minister of Transportation No. 31/2024 concerning the Determination of International Airports, April 2, 2024, there are 17 airports with international airport status in Indonesia. These international airports include Kualanamu (Medan), Hang Nadim (Batam), Soekarno-Hatta (Banten), Kertajati (Majalengka), Kulon Progo/YIA (DIY), Juanda (Sidoarjo), I Gusti Ngurah Rai (Bali), Sultan Hasanuddin (Maros), and Komodo (NTT).

Currently, 37 airports are under PT Angkasa Pura Indonesia, a subsidiary of InJourney. Two international airports, namely Kualanamu and Hang Nadim, have the potential to be developed into ASEAN regional international hubs in the future.

The potential is supported by its strategic position in the northern region of Indonesia, close to ASEAN economic centers. So far, a number of international airports in Indonesia have only been feeders for Changi Airport, Singapore.

SAF usage policies can be determined at the airline or government level. Approaching 2030, many countries around the world are starting to require SAF usage by airlines in their respective countries, in line with the ICAO Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels, Low Carbon Aviation Fuels, and other cleaner aviation energies.

The European Union (EU) requires all EU airports to supply aviation fuel with a minimum SAF content of 2 percent starting in 2025. This mandatory percentage will continue to increase to 6 percent (2030), 20 percent (2035), and 70 percent (2050), applicable to all flights departing from the EU and to any destination.

In BIAS 2024, the Coordinating Minister for Investment and Maritime Affairs launched the SAF Roadmap Action Plan, which focuses on developing SAF to achieve net zero aviation by 2050, earlier than the 2060 target. This roadmap is a guiding framework to ensure greener Indonesian aviation.

At the airline level, Lion Air Group will require the use of SAF on all airline fleets starting in 2030. InJourney, after the effective joining of Garuda, can take a more progressive step in the use of SAF.

In the medium term until 2030, the initial stage in building a sustainable aviation ecosystem focuses on the development/use of SAF and the development of a green airport ecosystem by gradually shifting to EBT in airport operations and all activities of airport stakeholders, including airport MSMEs.

Airlines certainly hope that Pertamina's SAF price is competitive with the price of traditional fossil-based aviation fuel. The relatively high SAF price will affect the ticket price that consumers/passengers must pay.

The use of hydrogen as the SAF for conventional aircraft, and as the SAF for hydrogen fuel cell aircraft, has implications for changes in aircraft technology and its supporting infrastructure that will take place in the longer term.

Likewise, the use of all-electric aircraft and autonomous flying taxis. All of this still requires research, development, and testing, especially regarding flight safety and fuel efficiency. A 100 percent green airport, in general, may only be achieved in 2050 or 2060, except for the IKN VVIP airport, which can supply 100 percent of its electricity from PLN's PLTS.

Flexible electrolyzer design co-produces hydrogen, creating feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel and e-methanol.

Potential pathway to decarbonise aviation and shipping, sectors responsible for more than 5% of global CO₂ emissions.

Amsterdam bets on flexible carbon capture

Dutch climate tech company Brineworks has raised €6.8 million (US $7.3 million) in fresh funding to advance a new form of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology designed to deliver carbon removal at below €100 per ton. The round, led by SeaX Ventures with participation from Pale Blue Dot, First Momentum, AiiM Partners, Energie360°, and Katapult, comes as policymakers and investors intensify scrutiny of aviation and shipping emissions.

The company, founded in 2023, is targeting commercial readiness by 2026 with a system that also produces hydrogen, the essential input for e-fuels. Earlier this year, Brineworks secured a €1.8 million grant from the European Innovation Council’s Accelerator program to accelerate pilot deployment.

DAC paired with hydrogen

At the core of Brineworks’ approach is a patented electrolyzer engineered to operate flexibly with renewable power. Unlike conventional systems, which degrade when turned on and off, the unit is designed to start and pause in sync with solar and wind availability.

“We’ve proven a clear path to capturing CO₂ directly from air at below $100 per ton,” said Joseph Perryman, co-founder and CTO. “That’s the threshold the world has been waiting for, and now the scale-up begins.”

The technology enables DAC and hydrogen co-production. Together, these streams provide the building blocks for synthetic fuels such as e-methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For airlines and shipping companies under pressure from regulators and investors, the economics of such a system could provide a lifeline.

Aviation and shipping in focus

Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, while maritime shipping contributes more than 3%. Both industries face limited options to decarbonise at scale. Synthetic fuels offer a potential solution, but costs have remained prohibitive.

“Renewable energy is becoming cheaper faster than anyone predicted. The bottleneck now is technology that can use this power flexibly and affordably,” said CEO Gudfinnur Sveinsson. “That’s exactly what we’ve built.”

By aligning DAC with renewable generation, Brineworks aims to localise production of carbon-neutral fuels. If the model proves viable, it could allow countries to produce e-fuels domestically, reducing import dependency while contributing to climate targets.

Investor confidence in science-led solutions

Investors describe Brineworks’ approach as a step-change in carbon removal economics. “We’re always looking for visionary founders solving massive problems with science-backed solutions, and Brineworks is exactly that,” said Kid Parchariyanon, managing partner at SeaX Ventures. He added that supporting the company aligns with the fund’s goal of helping to cut 1% of the world’s carbon footprint.

The financing reflects a broader wave of venture and public funding moving into engineered carbon removal. European institutions, including the EIC, are prioritising projects that pair carbon capture with synthetic fuels, in part to meet transport decarbonisation targets set by Brussels.

Policy and market implications

If Brineworks achieves its target of commercial readiness by 2026, airlines could begin sourcing carbon-neutral fuel before 2030, supporting compliance with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and the International Maritime Organization’s decarbonisation strategy.

The sub-€100 per ton capture benchmark is particularly relevant to investors. Current DAC systems often operate at two to four times that cost, limiting their integration into fuel production at scale. Achieving that threshold would make DAC competitive with established offset markets while offering a verifiable, technology-based pathway.

Looking ahead

The next phase for Brineworks is scaling its electrolyzer-DAC system to pilot level, with demonstration projects expected in the next 18 months. For global energy and transport leaders, the outcome will be closely watched. Success could reshape the economics of synthetic fuels and offer a scalable solution to two of the hardest-to-abate sectors.

For investors and policymakers, Brineworks highlights the growing intersection of renewable integration, carbon removal, and industrial decarbonization. As nations look to secure domestic energy supplies while meeting net-zero commitments, technologies that merge these goals are gaining strategic importance.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dutch-Startup-Brineworks-Secures-7.3M-to-Scale-Direct-Air-Capture-for-e-Fuels.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 16:56:08.836412

Using circular economy principles and energy-neutral processes, the technology converts animal manure and agricultural residues into valuable commodities with minimal environmental impact. The modular BCT system, now in its fifth generation after 15 years of development, can be rapidly deployed. Each module, shipped in ten containers, can be assembled in under a month and processes 36 tonnes of dry biomass per day with negligible emissions and no residual waste.

Verdus said the system works efficiently on a smaller, decentralised scale, making it suitable for farms, forests, and industrial sites. It can process feedstocks including cattle manure, poultry litter, crop residues, and municipal solid waste, transforming them into more than 200 marketable products such as renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biochar, green fertilisers, organic pesticides and herbicides, bio-oils, electricity, and carbon credits.

Biochar alone can sequester three tonnes of CO₂ per tonne applied to soil and reduce methane emissions from cattle by up to 22%. Overall, Verdus claims its solutions can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 187%.

The company has partnered with governments, primary producers, energy firms, and waste managers, and plans rapid international expansion given the over 20 million tonnes of annual feedstock surplus in New Zealand and growing global demand.

Kevin Smith, President and COO, said the technology has already proven commercially. “Version 4.0 has been operating for over two years, producing carbon fuel pellets for a major mining company. Rollout of V5.0 begins in Q4 2025, with production in North America scheduled for 2026.” He added, “Verdus Energy is not just addressing waste—it is creating a new model for resource recovery, climate resilience, and economic regeneration.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Biomass-6.png,N,,2025-09-26 12:56:59.596160

“This is a big day for northern Wisconsin – we’re looking at over $1 billion in annual economic impact and over 350 high-paying, local jobs, all while bolstering our forestry industry,” said Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk). “This facility will also help maintain clean forests, lowering the risk of forest fires and haze resulting from extreme smoke.”

To complement approximately $1.5 billion of private investment, the Forestry Revitalization Act will invest $210 million ($60 million in WEDC Enterprise Zone Tax Credits and $150 million in state bonding through the forestry account) to the new Hayward facility. The facility will turn CORSIA-qualified woody biomass (bark, branches, cutter shavings, tree tops, etc.) into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and naphtha, primarily for export. The European Union (E.U.) is phasing in regulations to require SAF to be mixed with conventional aviation fuel. By 2050, the E.U. will require 70% SAF.

USFWS Offers Voluntary Lead-free Ammo Incentive Program for 2025-26 Season

La Crosse, Wis. — The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is extending the Voluntary Lead-Free Hunting Ammunition Incentive Program for the 2025-26 hunting season in the National Wildlife Refuge System. The decision follows a successful pilot program and survey results indicating that hunters are more likely to use lead-free ammunition on national wildlife refuges when an incentive program is available. The program will include 25 hunting seasons at 13 refuges in 11 states.

Locally, the program is offered to those hunting deer on the Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge.

The program also is being offered at refuges in Maryland, Idaho, West Virginia, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Oregon.

“We are committed to providing access to quality hunting experiences on national wildlife refuges and supporting the contributions of the hunting community to wildlife conservation,” said USFWS Director Brian Nesvik. “Our analysis after the first year of the pilot indicates most hunters were satisfied with the program and we are pleased to expand it to accommodate more hunters.”

The lead-free program was launched in 2024 at seven national wildlife refuges and encourages voluntary adoption of lead-free ammunition as a non-regulatory means of addressing lead ingestion by wildlife on federal lands. The USFWS collaborated on program recommendations from the Hunting and Wildlife Conservation Council as well as from states, non-governmental groups, industry partners and the public. The HWCC is a federal advisory committee established by the Secretaries of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.

This voluntary lead-free hunting ammunition incentive program offers hunters an opportunity to try ammunition types that reduce the risk of unintentional lead ingestion by scavenging wildlife. Participating hunters at each refuge will benefit from an incentivized rebate program that includes prepaid debit cards for reimbursement of the cost of lead-free ammunition with proof of purchase and other refuge-specific verifications. Participating hunters will receive up to $50 per box of rifle ammunition and $25 per box for shotgun or muzzleloader, for up to two boxes.

Under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, the USFWS allows hunting, within specified limits, on more than 430 refuge units. There are 573 national wildlife refuges and 38 wetland management districts.

Abstract

The increasing carbon footprint of civil aviation has made the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a strategic necessity in line with the sector’s sustainability goals. This study evaluates the existing SAF types based on environmental, economic, technical and social criteria, determines the criteria weights with Fuzzy-Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (F-SWARA) and selects the most suitable alternative through Spherical Fuzzy-Multi Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis plus full MULTIplicative form (SF-MULTIMOORA) method. The alternative evaluation process was carried out on a Python-based online platform and sensitivity analysis was performed on five different scenarios. According to the findings, the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK) alternative stands out as the most suitable option in all scenarios, followed by the Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) alternative. In contrast, Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ-SPK) and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) options seem to be more variable and less stable. The study provides methodological contributions for the evaluation of SAF alternatives with fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and provides strategic implications for manufacturers and airlines in achieving the low-carbon targets of the aviation sector.

One disappointing truth: carbon capture was supposed to save us by now, and we have only managed to reach 50 million tonnes of global CO2 storage per year with where we needed to be at 1 billion tonnes by 2030.

As CCUS projects continue to face delays and climate change continues to accelerate, the technology that was supposed to be our salvation is desperately racing against time. CCUS technology is one of the most promising runners in this race, but there’s still a lot to catch up on.

In this article, we will break down the phenomenon of CCUS, define the carbon capture processes, understand what happens after capture, and see the role carbon tracking plays. We will also try to answer a question: Is CCUS a promising technology? Let’s start by defining it.

What is CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation, and storage)?

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a form of technology that captures CO2 emissions from industrial sources and power plants or directly from the atmosphere.

According to the EU Science Hub, at the EU level, 30% of CO2 emissions come from fossil-fuel combustion in power generation and energy-intensive industries, such as cement and steel. The process consists of three parts: the capture of CO2 from the source, transporting it to a storage site via pipelines or ships, and permanently storing it below ground or utilizing it to create another product.

The history of carbon capture goes back to the 1920s, and now, around the globe, the International Energy Agency reports that CCUS capacity has grown to just over 50 Mt of operational capacity as of 2025, with the expectation of growing to 430 Mt by 2030. However, developers are now also focusing more on advancing existing projects, with 60% of the pipeline in advanced development stages blocked.

Difference between CCS and CCU

Within the wider framework of CCUS’s emissions reduction technology, there are two separate approaches - CCS and CCU. They differ in some notable aspects:

Goal. CCS permanently stores CO2 underground to stop emissions, with cleanenergywire.org noting it's ""essential for achieving climate goals, particularly for limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C."" CCU turns captured CO2 into useful products, with CO2 Value Europe stating it will reduce EU emissions by 250Mt by 2050.

Challenges. CCS needs suitable underground storage sites - IOGP Europe shows projects like Norway's Smeaheia (5 Mtpa planned 2028) require specific porous rock with impermeable caps above. CCU faces high conversion costs, with projects like 4AirCRAFT (completed 2024) demonstrating synthetic kerosene production but requiring significant energy input.

Project types. CCS targets heavy industry - examples include Belgium's ArcelorMittal (0.125 Mtpa, operational since 2022) and Germany's Cemex cement plant (0.146 Mtpa, planned for 2026). CCU covers diverse sectors: aviation fuels (4AirCRAFT), building materials (Spain's AGGREGACO2), and chemicals (France's ABACUS algae project, completed 2020).

Carbon uses. CCS utilizes old oil/gas fields (like Croatia's CO2 EOR project, running since 2014) as well as saline formations (Denmark's Greensand, with a claim of .4 Mtpa by 2025). CCU uses different conversions: catalytically (4AirCRAFT for jet fuel), biologically (ABACUS algae-to-chemicals), or mineralisation (AGGREGACO2 for carbon-negative concrete).

Impact on timelines. CCS allows for immediate permanent removal, i.e., Iceland's Orca facility (0.004 Mtpa, operational), which is permanently storing underground CO2. CCU allows for temporary storage, in that most products will re-release the CO2, with the exception of the mineralized building materials, which CO2 Value Europe claims is permanently stores 8% of the overall carbon that is captured.

Current scale. CCS has scaled up to sizeable operational projects (Norway's Sleipner (1 Mtpa since 1996) and Longship (1.5 Mtpa, 2024). CCU remains at a modest scale, with most of the relevant projects having demonstrated proof-of-concept or pilot phase, with CO2 Value Europe projecting some 173Mt of utilization by 2050.

Business model. CCS cannot make money from enhanced CO2 storage; thus, it needs government support from carbon capture public companies, such as the UK's Net Zero Teesside (with 2 Mtpa in 2027), which is advancing under a ""policy backing"" only. CCU can sell products for profit, i.e., CO2 Value Europe indicates about 50% of utilization will become transport fuels and 42% chemicals, thus building market value.

With these differences in place, CCUS projects influence varied industries altogether. One of the most important ones is done for the airline industry.

How does CCUS impact the airline industry?

Aviation is coming under increasing pressure to decarbonize. The International Energy Agency reported that aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, almost 950 Mt CO2, as travel demand rebounded to almost 90% of pre-pandemic levels. If the ICAO forecasts hold true, the European Commission adds that emissions from aviation could triple by 2050 compared to 2015 levels. To respond to growing sustainable travel trends, potential CCUS technologies provide a number of pathways for the aviation industry to reach its net-zero commitment.

Noteworthy benefits of carbon capture and storage for aviation:

Sustainable aviation fuel. CCUS is enabling the production of synthetic fuels for aviation. Projects, such as 4AirCRAFT, have showcased the potential of producing synthetic aviation fuels, specifically kerosene. This would provide airlines with alternatives to fossil-based fuels.

Cost-competitive CCUS infrastructure. Initiatives, such as CO2 Hub in Zeebrugge, Belgium (planned for 20 Mtpa capture capacity by 2030), leverage shared infrastructure for carbon management strategies that airlines may be able to access.

Carbon offsetting. According to IATA, CCUS technology has the potential to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes. Direct Air Capture, a CCUS technology, can offer a way to remove carbon dioxide permanently, which meets aviation's additionality and permanent requirement for emission reductions.

Assist with regulatory compliance. Airlines are currently bound to adhere to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), whose full auctioning of allowances will increase by 2026. Credits that are derived from CCUS offerings may be beneficial compliance instruments.

In its report, the IPCC recognizes that ""CCUS will be critical to limit global warming to 1.5°C"" and that the target ""cannot be met"" without the use of such technologies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) calculates that CCUS could reduce global CO2 emissions by as much as 19%.

In terms of aviation, IATA states that CCUS, coupled with renewable biomass, could operate in ""carbon-negative"" mode, actually removing CO2 from the atmosphere while producing sustainable aviation fuels and making it essential to achieve net-zero ambitions.

How do carbon capture technologies work?

Point source carbon capture involves capturing CO2 emissions at their source, usually at industrial sources of energy generation, such as power plants or cement plants, or that create large quantities of CO2 (such as carbon capture for cars that produce 81% of non-industrial emissions) before the CO2 is released into the air. To understand how capture works, let’s break it into several types and describe each one with its goals, benefits, and real projects.

Post-combustion capture

Post-combustion CO2 utilization technology captures carbon dioxide from flue gases after the combustion of fossil fuels, with chemical solvents (generally amine-based solutions or carbon capture fertilizers, like those offered by the Fertilizers Europe project). This approach allows components to be replaced without impacting the operations of the power plant. Furthermore, the phased introduction of this technology facilitates a reduction in operational disruption and investment risk, as the post-combustion CCUS value chain applies to pre-existing plants.

Europe's first fully operational post-combustion carbon capture plant is the Eni Casalborsetti natural gas treatment plant near Ravenna, Italy, shows the technology's capabilities while utilizing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' KM CDR Process™ to capture around 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The facility has an impressive 90% CO2 reduction rate, with peaks of 96% efficiency, before transporting captured CO2 via reconverted gas pipelines to a depleted offshore gas field for permanent storage.

The technology is viable for decarbonizing existing industrial infrastructure worldwide using advanced solvent technologies such as, but not limited to, the KS-21™ system, with 18 commercial plants already deployed.

Pre-combustion capture

Pre-combustion capture technology (PCC) targets the CO2 in synthetic gas (syngas) prior to combustion. This CCUS technology uses acid gas removal technologies, which have been used across many industrial sectors for decades. The Global CCS Institute describes PCC as working under pressure (> 40 bar, for example), the increased pressure allows the use of physical solvents like Selexol to promote CO2 regeneration in a flash drum, while also reducing the power requirement for the absorption system.

The process itself involves converting syngas to hydrogen and CO2 through one or more water-gas shift reactions before separating the CO2 using chemical or physical absorbents, which dissolve acid gases, achieving CO2 removal rates of >90% in practice.

Applications for the technology are found in natural gas processing, hydrogen production, and coal gasification, with its commercially mature distilable gas separation technology. The DECARBit CCUS project of the European Commission aims to reduce the price of PCC to 15 euros per captured ton. Axens states that for processes with high-pressure syngas treatment (15-20% CO2 at 20-30 bar), physical solvents become the best option for investing in carbon capture technology in industrial applications, such as fertilizer producers and refineries.

Oxyfuel combustion

Oxy-fuel combustion involves burning air that has been stripped of nitrogen and argon to produce high concentrations of oxygen that combust with fuel (coal or natural gas) in the combustor, producing steam and CO2 for gas turbine efficiency and power generation.

According to the technology study by Southwest Research Institute, scrubbed CO2 is taken in a power plant, with a capture rate above 90% and with the CO2 being used again, as it can be used in refrigeration manufacturing, carbonation of drinks, or oil and gas applications. In particular, there are advantages of carbon capture for the use of traditional fuels, such as coal, which is typically considered a high-emission fuel. Oxy-fuel conditions allow coal to burn cleaner and at the same time maintaining the abundant feedstock.

The Callide Oxyfuel Project at Callide A Power Station achieved more than 10,000 hours of oxy-combustion and 5,000 hours of carbon uses. Southwest Research Institute continues to research direct-fired supercritical CO2 (sCO2) power cycles, by combining sCO2 technology with oxy-combustion, and is able to achieve nearly 100% CO2 capture efficiency. It also partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy in the development of megawatt-scale demonstration equipment for power plant carbon capture.

Digital solutions for CCUS

Digital technologies are removing cost barriers that have previously limited CO2 utilization technology adoption. In remarks made by Prateek Bumb, co-founder and CTO of Carbon Clean, capture rates can ""substantially exceed"" 90-95%, but cost has historically been a barrier to adoption as ""the operating costs for large conventional plants with high columns are difficult to justify for many emitters, especially small-to-mid-size companies.""

Advanced digital technologies have the potential to be used to reduce the carbon capture costs through optimization and prediction.

Integrated management platforms that visualize the entire CCUS value chain and enable CO2 supply-demand matching, e.g., Mitsubishi's CO2NNEX® we mentioned.

Digital twins for monitoring CO2 pipeline flows in real time and optimizing energy consumption in power systems.

AI and machine learning, with anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and process optimization that match theoretical operating conditions with operational realities.

Process control systems for carbon capture equipment, e.g., AspenTech's Aspen solution that we described above.

Advanced simulation tools, such as SLB's Intersect simulator, for improved subsurface modeling and characterization of CO2 storage sites.

Now that we have sorted out the carbon capture methods, let’s focus on the next steps that are equally important.

Utilization and storage: What happens after capture?

Capture, as complex as it is, is just the first step of CCUS. CO2 utilization technology is extremely diverse and important as well. Let’s now understand what happens after carbon has been captured.

Carbon utilization strategies: fuels, building materials, chemicals

Following CO2 capture, there are several main pathways for carbon utilization. The main idea remains the same, however, to transform captured carbon into useful products. These pathways generalize over 25 other ways, which could represent substantial carbon capture and sequestration market opportunities by 2040.

Utilization of fuels and chemicals.

For chemical processes, CO2 is utilized via reaction with hydrogen to produce fuels and chemicals. According to the Planete Energies group, the chemical sector currently uses:

100 million tons of CO2/year for producing fertilizers based on urea.

130-280 Mt CO2/year for e-methanol, one of the few commercially viable products, as demonstrated by plant developments such as Topsoe's facility in Spain, which produces 40,000 tons annually of e-methanol and captures 56,000 tons of CO2.

E-kerosene for aviation presents a great market for carbon uses, estimated to be between 50-150 Mt CO2/year, but without regulatory incentives, its adoption is slow..

Both e-methanol and e-kerosene share the opportunity to establish biogenic CO2 scarcity constraints, while they both provide closed carbon cycles that only emit the amount of CO2 they captured to produce the fuels.

Construction applications.

Construction materials have the greatest CO2 utilization potential, with construction aggregates capable of utilizing 0.5-2 Gt CO2/year, according to extensive research. However, low product value makes economic competitiveness questionable.

CO2-cured concrete is a smaller option of carbon reduction technologies, but has stronger revenue potential (40-70 Mt CO2/year), and the technology is nearly ready for commercialization (as shown by the Carbon Upcycling projects).

Materials systems such as CarboPac-C from Bright Renewables are also examining how to capture CO2 from flue gas to produce either liquid or gaseous CO2 for construction applications.

The construction utilization pathway represents a market opportunity value of $400 billion with the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 3 Gt/year by 2030.

Biological utilization with microalgae and cyanobacteria.

Biological utilization is based on photosynthetically functioning organisms using large amounts of CO2 to support growth. The cultivation of microalgae has achieved commercial maturity for producing high-value products, including pigments and omega-3 fatty acids.

Green algae contain 50-70% protein on a dry weight basis, providing opportunities for the peri-urban agriculture application of animal feed with reduced land allocation. Commercial viability has already been established with the production of astaxanthin. The pathway for microalgal-to-ethanol conversion demonstrated that cyanobacteria were more readily genetically manipulated than green algae.

Engineered cyanobacterial strains have been developed to produce ethanol, fatty acids (which can be consumed by animals), 2,3-butanediol, and other chemicals, although a majority of commercially relevant products are still not yet economically viable.

Carbon storage solutions: geological formations, saline aquifers

After CO2 capture, permanent geological storage is the next most effective long-term climate change mitigation option on an economical scale. Deep saline aquifers and geological formations represent substantial geological storage potential through proven methods, with commercial viability demonstrated in numerous deployment examples.

Deep saline aquifers.

According to research published on MDPI, deep saline aquifers have the greatest estimated storage capacity, ranging from 400 to upwards of 10,000 gigatonnes of CO2. Underground saline aquifers can provide all the conditions for permanent CO2 storage through pressure increase, structural, residual, solubility, and mineral trapping. Pioneering CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers provides commercial feasibility examples such as Australia's Gorgon project, at up to 4 million tonnes per year in the Dupuy saline formation.

Geological formations.

Depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs offer the advantage among other carbon capture materials as they provide a proven storage with existing natural infrastructure.

CO2-Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2-EOR) captures value from two sources: injecting 300-600 kg of CO2 per recovered barrel of oil, and it achieves permanent storage for the majority of injected CO2 underground.

Carbon Storage with Enhanced Gas Recovery (CSEGR) in depleted natural gas fields allows for the permanent storage of CO2 while capturing remaining natural gas resources potential with negligible possibility of leakage, because the depleted natural gas fields and overlying geology have proven containment capabilities.

In regard to the technical basis, if site selection and management protocols follow the IPCC assessments of geological storage, the majority of the CO2 can be retained for longer than 1,000 years with a 99% or better certainty for permanent retention.

Risk management and monitoring of stored CO₂

Risk management is essential to the safe geological storage of CO2 and must be continuously monitored for the duration of the life of the project. The European Commission CCS Directive states that effective storage requires permanent containment, and associated health and environmental risks of any CCUS technology should be as low as reasonably practical.

It defines the following considerations for risk management and monitoring:

Risk assessment should be based on site-specific risk screening that uses likelihood categories and consequence rating criteria for human and environmental health.

The hazard identification approach should identify all potential hazards associated with CO2 leakage pathways, formation fluid displacement, and induced seismicity.

A risk management monitoring program should be organized, documented, and related to the project-specific risks as effectively as possible within budget.

A typical commercial project (≥1 Mt CO2/year) should have an annual monitoring budget of US$1-4 million, which is based on <5% total project costs (IEA Technology Collaboration Programme).

A monitoring approach should adopt a mix of monitoring technologies capable of detecting any leakage or assessing CO2 migration, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Current operational projects showcase a strong level of faith in the monitoring technologies currently available, with better efficiency achieved by incorporating risk-based methods. Carbon offset companies like Terrapas and CarbonClick facilitate the commercial viability and cost-efficiency pros of carbon capture, allowing the sale of carbon credits for tax reduction and showcasing sustainability initiatives. None of this would be possible without carbon tracking.

How does carbon tracking enhance CCUS performance?

To see how carbon tracking approaches enhance carbon utilization and capture, let’s review how each specific type of technology influences the development of this industry.

Emissions calculators.

Emissions calculators are necessary tools for measuring carbon footprints using internationally accepted methodologies. They enable businesses to accurately measure carbon footprint of their travel with a data-driven approach and provide a solid foundation for sustainable decision-making and identifying improvements. This, in turn, allows organisations to set realistic emissions reduction targets and build cultures of sustainability within their organisations. Apart from assisting businesses with green initiatives, personal carbon capture devices like CarbinX help use the converted carbon into energy for residential buildings.

Dashboards with real-time CO2 analytics.

Real-time CO2 analytics dashboards and carbon reporting software, such as those offered through StormGeo and Sievo CO2 provide better access to carbon emissions data and insight. These dashboards bring together the organization’s CO2 emission data and metrics, give a complete overview of the organization’s environmental impacts, and provide more visibility by mapping the spent data with emission data. The dashboards allow users to create customized reports that allow unlimited collaboration, while the totals are being updated in real-time.

Carbon emission budgeting.

Carbon emission budgeting involves creating measurable emission targets that are specific to an organization's sustainability goals. When used effectively, it can develop a framework for decreasing environmental impact while incorporating and utilizing sustainable travel practices. Ultimately, organizations are perceiving carbon emissions budgeting as an investment towards future business continuity, allowing them to maintain a place on the leading edge of responsible environmental activity.

Emissions visibility while flight shopping.

Transparency while booking flights creates awareness of the emissions associated with flights and other travel options. When carbon footprints are shown next to every flight option, it allows travelers to make informed decisions about their travel choices consistent with environmentally friendly or sustainable practices. In addition, selecting airlines with robust sustainability credentials (like Wizz Air and Air France-KLM) that use airline digital solutions reinforces responsible travel practices and supports business travel that has less impact on the planet.

Individual emissions visibility.

Individual emissions tracking displays a detailed breakdown of personal travel selections and the carbon emissions related to those selections. Armed with this level of detail, people can figure out exactly what they can change in that travel selection to lower their environmental impact. Acting on emission visibility accomplishes two things: One, it allows individuals to act on that visible impact, and, more importantly, it creates awareness and a corresponding shift in collective action within an organization.

Environmental initiatives and carbon offsetting.

Investing in high-quality carbon credits offsets unavoidable emissions and gets you certified greenhouse gas reductions through a project-based certification system. Contributing to global research and development projects that focus on environmental protection can establish a global positive ripple effect. This is more than just carbon offsets - this is about supporting organizations that model and promote corporate responsibility and community development.

Technology and modern approaches help support CCUS projects and the related benefits they bring.

What is their role in CCUS?

Transportation causes nearly 20% of global CO2 emissions (out of 36.7 billion tons globally; Ritchie, Science Direct). As such, there is significant potential for reductions in carbon emissions in this sector to fit into the context of carbon capture, utilization.

Carbon tracking applications help identify emissions sources, calculate the associated emissions impact, and provide a basis for behavioural change to intentionally reduce the total carbon to capture and store.

In fact, research suggests that by using carbon footprint tracking apps, emissions could be reduced by as much as 23% through continuous feedback (Hoffmann et al., Science Direct). However, the relative impact will vary - mobility reported a 12% reduction, and household activities had up to a 35% reduction.

The evidence of success is real, particularly concerning tourism in Ireland. The Fáilte Ireland Carbon Calculator has involved over 500 businesses to measure and collectively reduce emissions, which shows how tracking technologies can provide a means of bridging the information gap for sustainable decision-making.

Best carbon tracking tools

To reduce their carbon footprint, companies and individuals can use carbon tracking tools that allow them to easily monitor daily emissions. Let’s review the top carbon capture technologies you can use.

The future of CCUS in climate strategy

The UK government's CCUS investor roadmap establishes its national commitment to CCUS development, which advises the establishment of four CCUS low-carbon industrial clusters that are expected to capture between 20-30MtCO2 per year by 2030. The UK is now in a unique position in that the estimated 78Gt of CO2 storage potential in the UK Continental Shelf will potentially provide one of the largest and most available CO2 storage capacities in Europe.

Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report confirms CCUS technology can support global climate aims such as the 1.5°C warming targets and must go hand-in-hand with rapid emission reductions to be able to achieve net-zero emissions. It’s particularly important for hard-to-abate sectors like cement, where CCUS will be “essential to avoid emissions from the limestone calcination process.”

Integration with hydrogen production and DAC (Direct Air Capture)

The combination of CCUS technology and hydrogen production brings one step closer to net-zero emissions through applications like ""blue hydrogen"" using natural gas reforming. Hongfang Lu outlined this pathway in a paper, ""Hydrogen production in integration with CCUS,"" published in Science Direct. This pathway provides immediate access to clean hydrogen while using current industrial infrastructure and expertise. Here is the possible workflow and results:

Capture integration. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is directly integrated into grey hydrogen production processes using absorption, adsorption, and DAC; it is estimated that current technology has a 10-20% increased energy demand relative to the grey hydrogen production chain.

Economic optimization. Large-scale implementation gives CCUS companies the ability to achieve cost reductions of approximately 30-40% over smaller installations. Blue hydrogen production could be achieved for 1.2-2.1 USD/kg, assuming natural gas prices are in the range of 1.4-6.3 USD/GJ.

Infrastructure development. The required shared transport and storage infrastructure is allowed by the regional clustering of hydrogen production, storage, and transport. With projects like Northern Lights, infrastructure development reduces the costs for each hydrogen project.

Catalyst performance. Investing in the development of high-performance catalysts, higher selectivity, and improved resistance to carbon deposition and materials sintering. Especially, alkali metals provide improved catalytic performance.

Policy support. Implementation will need government policies that include carbon taxes, market incentives, and industry engagement models that capture, transport, utilize, and store projects and development.

Apart from hydrogen production, direct air capture is another useful complementary technology to point-source CO2 capture because it removes atmospheric CO2 directly. Specialized DAC technology exists that is also capable of integrating with facilities with low-concentration CO2 waste emissions, lessening the boundary condition for mass and thermal transport.

Use of a contactor system designed for CO2 adsorption-desorption using solid-amine materials for atmospheric CO2 capture.

Use of waste heat and recoverable energy from co-located industrial facilities to lower operational costs

Integration of low-concentration CO2 streams from industrial vents to improve the efficiency of the overall system.

Creation of commercial systems based on actual field-testing data, for use internationally.

Production of concentrated (>99%) CO2 that is suitable for either utilization or storage.

The DAC RECO2UP project, finalized in July 2024, shows how technology enhances the advantages of carbon capture storage. As the first direct air capture system, the project conducted five testing campaigns and over 3,300 operational hours. The project demonstrated a reduction in the cost required to capture CO2, produced concentrated CO2 streams with a purity of >99%, and achieved more than what was originally requested. The project also verified that DAC technology has commercial promise around cost.

Innovation trends and emerging technologies

The CCUS industry is at a turning point as the world moves toward net-zero emissions targets. After demonstrating technological feasibility, the sector has large hurdles remaining in order to scale up to the immense deployment needs for global decarbonization.

Some innovative trends help move this industry forward:

AI is changing the game with respect to finding suitable CCUS storage sites. It can quickly analyze potential aquifers and adjacent geological features, identifying site potential rapidly. AI can 'see' the presence of faults and honeycombed fractures much more clearly than traditional methods. Using an AI model, location screening of storage sites can happen rapidly before any excavation, and to understand whether there is trap and seal integrity in the site.

The hub & network model

of creating larger CCUS hubs and networks has led from isolated projects to integrated systems of infrastructure that support multiple emitters from different industrial sectors.

Standardization helps as the sector is approaching a shift from customized processes and CCUS equipment being designed for a specific site, to standardized equipment and mass manufacture as a low-cost option that speeds up deployment.

Cross-sectoral integration, or the delivery of CO₂ from gas processing to the hard-to-evade sectors of cement, steel, chemicals, fertilizers, and waste.

Shared-infrastructure development causes regional economic and industrial clusters to facilitate multiple emitters utilizing shared CO₂ transport and storage infrastructure.

Advanced business structures make risk management more attractive for private investment, developing market acceptance for CCUS projects to set commercial viability.

Improved storage technology helps drive geological storage technology to deliver the massive amounts of CO₂ in the net-zero scenarios.

The main problems with carbon capture and storage are high costs, regulatory ambiguities, and bespoke manufacturing models that limit scale. However, some emerging trends are promising, such as more robust policy instruments, particularly the reformed EU's Emissions Trading System and the Clean Industrial Deal.",https://www.hospitalitynet.org/picture/153185082.jpg?t=1751881108,N,,2025-09-26 10:57:28.539506

Layered Credit Advantage - Hydrogen produced is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Tax Credits, while the clean power generated can reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's fuels, boosting the value of its 45Z and LCFS credits, or be sold into the local energy grid to meet rising demand for renewable energy.

Scalable Roadmap - The project is expected to begin with a 100-kW pilot and expand to modular 250-kW units, building toward multi-megawatt capacity.

HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / September 26, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), announces that it has signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") with Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator, through its subsidiary New Rise Renewables Reno, LLC (""New Rise Reno"") to explore deploying Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets at the New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets are expected to be installed at New Rise Reno to convert byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into clean, renewable electricity. Its proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams and transform them into zero-carbon electricity. In the coming weeks, XCF and Posh plan to publish a white paper outlining how Flex-Fuel Gensets can transform byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into scalable sources of renewable electricity.

By integrating Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets, XCF expects to unlock a combination of tax incentives that enhances both facility economics and sustainability metrics. Hydrogen produced by the system is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, while electricity generated from that hydrogen is expected to produce Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""). When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region's expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world's largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno's byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""XCF's mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem. Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented:

""Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power. Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.""

The LOI is non-binding, and project execution remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.
