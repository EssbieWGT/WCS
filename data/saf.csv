More than 60 vehicles involved in airport operations are now running on biodiesel instead of fossil-based diesel. These include airfield operations and security team vehicles, fire trucks and snow clearing vehicles.

The airport has worked with biodiesel supplier YourNRG to bring about the change, which comes as its parent company, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), launches its five-year Sustainability Strategy, Creating a sustainable future for all.

The airport’s biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oils and fats which undergo a hydrogen treatment to be turned into renewable fuel which reduces carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil diesel. It also drastically lowers particulate emissions and is biodegradable, making it safer for the environment than traditional diesel.

East Midlands Airport’s managing director, Steve Griffiths, said: “We are always looking at ways to reduce our impact on the environment, with the aim of hitting Manchester Airport Group’s target of achieving net-zero operations by 2038.

“Working with YourNRG to convert our fleet of ground vehicles is a great step forward, with significant emissions reductions and other environmental benefits.”

Lee Reason, commercial director at Your NRG, said: ""We're proud to support East Midlands Airport on its journey toward decarbonisation. By transitioning their operational fleet to HVO Fuel, they've taken a major step in reducing emissions without compromising on performance.

“It's a powerful example of how sustainable alternatives can deliver real impact today.

The findings provide crucial insights for aerospace leaders transitioning to sustainable, low-emission fuels whilst ensuring safety and reliability remain uncompromised.

Addressing Critical Industry Challenges

As the aerospace industry intensifies its focus on decarbonisation, SAFs offer substantial CO2 reductions of over 65 percent compared to traditional jet fuels. However, challenges such as seal compatibility continue to present obstacles to widespread adoption. To address these concerns, Greene Tweed conducted rigorous testing to ensure its seals perform effectively with these advanced fuel formulations.

Shawn McCloskey, Greene Tweed’s chief commercial officer, emphasised the practical significance of the research. “Sustainable aviation fuels offer a practical path to reducing emissions, particularly for long-haul flights, where batteries and hydrogen remain less feasible,” McCloskey said. “Our study ensures aerospace customers have reliable seal solutions for SAF adoption without compromising safety or performance.”

Comprehensive Testing Methodology

Greene Tweed collaborated with multiple suppliers to evaluate SAF blends and their effects on the physical properties of fluorine-based elastomers FKM and FVMQ. The study assessed performance across various SAF blends, including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), following ASTM D7566 standards.

Testing protocols simulated extreme aerospace environments, including temperatures reaching 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure conditions to ensure real-world applicability.

Key Research Findings

The study yielded several significant findings that demonstrate the viability of Greene Tweed’s seal solutions for SAF applications:

Consistent Performance was observed across FKM compounds (731, 772, 665), which maintained their effectiveness across various blends, including three SPKs, 50/50 blends with control fluid, and 20 percent SAK with 80 percent SPKs.

Material Properties testing revealed that FKM elastomers demonstrated strong compatibility with harsh SAF conditions, including fluid ageing and dry-out scenarios that commonly occur in aerospace applications.

Aromatic Content Impact emerged as a critical factor, with the research confirming that aromatic content in SAF formulations, particularly SAK blends, plays a vital role in maintaining material performance.

Advanced Testing Protocols under accelerated ageing conditions provided confirmation of long-term reliability, addressing industry concerns about component longevity.

Dr Ronald Campbell, senior technical advisor at Greene Tweed, highlighted the comprehensive nature of the research. “By analysing the effects of chemical interactions between SAF blends and advanced elastomers, we have developed a robust data set that established long-term reliability and compatibility in extreme aerospace conditions,” Campbell noted.

Supporting Industry Decarbonisation Goals

The research arrives at a critical juncture for the aviation industry, which is working towards carbon-neutral growth targets. US airlines have set ambitious goals for a 50 percent CO2 reduction by 2050, making SAFs a vital component of decarbonisation strategies.

Greene Tweed’s findings directly support these environmental objectives by ensuring component compatibility with SAF whilst maintaining the safety and operational performance standards required in aerospace applications.

Industry Engagement and Future Applications

The research results were recently highlighted in an Aviation Week webinar, where Greene Tweed detailed its comprehensive testing methodology and findings. The company’s representatives will also present these solutions at the upcoming Paris Air Show 2025, providing industry professionals with opportunities to explore practical applications of the technology.

The study represents a significant advancement in addressing one of the key technical challenges facing SAF adoption, potentially accelerating the industry’s transition to more sustainable fuel alternatives whilst maintaining the rigorous safety and performance standards essential to aerospace operations.",https://storageterminalsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ST-318214319-copy-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:56:46.799111

But a new report takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.

The report, from the World Resources Institute, which has been critical of U.S. biofuel policy in the past, draws from 100 academic studies on biofuel impacts. It concludes that ethanol policy has been largely a failure and ought to be reconsidered, especially as the world needs more land to produce food to meet growing demand.

“Multiple studies show that U.S. biofuel policies have reshaped crop production, displacing food crops and driving up emissions from land conversion, tillage and fertilizer use,” said the report’s lead author, Haley Leslie-Bole. “Corn-based ethanol, in particular, has contributed to nutrient runoff, degraded water quality and harmed wildlife habitat. As climate pressures grow, increasing irrigation and refining for first-gen biofuels could deepen water scarcity in already drought-prone parts of the Midwest.”

The conversion of Midwestern agricultural land has been sweeping. Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent. Corn and soybeans are now grown on 92 and 86 million acres of land respectively—and roughly a third of those crops go to produce ethanol. That means about 30 million acres of land that could be used to grow food crops are instead being used to produce ethanol, despite ethanol only accounting for 6 percent of the country’s transportation fuel.

The biofuels industry—which includes refiners, corn and soy growers and the influential agriculture lobby writ large—have long insisted that corn- and soy-based biofuels provide an energy efficient alternative to fossil-based fuels. Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have agreed.

The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

In addition to greenhouse gas reductions, the industry and its allies in Congress have also continued to say that ethanol is a primary mainstay of the rural economy, benefiting communities across the Midwest.

But a growing body of research—much of which the industry has tried to debunk and deride—suggests that ethanol actually may not provide the benefits that policies require. It may, in fact, produce more greenhouse gases than the fossil fuels it was intended to replace. Recent research says that biofuel refiners also emit significant amounts of carcinogenic and dangerous substances, including hexane and formaldehyde, in greater amounts than petroleum refineries.

The new report points to research saying that increased production of biofuels from corn and soy could actually raise greenhouse gas emissions, largely from carbon emissions linked to clearing land in other countries to compensate for the use of land in the Midwest.

On top of that, corn is an especially fertilizer-hungry crop requiring large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizer, which releases huge amounts of nitrous oxide when it interacts with the soil. American farming is by far the largest source of domestic nitrous oxide emissions already—about 50 percent. If biofuel policies lead to expanded production, emissions of this enormously powerful greenhouse gas will likely increase, too.

The new report concludes that not only will the expansion of ethanol increase greenhouse gas emissions, it has also failed to provide the social and financial benefits to Midwestern communities that lawmakers and the industry say it has. (The report defines the Midwest as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,

South Dakota and Wisconsin.)

“The benefits from biofuels remain concentrated in the hands of a few,” Leslie-Bole said. “As subsidies flow, so may the trend of farmland consolidation, increasing inaccessibility of farmland in the Midwest and locking out emerging or low-resource farmers. This means the benefits of biofuels production are flowing to fewer people, while more are left bearing the costs.”

New policies being considered in state legislatures and Congress, including additional tax credits and support for biofuel-based aviation fuel, could expand production, potentially causing more land conversion and greenhouse gas emissions, widening the gap between the rural communities and rich agribusinesses at a time when food demand is climbing and, critics say, land should be used to grow food instead.

President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, passed by the House and currently being negotiated in the Senate, would not only extend tax credits for biofuels producers, it specifically excludes calculations of emissions from land conversion when determining what qualifies as a low-emission fuel.

The primary biofuels industry trade groups, including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, did not respond to Inside Climate News requests for comment or interviews.

An employee with the Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers, not ethanol, said the report vastly overstates the carbon emissions from crop-based fuels by comparing the farmed land to natural landscapes, which no longer exist.

They also noted that the impact of soy-based fuels in 2024 was more than $42 billion, providing over 100,000 jobs.

“Ten percent of the value of every bushel of soybeans is linked to biomass-based fuel,” they said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2166100083-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:21.814853

The aviation industry alongside government and manufacturing bodies is driving toward net-zero emissions which leads to substantial growth in the global SAF market that promises cleaner and greener airways.

🌱 What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel encompasses alternative fuels derived from biomass, waste oils, municipal solid waste, algae, or captured CO₂ which enable aircraft to operate with reduced carbon emissions compared to standard jet fuel.

Depending on both feedstock type and production techniques SAF achieves lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 80% which positions it as a fundamental element of aviation's decarbonization roadmap.

✈️ Why Airlines Are Fueling Up on SAF

The aviation industry presently generates between 2 and 3 percent of worldwide CO₂ emissions which are expected to increase when air travel returns to normal after the pandemic. A growing number of airlines have established bold climate pledges which include achieving net-zero emissions by the year 2050.

SAF delivers a critical contribution to aviation decarbonization by providing a drop-in fuel option compatible with current aircraft and fueling systems which removes the requirement for extensive retrofits or new technology deployment. The production increase enables immediate scalability.

Major airlines such as United Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa and Emirates have started integrating SAF into their operations through long-term off-take contracts with fuel producers.

📈 Market Outlook: Soaring to New Heights

Projections from the industry suggest the global SAF market will expand from USD 576.18 million in 2022 to more than USD 15.85 billion by 2030 with a CAGR above 57.5%. Key drivers include:

The European Union and United States authorities enforce regulations that require aviation fuels to decrease their carbon intensity levels.

The requirement for sustainable corporate travel is forcing airlines to implement eco-friendly travel options.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s SAF tax credit operates as an incentive and subsidy for sustainable aviation fuels.

Technological innovations are reducing production costs while simultaneously boosting yield efficiency.

Europe leads the way in SAF adoption because of strict environmental policies and ReFuelEU mandates yet North America and Asia-Pacific focus on building significant domestic SAF production capabilities.

🌍 Global Collaboration: Policy Meets Innovation

Multiple stakeholders beyond airlines contribute to the growing momentum behind SAF. Governments and fuel producers along with airports and technology companies are building strategic partnerships to expand production output.

The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and ICAO's CORSIA framework develop a unified SAF adoption roadmap. Both startups and large energy corporations are pioneering new production technologies such as power-to-liquid synthetic fuels and carbon capture-based synthesis methods.

🚧 Challenges on the Flight Path

Despite its promise, SAF adoption faces hurdles:

High costs: The price of SAF stands at two to five times higher than that of conventional fossil-based jet fuel at present.

Limited supply: The usage of SAF makes up under 0.1% of the total aviation fuel consumption worldwide today.

Feedstock competition: Bio-based resources face growing pressure because sectors like shipping and road transport require more demand.

Production scaling combined with better logistics systems and growing investor trust works to gradually overcome existing challenges.

🛫 The Future of Green Flight

Experts predict that Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs to make up 65% of all aviation fuel by 2050 to help achieve global net-zero objectives. The future holds significant potential with upcoming advances in advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels that promise to both lower emissions and build a resilient aviation sector prepared for future challenges.

✅ Conclusion

While the journey is far from over, the destination is clear: Travel by air can achieve sustainability while maintaining environmental protection at high altitudes.

However, the road to a sustainable aviation future is long, and more efforts are needed to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.","The European Union has initiated an ambitious program aimed at promoting the airline industry’s transition to cleaner fuel. The EU is offering generous subsidies with the hope that it will induce the use of greater volumes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be able to dramatically reduce the sector’s carbon footprint. The action is just one of the steps the EU is taking in an effort to tackle climate change in addition to greening aviation.

A Game Changer for the Aviation Sector

Under this new program, the EU has committed to subsidising the purchase of over 200 million litres of SAF. This volume represents about 15% of the current global SAF production, as calculated by the European Commission. With the airline industry producing around 1.3 billion litres of SAF last year, this initiative is expected to give a substantial boost to SAF consumption, helping the aviation sector reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.

In terms of financial support, the EU is using funds from the sale of carbon emissions permits to cover the price gap between traditional kerosene and SAF. This approach is expected to make SAF more competitive, as it currently costs several times more than conventional jet fuel.

Key Features of the EU SAF Subsidy Program

The EU’s subsidy plan offers significant financial backing to airlines looking to transition to greener fuel. Here’s how it works:

Subsidy Amounts: Airlines can receive subsidies of up to 6 euros per litre for e-fuels (synthetic fuels made from captured CO2) and 0.5 euros per litre for biofuels.

Volume of Subsidised SAF: The program supports up to 216 million litres of e-fuels or up to 2.6 billion litres of biofuels.

Carbon Emissions Permits: The EU is funding this initiative through revenues from the sale of carbon emissions permits. This is intended to offset the higher cost of SAF, which remains a major barrier to widespread adoption.

This subsidy program is a crucial step in helping airlines make SAF a viable alternative to kerosene. As airlines are pressured to meet the EU’s sustainability targets, these subsidies will ease the financial strain of transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

Challenges in Decarbonizing the Aviation Industry

The aviation sector has long been one of the hardest industries to decarbonize, primarily due to the high energy demands of air travel and the current lack of viable zero-emission aircraft. While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is seen as the most promising near-term solution, it still faces significant hurdles:

High Costs: SAF is significantly more expensive than traditional jet fuel, often costing three to five times more. This cost difference is a major obstacle to its widespread use.

Limited Supply: Currently, SAF accounts for only 0.3% of the global jet fuel supply, which highlights the sector’s reliance on fossil fuels.

Investment Gaps: Despite the potential benefits, the aviation industry has invested only a small portion of its revenue—typically between 1% and 3%—in SAF production, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group.

Given these challenges, the EU’s subsidy program is a critical intervention aimed at accelerating the adoption of SAF and reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

EU’s Ambitious Targets for SAF Adoption

The European Union has set clear targets for SAF usage at EU airports, which airlines are expected to meet in the coming years. These targets are part of the EU’s broader climate action plan:

2% SAF by 2025: By 2025, 2% of the fuel used at EU airports must come from SAF.

6% SAF by 2030: This requirement will rise to 6% by 2030, aligning with the EU’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

To ensure these targets are met, airlines are required to purchase carbon emissions permits to offset the greenhouse gases produced by their flights. These permits were previously provided to airlines for free but are now being phased out, pushing airlines to reduce their emissions more rapidly.

The Role of SAF in the EU’s Green Transition

The push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is part of the EU’s broader commitment to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability across various industries. As aviation accounts for a significant portion of global emissions, transitioning to SAF represents a major step towards achieving the EU’s ambitious climate goals, including carbon neutrality by 2050.

In addition to reducing emissions, SAF also plays a critical role in reducing the environmental impact of the aviation sector in the near term. While zero-emission aircraft are still years away from being commercially viable, SAF provides a practical solution to mitigate the sector’s impact on the climate.

The Road Ahead for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The EU’s subsidy program for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) marks a significant move towards a more sustainable future for aviation. By easing the cost burden on airlines and providing clear targets for SAF adoption, the EU is helping to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation sector. However, the road to a sustainable aviation future is long, and more efforts are needed to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.

The current subsidy program is an important economic incentive for airline companies to adopt the use of SAF, but additional investment in production facilities, infrastructure, and technology will need to be made to establish SAF as an everyday fuel source. The support of the EU will enable the airline sector to make an actual contribution to lessening its environmental footprint and preventing climate change.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__78546-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:25.162615

Project SkyPower has coordinated a joint open letter from more than 40 leading companies across the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) value chain, calling on EU national governments to jointly commit funding to a pilot e-SAF tender. This tender would use a double-sided auction mechanism to help scale e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel produced from clean electricity) across Europe.

The EU has already recognised e-SAF as a key pathway to decarbonising aviation, with the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating increasing levels of e-SAF blending starting in 2030. Despite this political momentum, none of the planned e-SAF projects in Europe have reached Final Investment Decision (FID) — even though Europe hosts around 60% of the world’s planned e-SAF capacity.

To move forward, the market needs to overcome two fundamental failures:

Producers require long-term offtake contracts to secure financing and de-risk investment.

Buyers, such as fuel suppliers and airlines, need short-term flexibility to avoid locking into high initial prices as the market matures.

A market intermediary using a double-sided auction could resolve both challenges. This intermediary would operate as a government-backed commodity trader — contracting long-term with producers to provide revenue certainty, while selling short-term to buyers to maintain flexibility.

Compared to traditional flat subsidies, this model ensures greater efficiency of public funding by minimising the cost gap through competitive pricing on both sides of the market.

But time is short. With a typical lead time of four years from FID to fuel production, projects need to secure investment by the end of 2025/26 in order to deliver fuel in line with the 2030 ReFuelEU mandate.

We have examined different ways to lower global warming over the course of the series. Over the last weeks, we have summarized what practical results we can expect from the different alternatives we have to reduce global warming from Air Transport. We looked at the following alternatives:

How do the initiatives on our lineup compare

Of the five different alternative ways to lower global warming, which is the most practical and can lead to a significant reduction in the warming effect in the short term, and which alternatives are more for the long term?

Let’s first single out the CO2 reduction ones and then compare these to the warming effect from Contrails.

The first CO2-reducing one is the one that occurs regardless of initiatives to lower emissions, the industry’s typical improvement in fuel consumption over time, Alternative 2. We can conclude that this was a powerful one, with a reduction in CO2 emissions between now and 2050 of around 600 million tonnes of CO2, compared to the scenario where there was no improvement in fuel consumption.

This shall be compared to today’s yearly emissions from Air Transport, where 300 million tonnes of Jet A1 fuel were burned during 2024, resulting in 950 million tonnes of CO2. It doesn’t mean we lower these emissions to 350 million tonnes, as we have growth in civil aviation. It means we have 600 million tonnes less of Jet A1-related CO2 emissions than we would have if there were no improvement in fuel consumption from new aircraft replacing old ones.

We shall compare this to our scenario in Alternative 1. In this scenario, we assume success in producing CO2 and NOx-emission-free airliners based on various Turboprop replacement projects. These projects can replace the existing 19, 30- to 50-seat, and 70- to 100-seat turboprops currently in the market.

We assume that the 19- and 30-to-50-seat projects will result in Entry Into Service (EIS) of aircraft from 2030. The replacement of 70 to 100-seat turboprops starts in 2040 when we assume Airbus delivers its ZEROe fuel cell-based hydrogen airliner.

In total, these projects would have reduced Jet A1 consumption between now and 2050 by 7.2 million tonnes, equivalent to approximately 23 million tonnes of CO2.

Alternative 3 involves the gradual mandating of increased SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) blends in the EU, which would result in an improvement of 106 million tonnes by 2050.

Finally, we have of the CO2 emission reducing alternatives, the effects of ETS on air transport, Alternative 4. This is more difficult to quantify, as the reductions done by individual airlines are not researched and extrapolated in a convenient manner.

We had the figure of air transport contributing 50 million tonnes of CO2 in the EU and affiliated states, and research had shown a typical 7 to 10 percent reduction from an industrial sector enrolled in the EU ETS versus not. This would then mean a three to five tonne reduction in CO2 emissions from the EU ETS for air transport.

CO2 emission reduction summary

To summarize, we have from the CO2 reduction initiative the following reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050:

We shall compare the warming reduction effects of these reductions to the effect of NOx, other sources, and avoiding warming contrails in the next Corners, as this is an analysis that requires some thought and discussion.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:36.347015

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, often lauded as the aviation industry’s silver bullet for decarbonisation, carries with it more than just the promise of cleaner skies. As airports position themselves as climate leaders, SAF emerges as both a technological hope and a strategic dilemma. The deeper question lies not in whether SAF can reduce emissions but whether its deployment justifies large-scale airport expansion.

What Makes SAF So Special?

SAF replaces conventional jet fuel with a blend derived from municipal waste, biomass, or even CO2 captured directly from the atmosphere. When used, it emits CO2—just like fossil jet fuel—but this carbon originates from sources already in the carbon cycle, thus neutral in net terms if sourced and refined responsibly.

This closed-loop concept appeals to climate regulators and aviation industry stakeholders, especially as SAF can be used with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. It is already blended into jet fuel at major hubs and has successfully powered flights at 100 percent concentration during trials.

A Reality Check on Emissions

Despite its appeal, SAF is not a panacea. Its sustainability hinges on how it is produced. If fossil energy powers the production process or if land use changes release additional emissions, the lifecycle benefits are compromised. Moreover, current rules permit fuels to be labelled “sustainable” even if they reduce emissions by only 40 percent. In practice, blending limits (up to 50 percent with fossil jet fuel) result in flights achieving as little as 20 percent emission reductions.

Still, major policy frameworks are backing SAF. Mandates in the US, UK, and EU are targeting significant volumes by 2050. Ambitiously, SAF is expected to deliver up to 65 percent of aviation’s carbon reduction under industry net zero goals.

Why We Are Not Flying on 100 Percent SAF Yet

Cost remains a primary constraint. Even under optimistic scenarios, SAF production costs exceed fossil jet fuel by 190 to 500 percent. Technologies like direct air capture—while highly sustainable—are among the most expensive due to their energy intensity.

Moreover, feedstock limitations present a bottleneck. The most economical options like used cooking oil are finite. Scaling up SAF production will require shifting to more contentious sources, potentially disrupting food systems or increasing land-use emissions.

Scaling SAF Is Not About Parity, It Is About Prioritisation

A significant insight is that SAF will likely never reach cost parity with fossil fuels without sustained policy support. But that is not a flaw—it is a feature. SAF should be viewed not through the lens of cost parity, but as an ethical and environmental imperative.

Rather than delaying action until it becomes cheap, the challenge is to design aviation strategies that accept SAF’s higher cost as the price of climate responsibility. This repositions SAF not as a competitor to fossil fuels but as a cornerstone of responsible growth.

Does SAF Justify Airport Expansion?

Herein lies a paradox. SAF is often cited to support airport expansion, suggesting that increased capacity can be sustainable. However, even in best-case scenarios, SAF uptake will remain modest in the short term. Global SAF use was just 0.3 percent of aviation fuel in 2024. Realistically, it may only reach 6 percent by 2030 in the EU.

Furthermore, SAF does not address all climate impacts. Non-CO2 effects like nitrogen oxide emissions and contrail formation persist. While SAF may reduce contrail impacts by up to 44 percent, these benefits remain under study and are far from universal.

An Opportunity to Redefine Progress

Rather than a green light for unbounded airport expansion, SAF presents an opportunity to redefine what progress in aviation means. It calls for climate-aligned infrastructure, demand-side interventions, and strategic investments that support decarbonisation without defaulting to growth-based narratives.

Conclusion: A More Nuanced Flight Path

SAF is not a blank cheque for expansion, but a signal to invest in smarter, more sustainable aviation systems. Airports that align their development plans with realistic SAF deployment, lifecycle sustainability, and community impacts will lead the transition. In doing so, they position themselves not just as transport hubs but as leaders in climate-conscious infrastructure.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-36.svg,N,,2025-06-13 04:56:27.231179

Aviation is often portrayed as a high-emissions outlier in the global decarbonisation journey. Yet, beneath this complexity lies an accelerating shift—one aligning the skies with the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the heart of this transition is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a key that not only unlocks environmental progress but also delivers economic and social value.

Beyond Emissions: SAF’s Broader Sustainability Impact

SAF is widely known for its environmental advantages—reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. However, its contributions stretch far beyond climate impact. SAF is a multifaceted lever influencing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy: By diversifying energy sources within aviation, SAF fosters resilience in a fuel system historically reliant on fossil fuels.

SDG 13 – Climate Action: Its use directly reduces aviation’s emissions, strengthening the industry’s commitment to climate action.

SDG 1 and 10 – No Poverty and Reduced Inequalities: SAF production, especially when rooted in agricultural or waste-based feedstocks, supports income generation in rural economies and enhances inclusivity.

The production of SAF, particularly in developing regions, can create job opportunities and infrastructure, building local capacity and promoting equitable economic growth. This less-discussed dimension reinforces SAF’s relevance not just in terms of carbon metrics but also human development.

Why Aviation Needs a Unique Approach

While other transport sectors embrace electrification with relative ease, aviation operates under very different constraints. Aircraft demand high energy density and light-weight fuel solutions for long-haul travel—making batteries and hydrogen impractical in the near term.

A comparative glance at the feasibility of electrification across sectors reveals aviation’s limited flexibility:

This reinforces the indispensable role of SAF in aviation’s decarbonisation—providing a viable, drop-in solution that integrates seamlessly with current aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Decoding SAF’s Technical and Economic Profile

To fully appreciate SAF’s potential, it helps to compare its characteristics with conventional jet fuel:

Despite its cost premium, SAF presents a long-term value proposition. It can reduce particulate pollution and requires no modification to existing aircraft, reducing adoption friction and retrofitting costs.

The Role of Policy and Investment

For SAF to achieve scale, coordinated policies and robust financial support are essential:

Mandates: Europe’s ReFuelEU and the UK’s SAF Mandate are already setting required SAF blending targets, gradually increasing through 2050.

Incentives: The United States has introduced SAF-specific tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act to boost production economics.

Global Momentum and Strategic Investments

Worldwide, governments and aviation players are investing in SAF projects that are not only technologically promising but also strategically significant:

UAE: Collaboration between Cepsa and Etihad to accelerate local SAF research and production.

Australia: Qantas and Ampol’s 1.7 million-liter SAF import—a national milestone.

Japan: Strategic pivot by Eneos Holdings toward SAF as a primary decarbonisation tool.

Brazil: $1 billion investment by Envision Energy to produce SAF from sugarcane.

USA: United Airlines backing carbon capture startups and SAF technologies.

Spain: Cepsa’s SAF supply rollout across major national airports.

These initiatives highlight the growing consensus that SAF is not a temporary fix but a foundational element in aviation’s sustainability strategy.

Conclusion: Fueling a Broader Transformation

The true power of SAF lies not only in its carbon reduction potential but also in its alignment with broader societal goals. It is a solution that merges technological feasibility with global equity, climate ambition with economic opportunity.

As the aviation sector steers toward a decarbonised horizon, SAF serves as more than just a cleaner fuel—it represents a new operating model where environmental integrity and human development fly in tandem.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-35.svg,N,,2025-06-13 05:57:01.513190

Remarkably, this number is equivalent to the current emissions of the United States sourcing from international operations alone.

It is important for the stakeholders of the aviation industry to urgently evolve solutions to the impending freeze on their growing emissions (compared with 2019).","The Indian aviation market is on a high growth trajectory. This growth will eventually lead to a significant environmental challenge, the most important being the increase in GHG emissions. Based on the current emissions, India’s airline industry is projected to emit around 50 million tonne of CO2 in 2035 (domestic and international) at 5% annual emissions growth rate. Remarkably, this number is equivalent to the current emissions of the United States sourcing from international operations alone. Within the total share of emissions projected for the Indian aviation industry in 2035, 24.4% (around 12.2 million tonne) will come from international operations. This sector has been experiencing an explosive growth in the country, providing huge market potential and opportunities for new entrants. However, with the onset of ICAO’s CORSIA, there can be adverse fallout on the growth of the international component of the existing and new carriers. Based on the current analysis, it is estimated that in the second phase, CORSIA would impose high financial costs on Indian carriers,e.g. Air India, Indigo and SpiceJet, which have international operations. The costs in terms of offsets for the three operators could vary in the range of INR 1998 to 10018 crore1 (on average INR 666 and 3334 crore per annum at USD10 and USD50 price unit) between 2025 and 2037if 5% growth rate in emissions takes place. If the operations grow and emissions increase at 8% per annum, the offset costs could range from INR 3592 to 18009 crore2 (on average INR 1197 and 6003 crore per annum at USD10 and USD50 price unit)between 2025 and 2037 for all the airlines put together.

The cost can impose a constraint on the growth of international operations for Indian carriers and aviation industry, unless suitably moderated or addressed. As the progress to reduce emissions globally is slow, the cost of mitigating global emissions from the aviation sector is anticipated to be high. To overcome these challenges and reduce the financial burden, the Indian aviation industry will have to rely on the options of offsetting the emissions in the domestic or international carbon market, and/or promoting the use of biofuels or low carbon fuels.

It is important for the stakeholders of the aviation industry to urgently evolve solutions to the impending freeze on their growing emissions (compared with 2019). Amongst the possible actions is a range of measures covering improvements in energy efficiency, fuel efficiency, and switch to alternative fuels. While many of these are already part of a Whitepaper on National Green Aviation Policy, the new interventions could include creation of a market trading facility in emissions, and increased use of low carbon sustainable aviation fuels.

Emissions reduction credits generated in other sectors of economy can be made available to the operators. The existing domestic energy related markets in India can become the starting point for the development of a domestic emissions trading system if the relevant regulations are tweaked. Further, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help the industry meet a substantial part of its fuel need if adequate policy initiatives are taken in time. SAF will require ramping up of efforts for its production and commercialization and making it available on scale to the Indian airline operators to enable them to reduce or offset their emissions in the second phase of the CORSIA (2027–2035).

The government needs to prepare a clear action plan to identify and roll out these measures with a view to prepare the industry to meet the emerging challenge sufficiently and adequately before 2025.",https://www.teriin.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-13 02:56:29.630058

Irvine said that this project uses ATJ technology supplied by LanzaJet to convert ethanol into low carbon jet fuel and renewable diesel.
“Around 90 per cent of what is produced from Project Ulysses is SAF, and 10 per cent is renewable diesel.
Both outputs of the company – SAF and renewable diesel – will be tested and certified to globally recognised standards.","Manufacturer Monthly’s Jack Lloyd sat down with Jet Zero CFO, Mac Irvine, to discuss the company’s sustainable aviation fuel projects, which utilise renewable feedstocks to produce low carbon liquid fuels.

Founded four years ago by CEO Ed Mason, Jet Zero Australia is dedicated to the development and operation of large-scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] projects. These projects aim to decarbonise aviation, improve sovereign fuel security and bring a new and diverse industry to regional Australia.

The idea for Jet Zero began with Mason’s previous work in equity capital markets in the mining, resources, oil and gas sectors. In this previous employment, he witnessed numerous clients – in what are traditionally non-renewable sectors – begin to ask about decarbonising their operations.

This motivated Mason to think about solutions to a hard-to-abate industry, which ended up being aviation fuel production. Beginning as a part-time operation, in the past three years the company has become a full-time business, growing from strength to strength.

Jet Zero CFO Mac Irvine joined the company from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation [CEFC], the Australian green bank, in early 2024. It was a high-profile appointment which spoke to the success and ambition of the company as a commercially-minded developer of SAF projects.

“We are looking to decarbonise the aviation sector, but at the same time, support the agricultural sector and the regional communities where these projects are most likely to be developed and built,” said Irvine. “Jet Zero started four years ago and has developed into what I personally believe is the market-leading private sector developer in the SAF space.

“We are technology agnostic and deliver our projects with a commercial mindset. This means we can procure any technology from the marketplace, but importantly we focus on proven and scaled technologies.

“This approach has led us to pursue the Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathways.”

A sustainable pipeline of projects

Currently, Jet Zero has two major projects that have been announced. The flagship project, which is currently in Front-End Engineering Design [FEED], is Project Ulysses. Irvine said that this project uses ATJ technology supplied by LanzaJet to convert ethanol into low carbon jet fuel and renewable diesel.

“Around 90 per cent of what is produced from Project Ulysses is SAF, and 10 per cent is renewable diesel. That’s just how the technology works in practice,” said Irvine. “It’s about decarbonising the aviation sector and looking to keep the fuel onshore.”

For Ulysses, Jet Zero has secured a site at the Cleveland Bay Industrial Park in Townsville, North Queensland. The project is set to produce approximately 102 million litres of SAF and 11 million litres of renewable diesel per annum.

“The project will have 1,000 jobs at peak construction and for longer-term operations, about 100 direct operational jobs as well,” said Irvine.

Irvine said that the project’s progress wouldn’t be possible without $50 million of funding – from both private and public sector – that Jet Zero has raised to date. Of this $50 million, he said that around $35 million comes from within the private sector.

“The private investment comes from our three strategic partners – Airbus, Qantas, and Idemitsu Kosan of Japan – as well as five other institutional funds,” he said.

Aside from private sector investment, the Queensland State and Commonwealth Government have jointly committed almost $15 million. Irvine said this is the biggest amount ever awarded by the Government to advance a single SAF project.

“Project Ulysses’ FEED phase saw $9 million in funding from the Commonwealth Government via the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and $5 million from the Queensland

Government,” he said. “There was also about $760,000 from the Queensland Government for its feasibility phase.”

With the first SAF estimated to be produced in 2028, Irvine said that the company is looking to close the FEED phase of Ulysses by the end of the year and begin construction shortly after.

While Ulysses is the company’s primary focus, Jet Zero and global biofuels player Apeiron Bioenergy have partnered on Project Mandala. This project will focus on sourcing waste oils and non-edible feedstocks to manufacture SAF via the HEFA pathway. The Project is nearing completion of its feasibility phase.

“We received grant funding for Mandala from the Go-Green Co-Innovation Program, which is an initiative between Enterprise Singapore and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT),” said Irvine.

Maintaining capability to ensure future quality

Irvine insists that it’s Jet Zero’s capabilities across development, engineering, operations and financing that have led them to become Australia’s leading SAF project developer.

“Our team has a really strong, broad skill set that allows us to put all of the component parts of a project together efficiently and commercially,” he said.

On top of its current team of 12, Irvine said that Jet Zero also has external partners that are working for and supporting the company on its mission. This includes Technip Energies as design and engineering contractor and Long Energy and Resources as owner’s engineer.

An equally important aspect of capability within Jet Zero is how the company plans to ensure the quality control and assurance of its products. Both outputs of the company – SAF and renewable diesel – will be tested and certified to globally recognised standards.

“We refer to this as ‘farm to wing’ – in other words, from beginning to end,” said Irvine.

To ensure these standards and specifications are met, Jet Zero has an external third-party provider working with it on its life cycle assessment [LCA].

“These certification bodies want to make sure that the fuel is produced within a sustainable supply chain,” said Irvine. “We will support the sustainability of that supply chain as well as reduce carbon emissions across that life cycle to ensure that we have a sustainable and validated product.”

Overcoming past challenges to create success

Irvine said that challenges have presented themselves across each part of the process, as trying to develop a project in a new industry regardless of location is never going to be easy. He said that overcoming these challenges in the past, present and future isn’t a solo adventure, but instead a challenge taken on by industry.

“Our commercially driven nature has really enabled us to help us break through a lot of the barriers that other projects wouldn’t have.”

Taking this attitude into the future is key for Jet Zero, and key to the company’s near term goal of completing the FEED program on Project Ulysses and targeting Final Investment Decision [FID] by the end of this year. For Mandala, Irvine said that the near term goal is closing out the feasibility study within the next three months.

“Mandala is the second most progressed project in our portfolio and allows the business to diversify across technology and feedstocks,” said Irvine.

He also said the company has unannounced projects in the pipeline that will help Jet Zero achieve their eventual goal of having a portfolio of global projects.

“We are continuing to develop those projects through feasibility and the early scoping stage in the immediate term,” Irvine said. “Long term, the goal is to have a platform of projects that are operating and producing significant volumes of SAF globally.”",https://www.manmonthly.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/New-Header-image-copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 00:56:27.790421

The calculations, based on European Commission data, suggest that the subsidies could trigger a significant boost to airline demand for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), given the volume equates to about 15% of global SAF production.

Global SAF output last year totaled 1.3 billion liters, according to airline industry association IATA.

The EU has earmarked revenue from the sale of 20 million carbon emissions permits to help airlines to cover the price gap between conventional kerosene and more expensive SAF on flights within Europe.

Reuters calculations showed these subsidies would cover purchases of up to 216 million liters of e-fuels - synthetic fuels made using captured CO2 emissions - or as much as 2.6 billion litres of biofuels.

The EU subsidies cover up to 6 euros per litre for e-fuels and 0.5 euros per liter for biofuels.

Aviation is among the hardest sectors to decarbonize, with zero-emission aircraft not expected this decade.

Sustainable fuels, which have net-zero emissions or lower emissions than fossil fuel kerosene, can help to reduce air travel's carbon footprint in the near term. However, SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply.

Airlines have warned that EU targets to use more SAF are therefore impossible to meet, though a Boston Consulting Group report this year found that the sector is investing only 1%-3% of revenue or budget allocation in SAF.

The EU requires 2% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030.

Airlines must buy permits from the EU carbon market to cover their emissions from European flights. Until last year, the EU gave airlines most permits free of charge, but it is now phasing out free permits to drive faster emissions reductions.

With the interagency review process is complete, the EPA is expected to soon publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register and open a public comment period.
The OMB has also concluded its review of a final rulemaking to partially waive the 2024 cellulosic RVO.
The agency in December 2024 first proposed plans to issue the partial cellulosic waiver and extend the 2024 RFS compliance deadline.
The EPA in March took action on the deadline component of its proposal, issuing a final rule extending the 2024 RFS compliance deadline.","The White House Office of Management and Budget on June 11 concluded its review of two Renewable Fuel Standard rulemakings, including a proposed rule to set new renewable volume obligations (RVOs) and a final rule for a partial waiver of the 2024 cellulosic RVO. Both rulemakings had been under review by the OMB since May 14.

The proposed rule to set new RFS RVOs is formally titled “Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Program: Set 2.” While no details have been made public, a brief summery posted to the OMB website indicates the rulemaking is expected to include 2026 RVOs for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, biobased diesel and total renewable fuel. According to the OMB, the “action also contains several regulatory changes to the RFS program intended to improve the program’s implementation.”

The OMB interagency review process marks a final step before a proposed rulemaking is released for public comment. The OMB review process aims to ensure agency-proposed regulations align with White House priorities and offers an opportunity to various federal agencies to weigh in the proposal. Trade groups, industry representatives and other members of the public can request to meet with government officials to discuss the proposed regulatory actions during the review period. According to OMB records, representatives of the Advanced Biofuels Association, Kinder Morgan, Gevo Inc., OPAL Fuels, the Sustainable Advanced Biofuels Refiners Coalition, NATSO, the Renewable Natural Gas Coalition, Growth Energy, Clean Fuels Alliance America, the Renewable Fuels Association, Amp Americas, the American Biogas Council, American Petroleum Institute, Fuels America, and National Oilseed Processors Association are among those who met with OMB officials during the review process.

With the interagency review process is complete, the EPA is expected to soon publish the proposed rule in the Federal Register and open a public comment period.

The OMB has also concluded its review of a final rulemaking to partially waive the 2024 cellulosic RVO. At part of the review process, the agency met with representatives of the Small Refineries coalition and Wynnewood Refining Co., RFA, Amp Americas, NATSO and SIGMA, the RNG Coalition, Marathon Ashland Petroleum Co., and American Fuel and Petrochemicals Manufacturers.

The agency in December 2024 first proposed plans to issue the partial cellulosic waiver and extend the 2024 RFS compliance deadline. At that time, the EPA proposed to reduce the 2024 cellulosic RVO from 1.09 billion renewable identification numbers (RINs) to 880 million RINs.

The EPA in March took action on the deadline component of its proposal, issuing a final rule extending the 2024 RFS compliance deadline.

In total, Montana Renewables will not pay property taxes on $67.4 million worth of assets at the plant.
Initially, Montana Renewables attempted to qualify the entire biorefinery, valued at $562 million, as tax-exempt under the pollution control equipment benefit.
Montana Renewables appealed and maintained that the entire operation is “one emissions-reducing unit.” Following the settlement, Montana Renewables dropped its appeal.
The company is going through its second multi-year tax protest since 2017 and has three pending cases before the Montana Tax Appeal Board.","A state board has nearly tripled the amount of equipment eligible for a tax exemption at the Montana Renewables biorefinery in Great Falls and left the door open for additional exemptions in the future.

The company, a subsidiary of Calumet, reached a settlement with the Montana Tax Appeal Board in May. Montana Renewables had appealed a prior determination by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality that $24.5 million in assets qualified for a tax exemption as “pollution control equipment.”

The terms of the settlement, released through a public information request by Montana Free Press, show that an additional $42.9 million in equipment will be eligible for the tax exemption. In total, Montana Renewables will not pay property taxes on $67.4 million worth of assets at the plant.

The exemption is retroactive to December 2022. The settlement also stipulates that the exemption applies to current assets only and that “nothing in this settlement agreement shall prevent MRL [Montana Renewables] from seeking pollution control equipment certifications for new assets” in the future.

Initially, Montana Renewables attempted to qualify the entire biorefinery, valued at $562 million, as tax-exempt under the pollution control equipment benefit. The exemption is aimed at “portions” of equipment or machinery that prevent the creation of air or water pollutants, according to Montana law.

The exemption request applied to the future expansion of the biorefinery, which is estimated to be finished by late 2027.

The DEQ rejected the request for a full tax exemption and identified specific equipment that controls or reduces emissions at the plant. The agency determined that the eligible equipment amounted to $24,579,241. Montana Renewables appealed and maintained that the entire operation is “one emissions-reducing unit.” Following the settlement, Montana Renewables dropped its appeal.

Montana Renewables did not return a request for comment Thursday.

Calumet launched Montana Renewables in 2021 to operate within the footprint of the Great Falls oil refinery. The biorefinery uses agriculturally based raw materials like canola oil and soybean oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to Montana Renewables to fund an expansion that will more than double the plant’s output.

Sustainable aviation fuel produces less pollution than conventional jet fuel. However, some researchers have questioned the environmental benefits of fuels derived from agriculture, taking into account the land use and production impacts.

Projections submitted by Montana Renewables suggest that the fully expanded plant could emit more pollutants than the plant did as a dedicated crude oil refinery.

The Calumet crude oil refinery continues to operate, though it has scaled down production to make room for Montana Renewables. Total greenhouse gas emissions at the entire Great Falls site were 427,371 tons in 2023, the highest amount in EPA’s published data for the location since 2010.

It’s not yet clear exactly how much this will impact the company’s property tax liability. The Montana Department of Revenue must apply multiple tax benefits to the site. Those include a 50% tax break on a portion of the plant from the city of Great Falls and a 50% break on the entire plant from Cascade County, both of which apply to Montana Renewables. The company also applied for a 50% tax break through a state-level energy production benefit that’s still under review.

This latest settlement will be worked into those calculations. A spokesperson for the Department of Revenue didn’t return a question about how the exemption would be applied. The two companies are among the largest taxpayers in Cascade County.

Calumet, which is taxed separately for the crude oil refinery operation, is subject to an 80% tax break on $6.1 million in equipment. The company is going through its second multi-year tax protest since 2017 and has three pending cases before the Montana Tax Appeal Board. Hearings are currently scheduled for 2026.",https://montanafreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCF3189_2.jpg,N,,2025-06-12 21:00:14.801644

They hope it could boost domestic manufacturing and fuel security in the process. Landline's Kat Sullivan reports.

Kath Sullivan: A truckload of canola is being unloaded at GrainCorp's northern Victorian factory. This crush plant receives about half a million tonnes of canola a year, extracting oil for use in food manufacturing or all sorts of household staples, from margarines to chips and chocolate. The canola meal is to feed livestock.

Don Campbell: We're going to take that technology and that skill and replicate it somewhere else.

Kath Sullivan: GrainCorp's Don Campbell has even bigger ambitions.

Don Campbell: We're looking at the regions where canola is consistently the largest grown, so that is both Western Australia and Eastern Australia.

Kath Sullivan: The publicly listed business is working with industry superfund IFM Investors and Australian fuel company Ampol on a plan that would see canola oil used at Ampol's Brisbane refinery to make sustainable aviation fuel, a low carbon alternative to fossil fuel. If the feasibility study stacks up, Ampol's Brent Merrick says it will take a multi-billion dollar investment.

Brent Merrick: Our plan is to aim for the 2030 time range for production. It's not something that comes across your desk every day, like the chance to make such a material change in how the energy mix drives the country. It is a big deal, it is exciting.

Kath Sullivan: CSIRO's Senior Research Scientist Cathryn O'Sullivan explains how that could work.

Cathryn O'Sullivan: For oils like canola, there's a process called heifer, and that basically takes that oil that you get from the grain, you extract from the grain, and turns that into a chemical equivalent of diesel called renewable diesel, and then you can on-process that to make an equivalent of aviation fuel, jet fuel.

Kath Sullivan: She says technically it can be used to replace 100% of fossil fuels, but right now airlines are blending it.

Cathryn O'Sullivan: The major roadblocks at the moment are economic.

Kath Sullivan: Support could include mandates for airlines to use certain quantities of sustainable fuel, subsidise start-up costs for manufacturing, and help to ensure that the end product meets global emissions reduction certification. The Federal Government's committed more than $30 million to support the development of a sustainable aviation fuel industry using renewable feedstocks. More recently, it announced $250 million from its Future Made in Australia Fund as grants to accelerate a domestic low-carbon liquid fuel sector. Zach Whale does advocacy for the group Grain Growers.

Zach Whale: Here's an opportunity to actually add some value here. We get economic benefit and regional jobs as a result.

They hope it could boost domestic manufacturing and fuel security in the process. Landline's Kat Sullivan reports.

Kath Sullivan: A truckload of canola is being unloaded at GrainCorp's northern Victorian factory. This crush plant receives about half a million tonnes of canola a year, extracting oil for use in food manufacturing or all sorts of household staples, from margarines to chips and chocolate. The canola meal is to feed livestock.

Don Campbell: We're going to take that technology and that skill and replicate it somewhere else.

Kath Sullivan: GrainCorp's Don Campbell has even bigger ambitions.

Don Campbell: We're looking at the regions where canola is consistently the largest grown, so that is both Western Australia and Eastern Australia.

Kath Sullivan: The publicly listed business is working with industry superfund IFM Investors and Australian fuel company Ampol on a plan that would see canola oil used at Ampol's Brisbane refinery to make sustainable aviation fuel, a low carbon alternative to fossil fuel. If the feasibility study stacks up, Ampol's Brent Merrick says it will take a multi-billion dollar investment.

Brent Merrick: Our plan is to aim for the 2030 time range for production. It's not something that comes across your desk every day, like the chance to make such a material change in how the energy mix drives the country. It is a big deal, it is exciting.

Kath Sullivan: CSIRO's Senior Research Scientist Cathryn O'Sullivan explains how that could work.

Cathryn O'Sullivan: For oils like canola, there's a process called heifer, and that basically takes that oil that you get from the grain, you extract from the grain, and turns that into a chemical equivalent of diesel called renewable diesel, and then you can on-process that to make an equivalent of aviation fuel, jet fuel.

Kath Sullivan: She says technically it can be used to replace 100% of fossil fuels, but right now airlines are blending it.

Cathryn O'Sullivan: The major roadblocks at the moment are economic.

Kath Sullivan: Support could include mandates for airlines to use certain quantities of sustainable fuel, subsidise start-up costs for manufacturing, and help to ensure that the end product meets global emissions reduction certification. The Federal Government's committed more than $30 million to support the development of a sustainable aviation fuel industry using renewable feedstocks. More recently, it announced $250 million from its Future Made in Australia Fund as grants to accelerate a domestic low-carbon liquid fuel sector. Zach Whale does advocacy for the group Grain Growers.

Zach Whale: Here's an opportunity to actually add some value here. We get economic benefit and regional jobs as a result. We also get greater fuel security and we get some market diversification for our farmers.

Grassley also talked about the importance of extending the 2017 Trump Tax Cuts for the middle-class and strengthening the pro-growth reforms that incentivize business investment.

Video and excerpts from Grassley’s questions follow.

VIDEO

On Trade Certainty:

“I’ve made clear that I support President Trump’s goals of getting better trade deals for U.S. producers. I’ve heard from many industries and businesses in Iowa. Each one of them [is] in a very unique position due to the tariffs, but all express one common concern – and that’s the need for certainty around trade.

“I’ve spoken with several Trump administration officials and nominees about the importance of finalizing two or three deals to provide some certainty around trade. So, would you agree that trade deals need some certainty and that at the same time, provide fair market access for U.S. goods would benefit the economy and provide much needed markets?”

On 45Z Regulations and Farmers:

“The Senate Finance Committee has been working on what will soon be the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit. Implementing this credit properly is important for the biofuels industry and especially for farmers.

“The Biden administration failed to meaningfully address 45Z regulations. They put some out for comment, but not much beyond that. But the regulations it released for the 40B Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credit demonstrated that Treasury officials in that administration knew nothing about farming.

“Prior to issuing rules governing 45Z, we need everyone in the Trump administration to take some time to learn a thing or two about how farming works. So, this is kind of a question of working ahead, looking after the president signs this bill, and regulations are going to be written on 45Z. Would you be willing to work with congressional colleagues, farmer-led organizations and even this senator to make sure that we get regulations under 45Z that work for farmers?”

Extending 2017 Trump Tax Cuts:

“The 2017 tax law provided tax relief across all incomes with a focus on the middle-class. Just as important, the law included pro-growth reforms to incentivize business investment, boosting production and leading to higher wages.

“A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found the 2017 law boosted investment 20 percent.

Is your airline providing or considering using CO2 Connect to provide visibility of the carbon footprint to your flying passengers or corporate clients?
“Yes, we plan to soon integrate CO2 Connect across all our customer segments—flying passengers, corporate clients, and cargo—to enhance environmental transparency.","To meet the aviation industry’s ambitious goal of net-zero CO2 by 2050, airlines are investing in decarbonization measures such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), more efficient aircraft and operational efficiencies. But you cannot manage what you don’t measure. Therefore, a vital consideration is the transparent and accurate provision of CO2 emissions data from flights, for both passengers and cargo.

In 2022, IATA launched CO2 Connect, a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization, driven by global standard methodologies and high-quality data. With the contribution of more than 70 airlines today, the tool has been established as the benchmark for measuring aviation emissions globally.

French airlines are among the key players leading the way. We spoke to three airlines—Corsair, Air Corsica and ASL Airlines France—that have recently joined the CO2 Connect program to understand how the tool is helping them.

The EU, including France, has implementednumerous regulations to reduce CO2 emissions from air transport. What does it mean for your airline?

Marie Antoinette Santoni, VP Network, ESG and Communications at Air Corsica notes that the airline industry’s commitment to net-zero, together with regulations introduced by the EU, requires the airline to rethink its operations to reduce its carbon footprint. “This means investing in a newer fleet of aircraft—with 85% of the fleet renewed, we have seen a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions—cleaner technologies and optimizing our routes to consume less fuel and reduce our CO2 emissions.”

“For the moment, it means additional costs, charges and taxes. SAF, which is a solution, is not available in the market and is too expensive. And the ReFuelEU anti-tankering provisions are unfairly onerous and costly to airlines serving smaller regional airports across Europe,” says Captain Nicolas Redier, Flight Ops Director at ASL Airlines France.

“The growing body of European regulations reflects a strong commitment to transformation, but their implementation poses significant operational and economic challenges for our sector,” says Cyrille Digon, Director of Flight Support and CSR at Corsair.

But overall, the airlines are firmly committed to reducing their environmental impact and complying with the regulations, says Santoni.

How important is the data from CO2 Connect in providing an accurate, credible picture of CO2 emission reductions across the aviation industry?

“CO2 Connect, using the IATA methodology, provides standardized, verifiable, and comparable data. Contributing our data is part of our commitment to reducing the overall emissions from aviation,” says Digon.

Captain Redier from ASL Airlines France, highlights that CO2 emission reduction is a commitment for the whole aviation industry. “CO2 Connect is a common tool for a common target. Working together in the same direction makes our efforts more efficient and accurate.”

“The data provided by CO2 Connect, in accordance with the IATA methodology, is essential for establishing an accurate and credible picture of our emissions reduction efforts. It not only allows us to track our progress, but also enables us to communicate transparently with our customers and partners about our environmental impact,” says Air Corsica’s Santoni.

Is your airline providing or considering using CO2 Connect to provide visibility of the carbon footprint to your flying passengers or corporate clients?

“Yes, we plan to soon integrate CO2 Connect across all our customer segments—flying passengers, corporate clients, and cargo—to enhance environmental transparency. Our intention is to make it available directly on our website, allowing customers to easily access and monitor their carbon footprint,” says Digon.

Santoni notes that Air Corsica recognizes the importance of transparency regarding its carbon footprint. “We are currently considering integrating CO2 Connect into our services to provide our passengers and business customers with clear visibility into the emissions associated with their travel. This could help them make more informed decisions when choosing more sustainable flight options.”

How important is the ability for CO2 Connect to account for SAF in the emissions calculations?

“It is a key driver,” says Digon, “Alongside fleet modernization, to achieve net-zero objectives. The increasing use of SAF, and soon e-SAF, must be properly reflected and valued in emissions accounting methodologies.”

“SAF represents a tangible solution for reducing CO2 emissions from aviation. The inclusion of SAF in CO2 Connect emissions calculations is crucial to achieving our net-zero targets. We are closely monitoring technological developments and hope that the production of these new fuels will enable us to increasingly integrate them into our consumption,” says Santoni at Air Corsica.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/5a66352875d14648ace7630457924ba7/gettyimages-1331820787-1200x800-6a45073.jpeg,N,,2025-06-12 21:01:19.211270

Today, all Airbus aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and conventional fuel. By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF. Our next-generation single aisle aircraft is being designed with SAF compatibility in mind.

SAF is one of the key ways that the aviation industry can reduce emissions, and could contribute more than 50% of the aviation industry’s carbon dioxide emissions reduction according to ATAG’s “Scenario 3”. However, encouraging airlines and operators to switch from fossil-based fuels like kerosene is a challenge. SAF is currently several times more expensive than traditional aircraft fuel, and it is less readily available.

Airbus agrees that SAF will be an important way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and is positioning itself as a catalyst in the ecosystem to promote SAF production and uptake by deploying SAF in its own operations, by forming cross-industry partnerships, and by making strategic investments.

What is SAF?

Airbus believes that scaling the SAF ecosystem isn’t possible without collaboration from different partners including airlines and operators. For this reason, Airbus has partnered with several airlines to trial the use of SAF in their operations.

Two pilot schemes launched in 2024 were:

Airbus partnered with easyJet to launch a pilot scheme on the Toulouse-Bristol route. Airbus financed 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the three month trial period. The trial aimed to act as a proof of concept, demonstrating how airlines and corporate organisations can share the cost of SAF in a mutually beneficial way, ultimately creating additional supply and demand for SAF.

Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise to WizzAir during a SAF operational trial where WizzAir operated more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel.

During the WizzAir trial, a passenger survey was also launched, emphasising the importance of understanding how travellers feel about low-carbon aviation, and whether they would be willing to pay extra to reduce the emissions on their flights.

In terms of partnerships that support the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus has a long-standing relationship with TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Since 2024, TotalEnergies supply enough SAF to meet more than half Airbus’ needs in Europe, and the two companies also have a shared research programme that is working on the transition to 100% SAF capability.

In recent years, Airbus has also signed MOUs with Neste – to jointly advance the production and uptake of SAF – and with OMV – to explore joint solutions that broaden access to SAF for various customer groups, stimulating new demand and supporting investments in new SAF production facilities.

In 2024, Airbus made two investments:

Airbus invested in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund (SAFFA). SAFFA makes investments that support the production of SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification.

Airbus invested in SAF producer and technology company LanzaJet. LanzaJet will use the investment to scale their SAF production which uses the Alcohol-to-Jet pathway.

In 2022 and 2023, Airbus made a number of investments alongside Qantas. In 2022, Airbus and Qantas agreed to invest up to $200 million to develop the SAF industry in Australia. In 2023, Airbus and Qantas, alongside the Queensland Government, invested in a Queensland biofuel facility being developed by Jet Zero Australia in partnership with LanzaJet. These investments seek to address the availability of SAF in Australia, improving accessibility to SAF for airlines and operators who want to use it.

To further address the challenge of accessibility, Airbus has launched a “Book and Claim” demonstrator. This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. This system will improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those located far from supply points or production facilities.

As a facilitator, Airbus purchases SAF certificates and manages the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/72590.pdf FAQ What are Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)?","Latest Developments in Sustainable Aviation Fuels

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, and Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are being touted as a key solution. SAFs are fuels that are made from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste, or algae, and can be used to power aircraft. In recent years, there have been significant developments in the production and certification of SAFs, which are bringing the industry closer to a more sustainable future.

New Feedstocks and Conversion Technologies

One of the key challenges in the production of SAFs is the availability of suitable feedstocks. Traditional feedstocks, such as corn and sugarcane, have been criticized for their impact on food prices and land use. As a result, researchers have been exploring new feedstocks, such as agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae. These feedstocks offer a number of advantages, including lower costs and reduced environmental impacts. For example, a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that agricultural waste could be used to produce up to 4.8 billion gallons of SAF per year in the United States alone 1. Similarly, a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that forestry residues could be used to produce up to 10% of the world's SAF needs by 2030 2. In addition to new feedstocks, researchers have also been developing new conversion technologies that can be used to produce SAFs. These technologies include advanced fermentation, gasification, and hydroprocessing. For example, a company called LanzaJet is developing a technology that uses fermentation to convert biomass into a jet fuel that is compatible with existing aircraft engines 3.

Advances in SAF Production and Certification

In recent years, there have been significant advances in the production and certification of SAFs. A number of companies, including Neste, Boeing, and Shell, have developed commercial-scale SAF production facilities. For example, Neste's Singapore refinery is capable of producing up to 1 million tons of SAF per year 4. The certification of SAFs is also becoming more streamlined. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has developed a number of standards for SAFs, including ASTM D7566, which covers the specification for aviation turbine fuel containing synthesized hydrocarbons 5. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has also developed guidelines for the use of SAFs, including a CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) methodology for calculating the emissions reductions from SAFs 6.

Industry Partnerships and Collaborations

The development and deployment of SAFs is a complex task that requires collaboration across the aviation industry. A number of partnerships and collaborations have been formed to support the development of SAFs, including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, which is a coalition of airlines, airports, and other industry stakeholders that are working together to promote the use of SAFs 7. Other examples of industry partnerships include the collaboration between Boeing and Neste to develop a commercial-scale SAF production facility in Finland 8, and the partnership between Shell and SkyNRG to develop a SAF supply chain in Europe 9.

Commercializing Sustainable Aviation Fuels

While there have been significant advances in the production and certification of SAFs, there are still a number of challenges that need to be overcome before they can be widely adopted. One of the key challenges is the cost of production, which is currently higher than traditional fossil fuels. However, a number of companies are working to reduce the cost of SAF production through economies of scale and improvements in efficiency.

Progress Towards Commercial-Scale Production

A number of companies are making progress towards commercial-scale SAF production. For example, Neste is planning to expand its SAF production capacity to 1.5 million tons per year by 2023 10. Similarly, LanzaTech is developing a commercial-scale SAF production facility in the United States that is expected to produce up to 100 million gallons of SAF per year 11.

Challenges and Opportunities for Industry Stakeholders

The commercialization of SAFs presents a number of challenges and opportunities for industry stakeholders. One of the key challenges is the need for significant investment in infrastructure, including production facilities, storage tanks, and distribution networks. However, this also presents an opportunity for companies to develop new business models and revenue streams. For example, a report by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that the adoption of SAFs could create up to 22,000 new jobs in the United States by 2035 12. Similarly, a study by the European Commission found that the adoption of SAFs could generate up to €4.3 billion in economic benefits for the European Union by 2030 13.

Role of Policy and Regulation in Supporting SAF Adoption

Policy and regulation will play a critical role in supporting the adoption of SAFs. Governments can provide incentives, such as tax credits or subsidies, to support the development and deployment of SAFs. For example, the United States has a tax credit of up to $1.50 per gallon for SAFs that meet certain criteria 14. Regulators can also play a role in supporting the adoption of SAFs by developing standards and guidelines for their use. For example, the European Union has developed a number of regulations and guidelines for the use of SAFs, including a requirement that all aviation fuels sold in the EU contain at least 2% SAF by 2030 15.

The Road to a Sustainable Aviation Future

The adoption of SAFs has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAFs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by up to 80% by 2050 16.

Potential Emissions Reductions from SAF Adoption

The potential emissions reductions from SAF adoption are significant. According to a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the use of SAFs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by up to 75% by 2050 17.

Industry Targets and Timelines for SAF Deployment

The aviation industry has set a number of targets and timelines for SAF deployment. For example, IATA has set a target of 2% SAF adoption by 2025, and 32% by 2035 18. Similarly, the European Union has set a target of at least 32% of aviation fuels being SAF by 2035 19.

Opportunities for Innovation and Growth in the SAF Sector

The adoption of SAFs presents a number of opportunities for innovation and growth in the SAF sector. For example, companies are developing new technologies and business models to support the production and deployment of SAFs. According to a report by the International Energy Agency, the global SAF market could be worth up to $150 billion by 2050 20. The development of new feedstocks and conversion technologies is also expected to drive innovation and growth in the SAF sector. For example, the use of algae as a feedstock for SAF production is expected to become increasingly important in the coming years 21.

\text{Emissions reductions} = \frac{\text{SAF adoption rate} \times \text{emissions reduction per gallon}}{\text{total aviation fuel consumption}}

Conclusion

The future of bioenergy in aviation is looking increasingly promising, with significant advances being made in the production and certification of SAFs. While there are still challenges to be overcome, the potential emissions reductions from SAF adoption are significant, and the industry is working towards a more sustainable future.
