As Saudi Arabia ascends the global aviation ladder, its air travel ambitions are no longer grounded by regional limitations. Instead, the Kingdom is strategically investing in its Total Air Market (TAM), which is forecasted by VIDEC to reach a staggering USD 11.3 billion by 2028 — growing at a robust CAGR of 12.2%. The Kingdom’s airspace, once primarily serving domestic passengers and pilgrimage traffic, is now being reimagined as a global crossroads, with state-owned SAUDIA leading an aggressive international expansion and newcomer Riyadh Air targeting global dominance by linking Saudi Arabia to over 100 cities by the end of the decade.

This shift is not merely a national milestone; it’s a geopolitical repositioning of air routes, economic influence, and tourism strategy. It is a core pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, aimed at reducing reliance on oil and diversifying into high-growth sectors like travel and tourism. With the international air travel market projected to grow even faster—at a CAGR of 14.1%—Saudi Arabia is positioning itself to capitalize on, and even help drive, this global aviation surge.

The TAM Surge: A USD 11.3 Billion Opportunity

According to VIDEC, Saudi Arabia’s Total Air Market (TAM) growth trajectory is among the highest in the Middle East. From 2024 to 2028, the TAM is expected to more than double in value, reaching USD 11.3 billion. This rise is underpinned by increased passenger volumes, expanded international flight networks, and heavy state investment in aviation infrastructure, including the construction of new airports and the transformation of existing hubs like Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport and Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport.

The TAM encompasses all commercial aviation activities including international and domestic travel, business aviation, and cargo services. The surge is driven not only by demand but by structural changes—policy liberalization, visa facilitation, new carriers, and technology upgrades. This holistic modernization of air infrastructure and policy is unlocking both inbound and outbound traffic.

SAUDIA’s Global Push: A Legacy Carrier Reimagined

Saudi Arabia’s national carrier, SAUDIA, is no longer just a symbol of domestic pride but an evolving global brand. Once seen largely as a pilgrimage and regional connector, SAUDIA is now venturing deep into Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. Its recent moves—launching direct flights to cities like Barcelona, Zurich, Seoul, and Chicago—reflect a strategy not just to increase frequency, but to reposition the airline as a global competitor.

Part of this transformation includes modernizing its fleet with Boeing 787 Dreamliners and Airbus A321XLRs, introducing in-flight entertainment upgrades, and enhancing passenger experience through AI-driven personalization and onboard services.

Additionally, SAUDIA’s alignment with the Kingdom’s broader economic goals—such as doubling tourism numbers to 70 million international visitors by 2030—creates a multiplier effect. Each new route opens a corridor for trade, investment, and cultural exchange, boosting the Kingdom’s economic profile far beyond aviation alone.

Enter Riyadh Air: The Future Flag-Bearer of Global Connectivity

Launched in 2023 and backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is Saudi Arabia’s bold bet on the future of global aviation. Targeting a launch fleet of Boeing 787s, the airline has already made global headlines for its ambition to connect the Kingdom to over 100 cities by 2030. Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a premium full-service airline, appealing to both leisure and business travelers.

Riyadh Air’s entry is disruptive in all the right ways. It introduces competition that will not only elevate service standards but also redefine pricing, route planning, and strategic partnerships within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) aviation ecosystem. Analysts predict that Riyadh Air’s impact will mirror that of Emirates in Dubai or Qatar Airways in Doha—but tailored to Saudi’s unique geopolitical positioning and tourism transformation.

The carrier also plans to integrate seamlessly with Neom, the futuristic megacity under development in northwest Saudi Arabia, thereby channeling passenger traffic directly into a visionary economic and tourism zone.

International Travel Surge: Growing at 14.1% CAGR

While the overall TAM is forecasted to grow at 12.2%, international air travel from and to Saudi Arabia is expected to outpace it at a CAGR of 14.1%. This growth is fueled by several key factors:

Tourism Reforms: Introduction of eVisas and visa-on-arrival for over 60 countries.

Religious Tourism Boom: Continued rise in Umrah and Hajj visitors, targeted to reach 30 million annually by 2030.

Business and MICE Events: Saudi’s increasing role as a host for global summits, expos, and tech events.

Outbound Tourism: Growing appetite among Saudis for global travel, supported by rising disposable income.

Saudi Arabia is now firmly in the league of nations whose outbound and inbound travel flows carry geopolitical and economic weight.

Aviation Infrastructure at Warp Speed

Supporting this explosive growth is an equally ambitious investment in aviation infrastructure. Riyadh is planning a new mega airport—King Salman International Airport—with six parallel runways and the capacity to serve 120 million travelers annually by 2030. Meanwhile, upgrades at Jeddah, Dammam, and Madinah are enhancing capacity and efficiency, while secondary airports are being developed to support tourism in AlUla, Abha, and the Red Sea coast.

The Kingdom’s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) is also rolling out new air traffic management systems, safety protocols, and digital check-in services—all part of its smart aviation vision.

Regional Implications: Competition and Cooperation

Saudi Arabia’s aviation renaissance will impact neighboring aviation hubs like Dubai, Doha, and Abu Dhabi. While some industry observers foresee intensified competition for transfer traffic, others argue that the Kingdom’s rise will expand the pie rather than steal slices. If coordinated well, Gulf aviation could evolve into a more interlinked system of mega-hubs, each with niche positioning—luxury, pilgrimage, MICE, or business.

Regional low-cost carriers such as flynas and Flyadeal are also scaling rapidly to meet domestic and regional demand, ensuring that price-sensitive travelers are not left behind in this transformation.

Challenges on the Radar

Despite the bullish outlook, the journey is not without turbulence. Riyadh Air’s aggressive expansion will test air traffic control systems, pilot availability, and slot management. Geopolitical volatility in the Middle East could pose security concerns. Additionally, sustainability remains a pressing issue as Saudi Arabia faces pressure to align its aviation growth with environmental commitments.

To this end, both SAUDIA and Riyadh Air have pledged investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon-neutral operations. The Kingdom is also exploring partnerships with global green aviation innovators.

The Broader Economic Context: Aviation as a GDP Driver

Aviation is poised to become a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s non-oil economy. Already, the industry supports over 500,000 jobs directly and indirectly. With increased route density, cargo handling, maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) activities, and airport services, this number is expected to rise significantly.

Tourism, linked inextricably with air travel, is projected to contribute 10% of GDP by 2030. This includes leisure, pilgrimage, cultural, heritage, medical, and business travel.

Conclusion: A Skyward Ascent

Saudi Arabia is not merely growing its air travel sector—it is redefining it. From a TAM of USD 11.3 billion to a network of over 100 global cities, the Kingdom’s aviation strategy is part of a larger national reawakening. With SAUDIA transforming into a modern global airline and Riyadh Air preparing to revolutionize the skies, Saudi Arabia is making an audacious yet calculated bet: that the world will fly through its skies and land on its soil.

Kenya Airways does not engage in creative accounting.
Second, Kenya Airways books are subjected to both internal and external audits from internationally reputable firms like PWC.
874 billion are subtracted from the airline’s Total Income at Ksh 188.485 billion, an Operating Profit of Ksh 16.621 billion results, proving that the business is viable.
KQ is paying back the government with interest and in Kenya shillings in a process called a novation.","Kenya Airways recently announced its 2024 full year results. It made a net profit of Ksh 5.4 billion. Because this is the first profit after more than a decade of loss-making, it has elicited a lot of online chatter. Whilst most are extremely ecstatic about these good tidings, others have cast aspersions on the figures. These are the facts as they obtained in the investor briefing.

1. The profit is real. Kenya Airways does not engage in creative accounting.

First, because it is illegal. Second, Kenya Airways books are subjected to both internal and external audits from internationally reputable firms like PWC. Moreover, KQ’s accounts are publicly available for scrutiny on its website. KQ also keeps its books in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. A deficit of accounting knowledge perhaps creates any misimpression to the effect that it has cooked its books.

2. KQ’s great results did not happen overnight.

They are the result of several years of restructuring, which culminated in Operation Kifaru, which started in 2020 and is now in its second phase.

3. Operation Kifaru was essentially a “stop digging the hole” process.

This entailed an imbuing of operational efficiencies through route rationalization (cutting back on low traffic routes to concentrate on lucrative ones). It also focused on other aspects of cost optimization even as it grew passenger and cargo numbers evinced by a Cabin Factor of 75.2% and 71 thousand tonnes of cargo uplifted, which is a 25% increase over the previous year.

4. It is true that KQ benefitted from a favourable forex exchange regime.

This contributed to an increase of Ksh 1.2 billion to the airline’s coffers. But even without that benefit, KQ would still have made a profit of Ksh 4.2 billion. Still, when Total Operating Costs of Ksh 171. 874 billion are subtracted from the airline’s Total Income at Ksh 188.485 billion, an Operating Profit of Ksh 16.621 billion results, proving that the business is viable.

5. Going forward, KQ has been cushioned from foreign exchange fluctuations through actions of the Government of Kenya.

The government has taken up a portion of KQ’s dollar loans guaranteed by it and is now settling them. KQ is paying back the government with interest and in Kenya shillings in a process called a novation. This will help to make KQ’s progress sustainable.

Responsibilities and obligations of airline passengers

6. Apart from the flying business, KQ also has other income streams.

It does Maintenance, Repairs and Overhauls for not only its fleet but also for aircraft for other airlines and jurisdictions. Recently, KQ received certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency allowing it to service planes that originate from the European Union.

7. Following the success of Operation Kifaru 1, Phase 2 of the same is ongoing.

It entails paying down KQ’s legacy debt incurred in the turbulent period of the ill-fated Project Mawingu and recapitalizing the business to acquire new planes even as new routes are added. The airline intends to increase its fleet to over 50 planes in the next few years.

8. KQ as anchor tenant of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, must grow in tandem with Kenya’s premier airport.

The government has indicated that it is looking for a strategic investor for both airline and airport. This is in keeping with best practice globally where major airlines are synonymous with their hubs. For instance, Emirates Airlines immediately evokes images of Dubai and BA, Heathrow Airport in London.

9. KQ has an environmental sustainability programme where recycled plastic is used to manufacture pyro-diesel.

This diesel is used to power the airline’s ground-handling equipment. KQ was also the first African airline to fly a long-haul commercial flight from Africa to Europe using Sustainable Aviation Fuel. With these initiatives, the airline is future-proofing itself.

10. Africa has 17 percent of the world’s commercial airlines yet it commands less than 3 percent of global air traffic.

In other words, the continent has more airlines than is necessary. The future lies in consolidating these numerous airlines to a few dominant airline groups. To that end, KQ is in talks with South African Airlines to form one pan African airline group. It is hoped that others will soon join in so that economies of scale benefits can be enjoyed. This will lead to greater efficiencies, wider reach and more competitive fares for citizens of the continent. The future is bright and KQ is right in the middle of it!",https://biznakenya.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/468782247_10161181601624121_5120546733599496377_n-2.jpg,N,,2025-04-20 11:56:28.779524

This firm commitment was made at the exclusive discourse event organised by Lufthansa Airlines at the Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos.

During the discourse, it was emphasised that Airlines, Airports, Aircraft Manufacturers, and Regulators must all play their roles to promote eco-friendly practices by lowering carbon emissions, improving fuel efficiency, developing alternative energy sources, and enhancing operational efficiency for the sustainability of the aviation industry.

Director of Air Transport Regulations, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Mrs Olayinka Babaoye-Iriobe, represented by Mrs Evelyn Tanko, Deputy General Manager, (Commercial Agreement & Aviation Environment), stated that the Authority is empowered by the Civil Aviation Act, 2022 to regulate environmental issues and further to reiterate its commitments to the sustainability of the industry.

NCAA has domesticated ICAO Annex 16 on Environmental Protection into the National regulations under Part 16 of Nig. CARS, which covers requirements for monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 Emissions for international aviation, and Part 5 addresses aircraft noise and emission certification.

The Director highlighted some of the NCAA’s initiatives regarding the industry’s sustainability, including the development of a State Action Plan on reducing CO2 Emissions from international aviation. Nigeria voluntarily joined the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) during its pilot phase in 2018 and has continued to ensure the timely submission of CO2 emission data from airlines under CORSIA. The NCAA is also leading a Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Roadmap for the development and deployment of SAF in Nigeria.

She added that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is rolling out Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) at major airports ultimately to reduce their carbon emissions and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA) has implemented Free Route Airspace (FRA) and Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) all efforts for the reduction of carbon footprints and towards the sustainability of the industry.

Key challenges in implementing and scaling sustainability policies within the aviation sector were identified, including a fragmented policy environment, limited data and monitoring systems, financing constraints, regulatory and institutional capacity, awareness, and industry readiness.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely considered the most viable alternative to conventional jet fuel, offering potential emissions reductions of up to 68%. However, despite its promise, SAF adoption remains below 0.1% of total aviation fuel use in 2024, largely due to high costs, supply chain constraints, and policy uncertainty.

SAF as a decarbonisation pathway

SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure. This makes it an attractive option for immediate carbon reductions. However, current production methods face limitations due to feedstock availability.

Lead author Yuchao Xu from UniSA Aviation joined C-EDGE researchers Professor Shane Zhang and Dr Xin Deng and international researchers from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Tongji University to analyse the academic literature.

As a result, five key themes were identified that influence SAF's role in aviation decarbonisation:

Sustainable certification of pathways and feedstocks – SAF production relies on certified pathways and sustainable feedstocks to ensure environmental integrity. However, ensuring sustainable sourcing is critical with the rising global demand for biomass. While HEFA from waste oils is currently the most mature technology, its scalability is limited. Future research must explore novel feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass, industrial waste gases, and algae-based oils.

Economic simulation of alternative solutions – While SAF is the most promising near-term solution, alternative decarbonisation strategies such as improved aircraft efficiency, route optimisation, and demand management (e.g., carbon pricing and voluntary flight reductions) could complement SAF adoption. Economic simulations suggest that without SAF, airlines may need to reduce flight distances by up to 27% or increase fares by 48% to meet climate goals, which would have negative economic impacts on tourism and global connectivity.

Economic feasibility and market challenges – SAF is 3.5 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, with prices averaging USD 2,500 per tonne compared to USD 690 per tonne for fossil-based alternatives. The high production cost, coupled with limited government incentives and inconsistent policy frameworks, makes SAF financially unattractive for airlines. Cost reductions will require investment in larger production facilities, improved logistics, and policy-driven financial mechanisms.

Supply chain dynamics and stakeholder involvement – The SAF supply chain involves feedstock suppliers, refineries, airlines, airports, and regulators. Ensuring a stable and cost-effective supply will require coordinated efforts across multiple stakeholders. The research underscores the importance of international collaboration to prevent market fragmentation and ensure equitable SAF availability across different regions.

Policy interventions and market incentives – Governments are crucial in breaking the deadlock between airlines, fuel producers, and infrastructure providers. The European Union, Japan, and Singapore have introduced SAF mandates, requiring airlines to increase SAF percentages over the next three decades. However, researchers warn that poorly designed mandates could create market distortions, favouring certain fuel types and limiting innovation. Instead, a mix of carbon pricing, subsidies, and research incentives may be more effective in scaling SAF production.

The need for global collaboration

The aviation industry cannot drive SAF adoption alone; it requires coordinated global action. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) are critical in setting international standards and ensuring compliance. However, current policies remain fragmented, with different countries adopting varying regulatory approaches.

One of the most significant challenges is the economic competitiveness of SAF. Without financial incentives such as tax credits, production grants, or subsidies, airlines are unlikely to switch to SAF at scale voluntarily. Researchers propose that carbon pricing mechanisms, such as emissions trading schemes (ETS), may be more effective than blending mandates, as they provide flexibility while incentivising cost-effective emissions reductions.

Future research directions

The research identifies additional research opportunities to accelerate SAF adoption:

Regulatory concerns remain a significant topic.

Understanding decarbonisation scenarios without SAF in place across different jurisdictions.

Engineering economic analyses are needed to understand cost-benefit scenarios.

The dynamics between various stakeholders, such as farmers, logistics agencies, and regulatory bodies, remain underexplored.

Investigating existing treaties and agreements between jurisdictions is essential for understanding their real impacts and understanding opportunities for international collaboration.

Understanding to what extent passengers can influence airlines’ adoptions of SAF is critical.

Greater attention to be paid to grey literature, including technical certification, sustainability certification, technological analysis, prediction, and policy considerations.

In summary

The aviation sector is at a critical juncture, with SAF playing a pivotal role in its decarbonisation efforts. While technological advancements and policy interventions are helping to scale SAF production, high costs and supply chain challenges remain significant barriers. This review of the current literature underscores the need for coordinated global action, market-based incentives, and continued innovation in feedstocks and production methods.

Non-CO₂ warming effects could be as significant as CO₂ in aviation’s total climate impact.

However, non-CO₂ emissions aren’t yet regulated in the same way. Scientists and industry leaders including Airbus are studying ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions.

What are contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions, and why do they matter?

Burning jet fuel always creates both carbon dioxide (CO₂) and non-CO₂ emissions. In certain conditions, water vapour and some non-CO₂ emissions such as soot or other particulate matters combine to form condensation trails. Commonly known as contrails, these are the white streaks visible behind aircraft at altitude.

On average, contrails heat the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. However, some contrails can have a cooling effect, depending on when and where they form and how long they last. It’s thought that a relatively small number of flights create the majority of warming contrails.

The overall climate impact of non-CO₂ emissions is complex and hard to measure.

Scientists are still working to fully understand their long-term effects.

What is the aviation industry doing about contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions?

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions. They are using different fuel types (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, hydrogen), propulsion technologies and operational mitigation.

The latter involves modifying flight paths in real time to avoid areas where warming contrails are most likely to form.

Airbus is working with scientists, policymakers and the wider aviation industry on some 20 projects linked to these mitigation concepts.

Some are funded externally while others are funded internally or with specific partners willing to share the cost of the project with Airbus.

Promising technologies including humidity sensors could help aircraft to avoid weather conditions favourable to contrail formation.

Nonetheless, the projects and collaborations led by Airbus and its partners are helping to accelerate the development of mitigation strategies for non-CO2 emissions and subsequent integration into flight operations.",https://www.leaderlive.co.uk/resources/images/19333980.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-04-20 01:56:40.530518
,,2025-04-20 05:15:40+00:00,The Sydney Morning Herald,"Faster, higher, sleeker: How Boom Supersonic wants to reinvent flight - The Sydney Morning Herald","Chris Zappone, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/faster-higher-sleeker-how-boom-supersonic-wants-to-reinvent-flight-20250415-p5ls10.html,"But that could change if a new entrant, exploiting new technology, can build a faster, cheaper plane and effectively reprice the industry’s costs.
One company leading this charge is Boom Supersonic.
Blake Scholl, chief executive of Boom Supersonic, said the XB-1 was built with a “tiny budget and just 50 people, including engineers, technicians, pilots”.
The stasis has bled into the experience of flying, Scholl says.
We’ve proven we can build a supersonic jet.","Technological disruption has upended banking, communication, even space travel (think SpaceX’s reusable rockets), but somehow, commercial aviation has remained largely unchanged.

For decades, Boeing and Airbus have dominated aircraft manufacturing. But that could change if a new entrant, exploiting new technology, can build a faster, cheaper plane and effectively reprice the industry’s costs.

One company leading this charge is Boom Supersonic. At the end of January, Colorado-based Boom successfully flew its test plane, the XB-1, at the speed of Mach 1.1 (or 1.1 times the speed of sound).

This marked the first time a jet developed independently of major aircraft manufacturers has achieved supersonic speeds.

Blake Scholl, chief executive of Boom Supersonic, said the XB-1 was built with a “tiny budget and just 50 people, including engineers, technicians, pilots”.

Data from the test flight is being used to inform the design of a bigger jet, one that Boom hopes will develop a new market: the Overture.

Boom’s Overture will carry between 64 and 80 passengers at speeds about double that of Boeing 787s or Airbus 350s (up to Mach 1.7). The engines are designed to run on 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel.

Building Overture would be one feat. Successfully commercialising at would be another, but the excitement around the plane is genuine. Scholl says interest in Boom is “just absolutely overwhelming”.

Part of the drive by Boom is to challenge the status quo in aviation. Boeing is beset by problems with its 737 Max, labour and safety issues, and production slowdowns. Airbus has gained market share, but it is also slowed by lingering production disruptions created by the pandemic aftermath.

“This is an industry where there are only two players in the world, Boeing and Airbus, and neither of them has launched a new product in more than 20 years,” says Scholl.

The stasis has bled into the experience of flying, Scholl says. “We’ve taken flying, which is an experience that used to be inspiring, and turned it to something that most people dread.”

A future of sleek airliners transporting passengers at supersonic speeds and reasonable prices over land would help restore some of the thrill of flying.

Scholl says he was inspired by seeing the Concorde in a museum when he was in his 20s. “I wondered why the most amazing airliner ever made was in a museum, not in our skies.”

The last and only commercial supersonic jet, the Concorde, travelled at cruising speed of 2160km/h or Mach 2, up to 60,000 times across the Atlantic, linking London and Paris to New York.

Before the era of Facebook and Apple, the Concorde was a symbol of technology’s possibility. The British-French Concorde capped a century in which humans progressed from the first flight of the Wright Brothers to landing on the Moon in a span of 66 years. The Concorde’s first test flight took place in 1969 – the same year of the Apollo moon landing.

But it was built with the technology of its time. The Concorde was loud, used lots of fuel and had cramped seating (its seats were smaller than many economy seats today). As it exceeded the speed of sound in flight, the pressure of the air created sonic booms – loud explosions that rattled the ground, frightening people.

This limited the Concorde’s routes to flying over the Atlantic.

The Overture promises to get around the prospect of sonic booms by using something called Mach cut-off physics, which involves the plane flying high enough and in the right conditions to a point where sonic boom never reaches the ground.

If Boom planes flying at or near Mach speed over land become viable, they will open up coast-to-coast routes in North America or between the US east coast and deeper into Europe – and across the Pacific.

“It’d be great if Sydney to LA were eight and a half hours, not 15,” Scholl says.

Boom is also building its own engine to efficiently burn sustainable aviation fuel. There is some debate about how easy this is.

Richard Aboulafia, managing director of Washington DC-based AeroDynamic Advisory, says Boom lacks a realistic path towards an engine.

“The real challenge with creating a modern supersonic jetliner is the engine – far more than the airframe,” he says, with only three companies in the world qualified to do “such a complicated and expensive engine”: GE, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, none of which are partnering with Boom.

“Boom is doing its own engine ... in conjunction with three minor partners who really don’t have anything like the capabilities needed,” said Aboulafia.

Scholl says such an assessment is rooted in legacy aerospace costs. “There’s a myth today that jet engines are basically impossible to develop and only big companies can do them.”

“That was also a myth about supersonic jets before XB. We’ve proven we can build a supersonic jet. The next thing is we’ll prove we can build a jet engine.”

Brian Potter of the US-based Institute for Progress writes that “the boundary of technological possibility” is defined not just by mastery of the universe but the “limits of the economy and the organisations that operate within it”.

One of those boundaries may be the cost of its creation. Potter says it’s not uncommon for aircraft companies to spend more than their value to complete a plane. Based on past – even recent examples – creating the Overture could require $US15 billion ($23.5 billion) for completion.

Scholl says the $US15 billion price tag would be right “if one of the big old players did it”.

Scholl says Boom has “demonstrated an ability to develop 10 times more efficiently than the traditional players”. So we are expecting costs more in the $US1-2 billion range “versus the much higher costs that would be realised at traditional players”.

Boom has so far amassed funding just shy of $US1 billion, some of it backed by the Saudi-based NEOM Investment Fund.

Boom also uses AI and proprietary software engineering tools, Scholl says, which “speed development while reducing costs”.

However, for Boom’s Overture to succeed, market economics must support it where they didn’t for the Concorde, which only flew a niche market of London, New York and Paris.

With a cheaper operational cost, Scholl forecasts flights on the Overture would fetch as much as business flights today – in the $US2500 to $US5000 range one-way – and, unlike with Concorde, prices would fall with time. The premium travel segment is expanding. More passengers are willing to pay for a higher level of service.

But economics probably weren’t the only reason for a plane’s success. Catching the right moment in the market matters too.

Loading

The Concorde was brought to completion in part for the same reasons the moon landing happened – the plane said something about societies that built it.

The Concorde wasn’t even the only supersonic airliner then; Soviet Russia also successfully built a short-lived supersonic transport called the Tu‑144.

Today, China is reportedly developing the C949, a supersonic commercial liner, that will also avoid creating sonic booms and put the Pacific in closer reach of Beijing.

Perhaps supersonic commercial flight will become more attractive both logistically and strategically now than in the past half-century. Boom is also planning a military version of the Overture. Still, the Overture is unlikely to succeed unless it can make a commercial use case.

To date, Boom has orders or options for orders from United Airlines, American Airlines and Japan Airlines. However, aircraft purchasing is a long and complicated business, with sizeable differences between initial options and final delivery.

Scholl is both unbowed and optimistic. “We have an opportunity here to build a company that’s not just larger than Boeing, but one of the most significant companies, one of the most valuable companies on the planet.”

Among several events was a march through midtown Manhattan, a demonstration at a Massachusetts celebration of the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War, and a gathering in front of the White House.

Protesters in San Francisco raised a human flag reading “Impeach & Remove” on the dunes of Ocean Beach, which overlooks the Pacific Ocean.

Thomas Bassford took part in the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in front of demonstrators outside Boston. On April 19, 1775, the “shot heard ’round the world” signaled the beginning of the nation’s war for independence from Britain.

An 80-year-old retired mason from Maine believes that Americans must reject their own government, which is currently assaulting them. Bassford remarked, “This is a perilous era for liberty in the United States,” as he attended the ceremony with his daughter, companion, and two grandchildren.

“We should understand the nation’s origins and fight for freedom.”

Tesla dealerships planned to hold protests against Elon Musk, a wealthy Donald Trump advisor, and his role in the decrease of the federal government. Others created additional community service efforts, such as food drives, training seminars, and volunteer work at local shelters.

It’s only been two weeks since thousands of people took to the streets around the country in response to similar statewide protests against the Donald Trump administration.

The organizers claim that they are opposed to Trump’s alleged violations of the Constitution and civil rights, which include his efforts to deport a large number of immigrants and shrink the federal government by firing thousands of employees and effectively closing entire agencies.

Events calling for “no kings” and opposing tyranny inspired the spirit of the American Revolutionary War.

While holding a sign that said, “Donald Trump fascist regime must go now!” During the Concord, Massachusetts demonstrations, Boston resident George Bryant raised concerns that Trump was constructing a “police state” in the United States.

“He is violating the law.” He is kidnapping students. Bryant stated, “He is dismantling the checks and balances.” “This is fascism.”

Bob Fasick had said in Washington: “I attended the march near the White House because I was concerned about the potential threats to the Constitution’s guarantee of due process rights, as well as to Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.”

Under Donald Trump, transgender protections have been compromised.

The 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, claimed, “I am unable to remain inactive, as I am aware that if we do nothing, our children and neighbors will be forced to live in a world that I would not wish to inhabit.”

Several hundred protesters were seen at the statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina. They exhibited placards that read “Save SSA,” which stands for the Social Security Administration, and “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight.”

Protesters gathered in Manhattan and marched north from the New York Public Library into Central Park, past Donald Trump Tower, to express their opposition to the continuous deportation of immigrants.

To the rhythmic beat of drums, they declared, “No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Marshall Green, a protester, expressed his principal concern about Donald Trump use of the 1798 Alien Enemy Act during the conflict. He claimed that the United States is at odds with Venezuelan bandits who work for the South American country’s government.

“Congress should make it clear that we are not at war.” The 61-year-old Morristown, New Jersey resident responded, “That is not feasible.” The right to due process is guaranteed to all individuals in this country, regardless of circumstances, and it is impossible to deport someone without it.

Melinda Charles of Connecticut raised her concerns about Donald Trump “executive overreach,” citing legal fights with federal courts involving Harvard University and other respected organizations.

She went on: “The executive branch has become excessively powerful, despite the fact that we are supposed to have three equal branches of government.” “It is truly remarkable.”

Lebih lanjut, menurutnya Indonesia telah menetapkan tiga tujuan utama dalam peta jalan yang disusun oleh pemerintah. Tujuan pertama adalah melakukan dekarbonisasi di sektor penerbangan untuk mendukung pencapaian target pengurangan emisi karbon secara global dan nasional, khususnya melalui penggunaan Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

“Kedua, kedaulatan energi dengan memenuhi kebutuhan energi sektor aviasi secara mandiri dengan memanfaatkan bahan baku domestik. Ketiga, penciptaan nilai ekonomi melalui hilirisasi bahan baku, penjualan SAF untuk pasar ekspor dan domestik, serta peningkatan investasi,” tuturnya.

Ia menambahkan bahwa saat ini produksi SAF di Indonesia masih mengandalkan jalur Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), dengan bahan baku berupa Palm Kernel Oil (PKO) yang dinilai belum sepenuhnya ramah lingkungan. Oleh karena itu, kegiatan riset dan pengembangan (RnD) terhadap beragam jenis bahan baku untuk SAF melalui metode HEFA perlu terus dikembangkan.

“Pentingnya keberlanjutan dalam produksi SAF antara lain mengurangi emisi Gas Rumah Kaca (GRK), mengurangi ketergantungan pada bahan bakar fosil, mendorong ekonomi sirkular. Mengurangi polusi udara lokal, Mendukung pembangunan berkelanjutan, memenuhi regulasi dan tuntutan pasar,” kata dia.

Ia menegaskan bahwa saat ini terdapat dua bahan baku yang memiliki potensi besar untuk dikembangkan sebagai alternatif dalam produksi SAF melalui jalur HEFA generasi berikutnya, yakni Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah, serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD). Kedua bahan tersebut merupakan limbah yang dinilai lebih berkelanjutan sebagai sumber energi.

Untuk menilai sejauh mana dampak lingkungan dari berbagai jenis bahan baku SAF tersebut, ia menjelaskan bahwa pendekatan yang dapat digunakan adalah Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Metode ini merupakan cara sistematis untuk mengukur dampak lingkungan suatu produk, proses, atau aktivitas, mulai dari tahap awal hingga akhir dari siklus hidupnya.

Lebih lanjut, ia menyampaikan bahwa kajian LCA mencakup seluruh tahapan penting dalam siklus hidup produk, termasuk ekstraksi bahan baku, proses produksi, distribusi, penggunaan, hingga ke tahap akhir seperti pembuangan atau daur ulang. Pendekatan ini penting agar pengembangan SAF benar-benar memberikan manfaat lingkungan yang optimal.

“LCA memiliki beberapa manfaat yang signifikan di Indonesia, seperti mengidentifikasi dampak lingkungan produk atau layanan, mengurangi biaya produksi, meningkatkan efisiensi produksi dan penggunaan sumber daya. Memenuhi persyaratan peraturan lingkungan, membantu perbaikan berkelanjutan, meningkatkan citra perusahaan, membantu pengambilan keputusan yang lebih baik untuk bisnis dan investasi,” ujarnya.

Kemudian, lanjut Arif, tantangan dalam penerapan LCA untuk produksi SAF mencakup beberapa aspek, antara lain terbatasnya data yang akurat dan menyeluruh, rumitnya rantai pasok, perbedaan metodologi yang digunakan, serta kebutuhan biaya dan waktu yang tidak sedikit. Selain itu, ketiadaan standar dan regulasi yang seragam juga menjadi hambatan tersendiri dalam pelaksanaan LCA secara efektif.

“Kami menyimpulkan, bahwa LCA menyediakan kerangka kerja yang sistematis untuk mengevaluasi dampak lingkungan dari seluruh siklus hidup SAF, mulai dari produksi bahan baku hingga penggunaan akhir. LCA membantu mengidentifikasi jalur produksi SAF yang paling berkelanjutan, serta area hotspot di mana dampak lingkungan dapat dikurangi,” kata dia.

Adapun hasil kajian LCA dapat menjadi landasan ilmiah dalam menetapkan kebijakan, menentukan arah investasi, dan mendorong inovasi teknologi dalam produksi SAF yang lebih efisien. “Dengan mengintegrasikan LCA ke dalam proses pengambilan keputusan, kita dapat memastikan bahwa industri penerbangan melangkah ke arah yang lebih berkelanjutan dan ramah lingkungan,” ujar Arif.",https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/04/20/id_1392885/1392885_720.jpg,N,,2025-04-19 23:56:11.374718

Bahkan, kualitas jelantah Indonesia diakui sebagai yang terbaik nomor satu di dunia. Sayangnya, potensi emas ini justru belum dimanfaatkan secara optimal oleh negeri sendiri.

Hal ini diungkapkan oleh Ketua Asosiasi Pengumpul Jelantah untuk Energi Baru Terbarukan Indonesia (APJETI), Matias Tumanggor, dalam Workshop Rantai Pasok Minyak Jelantah Berkelanjutan untuk Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang digelar di Gedung BJ Habibie, Jakarta beberapa waktu lalu.

Dalam pemaparannya, Matias menyampaikan bahwa potensi jelantah Indonesia sangat besar dan berkualitas tinggi, bahkan diakui oleh mitra internasional.

“Hal ini sebagai pengakuan dari mitra di luar negeri, dan dibuktikan oleh masyarakat Indonesia dengan sertifikasi halal yang dimiliki oleh setiap hotel, restoran, dan cafe. Bahan yang mereka gunakan adalah 95% minyak goreng berbahan nabati, karena asasnya adalah halal,” ujar Matias.

Namun, ia menambahkan bahwa hingga saat ini jelantah masih belum dimanfaatkan secara maksimal untuk kebutuhan energi di dalam negeri. Penggunaannya lebih banyak terbatas pada bahan baku lokal seperti lilin dan produk lainnya.

Matias juga menyayangkan belum adanya regulasi yang jelas dalam pengelolaan minyak goreng bekas. Hal ini, menurutnya, menjadi salah satu hambatan terbesar dalam pemanfaatan jelantah sebagai energi terbarukan.

“Kemudian, pentingnya dan belum adanya regulasi tentang tata kelola penanganan minyak goreng bekas atau jelantah, serta kami perlu untuk diajak berdiskusi. Menurut kami hal ini sangat penting, karena berhubungan dengan kesehatan lingkungan dan energi,” tegasnya.

“Kami menerima produk jelantah sebagai sumber penghasil UCO, terdiri dari rumah tangga dengan Bank Sampah atau langsung door to door. Sektor industri yang bergerak di bidang makan dan minuman, seperti hotel, restoran, dan cafe,” jelasnya.

Lebih lanjut, sumber jelantah juga berasal dari pelaku UMKM, kantin, industri pertambangan, hingga pedagang kaki lima yang menghasilkan limbah penggorengan seperti gorengan dan kerupuk yang sudah kadaluarsa.

Meski demikian, proses pengumpulan jelantah masih menghadapi berbagai kendala, seperti ketiadaan regulasi, ketidakpastian arah pemanfaatan dalam negeri, serta banyaknya pelaku usaha ilegal yang tidak terorganisir.

“Untuk mengatasinya, kami memiliki strategi pengumpulan dengan melahirkan pelaku usaha yang teredukasi dan terorganisir dari desa sampai provinsi. Meningkatkan kegiatan sosialisasi kepada masyarakat, merangkul dan bersinergi dengan komunitas, organisasi masyarakat, Badan Usaha Milik Desa (Bumdes) atau daerah.

This firm commitment was made at the Exclusive Discourse Event organised by Lufthansa Airlines at Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos.

Olayinka Babaoye-Iriobe, director of Air Transport Regulations, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), who was represented by Evelyn Tanko, Deputy General Manager, Commercial Agreement & Aviation Environment stated that the Authority is empowered by the Civil Aviation Act, 2022 to regulate environmental issues and further to reiterate its commitments to the sustainability of the industry, NCAA has domesticated ICAO Annex 16 on Environmental Protection into the National regulations under Part 16 of Nig. CARS, which covers requirements for monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 Emissions for international aviation, and Part 5 addresses aircraft noise and emission certification.

The Director highlighted some of the initiatives of the NCAA on the sustainability of the industry. These initiatives include: The development of a State Action Plan on CO2 Emission reduction from international aviation, Nigeria voluntarily joined the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) during its pilot phase in 2018 and has continued to ensure the timely submission of CO2 emission data from airlines under CORSIA and also leading on a Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Roadmap for the development and deployment of SAF in Nigeria.

She added that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is rolling out Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) at major airports ultimately to reduce their carbon emissions and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA) has implemented Free Route Airspace (FRA) and Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) all efforts for the reduction of carbon footprints and towards the sustainability of the industry.

Key challenges in implementing and scaling sustainability policies within the aviation sector were identified to include: fragmented policy environment, limited data and monitoring systems, financing constraints, regulatory & institutional capacity, and awareness, and industry readiness.

Also speaking at the panel session, Rene Koinzack, the Senior Director (Sales), Lufthansa Sub-Sahara Africa, said that the airline has deployed Science- Based Target Initiatives (SBTI) which comprises modern fleet, efficient flight operations, carbon neutral flying, sustainable aviation fuel, reduction of waste and plastics as part of their effort to sustain the industry.

It was emphasised that airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and regulators must all play their roles to promote eco-friendly practices by lowering carbon emissions, improved fuel efficiency, develop alternative energy sources, and enhance operational efficiency for the sustainability of aviation industry.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nigerian-Civil-Aviation-Authority-NCAA.jpg,N,,2025-04-19 12:56:31.527543

Vanaf 2018 heeft het bedrijf geleidelijk maatregelen ingevoerd om reiskilometers en uitstoot te verminderen. Maarten vertelt: ‘Klantcontact is cruciaal in ons werk, maar we stellen ons altijd de vraag of een fysieke reis noodzakelijk is. Is een online meeting mogelijk? Of kunnen we de ontmoeting met minder collega’s of minder vaak plannen, zodat we minder hoeven te reizen? Als reizen noodzakelijk is, geven we de voorkeur aan auto of trein. Sinds 2024 is voor alle reizen tot 700 kilometer de trein de standaard, mits de reis niet langer dan zes uur duurt. Je kunt altijd aanspraak maken op een eersteklas treinticket.’

‘Moet er toch gevlogen worden? Dan is goedkeuring van een leidinggevende vereist. We zijn hierin sinds 2024 strikter geworden. Voordat een vlucht wordt goedgekeurd, overwegen we verschillende factoren: is een directe vlucht mogelijk, kun je de trip combineren met ander werk, en reis je met niet meer dan vier personen? Ook moedigen we aan om zoveel mogelijk in economy class te vliegen, behalve bij langere nachtvluchten. Zo beperken we de uitstoot van de noodzakelijke vliegreizen die we nog maken.’

Hoewel volledig stoppen met vliegen geen optie is voor PwC, probeert het bedrijf de luchtvaartsector te helpen transformeren door te investeren in innovatie. Sinds 2022 koopt PwC een hoeveelheid biobrandstoffen in die gelijkstaat aan alle gemaakte vliegkilometers, bekend als Sustainable Aviation Fuel, die vervolgens door leveranciers aan het brandstofnetwerk wordt toegevoegd. Omdat er niet genoeg biobrandstoffen beschikbaar zijn om de gehele luchtvaart te verduurzamen, investeert PwC ook in onderzoeksprogramma’s voor de productie van synthetische kerosine. Bovendien hanteert het bedrijf een interne CO2-prijs. ‘Voor elke ton CO2 die we uitstoten, investeren we honderd euro in reductie, compensatie en innovatie. Deze CO2-prijs maken we ook zichtbaar in projecten, zodat klanten bewust worden van de klimaatimpact van hun zakelijke reizen en daardoor andere keuzes kunnen maken’, zegt Maarten.

Belangrijke succesfactoren voor een duurzaam reisbeleid

Volgens Maarten kunnen andere bedrijven ook aan de slag met een beleid zoals dat van PwC. ‘Minder vliegen kan zowel tijd als geld besparen voor je bedrijf. Het is belangrijk om een sterke business case te maken en deze goed te presenteren. Daarbij is het cruciaal om met het bestuur realistische doelen te stellen die bij het bedrijf passen.’

Maarten benadrukt het belang van een “holistische benadering”. ‘Verwacht niet dat je onmiddellijke resultaten ziet door slechts één maatregel te implementeren. Meerdere maatregelen samen zorgen vaak voor het grootste effect. Sommige maatregelen zullen pijnlijk zijn, terwijl andere juist meer comfort bieden aan medewerkers. Het vinden van een balans is essentieel voor acceptatie. Daarnaast is het belangrijk om te monitoren en handhaven. Pas dan kun je zien of je beleid effectief is. Wij zien dit als een continu proces. We voeren halfjaarlijkse analyses uit en op basis daarvan scherpen we onze maatregelen aan of verhogen we onze communicatie hierover.’

Is deze holistische benadering een stap te ver voor jouw bedrijf? Dan raadt Maarten aan om te onderzoeken wat wel mogelijk is. ‘Het is nuttig om te leren van andere bedrijven en bestaande informatie. Sluit je bijvoorbeeld aan bij een coalitie zoals Anders Reizen. De Vliegwijzer biedt bovendien veel tips en inspiratie van ervaren bedrijven.’",https://www.nieuwsbladvoorhuizen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Exclusief-Interview-PwC-Treinreizen-Nieuwe-Standaard-voor-Afstanden-tot-700.jpeg,N,,2025-04-19 11:56:59.718167

Air New Zealand's flight plan for sustainability A bold experiment is underway to turn Air New Zealand green.
They include: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF is an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions across its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil fuels.","Say the word ""sustainable"" around an airline executive, and they'll probably try to change the subject. That's because green air travel is a distant dream.

But not for Air New Zealand.

""We're doing everything we can to become sustainable now,"" says Kiri Hannifin, Air New Zealand's chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer. ""And we're leaving no stone unturned.""

Hannifin is not your typical airline executive. She's too casually dressed, too plain-spoken to fit the stereotype, answering my questions quickly and candidly. Hannifin readily admits she prefers being among the workers at the airport instead of sitting at a desk in Air New Zealand's Auckland headquarters, where I met her.

Air New Zealand is unique among airlines. It's the national air carrier for a geographically isolated island on the far edge of the Pacific Ocean. New Zealand depends on long-haul aviation for tourism and trade, and the airline imports 100 percent of its jet fuel. That creates a paradox. If you cut back on carbon emissions, you could cut yourself off from the rest of the world.

So can you explore the world and protect it at the same time? Hannifin doesn't just hope the answer is yes — she's counting on it. But Air New Zealand's path to sustainability has already been turbulent, and there's more rough air ahead. There have been missteps. Hannifin's work may affect your next flight on all airlines beyond Air New Zealand, no matter where you're headed.

Air New Zealand's flight plan for sustainability

A bold experiment is underway to turn Air New Zealand green. The airline is exploring strategies to reduce its environmental impact. They include:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF is an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions across its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil fuels. The airline recently purchased 30 million liters of SAF for its flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Auckland.

Electric planes: Air New Zealand expects to be one of the first commercial airlines to add an electric plane to its fleet in 2025. It's a six-seater, all-electric aircraft from Beta Technologies with a range of 350 kilometers. The airline intends to use the electric plane for short cargo routes from Wellington to Blenheim on New Zealand's South Island.

Next-level conservation. The airline is also experimenting with other sustainability measures. For example, it recently removed single-use coffee cups from one of its flights and encouraged passengers to bring their own cups. The airline has also removed disposable coffee cups from their lounges and replaced them with washable ones. (The bring-your-own-cup experiment was short-lived, but the paper cups in the lounges are gone for good.)

Granted, these are baby steps toward Air New Zealand's goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Hannifin says achieving it will require a ""huge lift"" and she predicts it'll be a bumpy ride as the airline navigates passenger demand, regulations and a need to be profitable.

What's the journey been like?

It's been an adventure so far. One challenge is getting buy-in from passengers. While its customers say they care about the environment, only between 3 and 4 percent buy a carbon offset when they book a ticket.

And then there's the great paper cup experiment. The airline uses hundreds of thousands of landfill-clogging disposable cups every year. But getting passengers on board with conservation efforts has proven difficult. Hannifin recalls a recent flight where the airline scrapped its paper cups on a trial basis.

""We texted the customers twice,"" she recalls. ""We said, 'Please bring your own cups. We're just doing a little trial and we'll give you prizes.'""

Only 10 percent of the passengers brought their cups. Flight attendants handed out Air New Zealand lapel pins and keychains to the participating passengers. Back to the drawing board.

Another giant hurdle: sustainable aviation fuel made from agricultural waste. It's the primary driver of green aviation. There's no clear, consistent global framework to support its widespread use.

Air New Zealand is voluntarily purchasing SAF, placing it at a commercial disadvantage compared to other airlines that continue to rely solely on cheaper fossil fuels. The airline is pushing for a SAF mandate in New Zealand, which would level the playing field by requiring all airlines to use a certain percentage of sustainable fuel.

This lack of regulatory support also hinders the development of a domestic SAF industry, because fuel companies require the assurance of long-term demand before investing in SAF production facilities in New Zealand.

What does this mean for your next flight?

How will all of these initiatives affect your next trip? In the short term, the most noticeable change might be the absence of single-use coffee cups.

As SAF becomes more prevalent, you might be flying with a fuel mix that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to regular jet fuel. Down the line, the use of electric planes for regional routes may become more common. And the amount of sustainable fuel being used will increase every year.

And what about that 2050 goal? Air New Zealand is far from getting there, and Hannifin says the airline is currently the fifth largest polluter in New Zealand, which, she admits, ""is a terrible position to be in.""

But she says the company is determined to be taken off the list quickly as it adopts sustainable fuels and switches to electric planes.

Hannifin predicts the flying experience itself will change as 2050 draws closer. Faster planes and quieter engines may make it more convenient to get to New Zealand. Sustainability aviation will be at the center of it.

""Travelers will be much more cognizant of where they travel based on climate footprint,"" she says.

It's a slow journey toward sustainability — but one worth taking

If Air New Zealand wants to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, it will require a multi-pronged approach. The airline will have to address not just decarbonization but also waste reduction and broader sustainability practices. It will have to solve the paradox of being a carrier of passengers, some of whom are trying to reach family or experience the natural beauty of New Zealand, with being a polluter.

This odyssey is happening across the tourism industry, as governments and passengers start pressuring air carriers to do more for the environment. So Air New Zealand's journey might affect an airline closer to home soon.

Reality check: With New Zealand entering a recession and Air New Zealand's competitors still using cheaper fossil fuels, it sounds almost impossible. But Hannifin likes those odds.

""We have to really hustle,"" she says. ""But we'll get there. I'm sure of it.""",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/680351d75abd153ea9b71a07/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-04-19 09:56:08.423187

Yet there comes a moment, often during the fifth month of gray skies, when even the most loyal resident starts scanning airline apps for sunshine and something profoundly different. Egypt answers both cravings in one sweep: year-round warmth, legendary hospitality, and a cultural pedigree that predates the oldest Seneca Lake stone wall by four millennia.

The following guide breaks down ten timely, tangible reasons Egypt should rise to the top of your 2025 travel shortlist. Think of it as a fact checked roadmap: each section pairs the latest intel (museum openings, currency shifts, visa updates) with practical tips, so you can move from daydreaming to departure with confidence.

1. Grand Egyptian Museum Finally Opens (July 3, 2025)

Cairo has waited nearly twenty years for the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) to fling open its pyramidal glass façade. The wait ends July 3, when the world’s largest archaeological museum welcomes the general public. Once inside, visitors will encounter 100,000 artifacts, including the full, gilded funerary collection of Tutankhamun, shown together for the first time in a single climate controlled space.

What this Means for Travelers:

A single, ticketed campus beside the Giza Plateau slashes cross-town traffic time; you can pair the Pyramids, Sphinx, and GEM in one seamlessly guided day.

Evening entry slots (announced for late 2025) will allow sunset pyramid views followed by air conditioned gallery strolls, ideal for summer visits.

Local tip: Book GEM tickets the moment your international flights are locked in; daily visitor caps mirror the timed entry model used by the Louvre.

2. E-visa Approval Arrives in Under 24 Hours

Remember mailing passports to consulates? Egypt scrapped that hassle. U.S. and most EU citizens can now apply, pay, and download a 30-day tourist e-visa on the government portal. Many approvals land in your inbox the same day, and the PDF works on your phone, no print-outs required.

Pro move: Submit the form one week out; if immigration requests a quick clarification, you still have days to spare.

3. Year-round Nonstop Flights From JFK Cut Travel Time

EgyptAir’s MS 986 departs JFK around lunchtime three times weekly (schedule expands to daily over summer), landing in Cairo the next morning. The single hop erases the European layover and, crucially, keeps your checked bag on the same aircraft. Even with a six-hour time change, you can clear customs, meet your guide, and reach the Pyramids before noon.

Sleep hack: Choose a window seat on the port side (rows 35–45) for dawn views of the Nile Delta on descent.

4. A Strong Dollar Turns Luxury Into a Bargain

Currency devaluations aren’t great for Egyptians, but they stretch American vacation budgets in a way unseen since the early 1990s. The pound slid to ≈EGP 51 per U.S. dollar in early April after another market wobble, and economists expect it to hover near that mark through peak travel season. Five star hotels that once rivaled Rome’s prices now cost less than midrange Manhattan rooms, and a private, Egyptologist-led day tour averages what a group bus excursion did three years ago.

Bottom line: This is the year to upgrade, think Nile view suites, hot air balloon dawn flights, or a cabin on a boutique dahabiya (see Reason 7).

5. Abu Simbel Sun Festival, a Twice Yearly Sunrise You Can Plan Around

On February 22 and October 22, sunlight pierces the innermost sanctuary of Ramses II’s Great Temple at Abu Simbel, illuminating statues of three gods and the pharaoh himself. Thousands gather before dawn on Lake Nasser’s shore, drums echo across the desert, and the spectacle lasts a mere 20 minutes.

How to catch it:

Fly to Abu Simbel from Aswan the afternoon prior, overnight at a lakeside lodge, and walk to the temple by 4 a.m.

Alternatively, board a Lake Nasser cruise that docks overnight, cabins sell out a year in advance.

6. Unesco Sites Deliver History in High Definition

Egypt packs seven UNESCO World Heritage inscriptions into a country smaller than Texas. From the Pyramids of Giza to the monastic summit of St. Catherine in Sinai, each site layers thousands of years of religious, political, and engineering innovation. Highlights include:

Memphis and its Necropolis – the full pyramid fields from Giza to Dahshur.

Ancient Thebes – Luxor’s east bank temples and west bank Valley of the Kings.

Historic Cairo – 600 plus listed buildings spanning Islamic, Coptic, and Ottoman eras.

Why this matters: Few destinations let you trace an unbroken architectural timeline from 2600 B.C. limestone to 14thcentury marble mosques within one week’s itinerary.

7. Nile Cruises, Culture on Cruise Control

Imagine waking to temple columns instead of city skylines. Modern riverboats (150–200 passengers) and intimate dahabiyas (10–16 guests) glide from Luxor to Aswan on itineraries that double as floating history seminars. Each afternoon, certified guides lead small groups through Kom Ombo or Edfu; evenings bring galabeya parties, cooking demos, or rooftop stargazing under skies unmarred by city light.

Why it clicks with Upstate travelers: If you enjoy pairing Seneca Lake wine cruises with Civil War history tours, a Nile cruise offers the same move-once-see-a-lot convenience—just add 4,000 extra years of backstory.

Ready to sail? Browse these Nile cruises, which feature luxury riverboats, boutique dahabiyas, and familyfriendly itineraries. These cruises include private tours led by certified Egyptologists, seamless air conditioned transfers to iconic attractions across Luxor and Aswan, and culturally immersive itineraries that blend historic insights with modern comforts.

8. Red Sea Resorts Keep Winter Water at 72–75°F

January in New York means sidewalks crunch with salt and wind bites. January in Hurghada means coral gardens sway under 73-degree water, and the hotel’s infinity pool is genuinely warm. Official sea temperature records place February averages at 22.2 °C / 72 °F, balmy enough for snorkelers, divers, and kite surfers chasing reliable wind.

Beyond the beach: desert yoga domes, thalassotherapy spas using salt harvested on-site, and camel-trek sunset dinners offer non-aquatic bliss.

9. Cairo’s Contemporary Art and Music Scene Hits Its Stride

While pharaohs steal headlines, Egypt’s creative class is busy reclaiming abandoned palaces and rooftops for jazz nights, design fairs, and film screenings. The Art Cairo fair held its sixth edition in February inside the Grand Egyptian Museum’s atrium, juxtaposing modern installations with 4,500 year-old statues. Rooftop bars in Garden City host weekly Afro-house DJs, while the Townhouse Gallery’s new satellite space doubles as a co-working hub for animators and podcast producers.

Traveler takeaway: Allocate at least one unstructured evening in Cairo. Ask your hotel concierge for the latest pop-up; the city’s creative calendar moves fast.

10. Fresh Archaeological Discoveries Every Season

Egypt is one of the few destinations where “newly opened” can describe a tomb carved in 1400 B.C. In January, archaeologists unearthed more than 1,000 vibrantly painted blocks from Queen Hatshepsut’s valley temple, alongside a limestone tablet naming her architect Senmut. Finds like these trigger temporary exhibitions, special access permits, and press tour discounts that travelers can tap within months.

Why it matters: Repeat visitors see something genuinely new each trip, rare in world heritage travel, where most attractions are static.

Sustainable Steps You Can Take

Fly economy or purchase SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) offsets when booking.

Carry a filtered water bottle; Egypt’s tap water is treated, and filters reduce singleuse plastic.

Choose a cruise that participates in Nile clean-up days and employs local staff above industry minimums.

Respect site capacity rules at tombs with fragile pigment (guides can suggest rotating tombs with equal artistry).

Final Word – the Joy of Contrast

Travel is partly about contrast: tasting flavors, hearing cadences, and seeing horizons that reset your sense of scale. Few countries deliver contrast like Egypt. One morning you’re tracing chisel marks inside a pyramid; that night you’re sipping pomegranate spritz on a Nile deck while Wi-Fi pings in the background. Add the favorable dollar, new museum buzz, and direct flights, and the equation tilts from “maybe someday” to “why not this year?”

When you’re ready to trade snow boots for sandals and creek ice for camel tracks, Egypt’s temples, reefs, and riverboats will be waiting, stories etched in stone, but memories still unwritten.",https://images.pexels.com/photos/1369212/pexels-photo-1369212.jpeg,N,,2025-04-19 09:56:12.084966

This SAF book-and-claim pilot launch offers around 1 million gallons of SAF – enough to power almost 15,000 individual business traveler flights from London to New York.

The pilot phase of the program aims to demonstrate the credibility of the book-and-claim model, using blockchain technology to ensure secured allocation of SAF’s environmental attributes to companies and airlines after the fuel has been delivered into the fuel network.

Airlines and business customers could simultaneously reduce emissions in their respective scopes, while ensuring transparency and accountability by avoiding issues such as double-counting.

The software was developed by Shell and Accenture with the support of the Energy Web Foundation (EWF) and includes Amex GBT’s travel management services to aggregate global business demand for SAF, which will increase SAF supply and use and help accelerate the aviation industry’s pathway towards net-zero emissions.

“SAF is a key enabler of decarbonisation in the aviation industry, and it’s available today,” said Jan Toschka, President, Shell Aviation said in a statement. “However, it’s currently scarce and costs more than conventional jet fuel. Avelia will help trigger demand for SAF at scale, providing confidence to suppliers like us to further increase investment in production, and in turn helping to lower the price point for these fuels.”

The first customers are Shell, Accenture and Amex GBT. Shell committed to purchasing the environmental attributes equivalent to 100,000 gallons of SAF over the pilot phase of the Avelia program. Shell will increase this commitment as soon as more SAF is available, to achieve its ambition to abate 45% of Shell’s corporate travel emissions through SAF by 2030.

Dia menambahkan, penting untuk mendorong adanya regulasi tentang tata kelola penanganan minyak goreng bekas atau jelantah.

“Menurut kami hal ini sangat penting, karena berhubungan dengan kesehatan lingkungan dan energi,” tegasnya dalam diskusi yang digelar Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) melalui Pusat Riset Sistem Produksi Berkelanjutan dan Penilaian Daur Hidup (PRSPBPDH).

Matias menilai perlu adanya pemetaan rantai pasok minyak jelantah atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO) dari hulu ke hilir dan mengidentifikasi tantangan dalam pengumpulannya.

Perlu juga mengidentifikasi inovasi teknologi pengumpulan, menyusun strategi untuk meningkatkan kapasitas pengumpulan, dan mendiskusikan potensi permintaan dan implementasi SAF.

“Kami menerima produk jelantah sebagai sumber penghasil UCO, terdiri dari rumah tangga dengan bank sampah atau langsung door to door. Sektor industri yang bergerak di bidang makan dan minuman, seperti hotel, restoran, dan cafe,” ujarnya dalam diskusi yang bekerja sama dengan PT Noovoleum Indonesia Investama tentang Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Upaya memanfaatkan jelantah untuk energi terbarukan tak selalu berjalan mulus.

Matias menyampaikan berbagai tantangannya, seperti belum adanya regulasi sehingga dia dianggap melakukan penyalahgunaan. Ketidakpastian pemanfaatan dalam negeri dan pelaku usaha yang tidak terorganisasi dan ilegal.

“Untuk mengatasinya, kami memiliki strategi pengumpulan dengan melahirkan pelaku usaha yang teredukasi dan terorganisasi dari desa sampai provinsi.”

Background: A second front in a long-running war

The U.S.-China trade war first erupted in 2018 when former President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, seeking to address intellectual property theft and trade imbalances. China retaliated, heavily targeting U.S. agricultural products.

Clint Hardy, Daviess County’s extension agent for agriculture and natural resources, said a Phase One agreement in 2020 promised renewed Chinese purchases of American farm goods, but those commitments largely fell short, likely complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and broader diplomatic tensions.

According to the Associated Press, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office completed a review of Section 301 tariffs on China, recommending both keeping current tariffs and increasing some — including agricultural goods. China responded with threats of new retaliatory tariffs on American imports like soybeans, pork, and vehicles.

The trade war has intensified in recent weeks, with the Trump administration maintaining and in some cases increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, according to the Associated Press. Some rates on strategic products have risen sharply, and China has responded with retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural products. The standoff has disrupted supply chains and fueled concerns about a broader economic slowdown, the AP reports.

As of Thursday, the American Soybean Association, the National Corn Growers Association, and other groups had issued cautious statements urging the administration to avoid using farmers as bargaining chips in trade disputes.

In a state where agriculture plays a critical role in the economy, farmers say the impact could be severe.

Kentucky farmers, officials react

Caleb Ragland, a LaRue County farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, said soybeans are Kentucky’s top agricultural product by gross sales, and any disruption in global markets has far-reaching consequences.

“Soybeans were the largest grossing ag product produced in Kentucky last year,” Ragland said. “About 50% of U.S. soybeans are exported, and until the first trade war in 2018, China purchased more than half of those exports.”

Though exports rebounded somewhat in recent years, Ragland said the U.S. has never fully recovered its market share lost to Brazil and Argentina.

“At the worst of the trade war, U.S. soybean exports to China dropped to about 11%,” he said. “Even today, we’ve only regained about 25% — and we’ve lost a lot of ground we may never fully recover.”

Ripple effects beyond the farm

The consequences, Ragland said, stretch far beyond farms.

“A dollar earned in agriculture usually circulates six to eight times in a local economy,” he said. “It affects local businesses, restaurants, hardware stores, schools, churches — it touches everything.”

Hardy echoed those concerns. Hardy said tariffs don’t just affect commodities like soybeans and corn, but also raise the cost of critical supplies such as fertilizer, herbicides, and machinery parts, many of which are imported.

“When tariffs are placed on imported products farmers need, those extra costs are passed down,” Hardy said. “It raises the cost of production at the same time prices for their crops are falling.”

Farmers are already operating on razor-thin margins. According to Hardy, many made little to no profit in 2023, and expectations for 2025 remain bleak.

“There’s an underlying optimism about growing a good crop,” Hardy said. “But economically, there’s very little optimism about turning a profit.”

Stability in question

Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell said that while the short-term situation is challenging, the current negotiations could ultimately lead to stronger and fairer global trade policies.

“There’s definitely opportunity for short-term pain,” Shell said, “but if we can realign ourselves with strong allies like India, Vietnam, and Australia, we’ll build more stable, long-term markets for our farmers.”

Shell said discussions are ongoing at the federal level about potential support for farmers, but no new subsidy programs tied directly to the China tariffs have been announced. He predicted that more market stability could emerge by this summer if new deals come together.

Still, Ragland urged caution about banking on distant promises.

“The farm economy isn’t strong right now,” he said. “Soybean prices are down about 40% from three years ago, while the cost of production continues to rise. We can’t wait two or three years for a solution — we need action now.”

Farmers are already seeing signs of strain, Ragland added, with some in the state either exiting the business or significantly downsizing.

“We’ve had folks auction off equipment or semi-retire because they can’t cash flow anymore,” he said. “Higher input costs, lower revenue — it’s a bad combination.”

Challenges ahead

While some officials hope to expand domestic consumption through biofuels like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel, Ragland said those initiatives will take years — and billions of dollars of investment — to materialize.

“You don’t just snap your fingers and double the demand for corn and soybeans domestically,” he said.

Hardy agreed, noting that while domestic demand programs are essential, they can’t fully replace lost export markets overnight.

“We’ve got to figure out how to use more of what we grow here, but it will take time,” Hardy said.

Meanwhile, the immediate threat of widespread asset liquidation looms. Shell said losing more farmland at a faster rate is a real risk if prices don’t improve soon.

“If we don’t stabilize markets, farmers will be forced to sell land or go out of business,” Shell said. “And once farmland is sold, it’s hard to get back.”

He added that it’s a two-pronged strategy at work: rebalancing trade partnerships abroad while investing heavily to grow domestic consumption of agricultural products.

“We have to start consuming more here domestically, whether that be in biofuels, feeding more livestock, or increasing what we do with soybeans and canolas,” Shell said. “The Trump administration is trying to ignite that American consumption spirit, and that’s happening through new programs and investments.”

Hardy said farmers must continue adapting as best they can, but volatility is likely to remain.

“It’s really difficult to make decisions right now,” he said. “Commodity prices, input costs, interest rates—they’re all moving targets.”

Ragland said he remains hopeful — but realistic.

“We need a trade deal, and we need it soon,” he said. “Otherwise, there won’t be many farmers left to benefit from it.”",https://cdn.owensborotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OT-China-Trade-War-AG-1024x536.png,N,,2025-04-19 01:56:25.477918

In this video, Rosie Barnes discusses the state of the aviation industry and its challenges related to carbon emissions, particularly focusing on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The aviation sector contributes to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, but its climate warming impact is approximately 4% when accounting for non-CO2 factors, such as contrails. The current aviation fuel, refined kerosene, has remained unchanged for decades. The necessity for an alternative fuel that can be used with existing aircraft engines is crucial for achieving net-zero emissions in aviation.

SAF, produced from renewable biomass, offers an approach that can directly replace fossil fuels without requiring new aircraft designs. The HEFA process, which utilizes waste oils and fats, is currently the leading method for SAF production, providing significant yields while facing challenges in scaling due to increased feedstock demand.

According to PBS, the aviation industry contributes 4% of global carbon pollution. The heat-trapping gases generated by private jets, which jumped 46% from 2019 to 2023, accounts for nearly half of the aviation industry's total. Flying private takes a big toll on the environment.

Those who fly privately include influencers, CEOs, and world leaders, all of whom deliberately choose private flights despite the environmental costs.

However, one study revealed that flights with few or even no passengers do happen because planes need to return to their home bases. That might be what happened here.

Alternative methods of travel that are less wasteful than flying privately — or flying in general — include carpooling, electric vehicles, and public transportation. This helps reduce heat-trapping gas pollution. In the case of EVs, they produce zero tailpipe emissions.

If you must fly, opt for airlines that actively incorporate sustainable aviation fuel and choose direct, nonstop flights to minimize your environmental impact.

Salah satu strategi utama untuk mewujudkannya adalah melalui transisi dari bahan bakar fosil (avtur) ke Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—bahan bakar terbarukan yang lebih ramah lingkungan.

SAF diprediksi mampu mengurangi emisi karbon dioksida (CO₂) hingga 718 Mega Ton pada 2050, sekaligus memenuhi permintaan global yang diperkirakan mencapai 449 Miliar Liter per tahun.

Indonesia, dengan potensi bahan baku terbarukan yang melimpah, memiliki peluang besar untuk menjadi pemain utama dalam pengembangan SAF.

Peta Jalan SAF Indonesia: Tiga Pilar Utama

Pemerintah Indonesia telah menyusun strategi pengembangan SAF dengan tiga tujuan utama:

Dekarbonisasi Sektor Penerbangan

SAF diharapkan menjadi solusi utama dalam mengurangi emisi karbon industri aviasi, mendukung komitmen nasional dan global dalam penurunan emisi gas rumah kaca.

Kedaulatan Energi

Dengan memanfaatkan bahan baku domestik seperti minyak sawit, minyak jelantah, dan limbah pertanian, Indonesia dapat mengurangi ketergantungan pada impor bahan bakar fosil sekaligus memperkuat kemandirian energi.

Penciptaan Nilai Ekonomi

Pengembangan SAF tidak hanya mendukung lingkungan, tetapi juga membuka peluang ekonomi melalui hilirisasi bahan baku, ekspor, dan peningkatan investasi di sektor energi terbarukan.

Tantangan dalam Produksi SAF di Indonesia

Meski potensinya besar, produksi SAF di Indonesia masih menghadapi sejumlah kendala. Metode utama yang digunakan saat ini adalah Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), dengan bahan baku Palm Kernel Oil (PKO) yang masih menimbulkan kontroversi terkait dampak lingkungan.

Oleh karena itu, penelitian dan pengembangan (R&D) untuk menemukan bahan baku alternatif yang lebih berkelanjutan terus dilakukan.

Dua bahan baku potensial yang sedang dikembangkan adalah Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah—limbah rumah tangga dan industri yang dapat didaur ulang—serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD), produk sampingan dari industri kelapa sawit.

Keberlanjutan dalam Produksi SAF

Produksi SAF tidak hanya berfokus pada pengurangan emisi, tetapi juga harus memenuhi prinsip keberlanjutan.

Beberapa manfaat utamanya meliputi pengurangan emisi gas rumah kaca, penurunan ketergantungan pada bahan bakar fosil, penerapan ekonomi sirkular, peningkatan kualitas udara lokal, dukungan terhadap pembangunan berkelanjutan, serta pemenuhan regulasi dan tuntutan pasar global.

Untuk memastikan produksi SAF benar-benar ramah lingkungan, diperlukan pendekatan komprehensif seperti Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Metode ini mengevaluasi dampak lingkungan dari suatu produk atau proses, mulai dari ekstraksi bahan baku hingga pembuangan akhir.

Manfaat dan Tantangan Penerapan LCA

LCA membantu mengidentifikasi dampak lingkungan di setiap tahap produksi, meningkatkan efisiensi penggunaan sumber daya, memastikan kepatuhan terhadap regulasi lingkungan, serta memberikan dasar ilmiah untuk pengambilan keputusan strategis terkait investasi dan kebijakan.

Meski manfaatnya besar, penerapan LCA masih terkendala oleh ketersediaan data yang akurat, kompleksitas rantai pasok bahan baku, biaya dan waktu analisis yang tinggi, serta belum adanya standar dan regulasi yang.

Masa Depan SAF dengan Pendekatan LCA

LCA memberikan kerangka kerja penting untuk memastikan produksi SAF berjalan secara berkelanjutan. Dengan pendekatan ini, industri penerbangan dapat mengidentifikasi metode produksi yang paling efisien dan ramah lingkungan.

Hasil kajian LCA juga menjadi dasar bagi pemerintah dan pelaku industri dalam menyusun kebijakan, menarik investasi, dan mengembangkan inovasi teknologi.

Namun, siapa sangka, Indonesia justru memiliki potensi jelantah terbaik di dunia yang bisa dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan baku energi terbarukan, seperti Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Hal ini diungkapkan oleh Ketua Asosiasi Pengumpul Jelantah untuk Energi Baru Terbarukan Indonesia (APJETI), Matias Tumanggor, dalam Workshop Rantai Pasok Minyak Jelantah Berkelanjutan untuk SAF yang digelar di Gedung BJ Habibie, Jakarta, Rabu, 16 April 2025, seperti dilansir dari laman resmi BRIN.

Menurut Matias, kualitas jelantah Indonesia menempati peringkat pertama dunia berkat bahan bakunya yang sebagian besar berasal dari minyak nabati, yang digunakan oleh sektor hotel, restoran, dan kafe di dalam negeri. “Karena mengikuti asas halal, 95% bahan yang digunakan berasal dari minyak nabati. Ini juga yang diakui oleh mitra luar negeri,” ujarnya.

Sayangnya, meskipun potensinya sangat besar, pemanfaatan jelantah di dalam negeri masih minim. Sebagian besar jelantah hanya dimanfaatkan untuk produk lokal seperti lilin dan sabun. Padahal bahan ini bisa menjadi komoditas strategis untuk bahan bakar ramah lingkungan. APJETI sendiri telah menginisiasi pengumpulan jelantah sejak 2010. Semakin hari, produksi maupun kesadaran masyarakat terus meningkat.

Matias menyoroti absennya regulasi nasional yang mengatur secara khusus tentang tata kelola minyak jelantah. Ini menyebabkan kegiatan pengumpulan masih dianggap ilegal atau menyalahgunakan bahan limbah. Padahal pengelolaan yang baik berpotensi menyelamatkan lingkungan sekaligus menjadi sumber energi bersih.

“Kami ingin dilibatkan dalam penyusunan regulasi karena ini menyangkut kesehatan, lingkungan, dan masa depan energi,” katanya.

Matias menjelaskan bahwa pengumpulan jelantah dilakukan dari berbagai sektor, mulai dari rumah tangga (melalui bank sampah atau sistem door-to-door), usaha makanan-minuman seperti hotel dan restoran, hingga UMKM, kantin, pedagang kaki lima, serta industri pertambangan. Bahkan, mereka juga menangani limbah penggorengan dari gorengan hingga kerupuk kadaluarsa.

Namun begitu, tantangan yang dihadapi tidak sedikit. Mulai dari tidak adanya kepastian pemanfaatan dalam negeri, belum adanya pembinaan kepada pelaku usaha kecil, hingga masih maraknya pengumpulan oleh pihak yang tidak terorganisir secara legal.

Untuk menjawab tantangan tersebut, APJETI telah menyiapkan sejumlah strategi: mendorong lahirnya pelaku usaha teredukasi dari desa hingga provinsi, melakukan sosialisasi masif ke masyarakat, bekerja sama dengan komunitas dan organisasi lokal, serta menggandeng BUMDes dan pemerintah daerah dalam memperluas wilayah pengumpulan hingga ke pelosok desa.

Workshop ini digelar oleh BRIN melalui Pusat Riset Sistem Produksi Berkelanjutan dan Penilaian Daur Hidup (PRSPBPDH), bekerja sama dengan PT Noovoleum Indonesia Investama, dengan pendekatan analisis Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Melalui kegiatan ini, diharapkan lahir sinergi antara pemangku kepentingan untuk membangun rantai pasok minyak jelantah yang berkelanjutan dan efisien. Dengan begitu, jelantah bukan lagi sekadar limbah, melainkan peluang besar dalam mendorong transisi energi Indonesia menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.***",http://bertuahpos.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Potensi-minyak-jelantah-untuk-energi-terbarukan.jpeg,N,,2025-04-19 11:57:27.549401

This now means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

During the course of 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This year alone, in 2025, over 600,000 litres of SAF with a 30% blend are expected to be used at the Airbus Mirabel site resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 400 metric tons.

Benoît Schultz, CEO Airbus Canada said, “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

In 2024, 18% of Airbus global fuel mix for the year was SAF. That’s more than 16 million litres of neat SAF. Alongside this, 75% of our aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, representing also the importance our customers are placing on decarbonisation.

Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping. Airbus Canada has the ambition to deliver SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025. SAF has been used in A220 aircraft delivered from our A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is over 1.5 million square feet and includes, among others, a pre-final assembly line (pre-FAL), two final assembly lines (FAL), a customer response centre (CRC), a flight and integration test centre (FITC), and a brand new delivery centre. Over 3,500 Airbus employees work at this location.

U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits.
“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said.","Research from The Nature Conservancy found current clean energy tax credits, if kept in place through 2032 would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa.

Some folks fear the tax credits will be slashed by congressional leaders as they stare down hefty budget cuts and eye Biden-era environmental policies, but advocates of the clean energy credits say they are essential to reaching American energy dominance.

The study looked at clean energy tax credits impacting transportation, power generation, industry and buildings. Those categories comprise sectors from renewable vehicle fuels, to carbon sequestration, to home solar installations and electric vehicles.

Amber Markham, director of external affairs and climate for The Nature Conservancy, said most of these tax credits were established with bipartisan support, but are under attack by Republican officials because they were extended by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

“Rather than just lumping them all together and throwing them out, because somehow it seems like it’s an environmental thing … we need to really, take not a sledgehammer approach, but a scalpel approach, and go in and look at each of them and their impact and what makes the most sense to keep and support.”

According to the study, the tax credits in the power category, followed by the industry category, account for the greatest share of annual economic value added to Iowa.

Markham said cutting the tax credits now would be like “pulling the rug out from under” the individuals, business owners and industries that have already invested in this technology with the expectation of the tax credits.

Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this is true for ethanol facilities in Iowa, which he said have invested “tens of millions of dollars” to be able to receive 45z tax credits for manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel.

“That is why we’re fighting so hard to push back against the people who (want to) rip it out,” Shaw said. “These facilities made good faith investments based on the law of the land.”

Conversely, opponents of the carbon pipeline projects in Iowa are gathering signatures on a petition, specifically urging Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to cut the 45Q tax credits, which incentivize the carbon sequestration pipelines.

IRFA and other commodity groups associated with the ethanol industry have been pushing for final guidance on the 45z program, which Shaw said would said is “the best tool” to “maximize the Midwest contribution to American energy dominance.”

A comment period for 45z guidance closed April 10. Shaw said the association asked for a long term extension of the program and for the inclusion of the climate smart agriculture practices. He said the climate smart agriculture practices program would help the ethanol facilities meet the low emission standards it needs to qualify for 45z, and it would allow farmers to compete in a global market by quantifying the carbon impacts of regenerative farming practices.

Shaw said it seems like the president doesn’t care about the impacts these tax credits have on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but he should care about the economic benefits they represent to the country.

“If you want to get to American energy dominance, this is a tool that’s right here, in law, that can be implemented aggressively, that will achieve your American energy dominance goals,” Shaw said, speaking specifically about 45z.

Another study, released by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, found that residential energy prices in the U.S. would increase by nearly 7% in 2026 if the tax credits were done away with.

Markham with TNC said renewable energy needs to be in the mix to meet American energy demand, which is expected to increase by at least 2% each year in 2025 and 2026.

“We know that more energy is needed across our nation, so it’s not an either or, it’s an all of the above approach that we need to be taking,” Markham said.

U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits. Miller-Meeks testified in favor of the credits, in the House Ways and Means Committee, urging her colleagues to develop an “any of the above” strategy to meet energy demands.

“Our energy sector faces significant challenges that demand bold action,” Miller-Meeks said.

She noted the Inflation Reduction Act of the previous administration created some “important energy tax credits that are already driving transformative investments across the U.S. energy sector.”

Miller-Meeks, along with 20 other Republican lawmakers wrote to the House Ways and Means Committee Chair, Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, asking that any changes to energy tax credits be done in a “pragmatic fashion” without “undoing” programs that are already promoting energy innovation and lowering utility costs.

Markham said the environmental group was grateful for the support of the Iowa representative.

“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said.

The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a budget resolution April 10, just before leaving for a spring recess, that will allow both chambers to work on a reconciliation package upon their return. Per the adopted resolution, Congress must make $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 19:57:01.090305

Let’s not sugar-coat it. Decarbonising aviation is like retrofitting a B777 mid-flight. With IATA pledging net zero by 2050 and passengers increasingly judging airlines by their sustainability credentials, we all know the target. The question is how to get there while keeping fleets profitable, passengers happy, and regulators at bay.

There are five main aviation decarbonisation levers in play. Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and realities. None will work alone. But together, they form the foundation for the sector’s transformation.

Here’s how it breaks down for those of us who live and breathe aviation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Ready-Now Solution

SAF is the most immediate decarbonisation lever available. Drop-in compatible, no need to redesign engines or build new aircraft. It reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 80 percent. The catch is supply and price. Production volumes are low and prices are high, but ReFuelEU mandates are creating a new market dynamic.

Hemp is emerging as an unexpected but serious SAF feedstock. It grows fast, thrives on marginal land, and delivers high oil yields for conversion. Some airports are already evaluating local SAF loops using hemp grown on-site. It’s not science fiction, it’s supply chain resilience.

Electrification: Ideal for Short-Haul, Not Quite There for Long-Haul

Electric aircraft are progressing fast, but energy density remains the bottleneck. They will soon serve short regional routes, offering zero-emission alternatives where infrastructure allows. The potential impact on noise and air quality is massive, especially for airports near urban centres.

However, don’t bet the long-haul strategy on batteries just yet. The technology curve is steep and promising, but physics still matters. Expect hybrid electric systems to play a bridging role in the near term.

Hydrogen: Huge Promise, Huge Infrastructure Challenge

Hydrogen propulsion is a gamechanger in theory. It delivers high energy per kilogram and emits only water. In practice, it requires entirely new aircraft designs and airport infrastructure. From cryogenic storage to fuelling logistics, it is a ground-up rebuild.

Still, OEMs like Airbus are putting real capital into hydrogen concepts. If renewables power the hydrogen production, the emissions savings are unbeatable. But the commercial rollout is likely closer to 2040 than 2030.

Operational Efficiencies: The Underrated Powerhouse

This is the decarbonisation lever with the most immediate impact and the least risk. Better flight planning, optimised climb and descent profiles, single-engine taxiing, and improved ATC coordination all reduce emissions without touching the aircraft design.

New data platforms are enhancing operational decisions in real time. One approach is to use predictive analytics and AI-driven dashboards to constantly identify fuel-saving opportunities. Think fewer delays, less holding, and smarter routings. It is a win for emissions, passengers, and the bottom line.

Carbon Removals: The Necessary Clean-Up Crew

Even in the most optimistic scenario, residual emissions will remain. This is where carbon removal enters the flight path. The key is using removal rather than avoidance. Nature-based solutions like hemp carbon capture can sequester emissions and lock them into biomass and infrastructure materials.

Passengers are starting to expect credible offsetting options. The challenge is to integrate removals seamlessly into their experience without compromising trust or transparency. Platforms now exist to embed this into the booking flow and loyalty systems, offering verifiable removals without greenwashing.

Pulling It Together: From Aspirational to Operational Aviation Decarbonisation Levers

These aviation decarbonisation levers are not hypothetical. They are deployable today in varying degrees. The trick is in combining them strategically. Think SAF adoption supported by data-driven operational efficiency. Think hydrogen development paired with airport infrastructure planning. Think real-time carbon removal embedded into customer engagement.

At Tao Climate, we support this integrated approach. Through tools that enhance operational performance, provide access to scalable SAF feedstock, and build trust in carbon removals, we help aviation stakeholders align with both climate targets and commercial realities.

There is no silver bullet. But there is a clear flight path to net zero. With collaboration, smart investment, and a willingness to innovate, the industry can continue to connect the world without overheating it.

One Last Thought

Decarbonisation is not a marketing exercise. It is a systems challenge that rewards precision and punishes delay. By leveraging these aviation decarbonisation levers in the right order, aviation can lead on climate—not just comply.

The flight would also demonstrate their existing Smart-X technology that lets pilots know if they are about to take off or land on a taxiway or if there won't be enough runway to land safely.

Both systems are available as software upgrades on aircraft equipped with Honeywell's popular enhanced ground proximity warning systems, or EGPWS.

SURF-A warned the pilots repeatedly with aural and visual signals about ""Traffic on Runway"" when it detected the King Air sitting at the end of the runway.

The scenario simulates how the system might have provided additional reaction time in situations like the February 2023 incident, in which a FedEx Boeing 767 cargo plane nearly landed on top of a Southwest Boeing 737 attempting to take off from the same runway in Austin.

This scenario is much like the incident from January 2023 when a Delta 737 had to slam on its brakes after an American Airlines jet crossed the runway from which it was trying to take off.

SURF-A is also designed to alert a landing plane if an aircraft is crossing the runway.

It could help prevent incidents like the Southwest Airlines flight that narrowly avoided colliding with a private jet crossing the runway as it descended to land at Midway Airport in Chicago in February.

The system, already on the market, alerted pilots when they tried to take off from and land on a taxiway.

For decades, commercial aviation symbolized human innovation, freedom, and global connectivity. Yet in a warming world, it now also symbolizes a pressing climate dilemma. The global airline industry is responsible for nearly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions and up to 5% when non-CO₂ effects such as contrails are included. As climate urgency intensifies, public and regulatory scrutiny of aviation’s environmental footprint has grown—forcing the sector into a new era of accountability, innovation, and transformation.

Boeing, one of the world’s largest aerospace manufacturers, is leading a pivotal shift toward sustainability alongside airlines, fuel suppliers, and governments. From investing billions in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to pioneering hydrogen and electric aircraft, the aviation industry is entering a critical phase of decarbonization.

Boeing’s Vision for a Decarbonized Future

In 2021, Boeing announced an ambitious goal: to ensure all its commercial aircraft are capable of flying on 100% SAF by 2030. This commitment places Boeing at the heart of aviation’s energy transition. With programs spanning aircraft efficiency, SAF compatibility, lifecycle emissions tracking, and supply chain sustainability, Boeing’s role is multifaceted.

1. 100% SAF Certification by 2030

Sustainable aviation fuel is the most immediate way for airlines to reduce carbon emissions. SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. However, it currently comprises less than 1% of global jet fuel use.

Boeing is working with regulators like the FAA and ICAO to certify its entire fleet—including the 737 MAX, 787 Dreamliner, and 777X—for 100% SAF operations. The 2021 test flight of a 777 Freighter running solely on SAF marked a milestone, signaling not only technical feasibility but also Boeing’s resolve.

To support SAF scale-up, Boeing has invested in partnerships with SAF producers including SkyNRG, World Energy, and Neste. These collaborations aim to reduce SAF costs and expand supply in key markets like the U.S., Netherlands, Singapore, and UAE.

The aviation sector is witnessing a substantial shift towards sustainability, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) taking center stage as a solution to reduce carbon emissions. In North America, the U.S. is advancing its production capabilities, while Canada is laying down a supportive policy framework. Despite these efforts, challenges such as policy intricacies, investment shortfalls, and trade tensions lie ahead.

U.S.: Scaling Up Production with Strategic Investments

Infrastructure Developments

SAF infrastructure in the U.S. has undergone significant growth. As reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, SAF production has surged from 2,000 barrels per day in 2020 to 19,000 barrels per day in 2023, with expectations to hit 51,000 barrels per day by 2025. This increase is largely due to the integration with renewable diesel facilities, where the U.S. holds a leading position globally.

Key investments in SAF projects by the U.S. Department of Energy include:

Calumet’s Montana Facility: Receiving a conditional $1.44 billion loan guarantee, this plant is set to produce 315 million gallons of biofuels yearly, with a major share being SAF.

Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 Project in South Dakota: Supported by a $1.46 billion loan guarantee, this facility will be the first to convert corn starch to SAF at a commercial scale, targeting 55 million gallons yearly.

Facilities such as World Energy’s Paramount in California and Marathon’s Dickinson in North Dakota also contribute to SAF output alongside renewable diesel.

The U.S. SAF market is poised for significant growth, projected to escalate from $0.86 billion in 2024 to $6.97 billion by 2030, as per a MarketsandMarkets analysis. This momentum is fueled by environmental concerns, government policies, and successful SAF trials, such as United Airlines' 100% SAF commercial flight.

Policy and the SAF Grand Challenge

With the SAF Grand Challenge, the U.S. aims to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet the projected aviation fuel demand. Current production levels fall short, with less than 100 million gallons produced annually, representing less than 0.1% of the country's jet fuel consumption.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, offering a $1.25-$1.75 per gallon benefit to SAF producers. However, concerns about long-term subsidy stability, especially amid political shifts, pose risks to investment.

Companies like United Airlines, JetBlue, and Delta have inked major SAF supply contracts, while Airbus and Boeing are channeling investments into technologies such as alcohol-to-jet and Fischer-Tropsch.

Canada: Building a Base for Future Expansion

Production and Import Initiatives

Canada currently lacks commercial SAF production but is making moves toward change. Air Canada has engaged with Neste to acquire 77.6 million liters (20.5 million gallons) of SAF, marking Canada's first SAF import. Deliveries have commenced at the Port of Vancouver, with access to Vancouver International Airport.

The Canadian government has pledged over CAD 11 million for clean fuel projects, fostering early-stage facilities to transform forest biomass, waste oils, and municipal waste into low-carbon fuels.

While Canadian specifics are not elaborated in the MarketsandMarkets forecast, North America is positioned for rapid expansion, with the global SAF market anticipated to climb from $1.1 billion in 2023 to $16.8 billion by 2030, heavily driven by U.S. strides.

Policy Challenges and Market Dynamics

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) demand lower carbon fuel intensity, establishing a compliance market that could entice SAF producers. However, SAF production costs are significantly higher than renewable diesel. To counter this, the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (C-SAF) advocates for:

Extending the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit to SAF facilities

Price assurance via Contracts for Difference (CfD)

Joint public-private investments targeting regional SAF hubs

These strategies mirror the successful models for hydrogen and renewable electricity in Canada.

Growth Obstacles

Despite policy efforts, Canadian SAF development faces significant challenges:

Higher Costs: Without U.S.-like subsidies, Canadian SAF costs remain significantly higher than Jet A fuel prices.

Reluctance from Investors: Funds are diverted to U.S. projects with better incentives.

Logistical Gaps: Lack of established systems for feedstock collection and SAF blending.

Impact of U.S.-Canada Trade Issues on Biofuels

In March 2025, the U.S. imposed a 10% tariff on Canadian biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel. While SAF wasn't explicitly mentioned, these tariffs affect feedstock markets and investor confidence.

Trade tensions could hinder emerging SAF supply chains in North America. Many Canadian SAF projects depend on U.S. Midwest feedstock imports. These trade barriers add risk, potentially stalling biorefinery investments.

Industry leaders from both nations emphasize the need for cross-border cooperation to maintain cohesive climate-oriented energy markets. Without aligned incentives and trade facilitation, Canada's production may lag, while the U.S. confronts policy unpredictability.

Assessing the SAF Landscape in North America

SAF is vital for achieving aviation sector decarbonization in both the U.S. and Canada. Nonetheless, production is still in early stages, hampered by infrastructural, cost, and policy uncertainties. The U.S. has advanced through government incentives and commercial collaborations yet hasn't met its ambitious SAF Grand Challenge targets. Meanwhile, Canada is setting the groundwork with policies and imports but requires substantial investments to transition from consumption to production.

For North America to lead globally in SAF, a cohesive regional strategy is crucial, involving technology deployment, feedstock coordination, stable incentives, and trade policy alignment. The forthcoming five years will determine if SAF evolves from a limited alternative to a sustainable aviation cornerstone across the continent.",https://usa-works.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/North-Americas-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Efforts-Challenges-and-Growth.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 16:56:51.795103

The SAF flight and new Eco-Skies Alliance participants are among the latest accomplishments towards United’s goal to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets.","United Airlines became the first commercial carrier in aviation history to fly an aircraft full of passengers using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“United continues to lead from the front when it comes to climate change action,” said United CEO Scott Kirby in a statement. “Today’s SAF flight is not only a significant milestone for efforts to decarbonize our industry, but when combined with the surge in commitments to produce and purchase alternative fuels, we’re demonstrating the scalable and impactful way companies can join together and play a role in addressing the biggest challenge of our lifetimes.”

The demonstration flight, which departed with more than 100 passengers from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport and landed at Washington, D.C.’s Reagan National Airport will be on a new United 737 MAX 8 and use 500 gallons of SAF in one engine and the same amount of conventional jet fuel in the other engine to further prove there are no operational differences between the two.

SAF is an alternative fuel made with non-petroleum feedstocks and has the potential to deliver the performance of petroleum-based jet fuel but with a fraction of its carbon footprint. Airlines are currently only permitted to use a maximum of 50% SAF on board. The SAF used on the flight is drop-in ready and compatible with existing aircraft fleets.

United operated this flight in partnership with Boeing, CFM International, Virent, a subsidiary of Marathon, and World Energy, a commercial SAF producer.

United’s Eco-Skies Alliance program was launched in April 2021 and has contributed toward the purchase of more than 7 million gallons of SAF this year alone. With its nearly 80% GHG emissions reductions on a lifecycle basis compared to conventional jet fuel, this is enough SAF to eliminate approximately 66,000 metric tons of GHG emissions or enough to fly passengers more than 460 million miles. The program has nearly 30 participants including companies like DHL Global Forwarding, HP Inc., and Nike.

The SAF flight and new Eco-Skies Alliance participants are among the latest accomplishments towards United’s goal to be 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions 100% by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets.

In a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group, the Army is making regular use of the recently certified fuel.

SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable sources.

Its use is primarily driven by the need for security of fuel supplies through lower reliance on conventional fuels.

The refueling at RAAF Base East Sale demonstrated the Australian Defence Force’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation-fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.

Certified for defense use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fueled by blended SAF at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a blend of SAF.

Colonel Brenton Mellor, HQ Aviation Command’s director of aviation-capability management, said the Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Mellor said. “Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence. The stopover by the Chinook at East Sale is an important milestone for the use of SAF across [the Australian Defence Force], and Army Aviation looks forward to greater availability of synthetic aviation turbine fuels.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_abf19dadd34142e9a20bace7469d9ead~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_558,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/80995f_abf19dadd34142e9a20bace7469d9ead~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-04-18 15:56:30.134931

However, the path forward is complex, shaped by policy dynamics, investment gaps, and emerging trade disputes.

United States: Production Acceleration Backed by Investment and Policy

Capacity and Infrastructure Expansion

The United States has significantly expanded its SAF infrastructure. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), SAF production has increased from 2,000 barrels per day in 2020 to 19,000 barrels per day in 2023, with projections reaching 51,000 barrels per day by 2025. These gains are primarily attributed to co-processing at renewable diesel facilities, an area where the U.S. leads globally.

The U.S. Department of Energy has made notable investments in next-generation SAF projects:

Calumet’s Montana Facility: With a conditional $1.44 billion loan guarantee, this plant aims to produce 315 million gallons of biofuels annually, with SAF comprising a significant share.

Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 Project in South Dakota: This facility received a $1.46 billion loan guarantee and will become the first commercial-scale operation converting corn starch to SAF, aiming for 55 million gallons annually.

Additional contributors include World Energy’s Paramount facility in California and Marathon’s Dickinson plant in North Dakota, both of which support SAF production alongside renewable diesel.

According to a MarketsandMarkets forecast, the U.S. SAF market is expected to grow from $0.86 billion in 2024 to $6.97 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.8%. This expansion is driven by rising environmental concerns, supportive government policies, and successful demonstrations of SAF integration—such as United Airlines’ use of 100% SAF on a commercial flight.

Policy Support and the SAF Grand Challenge

The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge targets the production of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050—covering 100% of projected U.S. aviation fuel demand. Current production, however, remains below 100 million gallons annually, less than 0.1% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption.

To meet these targets, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, offering a $1.25-$1.75/gallon incentive for SAF producers. However, uncertainty around long-term subsidies—especially under shifting federal administrations—casts doubt over capital investments.

United Airlines, JetBlue, and Delta have made significant SAF offtake agreements, while Airbus and Boeing are investing in SAF pathways, including alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and Fischer-Tropsch technologies.

Canada: Establishing a Foundation Amid Global Competition

Domestic Production and Imports

Canada currently lacks commercial SAF production. However, recent developments signal a strategic shift. In late 2024, Air Canada signed a deal with Neste for 77.6 million liters (20.5 million gallons) of SAF—the first time SAF has been imported for use in Canada. Deliveries began at the Port of Vancouver, with pipeline access to Vancouver International Airport.

Additionally, the Canadian government committed more than CAD 11 million to clean fuel projects, supporting early-stage SAF facilities that convert forest biomass, waste oils, and municipal waste into low-carbon fuels.

While specific Canadian projections are not detailed in MarketsandMarkets’ global outlook, North America as a whole is poised for rapid growth. The global SAF market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2023 to $16.8 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 47.7%—with the United States driving much of that expansion.

Policy and Market Mechanisms

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), which require a reduction in carbon intensity of fuels, create a national compliance market that could attract SAF producers. However, SAF remains too costly compared to renewable diesel. To bridge this gap, industry coalitions such as the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (C-SAF) are advocating for:

Extension of the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit to SAF facilities

Price guarantees through Contracts for Difference (CfD)

Public-private investment partnerships for regional SAF hubs

These recommendations echo the success of hydrogen and renewable electricity investment frameworks in Canada.

Barriers to Growth

Despite policy momentum, Canadian SAF development faces hurdles:

Cost disadvantage: Without U.S.-style subsidies, Canadian SAF costs remain 3–5x higher than Jet A fuel.

Investor hesitancy: Capital flight to U.S. projects offering more generous incentives.

Supply chain gaps: Lack of established logistics for feedstock aggregation and SAF blending.

U.S.-Canada Trade Tensions Threaten Cross-Border Biofuels Supply

In March 2025, the U.S. enacted a 10% tariff on Canadian biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel. Though SAF is not directly named, the tariffs affect feedstock markets and investor confidence.

These trade actions could disrupt emerging North American SAF supply chains. For instance, several Canadian SAF proposals rely on feedstock imports from the U.S. Midwest. Trade friction increases risk premiums, potentially stalling biorefinery investment.

Industry leaders from both countries have urged for binational coordination to prevent fragmentation of climate-aligned energy markets. Without aligned SAF incentives and mutual trade facilitation, Canada may continue to lag in production while the U.S. grapples with policy volatility.

North America’s SAF Reality Check

SAF is essential for meeting aviation decarbonization targets in both the U.S. and Canada. However, production remains nascent, hindered by infrastructure gaps, high costs, and policy uncertainty. While the U.S. has made measurable gains through federal subsidies and commercial partnerships, it has not reached the scale required to meet its own SAF Grand Challenge goals. Canada, meanwhile, is establishing policy frameworks and initiating imports but needs bold investments to become a producer, not just a consumer.

For North America to become a global SAF leader, a harmonized regional strategy is needed—one that includes technology deployment, feedstock alignment, consistent incentives, and trade policy cooperation. The next five years will be critical in determining whether SAF remains a niche alternative or becomes the cornerstone of sustainable aviation on the continent.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250417-172018-ce1-An%20industrial-scale%20fuel%20refinery%20with%20multiple%20silver%20distillation%20towers%2C%20white%20storage%20tanks%2C%20and%20a%20complex%20network%20of%20metal%20pipes%20set%20against%20a%20clear%20blue%20sky..jpg,N,,2025-04-18 12:56:42.985287

This time, the world’s second-largest mining company is partnering with AMG Metals & Materials (AMG M&M) to explore the feasibility of setting up a large-scale low-carbon aluminium production facility in the country.

The proposed project includes plans for up to 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of primary aluminium and 2 mtpa of alumina, powered entirely by renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, backed by pumped hydro storage. In its first phase, the partners are evaluating the potential of establishing a 500,000 tonnes per annum aluminium smelter at a suitable location in India.

AMG M&M, promoted by the founders of clean energy company Greenko and AM Green, will work closely with Greenko to develop a firmed renewable energy infrastructure to support the project. Rio Tinto will focus on the supply of alumina and evaluate the most viable smelting technology for the initiative.

This move marks a significant shift towards sustainable materials production and aligns with Rio Tinto’s global strategy to expand its low-carbon aluminium portfolio. India, with its rapid industrial growth and increasing demand for decarbonised supply chains, presents a strategic opportunity for both players.

The project, once operational, could address growing global demand for low-emission aluminium across sectors like automotive, construction, and packaging. With aluminium consumption reaching 70 million tonnes globally, low-carbon aluminium is emerging as a preferred material for climate-conscious industries.

The development may require a total power input of 7–8 GW, supplied through 1.8–2.0 GW of wind and solar energy backed by hydro storage, and could demand an investment of $5–7 billion across phases.

Though India is the second-largest aluminium producer globally, it continues to rely heavily on bauxite imports. The plan includes sourcing bauxite from Rio Tinto’s Australian mines, potentially bridging India’s raw material gap and supporting exports of low-carbon aluminium to Europe.

The MoU is seen as a step towards enhancing India’s role in clean manufacturing while creating a foundation for reliable and cost-effective aluminium production backed by green energy.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/04/18/Rio-Tinto.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 11:57:10.333428

Pouyanne lauded China's commitment to both providing energy and decarbonizing its economy, emphasizing the crucial role of affordable energy transition.
In China, natural gas serves as a crucial transition energy resource, mitigating the intermittency of renewable energy sources and reducing emissions when used as a substitute for coal in electricity generation.
In addition to fossil fuels, TotalEnergies also sees significant opportunities in China's renewable energy sector as well.
He reiterated the goal of providing renewable energy at competitive prices to ensure a successful energy transition.","China's innovation capabilities in green technology are key to achieving an affordable, low-carbon economy and green energy transition, said Patrick Pouyanne, chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, adding that the US retreat from globalization presents a ""huge opportunity ""for strengthened energy cooperation between China and Europe.

""As a European company, I want to emphasize that while the United States may be retreating from the wave of globalization, climate change and energy transition have actually brought enormous opportunities for cooperation between China and Europe,"" said Pouyanne.

""We will jointly contribute to the success of the energy transition process and continue to collaborate with China, and TotalEnergies is fully committed to supporting China's balanced and strategic energy transition,"" he said.

Pouyanne lauded China's commitment to both providing energy and decarbonizing its economy, emphasizing the crucial role of affordable energy transition.

""TotalEnergies has a long-standing and stable relationship with China, with a history of over 40 years and extensive influence in numerous activities, while we also collaborate with Chinese energy companies and overseas subcontractors, utilizing Chinese products and solutions. China has excellent innovation capabilities in green technology, achieving a low-cost, low-carbon economy, which is crucial for customers. We need an affordable transition,"" Pouyanne said.

He added that the company's commitment to supplying LNG to meet China's growing gas demand has driven coal-to-gas switching and helps address peak power needs.

TotalEnergies announced in November the signing of a sales agreement with China Petroleum and Chemical Corp for the delivery of 2 million metric tons of LNG per year for 15 years, starting in 2028.

This came after the French energy provider announced a five-year extension of its sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) in September, on the delivery of 1.25 million tons of LNG per year to China until 2034, as the energy giant has been strengthening its long-term positions in the growing Chinese market, which is also the world's largest LNG importing country.

In China, natural gas serves as a crucial transition energy resource, mitigating the intermittency of renewable energy sources and reducing emissions when used as a substitute for coal in electricity generation.

In addition to fossil fuels, TotalEnergies also sees significant opportunities in China's renewable energy sector as well. Pouyanne outlined joint ventures with Chinese partners across the solar photovoltaic supply chain and agreements for offshore wind and onshore solar projects.

He reiterated the goal of providing renewable energy at competitive prices to ensure a successful energy transition. The company aims for renewables and low-carbon electricity to constitute 50 percent of its energy production and sales mix by 2050.

Pouyanne also pointed to a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) agreement in China to produce 230,000 tons of SAF annually from local waste, showcasing collaboration in circular economy solutions.

Pang Guanglian, vice-secretary general of the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation, said global production of sustainable aviation fuel stands at 3 million tons, with China already contributing over 1.1 million tons to this total.

""Looking ahead to 2030, global SAF demand is projected to surge beyond 18 million tons, and China is poised to account for at least half of this burgeoning market,"" he said.

""With the European Union already mandating a 2 percent SAF blending ratio and China soon to unveil its own ambitious policy, the stage is set for exponential growth in the sector.""",http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202504/18/6801ad54a3104d9fd156375d.jpeg,N,,2025-04-18 11:57:21.235474

It will supply the fuel to Japanese airline companies for a cleaner alternative to traditional air travel.

As Reuters reported, Cosmo planned production at its Osaka-based Sakai refinery earlier this year. It aimed to produce 30,000 kiloliters of sustainable aviation fuel per year by April.

The company supplies eco-friendly fuel to Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. This commitment is significant because it is Japan’s first domestically produced green fuel for airlines.

Cosmo’s sustainable fuel is made from cooking oil and is the first large-scale production of its kind in the country. The refiner worked with two other companies to produce it but declined to provide details about the fuel’s price and volume.

The news from Japan is encouraging worldwide because of how sustainable aviation fuel can reduce the harmful air pollution associated with traditional plane travel.

Watch now: Delta announces innovative plans for its next 100 years of air travel

The aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global energy pollution. This contribution impacts our planet’s overheating and leads to public health risks and extreme weather events.

In other parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel companies like LanzaJet have been creating millions of gallons of alternative fuel to offset air travel pollution. That company’s fuel is made from low-carbon intensity ethanol, or grain alcohol, using corn.

Another company, OXCCU, has been creating jet fuel from air pollution using renewable energy and a combination of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

As a traveler, you can look into flying on planes powered by sustainable fuel and support airlines’ efforts to embrace fuels with lower carbon impacts. For example, Delta has been actively working to use sustainable fuels to reduce the environmental impact of its flights.

Until sustainable fuel flights become more readily available, you can change the way you travel by embracing train travel and vacationing close to home in places that don’t require a flight.

Researchers will use the campaign to help improve tools to assist with collision avoidance and landing operations and ensure safe and efficient air taxi operations in various weather conditions.

For years, NASA has looked at how wind shaped by terrain, including buildings in urban areas, can affect new types of aircraft. The latest test, which is gathering data from a Joby Aviation demonstrator aircraft, looks at another kind of wind – that which is generated by the aircraft themselves.

Joby flew its air taxi demonstrator over NASA’s ground sensor array near the agency’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California producing air flow data. The Joby aircraft has six rotors that allow for vertical takeoffs and landings, and tilt to provide lift in flight. Researchers focused on the air pushed by the propellers, which rolls into turbulent, circular patterns of wind.

This rolling wind can affect the aircraft’s performance, especially when it’s close to the ground, as well as others flying in the vicinity and people on the ground. Such wind turbulence is difficult to measure, so NASA enhanced its sensors with a new type of lidar – a system that uses lasers to measure precise distances – and that can map out the shapes of wind features.

“The design of this new type of aircraft, paired with the NASA lidar technology during this study, warrants a better understanding of possible wind and turbulence effects that can influence safe and efficient flights,” said Grady Koch, lead for this research effort, from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

Data to Improve Aircraft Tracking

NASA also set up a second array of ground nodes including radar, cameras, and microphones in the same location as the sensors to provide additional data on the aircraft. These nodes will collect tracking data during routine flights for several months.

The agency will use the data gathered from these ground nodes to demonstrate the tracking capabilities and functions of its “distributed sensing” technology, which involves embedding multiple sensors in an area where aircraft are operating.

This technology will be important for future air taxi flights, especially those occurring in cities by tracking aircraft moving through traffic corridors and around landing zones. Distributed sensing has the potential to enhance collision avoidance systems, air traffic management, ground-based landing sensors, and more.

“Our early work on a distributed network of sensors, and through this study, gives us the opportunity to test new technologies that can someday assist in airspace monitoring and collision avoidance above cities,” said George Gorospe, lead for this effort from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.

Using this data from an experimental air taxi aircraft, NASA will further develop the technology needed to help create safer air taxi flights in high-traffic areas. Both of these efforts will benefit the companies working to bring air taxis and drones safely into the airspace.

The work is led by NASA’s Transformational Tools and Technologies and Convergent Aeronautics Solutions projects under the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts program in support of NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility mission.

In a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group, Army is making regular use of the recently certified fuel.

SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable sources. Its use is primarily driven by the need for security of fuel supplies through lower reliance on conventional fuels.

The refuelling at RAAF Base East Sale demonstrated the ADF’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.

Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a SAF blend.

HQ Aviation Command’s Director of Aviation Capability Management, Colonel Brenton Mellor, said Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.

“Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence.

The meeting brought together the ministers of petroleum, environment, and civil aviation to discuss the project, led by the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (ECHEM). The initiative is a cornerstone of the petroleum ministry’s strategy to promote sustainable development and reduce environmental impact.

Environment Minister Yasmine Fouad stressed the need for inter-ministerial coordination to accelerate Egypt’s shift toward renewable energy, particularly in aviation—a sector with significant environmental challenges.

She noted that SAF production is crucial for cutting the aviation industry’s carbon emissions. Fouad clarified that carbon credits generated from the project must comply with strict guidelines before being traded. The petroleum ministry has already set emission reduction goals as part of Egypt’s climate commitments and established rules for carbon credit sales.

Fouad also pointed to Egypt’s broader bioeconomy strategy, which encourages biofuel production as a green alternative. Used cooking oil, a primary ingredient for SAF, has been reclassified as a valuable resource following a study by the Waste Management Regulatory Agency.

Tamer Heikal, head of the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF), outlined the project’s $530 million business plan, confirming that feasibility studies—conducted with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)—are complete.

The facility, to be built on a 100,000-square-meter plot near Dekheila Port, will use advanced technology to convert used cooking oil into 120,000 tons of SAF per year. The fuel will cater to both local and international markets.

Heikal said the project is now in the process of selecting a technology provider and a construction firm, with backing from four global financial institutions. Efforts are also underway to secure long-term supply agreements for used cooking oil and to market the SAF to airlines worldwide.

Furthermore, a significant portion of the Bio-C content was concentrated within the distillation ranges of conventional gasoline, kerosene, and diesel, indicating its potential for future applications as a sustainable fuel. The calculated Bio-C content of aromatic components in the light fraction of WTPO was as high as 87%. The substantial Bio-C content positions these fractions of WTPO as potential feedstocks for biobased high-value-added chemicals as well as for further separation processes. In WTPO’s heavy fraction, the Bio-C contents of SARA separated components accounted for 68, 66, 4, and 6%, respectively. The Bio-C content of WTPO was mainly concentrated in olefins and aromatics with a low carbon number and low double bond equivalent.

From ambitious fleet expansions to bold turnarounds, these CEOs aren’t just steering planes—they’re redefining an industry.

Jaideep Mirchandani

The Strategic Playmaker at Sky One

When Sky One’s Group Chairman Jaideep Mirchandani submitted his bid to revive GoFirst in mid?2024, it wasn’t just a splashy headline—it was a calculated move to cement India’s place on the global MRO and leasing map. Mirchandani, whose UAE?headquartered Sky One specializes in charters, training, MRO, and asset trading, sees GoFirst as more than just an airline acquisition. He aims to leverage its prized airport slots and traffic rights to build a home?grown aviation services powerhouse.

Building India’s MRO and Training Backbone

At Air Expo Abu Dhabi 2024, Mirchandani unveiled a roadmap focused on sustainability and operational reform. His blueprint calls for scaling pilot training academies, expanding MRO hangars, and rolling out cargo?optimization tech—all designed to support India’s target of 20,000 new pilots by 2030. With women’s empowerment initiatives and green fuel partnerships already underway, Sky One under Mirchandani is charting a new course for the sector.

Vinay Dube

The New?Age Disruptor at Akasa Air

If disruption had a poster child, it would be Akasa Air’s co?founder and CEO Vinay Dube. An Indian?American at the helm of a carrier barely three years old, Dube has guided Akasa from zero to a fleet of 27 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, serving 27 destinations. By July 2025, that fleet will swell to 30 planes—despite earlier delivery delays.

Growth with Grit and Green Fuel

Passenger traffic under Dube’s watch has more than doubled, surging from 7.75 million in March 2024 to a staggering 16 million in March 2025. But growth isn’t Dube’s only metric. With 199 more planes on order, he envisions Akasa as one of the world’s 30 largest airlines by 2030, commanding up to 15% of India’s domestic market. Strategic hubs at Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports will further boost connectivity, while experiments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demonstrate his commitment to eco?friendly expansion.

Campbell Wilson

The Turnaround Maestro at Air India

When former Scoot and Singapore Airlines veteran Campbell Wilson took charge of Air India in June 2022, he inherited a legacy airline weighed down by aging jets, outdated cabins, and bruised customer sentiment. Fast?forward to 2025, and his blueprint for revival is unmistakable: 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing jets on order, refreshed lounges across New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and connection times slashed from 10 hours to just three for major transit routes.

Quality over Quantity… for Now

In February 2025, Wilson paused further Boeing orders, citing the need to clear existing backlog before committing to more aircraft—an uncommon move in an era of aggressive procurement. Meanwhile, his team is overhauling cabin interiors, standardizing in?flight entertainment, and rebranding the frequent?flyer program as the ‘Maharaja Club’. While the full payoff of these measures may take years, early indicators—higher on?time performance, rising transit volumes, and positive social?media buzz—suggest Wilson’s “drinking from a firehose” approach is yielding results.

Pieter Elbers

The Global Expansionist at IndiGo

Dutch aviation stalwart Pieter Elbers brought his KLM pedigree to IndiGo in 2022, and the low?cost leader has never looked back. Since his arrival, IndiGo has doubled its international footprint—from 20 overseas destinations to roughly 40 by March 31, 2025—while upping its route count from 60 to 120.

Charting New Horizons with A321XLR

Elbers isn’t stopping at just quantity; he’s targeting quality. With Airbus A321XLRs on the horizon, IndiGo plans to launch up to seven new long?haul routes—and even introduce business?class seating on select high?yield sectors. He envisions another 10 international additions in FY26, mapping out a network that rivals legacy carriers while keeping the “Rising A” ethos of simplicity and reliability intact.

These four CEOs share a common altitude: an unflinching focus on operational excellence coupled with a visionary zeal for growth and sustainability. Whether it’s building India’s MRO backbone, setting new benchmarks in fleet expansion, orchestrating a corporate revival, or weaving a global route tapestry, their collective efforts are not just lifting their airlines—they’re propelling India’s aviation narrative skyward. As FY25 takes flight, passengers, pilots, and the planet all stand to gain from their high?octane leadership.

In an industry already buffeted by global supply chain challenges, a high-stakes game of international tariffs and aircraft allocations is unfolding. As geopolitical tensions shape the aerospace market, Indian carriers could soon find themselves in a fortuitous position, thanks to unexpected shifts in aircraft deliveries stemming from U.S.-China trade sparring.

When Tariffs Alter Flight Routes

The Geopolitical Backdrop

In a dramatic twist, China recently instructed its airlines to halt the acquisition of Boeing aircraft. This move comes on the heels of U.S. tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump, which levied a hefty 145% duty on American-made aircraft. The intent behind these tariffs was to assert economic pressure, but the ripple effects have cascaded well beyond political corridors, directly impacting the global aerospace supply chain.

Shifting the Aircraft Allocation

Chinese airlines, who were expecting deliveries of approximately 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets and 11 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, now find themselves in a logistical limbo. With production slots at the Seattle final assembly line left unused, industry insiders predict that these “white tail” aircraft—originally built for Chinese carriers but not yet delivered—might soon be reallocated to Indian customers.

Indian Carriers at the Ready

A Beneficiary of Redirection

Indian carriers such as Air India Express and the relatively new entrant Akasa Airlines are in a prime position to capitalize on this unforeseen development. Last year, Air India Express acquired 25 white tail Boeing MAX jets, with another 25 jets scheduled for future delivery. The current scenario could allow these airlines to secure even more aircraft—either additional white tails or purpose-built models—to support their expanding fleet, mitigating the persistent challenges of aircraft acquisition amid global constraints.

Learning from History

This isn’t the first time Indian airlines have benefited from redirected aircraft. Recent history has shown similar occurrences, creating a precedent where white tail aircraft, manufactured to cater to specific foreign market demands, end up buoying domestic airline fleets. This not only ensures the continued growth of their services but also bolsters India's position in an increasingly competitive aviation sector.

The Boeing vs. Airbus Dynamic

Boeing's Strategic Dilemma

Boeing is now navigating choppy waters as the shift in aircraft orders creates uncertainty around its global production capacity. With Chinese orders in jeopardy, Boeing’s Seattle final assembly line earmarked for these deliveries risks remaining underutilized. This redirection does little to dent Boeing’s larger operations but signals a broader strategic reevaluation in the wake of volatile global trade policies.

Airbus Seizing the Opportunity

Not to be outdone, Airbus finds itself in a contrasting position. With two final assembly lines dedicated to the popular single-aisle A320 family, Airbus has the capacity to adjust more nimbly to the evolving market conditions. China, which might turn to Airbus for increased aircraft availability, could alter its stance, potentially increasing orders for the European manufacturer—a development that would ripple across the industry as alliances and supply agreements come under reconsideration.

Global Ripple Effects in the Aerospace Industry

A U.S.-Led Trade War in Full Flight

The ongoing tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have thrown the global aerospace industry into a state of flux. Planemakers, airlines, and suppliers are reassessing contracts worth billions as they navigate the fine line between honoring delivery commitments and absorbing new costs. The disruption extends to the critical supply chains for parts and equipment. For instance, if China halts the import of U.S. components for its domestic projects like the C919 program, the repercussions could stall or even derail these ventures entirely.

Leasing, Logistics, and Long-Term Strategies

Beyond delivery schedules, the uncertainty has prompted airlines to consider deferring aircraft deliveries rather than accepting additional duties and costs. Beijing is reportedly even brainstorming measures to assist airlines leasing Boeing jets that are now burdened with higher operational costs—a sign that government intervention might be on the horizon as both countries grapple with the fallout.

Conclusion: Turbulence or Opportunity?

As the aerospace industry is drawn deeper into the vortex of global trade disputes, the interplay between tariffs, aircraft allocation, and supply chain disruptions presents both challenges and opportunities. While Boeing might suffer temporary setbacks, Indian carriers stand to gain significantly from redirected aircraft. Meanwhile, Airbus’s robust production capacity may enable it to capture a larger share of the shifting market. With each stakeholder recalibrating its strategy, the skies may indeed be getting a little more crowded—but also a lot more interesting.

In this rapidly evolving high-stakes game, one thing is clear: the next chapter in global aviation will be written not just in the skies, but in the intricate balance of international trade and diplomacy.

In a vibrant twist to the aviation narrative, Akasa Air is charting an ambitious course toward future growth, blending rapid expansion with strategic challenges. With less than three years in operation, the low-cost airline has become a dynamic player in India’s aviation market, doubling its passenger traffic and setting its sights on new heights—even as Boeing delivery delays pose hurdles along the way.

Fleet Expansion: A Bold Vision Takes Flight

Akasa Air is on track to grow its fleet to 30 aircraft, with its 28th Boeing 737 MAX scheduled to join later this month. This expansion is not just about more planes in the sky; it's a commitment to meeting soaring passenger demand. The airline boasts firm orders for 226 aircraft from Boeing, signaling a robust future despite the current delivery setbacks. The ambitious fleet plan underscores the strategic vision of chief executive Vinay Dube and his dedicated team.

Overcoming Challenges: Boeing Delays and Regulatory Hurdles

The journey hasn't been without turbulence. Akasa Air's rapid growth has encountered an unexpected headwind—delivery delays from Boeing. These delays are largely attributed to enhanced regulatory scrutiny following a 2024 incident, where a cabin panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX aircraft blew out mid-flight. This heightened focus on safety has slowed down deliveries, with only around 65 of the 446 Boeing 737 MAX jets ordered by Indian carriers having been delivered to date. Boeing now aims to roll out two aircraft per month, a pace that, while steady, forces Akasa to sometimes ground pilots due to the inconsistency in fleet availability.

Financial Backing and Strategic Investment

In February, the airline secured $135 million in fresh capital—a robust financial boost that reinforces its aggressive expansion plans. The continued support of the Jhunjhunwala family, Akasa Air’s largest shareholder, exemplifies the strong confidence behind the airline’s vision. This investment surge ensures that operational hurdles, from fleet delivery gaps to pilot training interruptions, are met with prompt action and resourceful management.

Strategic Hubs: Navigating to Navi Mumbai and Jewar

Looking ahead, Akasa is gearing up to make a significant mark at two key airports in India—Navi Mumbai and Jewar. By the end of 2025, the carrier plans to station 5–7 aircraft at each location, with both airports expected to become central to its operational strategy. Dube has emphasized that being among the first tenants at these airports isn’t merely a logistical decision; it’s a strategic coup that will help define the airline’s identity in a competitive market. Interestingly, rival Air India Express is reportedly poised to expand its operations at these hubs as well, setting the stage for a dynamic rivalry that could spur further innovation and customer service excellence.

International Expansion: Charting New Global Routes

Beyond domestic success, international growth remains a core strategic pillar for Akasa Air. With flights already connecting 23 cities in India and five international destinations, the airline envisions a network that not only broadens its reach but also significantly boosts its profitability. Chief Executive Vinay Dube reiterates that venturing into international markets is both profitable and crucial for future sustainability. The airline’s rapid increase in passenger numbers—from 7.75 million in March 2024 to an impressive 16 million in March 2025—underscores the effectiveness of its expansion strategy and the burgeoning demand for its services.

A Dynamic Future in the Skies

As Akasa Air navigates the complex interplay between rapid growth and operational challenges, it stands as a testament to innovation in the aviation industry. Its ability to double passenger traffic, secure significant financial investments, and strategically position itself at upcoming major airports paints a picture of a company poised for long-term success. While Boeing delivery delays pose a temporary setback, Akasa’s forward-thinking approach suggests that these hurdles are just minor detours on a well-planned flight path towards industry leadership.

With its daring expansion plans and commitment to overcoming challenges, Akasa Air invites us to wonder: can this trailblazing airline redefine low-cost travel and set new benchmarks in aviation? Time will tell, but one thing is clear—the future of air travel in India is about to get a whole lot more exciting.

With Inputs from Business Standard

India’s largest carrier, IndiGo, is not just weathering global challenges—it’s setting a course for unprecedented growth despite the turbulence from worldwide tariff hikes. In a recent interaction with PTI, Chief Executive Pieter Elbers painted an upbeat picture of a carrier that remains undeterred by global price wars, aiming high in one of the world’s most promising domestic aviation markets. Let’s dive into the dynamic strategic vision that is steering IndiGo toward a horizon brimming with opportunities.

Resilience Amid Global Uncertainty

Navigating Global Tariff Wars

Global tariff hikes have recently sent ripples through international markets, but IndiGo’s management is steering clear of these headwinds. “Some of the more recent dynamics and the global scale are not changing any of our capacity expansion plans for next year,” said Pieter Elbers. The airline’s confidence underscores a deep belief that despite external pressures, strategic, long-term planning can weather even the roughest of economic storms. While acknowledging that a major economy such as India cannot be completely isolated from worldwide events, Elbers emphasizes that a transient “blip” in performance is no match for the robust trajectory set for the future.

Doubling the Fleet, Doubling the Vision

Ambition is at the heart of IndiGo’s strategy. With aspirations to double its size by the end of the decade, the airline is not only focused on maintaining its current market position but also on scaling up to meet both domestic and international challenges head-on. This ambitious roadmap reflects confidence and a commitment to long-term growth, irrespective of short-term market fluctuations.

Capitalizing on India’s Unmatched Domestic Market

The Power of a Big, Untapped Segment

India’s domestic aviation market remains a treasure trove of untapped potential. With thousands of cities and a burgeoning middle class, IndiGo sees a landscape ready to be transformed. Elbers pointedly noted that India’s enormous and competitively priced aviation sector, supported by relatively low average ticket costs, provides a fertile ground for expansion. This market dynamic not only fuels IndiGo’s growth engine but also positions the airline as a key player in bolstering India’s connectivity and economic development.

Competitive Edge in a Consolidating Market

While IndiGo enjoys a leading position, competition is fierce. The aviation duopoly in India, featuring formidable rivals like the Tata group, continues to drive innovation and efficiency. Elbers suggests that a globally competitive, large-scale airline elevates the entire aviation ecosystem in India. This consolidation, observed in various international markets, positions IndiGo at the nexus of increased market efficiency and improved customer service, ultimately benefiting the consumer.

Strategic Innovations and Industry Impacts

The “Missed Opportunity” of Parting Seats

During negotiations with international authorities, parting seats have become a contentious issue. Elbers highlighted that such arrangements represent a missed opportunity for Indian carriers. By sharing seats, foreign competitors often gain an unfair advantage, thereby limiting the growth prospects of domestic airlines. A strategic overhaul in such frameworks could empower IndiGo and its peers, reinforcing the broader narrative of Indian aviation autonomy and self-reliance.

Integration of Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) Capabilities

Beyond flying passengers, IndiGo is also leveraging its robust operational network to extend its services globally. The airline’s practice of sending aircraft overseas for maintenance, repair, and overhaul underscores the employment potential of the aviation sector. With over 60,000 employees today, IndiGo’s growth signifies not just a corporate ambition but a substantial boost to the overall job market and ancillary industries tied to aviation.

Embracing Market Forces for Sustainable Growth

Flexibility in Fare Structures

The conversation around domestic airfares has been a hot topic, with voices calling for regulation. However, Elbers remains firm on trusting market mechanisms, emphasizing that fares adjust naturally with seasonality. Events like the Kumbh Mela may see a surge in costs due to heightened demand, but this dynamic pricing is a testament to the robust, competitive nature of India’s aviation market. Allowing the market to balance supply and demand reinforces IndiGo’s commitment to sustainable growth and consumer-centric policies.

Expanding Through Infrastructure Advancements

Infrastructure development continues to be a cornerstone of IndiGo’s expansion blueprint. With new airports emerging—such as the upcoming facility in Navi Mumbai—the carrier is set to enhance both its operational efficiency and regional connectivity. This dual approach of upgrading existing facilities while venturing into new territories ensures that IndiGo remains at the forefront of India’s aviation revolution.

Conclusion: A Flight Path to the Future

In the rapidly evolving world of aviation, IndiGo is charting an ambitious flight path that balances resilience with innovative growth—even in the face of global tariff-induced challenges. As worldwide price wars present transient hurdles, the airline’s long-term focus on capacity expansion, market dominance, and strategic consolidation remains unshaken. With an eye on both immediate opportunities and a vision that spans the decade ahead, IndiGo is not just flying—it’s soaring toward a future that promises robust economic and social impact for India.

The journey ahead is filled with challenges and triumphs alike, but one thing is clear: IndiGo is ready to lead the way in redefining India’s aviation narrative, setting a benchmark for competitors and inspiring a nation on the move.",https://www.100knots.com/airlines_dashboard/uploads/blog/1744945564.webp,N,,2025-04-18 08:56:36.942900

Any effort to loosen restrictions on U.S. and Russian airlines would increase pressure for similar steps from European carriers.","BRUSSELS — Moscow is lobbying for the U.S. to open its skies to Russian airlines as part of a ceasefire deal with Ukraine.

But there's a big problem with that scheme — the EU isn't keen, and without Europe on board it won't be easy for Russian carriers to fly to the United States.

“First, EU sanctions stand firm against Russia, which includes a ban on Russian airlines flying over EU airspace,” said a European Commission official speaking on condition of anonymity.

Beyond the political decisions on sanctions, the EU official also pointed to “major safety and security issues” related to the possible reopening of EU airspace to Russian jets, as “it is not known if Russian air operators and air traffic services have been properly maintained over the past three years, putting the airworthiness of the Russian fleet seriously in question.”

Since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russian airlines have been banned from landing in and flying over the territory of the EU and the U.S., as well as from accessing spare parts for aircraft from Western manufacturers such as Boeing or Airbus. The Kremlin retaliated by blocking Western airlines from its airspace.

“As a result, there’s a high probability that bogus parts are being installed in aircraft operating within the Russian domestic market,” said Sander Starreveld, director of the SIG Aviation consultancy, warning of risks to aviation safety. “Allowing these aircraft to operate commercially in Europe is not only unsafe but also risks introducing counterfeit parts into the Union.”

Unsafe skies

In practical terms, reopening Europe's skies to Russian airlines such as flag carrier Aeroflot would also place a massive burden on the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The agency would be required to ensure that Russian airplanes have a level of safety that is equivalent with aircraft already operating in the EU, Starreveld said. “This process takes time, especially considering the workload involved.”

In addition to safety and certification issues, many Russian planes may never be able to land in Europe again because they are actually not Russian but were stolen from plane lessors after the invasion.

“Some aircraft could be seized immediately upon landing in Europe due to Russia’s unilateral decision to nationalize leased aircraft,” Starreveld said, noting that “there are massive debts owed to Western leasing companies, and I expect they’ll try to recover as many assets as possible.”

Pressure from Moscow

Despite such problems, Russia is demanding the resumption of direct flights to the U.S. as part of any agreement to stop fighting. Such a step “should be a consequence of the lifting of sanctions on Aeroflot,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on April 11.

“The Americans considered it, [but] so far we have not seen any reciprocal step,” the Russian minister said.

On Wednesday, Russia reportedly asked Washington to be allowed to buy planes built by U.S. manufacturer Boeing and to pay for them with Russian state assets that have been frozen since the start of the war, provided a ceasefire is reached.

So far the Trump administration has not lifted any sanctions on Russia, but some signals are giving the Kremlin hope.

In March, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, Robert Agee, publicly called for the lifting of sanctions in the aviation sector.

“Russia has a huge fleet of Western planes, mostly Boeing. We believe we should provide spare parts and technical support for them, so we will try to have these sanctions lifted,” Agee told the Russian business daily RBC, adding: “This is less a business wish and more of a humanitarian necessity, as ordinary citizens suffer primarily from this.""

Any effort to loosen restrictions on U.S. and Russian airlines would increase pressure for similar steps from European carriers. The latter have long complained about the extra cost of avoiding Russia's vast airspace when flying to Asia, which has given an advantage to Chinese airlines.

Despite these competitive concerns, Brussels is wary of entering into negotiations with Moscow over access to its airspace, in part because of the unsafe nature of Russian skies.

The Commission official called the security of Russian airspace “problematic,” citing the Christmas Day crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines flight — allegedly after being struck by a Russian air defense missile — that prompted EASA to advise airlines to avoid all of western Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for the crash but stopped short of saying Russia had been responsible.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/16/12926648-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-04-18 04:56:35.440032

Marubeni Corporation (hereinafter, “Marubeni”), Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, “JAL”), Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (hereinafter, “Mitsubishi Chemical”), Chugoku Lumber Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, “Chugoku Lumber”), Boeing Japan KK (hereinafter, “Boeing”) and Obayashi Corporation (hereinafter, “Obayashi”), have concluded a memorandum of understanding on a preliminary business feasibility study for the manufacture and sale of sustainable aviation fuel (hereinafter, “SAF”), bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel from domestic forest residues (hereinafter, the “Pre-Feasibility Study”).

Background and Significance

Japan is among the leading countries in terms of forest resources worldwide, with high expectations that thinning materials and residues generated from wood usage can be leveraged as sustainable raw materials due to their potential volume. In addition, the use of wood in large-scale wooden buildings, including high-rise buildings, is currently in the spotlight from the perspective of resource circulation, and it is expected that there will be an increase in opportunities to utilize the residues generated as a result of such initiatives.

Overview of the Pre-Feasibility Study

This study envisions the potential use of manufacturing technology developed by Licella*1 to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues, which will then be reformed and refined for use in making products such as SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel towards the building of a domestic supply chain. This supply will leverage a model involving local consumption of locally produced products. Specifically, the study will assess the economic viability of the business; consider the raw material supply and processing system as well as the manufacturing process; and evaluate product logistics and effectiveness in reducing CO2 emissions. The study is scheduled to run until December 2025 and aims to commercialize the product around 2030 depending on the progress of the study.

Future prospects

The companies participating in this study will pool their knowledge and expertise towards the realization of the domestic production of sustainable products; the creation of new industries utilizing forest resources throughout Japan; and the promotion of regional revitalization. In addition, by promoting the circulation of forest resources, they will aim to contribute to the resolution of Japan’s forestry challenges, including carbon fixation*2, water resource conservation*3, and disaster prevention.

Last Updated on:

A COMAC C919 rolls to the end of the runway at Shanghai Pudong, a clean-lined aircraft shimmering in the haze as ground crews finish their checks. In the background, a row of pristine Boeing 737 MAX aircraft sit unused, tails high, their future uncertain. The scene is an imagined one, but it’s reflective of reality: China is changing course, and one of the largest aerospace shifts in modern history is underway. Reports indicate that Beijing has instructed its domestic airlines to stop ordering U.S.-built passenger aircraft. The move is not simply an act of retaliation or trade war chess—it’s a signpost for a deeper transformation in industrial strategy, technological sovereignty, and geopolitical signaling.

The gravitational pull of China’s aviation market is well understood by insiders. In 2019, Chinese airlines carried over 660 million passengers, representing more than a trillion revenue passenger kilometers annually. The pandemic cratered that growth curve, but the rebound was swift. Today, passenger-kilometer totals are nearing pre-pandemic levels, with industry expectations of doubling by 2030, although I’m skeptical of that given the continued dominance of high-speed rail and Tencent Meeting (the Chinese alternative to Zoom). When Boeing or Airbus plan production lines, they do so with one eye on Toulouse and Everett, and the other fixed on Beijing.

For decades, China’s air fleets have been filled with Boeing and Airbus metal. The split was once relatively even, with Boeing holding the advantage in narrow-body workhorses and long-haul widebodies alike. ​Over the past decade, Boeing’s relationship with Chinese airlines has experienced a significant decline. Between 2015 and 2020, Boeing delivered 668 aircraft to Chinese customers, reflecting a robust partnership. However, from 2020 through March 2025, deliveries plummeted to just 109 aircraft. This downturn is attributed to a combination of factors, including the global grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, and China’s increasing investment in its domestic aerospace industry.

Europe’s Airbus built an assembly line in Tianjin in 2009, deepened its political relationships, and has increasingly become the go-to supplier. Boeing, meanwhile, has seen its position erode not just due to politics but performance—and that matters.

There’s also the emergence of China’s COMAC as a credible manufacturer. The ARJ21 was a slow, clunky, underperforming regional jet built with dated technology and endless delays. But it served its purpose as a systems integration testbed, and it taught COMAC and its suppliers how to build, certify, and support a commercial airliner. That experience paved the way for the C919, China’s first real attempt at challenging the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 head-on. The aircraft uses modern avionics and Western engines, but it is designed, assembled, and delivered under Chinese control. More importantly, it’s being pushed into the fleet not as a speculative startup venture, but with the full weight of the Chinese state behind it.

At the same time, Boeing has been disassembling the institutional knowledge and engineering culture that once made it the world’s most respected airplane manufacturer. Its embrace of the Jack Welch school of quarterly capitalism from General Electric—cutting R&D, gutting engineering oversight, offshoring everything it could, prioritizing stock buybacks—has been well documented. The 737 MAX crisis wasn’t a one-off error. It was a systemic failure, the inevitable result of decades of eroding technical competence in favor of financial optimization. I have written about the substitution of engineers with finance MBAs, the rise of offshoring for supplier risk dilution rather than integration quality, and the near-total loss of executive leadership that understood the physics of flight. Boeing didn’t lose China. It gave it away.

There’s more. While Airbus capitalized on the vacuum, delivering hundreds of A320neo-family jets and securing long-term relationships, China has been working toward something even more consequential: not just supplier diversification, but supplier replacement. The orders for 300 C919s by China’s Big Three airlines are not just a vote of confidence—they are a domestic industrial policy in action. COMAC is ramping production capacity to 150–200 units per year by the end of the decade. That’s a credible share of China’s expected single-aisle fleet expansion, and a strategic firewall against geopolitical shocks. China doesn’t want to be held hostage to U.S. export policy or EU regulatory leverage. It wants to own the full stack of its own aviation future. And as a reminder, turbine metals are mostly processed in China, and it’s just put export licenses on them targeted at the USA and hence Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

The implications go far beyond fleet planning. The global aerospace sector relies on tight regulatory harmonization, overlapping supply chains, and decades of accumulated interoperability. COMAC’s current products use CFM engines and Western avionics, but the trend is toward domestic substitution where possible. In parallel, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is working to establish its own certification regime that will rival the FAA or EASA—not just for internal purposes, but for export into Belt and Road countries with aligned regulatory standards. This is how parallel systems emerge: not through confrontation, but through quiet, persistent divergence.

And here’s the part that too few in Washington or Chicago seem to grasp: this isn’t a tantrum. It’s a transition. China is not rejecting Boeing as a company. It’s rejecting a model—a model of industrial dependency, of outsourced accountability, of financialized engineering. Airbus should not be resting easy. It may be the preferred Western supplier today, but its future status is conditional. COMAC’s widebody program, the CR929, has been bumpy, especially after Russia’s withdrawal. But the ambition remains. China is not interested in winning on price alone. It wants the prestige, leverage, and supply chain sovereignty that come from fielding a full domestic aviation stack.

This realignment isn’t purely about China either. It sends shockwaves through the entire global aviation system. Boeing’s declining relevance in the world’s most important growth market puts its long-term production planning at risk. Suppliers who depend on Boeing for orders are being squeezed. And smaller states that used to play Boeing and Airbus off one another may soon find they have a third axis in COMAC—one that comes with financing, infrastructure packages, and political ties. India, Turkey, and other regional powers are watching closely. Aviation is one of the last high-tech sectors with massive barriers to entry. China is demonstrating how to scale those walls.

And Trump’s tariffs hit Boeing hard. The 25% markup on imported aluminum, so essential to airframes, when the USA imports most of their supply of the metal, means Boeing is both losing customers and seeing increasing costs. This isn’t a good combination from a survival perspective.

In late 2024, China’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) granted type certification to the RX4E, a four-seat electric aircraft developed by the Liaoning General Aviation Academy. This marked the first time an electric aircraft received such certification under China’s CCAR-23 regulations, which govern airworthiness for normal category aircraft. In fact, it’s the first commercial electric airplane certified to carry passengers globally. The RX4E, powered by a 70 kWh lithium battery and capable of a 1.5-hour flight time, is designed for applications like pilot training, sightseeing, and aerial photography. This certification signifies China’s commitment to advancing electric aviation technology and integrating it into its broader transportation infrastructure. China has also certified an evtol from eHang for passenger flights, which while mostly a dead end flex, is still more than the west has done. It’s also rapidly expanding production of sustainable aviation fuel.

All of this raises hard questions for the United States. The pivot to quarterly earnings as the primary metric of corporate health has gutted its industrial base across sectors, from semiconductors to power transformers to commercial aircraft. Boeing could have remained a globally dominant aerospace manufacturer, but instead financially engineered its way to failing aircraft and exclusion from the biggest growing market in the world. Meanwhile, China built plants, trained engineers, certified aircraft, and now fields its own jets, while keeping most of its citizens on the ground in low-carbon, high-speed rail. It’s a lesson in what happens when a nation-state takes industry, climate change and transportation seriously.

The future of aviation is becoming multipolar. Boeing, once a synonym for safe, efficient, and globally interoperable air travel, is now a full stop in one of the most critical markets on Earth and a question mark elsewhere. Airbus is the near-term winner, but it plays under the long shadow of strategic substitution. COMAC isn’t ready to compete globally yet—but it doesn’t have to. It only has to dominate at home, and in doing so, redefine what the next era of aviation looks like.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-17-2025-09_17_34-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-04-18 04:56:44.783329

In 1980, the United States accounted for 44% of global wheat exports; today that total is just 11%. Over the last five years, the US corn export market share has fallen to a record-low 31%, down from a high of above 80% in the 1970s. Once the leader in soybean exports, the United States has watched Brazil supplant it; it now accounts for only 27% of soybean shipments compared to 80% five decades ago.

And now, amid another trade war with China, the world’s largest soybean importer, and other countries that import US ag products, that downward spiral may continue.

In March, US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, his social-media platform, that US agricultural producers should prepare to “start making a lot of agricultural products to be sold INSIDE of the United States.”

Sounds simple enough, but it flies in the face of reality. The United States currently exports about 25% of the grain it produces each year, including more than half of its soybeans. Even with domestic industrial uses of grain steadily climbing in recent years, the percentage of bulk ag commodities (corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, pulses and cotton) shipped overseas has been trending higher, including a 22% increase last year, the biggest year-on-year increase in more than a decade.

Finding additional domestic demand drivers for grains and oilseeds is possible, perhaps with increased biofuel use such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel or some other industrial use that has yet to be discovered. But even in a best-case scenario, it takes years for these new markets to develop.

One of the long-term impacts of trade wars, even after they end, is a loss of reputation as a reliable supplier on the global market, something that can take years to repair. Countries that have no choice but to rely on grain imports to feed their people not only consider cost and quality, but they also want stable trading partners that deliver products in a consistent manner year by year, without disruption.

It took the United States a long time to be viewed as a reliable supplier following grain embargoes in the 1970s and 80s. The same thing has happened with soybean exports following the US-China trade war from 2018 to 2020, as China has shifted to Brazil as its primary soybean supplier.

The recent trade wars have not only fueled more conflict and mistrust between the world’s two major economic powers, but relationships between the United States and its allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico have been strained by Trump’s freewheeling tariff policies.

Once the dust settles in this latest trade war, perhaps another era of free trade will begin. Until then, with tariffs and counter-tariffs flying back and forth between countries, what we’re witnessing is a race to the bottom with mostly losers and very few winners.",https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/ext/resources/Articles/2025/04April/041725_Trade-war-impacting-Ag_Lead.jpg?height=635&t=1744891277&width=1200,N,,2025-04-18 07:56:14.417392
