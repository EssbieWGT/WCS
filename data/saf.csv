Speaking by video in a speech to a UN Climate Summit, President Xi also announced 2035 targets to expand China’s installed capacity of wind and solar power to 3,600 gigawatts – more than six times 2020 levels – and to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30%.

The new emissions reduction goal will form China’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. NDCs are national climate action plans presented by each country under the agreement, and are required to be updated every five years with increasingly higher ambition. In 2021, China set targets to reach peak GHG emissions prior to 2030, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2060.

China produces more greenhouse gases than any other country, accounting for nearly 30% of GHG emissions in 2024, more than double that of 2nd place U.S.

While marking China’s first absolute emissions reduction goal, the new target falls well below those of other large countries, such as recent 2035 NDCs announced by Australia, with a goal to reduce GHG emissions by 62% – 70%, or Switzerland’s 65% target.

Several climate-focused groups expressed disappointment at China’s new targets, calling for greater ambition from the world’s top emitter.

Climate Action Tracker’s (CAT) China lead Norah Zhang said:

“Given China is both the world’s largest emitter and a leader in clean energy, this new target could have been a major opportunity for China to help the world reach the global climate goals. However, our calculations show the new target is unlikely to further drive down emissions, as China is already set to achieve this target with the policies it has in place. This is disappointing as China has the opportunity to decarbonise faster.“

CAT also pointed out that President Xi’s renewable energy goal was also less ambitious than current policy scenarios already suggest.

In the late days of the prior administration, U.S. President Biden also announced a goal to reduce GHG emissions by 61% – 66% by 2035, although President Trump has worked extensively to undo the Biden administration’s climate initiatives, and this week at the U.N called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Speaking the day after Trump’s remarks, Xi said:

“Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of the time. While some countries are acting against it, the international community should stay focused on the right direction, remain unwavering in confidence, unremitting in actions and unrelenting in intensity, and push for formulation and delivery on NDCs, with a view to providing more positive energy to the cooperation on global climate governance.”

In addition to the emissions reduction and clean energy targets, Xi also outlined a series of other climate-related 2035 goals, including scaling up total forest stock volume to over 24 billion cubic meters, making new energy vehicles the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles, and expanding the National Carbon Emissions Trading Market to cover major high-emission sectors.

Xi said:

“These targets represent China’s best efforts based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Meeting these targets requires both painstaking efforts by China itself and a supportive and open international environment. We have the resolve and confidence to deliver on our commitments.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/China-Xi3.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 16:56:38.020149

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I’m Sean Severson, CEO and founder of Water Tower Research. Great to have our next presenter and company today, Gevo. Doctor, are you Mr. or Doctor? Which one? Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. Dr. Pat Gruber. We’re going to talk a little bit about Gevo, and then we’re going to leave plenty of time for Q&A on this one as well. There’s a lot going on at the company, but we’ll go through an overview of the company, and then we’ll get to some Q&A. Pat? Great. Glad to see you. We’re a company that’s focused on a new generation of fuels, the renewable resource-based jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel fuel. They’re made from renewable carbon, and they can achieve even carbon-negative footprints. Here’s the thing about them, is that to produce them on a cash cost basis, they can be economical.

I’ll do this to take a little bit about our story, where we’re at today, and how we look as a business and how to think about us. Our team is extremely well experienced. We’ll get this slide later, but we’re people who’ve been there, done it, built plants before, operated stuff before. We represent a team that’s one of the very few in the world who’s ever done agricultural stuff crossed over into the petrochemical world. If you were familiar with NatureWorks PLA, the clear plastic stuff that’s biodegradable, usually a clear cup, green band, and a whole bunch of products. I invented that stuff when I was young. I led the teams to build the plants. The people who worked with me then, we were all at Cargill and built stuff. We all came over here, and we wanted to do something bigger. We wanted to do hydrocarbons.

The cheapest way to make hydrocarbons from renewables is to take carbohydrates through alcohols. Alcohols like ethanol and other alcohols like isobutanol, and then do the chemistry, copying it straight out of the petrochemical industry of what’s done, and turn it into these hydrocarbon fuels. Put it all together and do it with a low carbon footprint. Our team is well experienced. When you look at our filings, you’re going to see four groupings of businesses. One of them is Gevo Fuels. Gevo Fuels encompasses ethanol. We recently bought an ethanol plant up in North Dakota. We’re using 16% of 12% of the capacity. One of the obvious things we’re going to want to do is you should buy more CO2 and put down that hole and get value for it. There’s a couple of ways that we can capture the value for it.

The wetland look is, it’s in a call to Broom Creek Formation. This is a cartoon of it. To give you the idea, it’s, like I said, been operating for three years. Interestingly enough, the people who built this, the plant was owned by Red Trail Energy. Red Trail Energy is a co-op. It’s owned by a farmer group who are both oilmen and farmers, mixtures of people. They said, I think it’s going to be important someday, and they built themselves a beautiful well. As I said, today, this is the only one that’s available on a public company basis, only three in the United States. They’re moving more in the future, and we’ll see this. Carbon capture is important. It creates a product that is called a CDR, Carbon Dioxide Removal credit. That’s the voluntary carbon they sell. That’s an important concept, the CDR.

It has nothing to do with the 45Z tax credit, nothing. They’re completely separate and unrelated. CDR. A ton goes down. You want to buy a ton? We’ll sell it to you. It’s going to cost you some money. One of the things is that we use corn as a raw material. This is important. You see my friend Corny, the cob out of here. He says, I’m not that kind of corn. We have to remind people that the kind of corn that we use in process is not the kind you eat. It is not in a bag, on a cob, or in a can. That ain’t the kind of corn we’re talking about here. We’re doing the 99% of the corn that’s grown. People forget this, particularly the enviros who like to talk about this food. You’re going to take food off a plate.

Sorry, that’s not true. Not food off a plate. In fact, you’re capturing all of the protein value and selling it in the marketplace. It’s important. To understand, say, a ton of corn, one third goes to ethanol, one third of a ton makes protein, which goes to the food chain, and the other third is carbon dioxide. Guess what? We’re doing a couple of interesting things here. We got ethanol as a product, and then we have protein as a product. Awesome. That’s a good co-product value. Now we’re talking about monetizing, creating value for that other third of a ton of raw material. That’s pretty important economically. You’ll see it. Where analysts get us wrong is not understanding how this business system works, because it is a little bit complicated. Corn comes in, and we’re going to take the corn, grind it up, mill it.

We’re going to use the carbohydrate portion and use that to make ethanol. We will take the protein and separate it, sell it to the food chain, take the corn oil, and sell it to the food chain. We are going to generate carbon, which we can sell to a voluntary carbon market, or we can also generate tax credits and other things. These things show up as co-products, so they are sometimes caught into costs. Cost of goods sold are offsets to our cost of goods, cost of production. You will not necessarily see it on a revenue line. If someone asked me that earlier today, where do we see this stuff? The carbon values come up as costs. The tax credits come up as a cost improvement.

Lazy analysts, when you come across them, they will have taken the corn and done some kind of a calculation. We are talking about SAF or jet fuel. They will talk about it, and they will do some kind of a calculation based on energy. They are lazy. They need to look at it in detail, do the economics, and actually come up with it, and you get the right answers. Low carbon corn, you sell out the co-products, you get low carbon ethanol. Cool, that is the business we have today that we are operating. It is profitable. In the future, we see ATJ, Alcohol-to-Jet, and I will explain that. No, I will get to it. Stand by. There are two markets that we are addressing in carbon markets.

Think of them as these are markets where we are actually selling dollars per ton, is the right way to think of this. Completely separate than a 45Z tax credit. The low carbon fuels markets like LCFS in California, Oregon, Canada, Washington, and others, you can get $50 to $200 a ton. That is better than zero. You can do CDRs. Those are $100 to $300 a ton. It does not take a genius to figure out that we should be focused on selling CDRs. That is what you saw last week in an announcement. We saw we sold something in NASDAQ. We are developing this marketplace. The reason you have not seen lots of these things is no one has handed us this sell this water. We just bought this plant and it closed on Peck in February.

Now we are taking it to the marketplace and seeing voluntary carbon markets as CDRs. An important concept. You can always bundle the carbon with a gallon of ethanol and sell it into California. That is this other market, generally at a lower price. Your EBITDA question is now being answered. The adjusted EBITDA potential, we are currently at a run rate of about $20 million a year. This is, if you look at this, this is what we think is going to happen in the near future. Right now, the light blue is going to be the tax credit market where we’re able to monetize tax credits. Another 45Z, big beautiful bill that runs through the end of 2029. It’s important. When you look at that light blue and you see the growth there, that’s pretty darn certain.

There’s another blue shadow up above there that’s about the voluntary carbon markets. That’s where we are putting a lot of emphasis to make happen, because we think that ultimately is where the world needs to go. Ethanol generates money, and then R&D. Where it has the negative in the column that has a negative above it, that’s our expenses. GSA, R&D, you know, the SARD or whatever you want to call it. It’s our burn. That’s what that is. That’s the subtraction. We’re saying that, yeah, we can see our way in very short order to $40 million a year with that. Very shortly after that, $110 million. This was without building an ATJ plant. This is just optimizing how we sell more carbon, optimize more ethanol. Optimizing more ethanol makes more CO2. It makes more protein.

It’s easier to understand what we’re trying to achieve here on this site. You did good by buying this site and by bringing in the carbon expertise on how to monetize sites. We are not a company that needs to raise money anytime soon from an operations standpoint. We have $127 million of cash equivalent on the balance sheet. We’re in pretty good shape. We like that. That’s an important point. As one looks at it, people say, gosh, it’s going to take you a long time to get an ATJ plant. You know what? We can be profitable without an ATJ plant. Get out of it. Get over it. We’re going to go build this ATJ plant. We’re going to lots of them. It’s a question of how we do it, but we don’t have to live and die by that sword. That’s a good place to be.

Now remember, we’re a company with hundreds of patents, huge amount of technology, fully designed plant, and we’re out to get that thing financed and built. That is our main growth platform is ATJ. I’ll tell you that story now. Fundamentals, first of all, this is information from the Energy Information Agency. U.S. jet fuel demand is increasing. In fact, it’s increasing all around the world. The demand for gasoline products is decreasing generally. Refineries are shutting down in the U.S. In a barrel of oil, there’s only 9% of jet fuel. The question is, where is the rest of the jet fuel going to come from in the future? What’s going to be the shortfall? How do you fill it? In 2035, it’ll be 2.3, 2.4 billion gallons a year of a shortfall.

The only alternative is going to be to import that. There will be some adjustments that refineries can do, but you can’t turn diesel fuel into jet fuel. It doesn’t work. It’s going to be sharp. This is actually the reason people want to see SAF, renewable jet fuel, be commercialized. Without it, absolutely, the price is going up for them. Our jet, this chart is a scatter chart of oil price versus jet fuel price. On the lower left, you see us overlapping heavily with the blue dots. That’s the cash cost of production of our stuff. It’s competitive with jet fuel. You know what that means? We can actually deliver a product on the same basis, assuming my plant was paid for, as that petrochemical company. Same basis, even though ours is made for renewable and has a zero carbon footprint. That’s pretty cool.

Which do you think people would buy if those two things are available? The challenge, of course, is that we have to pay off new capital. That’s the reality. Theirs is paid off. We have to pay for it. That’s what all those co-product values come and do. Those tax credits can help us. That’s how that works. It’s pretty interesting. Half thought is up to the right, and power and liquids thing is even off the chart. There are all kinds of technical reasons for it. If anyone ever wants to know, get me. I’ll tell you about it. Why that one is economically challenged. It’s about the use of energy. If one of these builds that ATJ plant up in North Dakota, adjacent and connected to our plant, we’d expect to add about $150 million of uplift to that site. $150 million of EBITDA uplift to that site.

Based upon the contracts we currently have in place, where we’re selling jet fuel as jet fuel, nothing’s done. It’s just jet fuel going to the market, and we sell the carbon to that same channel that passed the airlines. You hear what I said? We’re separating the carbon value from the jet value. The airline buys jet. The person who actually cares about carbon downstream, the buyer of airline seats, buys carbon. That’s incredibly important. Rather than trying to jam it all into the airline, make it where they can’t afford anything. Very important point. Okay? That’s what it looks like. That’s pretty exciting. That 2.3 billion gallons, if you’re doing simple math, we did 30 million gallon plants. That requires 70 new plants by 2035. That sounds like a lot of plants. Could we do that? Yeah, 70 is a lot. You know what?

That’s a targetable environment to deploy. These little markers are representing the 180 ethanol plants in the U.S. Lots and lots of opportunity. Let’s go back here and point out, for each site, it generates about $100 million of EBITDA outside of our boundary, or $30 million of regional impact, 400 to 600 jobs. It’s important for rural economic development. Remember, ethanol demand is predicted to be flat or declining. Corn production without increasing land is increasing. We’re going to be a billion bushels more corn produced this year than people expected. What happens? What do you do? You’ve got to find new uses. Energy security is a huge issue. The Trump administration wants energy security, wants economical hydrocarbon products. Guess what? We check all the boxes. That’s what we do. It’s pretty interesting. We can evade carbon too and satisfy that need for the marketplace.

A little bit different game. The executive order does specifically mention ethanol in the aviation field. That’s still different. What we’re doing over here, our puzzle pieces are saying you have to actually know a lot. You have to know how to do agriculture and processing and sell protein and sell to animals, sell, do the chemistry. You have to sell carbon. You have to sequester carbon. It’s actually a lot. When people ask, why don’t those big oil companies do it? They don’t have agriculture. Why don’t the agriculture companies do it? They don’t know how to do hydrocarbons. We do. This is what we’ve done for the last, me, 30 years. Now we’re at a point where the market seems to care about it. We can finally pin down the value in the marketplace and get on it. For instance, we’ll build ATJ plants. It’s a targetable environment.

We use, we’re going to call it Project North Star up there in North Dakota. Get that thing optimized, get it, get you improved the cash flow, and then we’ll build an ATJ plant, ATJ 30, and then we’ll cut and paste them. Now we’re going to have to build these things differently than doing a stick-built project finance. I don’t believe in that model. I don’t like that model. I think it makes everybody rich but us. What we’re going to do is build it in a factory in modules. We’re going to make modules in a factory, okay? Truck-sized modules that these modules can then be tested, validated, proven that they work. It de-risks them from an execution standpoint. The wells are, you know they work. We know the electronics work. We can put them on a ship.

In this case, we’ll ship them to Duluth, Minnesota, put them on a truck, and drive them over to North Dakota. That’ll sell them like Legos with more regional builders rather than having some giant lump sum turnkey EPC project. They’re doing that. That puts all the money in the EPC project guy’s hands, right? If we’re doing them in a factory, guess what? It’s a freaking factory. We can build more than one plant at once if we want. Our key task then is to continue to generate the cash flow, improve the cash flow up there in North Dakota, Project North Star, and expand capacity, expand, learn how to sell more carbon, learn how to sequester more. Carbon is important for enhanced oil recovery as well. There’s a demand up in the bucket for that. Cool.

We’re going to go figure that out too, because I don’t care who buys my CO2 as long as I get paid for it. I don’t care where it goes, right? All I care is what we make more money.

Unidentified speaker: You’ll lower it to what?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I have no idea how that’ll work, how they’ll account for it. We’ll do it as just a transfer. If you want to buy my tons, pay me.

Unidentified speaker: Okay, sounds good.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: You get more oil out of it.

Unidentified speaker: Yeah.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah.

Unidentified speaker: I don’t know that.

All right. Joseph, when you want to build these ATJ plant designs, do you consider whether to put them off in these areas?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: No, we don’t need to, because it’s just a drop-in fuel. Put it in the rail car and ship it to wherever. There’s a limit to a number of trips. These are true drop-ins. That’s one of the things about when I’m talking about hydrocarbons, literally drop-in products. It’s not a surprise. Techniques we’re using. Jet fuel is made this way in the petrochemical industry from old. It’s no surprise that it’s going to be straightforward. People talk about it as magic. This is one of the things that gets on my nerves in our industry. Ooh, I got the greatest special sauce. I call it bullshit. Sorry. It’s not. You can’t do things that are big with all this foofy stuff. It’s got to be stuff that’s tried and true and proven. That’s where we land. We just happen to have a, I don’t know, pragmatic point of view.

I’ll add it to the work. No kidding, what we’re going to do: grow our EBITDA, deploy the first plant, and that really comes down to how we’re going to finance that plant. That’s what it really is going to come down to. How do we make it reproducible? I’m not interested in being a one-trip pony. One plant, and that’s all we do. That’d be serious underachieving. That’s not what we want. Got to have a reproducible model to be deployed over and over and over again. That requires both the execution of how you build plants, but then the financing of those plants. That’s the topics all around the world. We do have projects around the world. We just don’t talk about them. Now, I could take questions.

Unidentified speaker: Just one question, Pat. If you look at the businesses that exist today and are now generating cash, if you unpack this a little bit for investors, you got the cash-generating businesses. Talk a little bit about those in the bar chart. What is the opportunity to develop and grow those? How should investors think about those, the R&D, the ethanol, the carbon, and then we can touch a bit on the SaaS.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, so what we’ll be doing is, remember we just took over this plant. The previous owners of the plant didn’t, that wasn’t in their wheelhouse to monetize carbon value. We come along, it’s an uplift of $60 million. Okay? That’s the time to do that. It was a non-trivial thing to do because you’ve got to get it all audited, validated, certified by people, and then insured. That’s what we did. That’s why other people haven’t done it yet. We’ve been the first to do this. We see that growing, and that’s pretty much certainty about how the system works by increasing the ethanol production incrementally and by how carbon exposure is calculated by the vehicle built. We see that. The next one, first just starting at the bottom of the chart of the things that are blue. The next one is about the CDRs.

That market is interesting because people have never been offered something where it’s like, look, there’s a meter. You can watch the tons go down the hole. It’s unequivocal. It’s not somebody planted a tree somewhere, and I hope it’s good. It went down the hole. It’s a carbon removal credit. So it’s a gold standard. That’s why Carolyn Romero certified it. That’s why NASDAQ bought it. That’s why. Yeah, it’s not pushing all around you, I’m not even going to deny it.

Unidentified speaker: I understand.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: You have to push everybody. I’m sure you covered every single person.

Unidentified speaker: Did you guys, you know, anyone that asked about me changing the name?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah.

Unidentified speaker: Okay.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I’ll leave that up to you guys.

Unidentified speaker: We will make it clear that we’re still trading under Gevo and GEVO. We are undergoing a transition to the new name.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I still use the company description that I have too.

Unidentified speaker: Which one did you choose?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, let me make sure that’s.

Unidentified speaker: Yes, that’s fine.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: That’s okay?

Unidentified speaker: Yeah.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: If I look.

Unidentified speaker: It’s a very short one. Yeah, it’s for him to announce.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, this one is.

Unidentified speaker: Okay.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I have a few questions, but I’ll jump in. Let’s just run with anything that comes up, yeah?

Unidentified speaker: Yeah, those ones we submitted.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah.

Unidentified speaker: We like those ones.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, I love it.

Unidentified speaker: All right, thank you, everyone. We’re going to get started with the next.

The fund, called Macquarie Green Energy Transition Solutions (MGETS), exceeded its original target after strong demand from investors. The money will support projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions and build a cleaner energy system.

More than 65% of the fund is already committed. Early investments target renewable energy storage, sustainable fuels, carbon capture, and electric transport systems. By backing both proven and emerging solutions, Macquarie shows that climate-focused investing is now central to its strategy.

Where the Billions Are Going

MGETS is designed to finance infrastructure and technology that reduces carbon. This includes battery energy storage, distributed renewable power, clean transportation, and sustainable fuels. It also covers carbon capture, recycling, and circular economy projects.

So far, the fund has backed 12 projects. These include Eku Energy, a UK-based battery storage platform; SkyNRG, a Dutch producer of sustainable aviation fuel; and Verkor, a French maker of EV batteries. These examples show the fund’s focus on areas where emissions are hardest to cut.

The fund also targets low-carbon technologies that are still developing, such as green hydrogen, carbon capture, and advanced batteries. These solutions are not yet scaled up, but early capital is needed to drive progress and lower costs.

Investing in these technologies carries risks. Costs are high, and technical barriers remain. But the long-term growth potential is strong. As countries and companies set net-zero targets, demand for these technologies will increase. Macquarie is positioning itself as a leader by supporting both current infrastructure and future innovations.

Key Features of the Fund

Here are some of the fund’s highlights:

Fund size: $3 billion

Focus: Energy transition projects

Sectors: Renewable power, grid upgrades, clean fuels, storage, and clean transport

Scope: Developed and emerging markets worldwide

Structure: Mix of equity and debt financing

Goal: Cut emissions and support net-zero pathways

Investors: Global institutions such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds

This flexible structure allows the fund to support both large-scale projects and smaller ventures that need growth funding.

The Investor Surge: Why Demand Exceeded Expectations

The strong demand for MGETS highlights how fast climate finance is growing. Pension funds, insurers, and sovereign wealth funds see the energy transition as both a duty and an opportunity. They can back low-carbon infrastructure while earning stable returns.

The fund also shows how investment is expanding beyond solar and wind. Macquarie is putting money into enablers of the transition, such as grid flexibility, carbon storage, and clean fuels.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts global energy investment will hit a record $3.3 trillion in 2025, led by clean energy technologies. Of this, $2.2 trillion will go to renewables, nuclear, and energy storage — about double the amount slated for fossil fuels. Solar power could attract $450 billion, while battery storage investment rises to around $66 billion.

According to the IEA, global clean energy investment could reach $4.5 trillion annually by 2030 if countries meet their climate goals. Funds like MGETS are meant to help close this gap.

Scaling Climate Impact: From Europe to the World

The launch of MGETS shows the scale of funding needed to meet climate targets. Private capital, alongside public funding, will be critical.

By committing $3 billion, Macquarie sets an example for other asset managers. The fund is also expected to attract co-investments and partnerships, expanding its impact far beyond its initial size.

Institutional Capital as a Climate Catalyst

Large investors are under pressure to align their portfolios with climate goals. They are looking for opportunities that combine stable returns with measurable impact. MGETS offers one way to do this.

Macquarie is not alone. BlackRock and Brookfield have also raised multi-billion-dollar energy transition funds. Together, these efforts show how finance is becoming a key driver of climate action.

Separately, a venture capital alliance overseeing $60 billion in assets has launched a $300 million fund to support climate-tech startups. Called the “All Aboard Coalition,” the fund aims to help firms scale from pilot to commercial stage.

It aims to close what’s known as the “valley of death” in clean technology. Backers include Breakthrough Energy, Khosla Ventures, and DCVC. This move comes amid a multi-year drop in climate-tech investments and seeks to restore funding momentum in the sector.

Opportunities vs. Risks: Navigating the Transition

The opportunities are clear. Demand for clean power, EVs, and smart grids will rise over the next decade. Technologies that reduce emissions will become more profitable as rules tighten and companies aim for net zero.

But there are risks. Some technologies are costly or unproven. Policy changes, such as shifts in subsidies or carbon pricing, can affect returns. Large projects also face hurdles with permits, supply chains, or local opposition. Climate risks such as extreme heat, flooding, or storms can also impact assets directly. Macquarie will need to manage these challenges carefully.

Early Momentum and Global Reach

Despite these risks, the fund has momentum. With over 65% already invested, Macquarie is moving fast. Current projects are based in the UK, France, and the Netherlands, but the fund plans to operate globally.

The name “Green Energy Transition Solutions” reflects its broad focus. It is not only about generating clean power but also about enabling systems that cut emissions across industries.

Looking Ahead: Funding the $4.5 Trillion Net-Zero Gap

The energy transition requires trillions of dollars in funding by 2050. This growth will continue, with more money flowing to energy storage, carbon capture, and clean transport.

Corporate net-zero pledges also create demand. Over 6,000 companies worldwide have set science-based climate targets. In 2023, companies with SBTi-approved climate targets made up 39% of global market value, rising to 41% in 2024. These businesses also grew faster than the wider economy, with market value increasing 16%, compared to 11% growth in global GDP.

This adds pressure on supply chains and energy providers to cut emissions. Financial players like Macquarie are stepping in to provide both funding and expertise.

Macquarie’s $3 billion fund is part of a much larger movement. To keep global warming to 1.5°C, clean energy investment must rise sharply over the next decade. Funds like MGETS can help connect technology developers, infrastructure operators, and investors.

The success of the fund will depend on two things: financial returns and real carbon reductions. If Macquarie delivers on both, it could attract more capital and inspire others to follow. That would speed up the world’s shift to a low-carbon economy.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2393182905.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:56:09.681144

The company confirmed that its Chief Executive Officer, Jimmy Samartzis, delivered a keynote address in front of key dignitaries, including Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the President of Kazakhstan, and Askhat Khasenov, Chairman and CEO of KMG. The announcement was made during New York Climate Week, marking a symbolic moment as both companies signed a major agreement to progress Kazakhstan’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project. This will also be the first time LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology will be deployed in the Central Asian region.

The collaboration between LanzaJet and KMG has already completed an extensive feasibility study, which assessed the potential for SAF production in the country. Building upon this, both parties have now agreed to move forward into the next crucial stage: the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) phase. During FEED, detailed technical, engineering, and financial solutions for the proposed facility will be developed. This stage will ensure the plant is optimally designed and economically viable, paving the way for its eventual construction and operation.

Kazakhstan, with its diverse and resource-rich economy, provides fertile ground for a project of this scale. Speaking about the potential impact, Jimmy Samartzis emphasized that Kazakhstan offers opportunities across agriculture, logistics, aviation, and the oil and gas industries, making it a strong hub for innovation in sustainable fuels. He added that the collaboration would not only help reduce aviation emissions but would also stimulate economic growth and enhance regional energy security.

Echoing these sentiments, KMG’s CEO Askhat Khasenov described the SAF initiative as a cornerstone project for the nation’s low-carbon strategy. He highlighted that this cooperation would strengthen bilateral ties, promote the use of advanced technologies, and stimulate the development of Kazakhstan’s biofuels market. Moreover, it is expected to bring lasting benefits such as improved environmental performance within aviation, a stronger transit position for the country, and alignment with international climate goals.

The agreement signifies more than just a technical milestone. It represents Kazakhstan’s strategic push towards becoming a leader in low-carbon energy solutions within Central Asia. As aviation continues to face mounting pressure to decarbonize, projects like this demonstrate tangible progress in addressing both regional and global demand for cleaner fuels.

With immediate work beginning on the FEED phase, the project is positioned to move quickly toward realization. Once operational, it is anticipated to meet the growing demand for SAF within Kazakhstan, which is projected to reach around 70,000 tonnes annually by 2030.

Energy Transition

SAF Funding | Cleared for Takeoff?

Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures recently unveiled a $150 million sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fund aimed at accelerating the adoption of low-carbon jet fuels. The initiative, which includes strategic investments from Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, seeks to address one of SAF’s biggest hurdles: cost competitiveness.

While U.S. producers benefit from production-side incentives like the 45Z, LCFS and the Renewable Fuel Standard, the absence of enforceable national blend mandates or buyer-side subsidies continues to limit market uptake. As a result, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. jet fuel consumption. Breakthrough’s SAF fund demonstrates some airlines’ willingness to support alternative fuels, creating demand signals that could broaden industry participation.

The fund is technology-agnostic but prioritizes technologies that can compete on cost with conventional jet fuel. It excludes fuels from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, which account for over 95% of the current U.S. SAF supply, due to concerns over feedstock limitations and scalability.

While certain synthetic SAF pathways offer higher potential revenue per gallon when supplemented by credits, they remain hampered by capital intensity and commercial immaturity. Still, new synthetic and alcohol-to-jet SAF projects are slated to come online later this decade, potentially expanding the market for emerging technologies supported by this fund (Figure 1).

The A330neo-based evolution of the combat-proven, aerial refuelling and transport aircraft A330 MRTT, will be equipped with both the hose-and-drogue, and a boom, as refuelling systems. Also included is the Airbus Medical Evacuation kit solution and will come in a VVIP cabin configuration.

The aircraft is scheduled to enter into military conversion at the A330 MRTT Centre in Getafe, Spain, in 2026, with final delivery to customer in 2029.

“Thailand’s selection of the A330 MRTT+ underlines the trust placed in this platform, while embracing the next evolution in efficiency, capability and sustainability. This natural evolution of the A330 MRTT, which will be a key asset for the Royal Thai Air Force operations, builds on its proven performance over the past years in service with nine customers all over the world, accumulating more than 340,000 flight hours,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Air Power at Airbus Defence and Space.

This strategic addition to the RTAF fleet marks a significant step in bolstering Thailand’s national defence, and enhancing its ability to respond effectively during crises, ensuring the safety and security of the Kingdom. The A330 MRTT+’s advanced capabilities will be instrumental in securing Thailand’s sovereignty, providing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR), and supporting Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions.

Launched at the 2024 Farnborough Airshow, the A330 MRTT+ introduces innovations from the A330-800 commercial airliner, including Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, optimised aerodynamics and wing-tips. These deliver up to 8% lower fuel burn and reduced noise. An increased maximum take-off weight of 242 tonnes (up from 233 tonnes) further extends range, increases fuel offload capacity, and enhances operational flexibility.

Retaining 95% airframe commonality with the current A330 MRTT fleet, the A330 MRTT+ ensures a common training process and access to a robust global maintenance network.

The A330 MRTT is cleared to refuel more than 25 aircraft types. Holding more than 90% of market share outside the US, the A330 MRTT has been ordered by Australia, Canada, France, NATO’s Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF), Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. To date a total of 85 aircraft have been ordered by 11 customers.

In parallel with this new order, Airbus will further strengthen its collaboration with Thai Aviation Industries (TAI). Both companies have signed an expanded Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to include in-country maintenance support for the RTAF’s A330 MRTT+. This expansion builds on the existing cooperation for the sustainment of C295 transport aircraft in Thailand.

The expanded MoU also marks an important step in Airbus’ long-term strategy to align with the Kingdom’s “Make in Thailand” policy. By expanding TAI’s scope of activities to include A330 MRTT+ maintenance and in-service support, Airbus will support the Royal Thai Armed Forces in increasing self-reliance for critical operational needs, while contributing to local capability building.

“Through our partnership with TAI, Airbus is committed to transferring skills, know-how, and technology to further develop aerospace capabilities in Thailand,” added Jean-Brice Dumont. “This expanded MoU with TAI ensures that the RTAF’s A330 MRTT+ will be maintained in-country, while also reinforcing our contribution to Thailand’s defence ecosystem and industrial growth.”",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102499/749880-uo01jnfhss-preview.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 11:57:56.239686

Thanks for talking through ag residue and carbon removal with me, but appreciate the time.","Agricultural byproducts like corn stover, wood chips, and soybean husks typically get left to decompose and release carbon dioxide. Don’t call them “waste” though; some farmers use these byproducts as field cover to improve soil health. And industry uses a fraction of this biomass as feedstock for valuable products like ethanol, electricity, and heat. Theoretically, it’s a vastly underutilized resource.

The problem is that agricultural residue is really hard to collect. The economics of gathering, sorting, processing, and refining are tough. On top of that, it makes for a crappy fuel. It’s low energy density and high carbon, compared to oil, for example.

So in what applications does agricultural residue make the most sense? And how do you economically collect the material at scale?

In this episode, Shayle talks to Peter Reinhardt, co-founder and CEO of Charm Industrial, a carbon removal startup that collects agricultural residue and refines it in the field into what it calls “bio-oil.” It then injects the bio-oil underground for sequestration. Together, Peter and Shayle discuss the use cases and collection of agricultural residue, covering topics like:

How the difficult economics of collecting and transporting biomass have killed centralized biomass projects, except in a few niche examples

Why Peter says the processing and densification are key to improving the economics

The tradeoffs between big, centralized processing facilities and Charm’s on-field mobile pyrolysis units

The case for using agricultural residue for applications where the carbon content matters, like iron-making, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal

What’s driving carbon removal buyers and what it takes to build trust with them

Shayle Kann: I’m Shayle Kann and this is Catalyst.

Peter Reinhardt: If you looked at, for example, at our woodchips that we process in Colorado where we’re getting in these forest fire prevention thinnings, if we were to stand there and look at it, you’d be like, this is pretty consistent material visually. It’s not like, oh, this is all over the place. But nonetheless, you can still get edge cases. You can get a rock that was randomly stuck in a branch or you can get people talk about a bale that had a handgun in it.

Shayle Kann: Coming up we’re talking ag residue, wood chips and carbon removal of Peter Reinhardt.

I am Shayle Kann. I invest in early stage companies at Energy Impact Partners. Welcome. So here’s the cycle. We humans grow crops. A lot of them because there are a lot of us, those crops contain carbon that has been sucked up from the atmosphere. Mostly they’re either consumed or burned to produce energy, but along the way a lot, really, a lot of them, parts of most of every plant that we grow actually are wasted, so to speak. There was a DOE study a couple of years ago that estimated the amount of ag residue alone that’s a subset of this category at around 200 million dry tons per year. So those ones generally decompose, of course releasing greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere. But what if they didn’t? There’s a whole class of ideas around utilizing that so-called waste biomass, either to displace something else that might generate greenhouse gases like fuels or just locking it up so that the CO2 is never released into the atmosphere in the first place.

The latter category is what charm industrial has focused on. Charm turns waste biomass into what they call biooil and then injects it back underground to be stored for thousands of years. Peter Reinhardt, who is the founder and CEO of Charm, is a friend of mine and I’ve always thought came into this space with a refreshing perspective. Prior to Charm, he was a wildly successful software founder. He founded the company, Segment, which was acquired for over 3 billion by Twilio in 2020. So he has this startup experience and actually carbon removal buyers experience, but this was his first foray, a charm into hard tech, into carbon markets as a producer into the realities of waste biomass. So that’s what I wanted to talk to him about, what he’s learned out there in the fields, what works, what’s hard, and where we are in the carbon removal markets. Here’s Peter. Peter, welcome. Thanks for having me. Alright, give me a tour of ag waste to start. Where is it? What is it? How much of it is there? Just give me the quick high level.

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, I think many people would maybe push back first the word waste there. For the most part, when you have ag residues, it’s mostly things that are unutilized or very underutilized, and so in some sense there’s waste there, but really I would think of it as sort of extremely underutilized and has a lot of value maybe that is going to waste or getting lost. But there’s an enormous amount in the United States, which maybe is where we can focus for now. Just corn stover for example. Obviously concentrated in the Midwest and particularly the northern part of the Midwest, and there’s about 90, 95 million acres of corn grown in the US every year. Just order magnitude for dry tons of stover per year on each of those acres. And so you’re just on corn stove, you’re looking at 400 megatons of ag residues that don’t really get used. They just rot on the field and return to the atmosphere.

Shayle Kann: What is stover actually on this cornstalk? What is the stover and then I think you just answered this question, but in a default scenario, corn is harvested, the stover just continues to sit on the field and eventually decomposes. That’s what happens to it.

Peter Reinhardt: That’s right, and there’s some geographical diversity to that, so we can get further into the nuance here. But the stover itself is the stalks, the leaves, depending on the harvest method, you may actually have cobs in the mix too. So it’s everything basically kind of minus the kernels because the kernels are really where the value lies, whether it’s animal feed stock or human consumption or high fructose corn syrup or ethanol. The kernels is really what we grow corn for today, but the actual practices around what happens to that stover are very pretty widely. There are a few places where it’s used for cellulosic ethanol production, but it’s really tiny that’s never really taken off. And as you get sort of farther north, you can have very moist soils that hold a lot of water, and as you get farther north, those will sometimes stay frozen deep into the spring when they actually need to plant it. So depending on the place, there can be quite different practices, actually on around whether you need to remove it so that you can actually plant in the spring and not be dealing with frozen soil or in other places, where actually say the Great Plains in Western Kansas and Colorado where you actually want to keep it on because more of it on because it’s going to help retain the soil moisture, which is a huge problem there. So there’s geographic diversity to that.

Shayle Kann: Yeah, I mean I have a feeling a lot of this part of the conversation is going to be like there is no uniformity in general, and that’s one of the challenges with doing anything at scale with ag residue. I’ll stop saying waste because you’re even just talking about specifically corn stover and that’s going to be different from almond shells in California from whatever soybean husks or whatever else it is from a practical standpoint, I mean, okay, so let’s view ag as a resource. It should be a resource, it has value, it has various things you could do with it, and we’re going to talk about highest best use, but one of the things that you and I have talked about a little bit that I think you have insight into that people don’t often appreciate is just the practical challenge of aggregation and utilization of that resource. Talk me through what does it take? Say you want it to do something, forget what you’re doing with it, say you want to do something with it at scale, what does that actually entail?

Peter Reinhardt: There is, again, some diversity depending on the residue, but if we stick with corn stover for a second and say you want to use the corn stover somewhere, typically you’re not going to be able to use it on the field. Typically, if you’re going to take some portion of it, whether that’s 70% or 30% depending on the sort of agricultural zone that you’re in, you need to get it off the field. And so there’s actually a lot of steps to get the biomass off the field in a sort of usable format at a usable distance, where typically people are building centralized plants, and so that actually dominates the cost of the biomass, which is something that we’re trying to invert this a charm by eventually operating on field to cut this all out. But let’s say you have a field that’s all laid flat, a forage harvester came through and cut it all down, now you need to first windrow it into a pile, then you’re going to bale it.

Then once you have bales, you’re going to bring a machine that’s going to stack the bales and bring ’em over to the edge of the field where put ’em in piles, and then you’re going to need something like telehandler to load it onto a truck and they need to drive the truck and they need to unload the truck. And so every one of those pieces equipment is a big CapEx piece and opex to run. You need people to actually do every step of that labor. So it’s a huge portion of the cost structure. So if you’re looking at getting corn stover, say, delivered to Abengoa Hugoton was a huge cellulosic ethanol plant that failed in Western Kansas because they were transporting their biomass 50 to a hundred miles. They expected to pay maybe $60 a ton. They found in fact that they were paying north of $120 a ton, and the actual dollars that were getting delivered to the farmer for the stover that they had was maybe in the low tens of dollars and all the rest of it was bundled up in the consolidation and transport of the biomass. So it’s quite an operation to do it and requires specialized equipment for each different type of feedstock as well. So it’s quite complicated and there’s some companies that do an incredible job of this, like Pacific Ag has a large operation in the panhandle kind of region. But yeah, it’s tough,

Shayle Kann: Isn’t it? Also when you talk about dollars per ton, things in delivered biomass world get priced in dollars per bone, dry ton, but actually the part of the problem also is that what you’re getting off the field is not one ton is not one bone dry ton, and so there’s more material.

Peter Reinhardt: It gets both ways. It gets priced both ways.

Shayle Kann: There’s no standard there, but I guess, well, the bigger point is part of the cost that’s loaded in there is that either you’re transporting something that has partial value, some piece of the stuff that you’re transporting is actually valuable and another piece of it is not. And so you’re carrying dead weight along with you, or you have to go process it before you transport it, in which case there’s a different piece of capital equipment that you need at the site in order to avoid transporting this stuff that is waterlogged or has whatever other stuff in it.

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, that’s true. The water content of stover dries on the field pretty effectively into the 15 to 20% range. So you’re not carrying that much water. I mean there is water in there, but the thing that kills you on the transport or more than the dead weight there is actually the volume. So when you’re trying to transport stover, you cube out, meaning volumetrically, you run out of space a lot faster than you weigh out. And I mean that’s why you see these insane trailers where it’s coming out all over the place trying to haul the biomass, the volume just literally you can’t fit it all in there, so fluffy. So from a cost perspective, at least for corn stover that dominates, but for wood is quite different. Actually wood can easily be 50% water if it’s young growth and hasn’t aged for a year post cutting. So when you look at wildfire thinnings, for example, oftentimes we get wood that’s in the 50% range and there, yeah, it sucks because half what you’re transporting is useless.

Shayle Kann: Right. What about heterogeneity? I mean, I think also this probably depends what you want to do with it. There’s probably some things that you can do with it that are going to be super sensitive to heterogeneity in the actual feedstock and other things that won’t be. But how big an issue is that in general?

Peter Reinhardt: It’s an issue, but it’s an issue because you encounter edge cases at volume as opposed to it being like if you looked at, for example, at our woodchips that we process in Colorado where we’re getting in these, taking this stuff from forest fire prevention, thinnings, that the Colorado State Forest Service and US Forest Service are running and we work with the forestry contractors, they would power burn this stuff. Otherwise they send this sort of thinning material to us, which nominally should have a lot of heterogeneity to it because effectively a waste product that they would have to burn if we were to stand there and look at it, you’d be like, this is pretty consistent material visually. It’s not like, oh, this is all over the place, but nonetheless, you can still get edge cases. You can get a rock that was randomly stuck in a branch, or you can get people talk about bale that had a handgun in it.

It happens. And so if you’re processing it at scale, you do have to have things in place to ensure that that doesn’t happen. But it’s the exception. The heterogeneity is problematic in its exceptions as opposed to some sort of continuous variability. Variability in moisture content is interesting. That can really affect processes. And so having strong controls around drying or measurement of moisture content or depending on your process, the form factor of the actual material going into a biomass processing system can matter a lot, right? Like aspect ratio, a long twig often is way more problematic than the same amount of mass in a well-rounded chip just because you can create bridges and other things like that and equipment.

Shayle Kann: So okay. If we want to, let’s just assume that we as a society or as entrepreneurs, whoever want to utilize this residue, let’s focus on ag residue here though. We could talk about wood chips or whatever else too. Let’s assume that we want to use it, it has some use. What are the things that you think then need to be true to make it work? In other words, I assume that basically the trade-off here is you can either do what the ethanol plant you described failed was trying to do, which is aggregate centralized, build a big centralized processing facility to go make something with it, and that you get the economies of scale on the processing facility. So that’s good because you want that, but you have to source from a wider aperture geographically, and so you end up paying these transport costs and logistics costs that kill you, or you do something at the edge, which I think is closer to what you’re doing because you then don’t have to do what the transport costs, but you trade off the economies of scale on the processing side. So how do you think about that balance?

Peter Reinhardt: In some sense, this is the fundamental thesis of charm, which is you can’t bring biomass to market in its broadly heterogeneous, highly distributed, fluffy, current existing capacity. You just can’t do it. It doesn’t work. People have tried it so many times and it just doesn’t work. So the things that do work today are when people have large centralized sources of biomass. That could be rice hulls coming out of a plant or it could be sawdust coming out of a plant. Those are the places where it works, but that’s a tiny fraction. It’s a tiny, tiny fraction of the total biomass. And so to your point, if you want to get it to scale, you do have to be able to go out into the field and convert it into some kind of format that actually is more homogeneous and transportable. And so that is basically the thesis of charm, which is can we take that material?

And instead of, people have tried pelleting, people have tried all these things, but the problem is your starting density is maybe like a hundred to 200 kilograms per meter cubed, and even if you get that up via pelleting to four or 500, 600, it’s still really, really hard. And so our fundamental thesis is can we go out into the field with pyrolysis equipment and consolidate that biomass by removing a bunch of stuff that isn’t useful? So sort of reducing the total mass to what is the useful component in oil and biochar and can we increase the density dramatically? So the density of oil is 1200 kilograms per meter cubed, so almost more than a 10 x in terms of consolidation. And so now actually you’re weighing out your tanker and you have a pumpable fluid instead of having to deal with moving around bales that are super fluffy. And so the sort of fundamental thesis there is like can you make it transportable and can you densify it such that the economics fundamentally change around your ability to centralize it for further processing or for consumption? So that’s our fundamental thesis with pyrolysis and people have tried a lot of other ways to do it, but we think this one will work.

Shayle Kann: How much do economies of scale matter on pyrolysis? Would it be the trade you’re making is you’re saying I’ll do a small pyrolysis unit, but in exchange for that I’ll get this density, I’ll drive down logistics costs and transportation costs and all these things that blow up the economics of every other use of waste biomass or I’m sorry, ag residue or whatever it is. Presumably you believe that to be the right trade to make, but how much of a trade off is it really if you were doing pyrolysis at a 10 x scale relative to what you are doing it at, would it be notably cheaper?

Peter Reinhardt: It can get notably cheaper up to a point. So we today operate two ton per day systems. It is significantly cheaper to operate like a 20 ton per day system, and that’s what we’re working towards is you’ll have basically the same amount of labor operating something with 10 times the throughput, maybe 15 times the throughput, and you get a lot of leverage out of that. You start to see some economies on top of that. When you go beyond, we think that sort of equipment, farm equipment form factor, when you start moving away from a mobile piece of equipment into a fixed facility, you do get some economies of the construction, but you actually take on a lot more risk in every facility that you build. You have all the balance of plant, you have permitting, you have just more risk, you’re going to build many fewer of them and each one is going to be uniquely sized.

And so there’s actually, I think you actually break the unity economics in some sense break and jump beyond that mobile form factor. And that’s part of our thesis is how much throughput can we jam into a large combine kind of form factor is what we’re ultimately going to be shooting for. And we think that there’s great economics and continuing to push that throughput. But if we look at the CapEx for example, of our system today on a dollars CapEx per ton basis and compare it to say state-of-the-art pyrolysis facilities, we are already less than half of that cost on a dollar per CapEx basis, and that will decline drastically as we increase the throughput. So that’s where you would expect to see the most economy there in labor. And we already are realizing an economy relative to where you would expect to see an economy and through this concept of mass production, the other place where you’d expect to see economy is on the labor side. And I think we won’t beat that aside from through automation and reliability that just requires fewer people over time per machine. But the CapEx thing is surprising to me actually when I went and ran those numbers, I was surprised that we were already under the CapEx per ton.

Shayle Kann: Is that a function of the pyrolysis market is not enormous and it’s not the most mature in the world, is it just in part there has been room for innovation not totally optimized?

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, it’s also the case that there are some processes that benefit drastically from sort of a surface area to volume change. A lot of these world scale chemical plants have massive volumes inside their reactors, and so as they scale up the sort of metal cost, physical metal cost of the reactive vessel is declining because the surface area to volume ratio is declining. I think that there are some process, I think pyrolysis in some senses is less influenced by that because you’re sort of putting heat in and taking heat out and so you almost have a surface area to surface area scaling law. So maybe also the pyrolysis is somewhat unique relative to other chemical processes.

Shayle Kann: All right, so let’s assume you can get your ag residue, you can get your biomass off the field. You can do it in a manner that is sufficiently dense and that is economic to do something with. And the next question then is, okay, so what should we do with it? What’s the highest and best use? So I know you have opinions on this, but talk me through I guess to start the suite of options. What are the things you think of as being potential uses for that biomass once you get it off the field?

Peter Reinhardt: Historically, biomass has been primarily used for industrial heat sort of alongside an existing plant or for electricity production in some cases, or for car fuel production like ethanol. These are not actually very good uses for biomass. They don’t really take advantage of the best properties that biomass has. What really distinguishes biomass is not necessarily its energy content, which is actually quite low. So on a per kilogram basis, the energy content of biomass is about one third that of crude oil, so it’s pretty energy poor. What’s interesting about it is that relative to almost everything else, it’s very carbon rich and so the use cases that rely either on the chemical availability of carbon or on the sort of physical availability of carbon, those or in the case of carbon removal literally on the amount of carbon in there, those are the use cases actually that have the highest and best use over time.

So carbon removal is obviously the market that we have gone into first where we can do oil sequestration and pump the carbon underground in a liquid form. That’s actually a pretty high value use case for it directly monetizing the carbon embedded in the biomass. There are other use cases where the carbon is really critical from a chemical perspective, so these is things like iron making. When you reduce iron oxide to iron, you need carbon monoxide and you can use hydrogen, but it’s endothermic. So if you want to make it sort of work in a reliable basis, you probably need carbon monoxide. You need that carbon. Well, great. We have a carbon source, so iron making is a pretty compelling use case. Another one actually is SAF is jet fuel. We don’t have a lot of great dense energy carriers that can actually do long haul flights and there it is. So we’re probably for a long time going to need carbon there. So those are some of the cases made. Asphalt plastics, there’s a bunch of these places where the carbon isn’t integral part either of the being an energy carrier or being chemically involved in the process or structurally involved as an atomic element. Those are the places where and world Resources Institute would agree with this in their analysis I think, which is like that’s where we need the carbon and other use cases like car fuel are pretty poor economic fits.

Shayle Kann: Is your view on why historically we’ve used biomass as an energy source rather than a carbon source predominantly just a function of the market has been there for energy, the market has not really been there for the carbon stuff, certainly not for carbon removal. Historically, SAF is a relatively new thing. Is it just like a market maturity thing or is there some other reason why we’ve gone down the wrong road historically?

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, I think it’s a market maturity thing. I think also for the industrial heat and electricity use cases, often that’s when you have a concentrated flow of biomass and now

Shayle Kann: And you just want to cofi with something else and you might as well. It’s like buying down your total cost.

Peter Reinhardt: Yes, A facility owner is like, well, I have this thing, why don’t I use it? Whereas the sort of biomass that we’re talking about maybe is a different type of biomass, which is like, okay, but then there’s five gigatons of this stuff all over the world and it rots or burns today, which is a different, it’s a different, yeah,

Shayle Kann: Maybe they’re right. Probably the more accurate way to put it is that a lot of this stuff has not been used actually historically. It’s not that it’s been used for this other stuff to the extent that it has, if it’s being used to produce ethanol, we’ve sort of distorted a market into existence for ethanol that is tax credit driven predominantly, and so there’s an economic reason to do that that doesn’t speak to the underlying rationality of leveraging it for energy.

Peter Reinhardt: To be clear, there’s geopolitical reasons also to ensure that we have massive amounts of corn and food grown in the United States. It maybe gets more complicated than just what’s the highest and best use of biomass, but it, yes.

Shayle Kann: Okay, so I’ve seen the analysis too that basically suggests that look, okay, so let’s just assume we care about CO2 emissions. Let’s assume we care about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in general. Then if you look at biomass, if you look at waste biomass, clearly if you could do it cheaply enough, the highest and best use of it is carbon removal. You just get the most bang for your buck even over the other things that leverage the carbon SAF or whatever else, which is where you guys have started. The question then is less, I think in my mind, what is the highest and best use of the material, and rather what is the market for that, right? Which is the sort of underlying question in CDR. So I want to transfer to talking about that a little bit. Been a kind of, I think you’ve delivered more tons of permanent CDR than anybody else in the world, or at least that was true at one point.

And the other thing that I think you’ve done that has been interesting to me is that you’ve found a more diverse set of buyers for CDR than most other folks. I think listeners to this podcast probably know that if you just look at overall tons purchased in the CDR market, it’s basically Microsoft followed by an order of magnitude lower frontier, which is the Stripe Coalition, followed by a bunch of little minnows in relative terms. And so a lot of the CDR market to the extent that they have actually generally pre-sold tons as opposed to selling tons, which is you’ve done, that’s the buyer universe for them essentially. But you have found some others on that list. So just give me your overall take on how the CDR demand side has evolved and what your approach has been to finding those buyers.

Peter Reinhardt: I think I have a little bit of a unique perspective here also as an ex-buyer, the reason that I’m in this market at all is because previously built a software company called Segment, which sold in 2020, and along the way, we were trying to figure out how to offset our carbon or remove our carbon, and I was really pissed off at the quality of what was there. And so I come from a perspective of sitting in the buyer’s seat beyond the folks that have gotten really excited and have driven forward the carbon removal industry, the Stripes and Shopifys and Microsofts and Googles and Facebook sort of core tech group. Beyond that, I feel a little bit of some of the pain that the broader market has encountered in trying to buy offsets historically. I went through it and specifically my experience was I went and bought some offsets in Indonesian rainforest and the Amazon Rainforest and it was like 20K or something, and then I came back a year later and I was like, wait a second, what happened?

What happened when I bought those offsets? Is there any clarity of can I look up which acres exactly did I protect and did it have an impact? Is it still there? Then you see in the news the Amazon is on fire and you’re like, oh, shoot, maybe I need to go rebuy something. Did my protection totally fail here? And so the deeper that I got into that, the more I was like, this is bad. This is really bad. There’s no clarity on it, there’s no trail of evidence, there’s no FedEx style delivery history of what happened there. And so I think there’s a few things that have differentiated charm and appealing to a broader set of buyers. The first is extreme transparency. So you can go to the website and this comes from that experience. You can go to the website, charmindustrial.com/ledger, and you can see a complete history of every delivery you can click in and you can see where the biomass came from and so on.

I still think it’s a really crappy V zero. I want to get to a point where you can, when the DoorDash deliverer takes a picture of the food on your doorstep, every step of the process, I won’t have photo evidence of what happened and make that public. So that’s one thing that still is extremely differentiated. We’ve made a big point of it over the years, and I’ve tried to push other suppliers to do that, and for whatever reason it’s still differentiated. And so from a risk perspective, if you’re a buyer and you’ve been feeling all this risk of these junky offsets that you maybe got burned by, that’s a pretty different feel in the sort of broader market. And the other is just all the co-benefits associated with charms process. There are many other processes that are sort of arbitrage-y of delivering tons in a cheap fashion, that are real, but probably can’t get to climate scale. What’s different is not only can charm get to a very large scale due to the feedstocks that we’re going and getting access to, but the potential wildfire impacts the potential orphaned, well cleanup. There’s a bunch of things along the chain that I think are big co-benefits to human health and communities that buyers want to help support.

Shayle Kann: So is your view that there’s a significant volume of latent, I don’t know whether this is the right way to put it, but latent demand for CDR that has not been unlocked? Largely because one, a sort of lack of trust in the market, which I 100% agree with you. I worked in the carbon market world, the voluntary carbon market world, like geez, 15 years ago now, and the legacy carbon offset world is a disaster in my opinion. So there’s definitely some repair that needs to be done there, but so your view is that a combination of trust and co-benefits deliver this big wave of demand that we haven’t seen fully show up yet outside of just that core group? You said the tech companies, et cetera?

Peter Reinhardt: I think so.

Shayle Kann: And why? What are they driving toward? Is it net zero commitments that they’re trying to meet? What’s the underlying motivation for corporates at least, do you think?

Peter Reinhardt: I think our underlying motivation for corporates is impact, and they want to trust that that impact is actually happening in a measurable way and climate impact is great, but they also, if they can double dip simultaneously into having climate impact as well as health impact because there isn’t particulate coming out of a wildfire and into community impact because homes aren’t getting burnt down and into community impact because a well is getting cleaned up and it’s not spewing radioactive brine at the surface anymore or methane if their goal is having a positive impact with these kinds of purchases a lot more, right? There’s just more there on the bone as opposed to some other approaches often have trade-offs in this sense, whether that’s consuming a lot of power or other kinds of things where it’s like that can be less appealing.

Shayle Kann: Are there other categories of buyers that you think are likely to scale? I mean, I guess the way I think about it’s right now, it’s been the tech industry first and foremost, followed maybe by the financial sector where there have been a few buyers who have stepped like some of the big banks who’ve made some larger volume purchases. Is that the next big beach head for CDR?

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, I’d say certainly. We started in high tech or technology, big software companies, ai, hyperscalers. We see a lot of activity in banking, financial services. We see a lot of activity in consulting, have a lot of consulting companies as customers, we’re starting to see more activity in advanced manufacturing, so that’s like aircraft, chips, pharmaceuticals. If you look at a sort of chart of profitability per ton or EBITDA per ton, it’s the companies that have a lot of EBITDA per ton that are going to lead the way on helping things down

Shayle Kann: Per ton of emissions, in this case, not per ton of removal, right? It’s like, yeah, how much money do they make? But it’s basically saying how hard is it for them to afford to purchase credits to offset a significant chunk of their emissions.

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah. I will say though that there are some companies that have done the analysis of, they’ve reduced all their obvious emissions in terms of just buying clean electricity and so on, and they’re getting down to the point where they’re like, hold on, it’s going to cost $2,000 a ton for me to go tear down a building and rebuild it with a proper HVAC system that does heat pumps and have clean concrete. At some point, you get down to this base baseload of amortized embodied emissions and things that are in the built structures, and it’s really hard and really expensive, and as they get down there, it’s like, well, maybe this is just cheaper to remove.

Shayle Kann: Alright, Peter, this was fun. Thanks for talking through ag residue and carbon removal with me, but appreciate the time.

Peter Reinhardt: Thanks for having me.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-25T093825.756.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 10:56:36.508150

Today, in the high-tech corridors of aviation and the carbon-accounting realities of ESG, we’ve lost sight of the truth that it takes more than evidence to propel change.

For the science of sustainability needs to be felt – through experience, through emotion, through human connection.

As we build the future of sustainable aviation, we need the fusion of imagination and evidence.

Because no matter how cutting-edge our solutions, ESG fatigue is real and it isn’t a failure of action, it’s a failure of imagination.

Experience is the antidote to apathy

The aviation sector faces a paradox: it is one of the most vital industries to decarbonise but the moves it is making in that direction are not being felt.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), electric propulsion, new infrastructure and the technical efforts are monumental.

But the public doesn’t feel them. This is where experiential marketing becomes not a luxury, but a strategic necessity.

Experiences build trust in ways data can’t. When people witness innovation with their own eyes, when they stand inside a net-zero aircraft cabin or engage with immersive sustainability journeys, they start to believe.

Brands doing this effectively are those that let people feel sustainability rather than read about it.

Immersive activations, demo flights or VR experiences can all turn abstract numbers into lived memories. This shifts ESG from compliance to something desirable and human.

TotalEnergies at the 2025 Paris Air Show used experiential marketing to demystify SAF and highlight the infrastructure challenges slowing its adoption.

At its booth, the company recreated a fully immersive SAF-powered airport environment – a physical manifestation of a concept typically confined to technical whitepapers and policy discussions.

By simulating what a SAF-enabled airport could look and feel like, TotalEnergies made an abstract future tangible.

This hands-on experience helped stakeholders – from policymakers to aviation executives – better grasp the logistical hurdles and opportunities tied to adopting SAF.

The installation reinforced TotalEnergies’ commitment to decarbonising aviation, translating complex ESG issues into actionable, engaging narratives.

Building emotional connection with passengers

The public may not grasp the carbon lifecycle of SAF, but they remember boarding a plane fuelled by it.

They may not read emissions dashboards, but they remember being immersed in a space where sustainable flight feels real.

The United Airlines’ historic passenger flight using 100% SAF in 2021 was a technical milestone and a strategic move to engage the public emotionally and promote sustainability.

The flight was positioned as a tangible example of progress in decarbonizing aviation, aiming to transform abstract environmental goals into a relatable and hopeful narrative.

By involving passengers and industry leaders, United sought to create a sense of shared accomplishment and personal connection to the sustainability effort.

Why airlines need to rethink their ESG marketing strategies

Airlines rely on data-heavy reports or fragmented campaigns that don’t resonate with passengers.

They’re good at setting targets and piloting new technology, but weak at translating that into customer experiences so, their ESG marketing needs to be reframed.

To increase consumer willingness to pay for sustainable travel, airlines need to make sustainability exciting and aspirational; a rewarding experience rather than a moral imperative.

Brands can better share the successes of how they have implemented ESG, such as including SAF seat upgrades or green booking options.

They can reward sustainable choices through loyalty programmes and premium perks, sharing proof through storytelling rather than just statistics.

ESG storytelling must move from solo to systemic

Aviation’s decarbonisation isn’t a solo act. It’s a system-wide, multi-stakeholder evolution. Yet the public often sees only fragments – a single innovation, a new fuel type, an airline campaign.

Events like the Paris Air Show, Dubai and Farnborough offer rare opportunities where the entire industry convenes in physical space.

Air shows are primarily industry-focused but their impact extends far beyond B2B audiences. The innovations and demonstrations fuel media coverage, social content and trust signals that regular consumers see.

To appeal to businesses, you need to appeal to where their revenue is generated, the end consumer.

B2B ultimately depends on demand at the passenger level, so showing progress and innovation at the start of the value chain helps businesses sell to other businesses.

A breakthrough demo at Paris or Farnborough often becomes a story the public remembers, and air shows act as launchpads for innovations before they reach passengers.

These aren’t just exhibitions; they are arenas of alignment. When done right, events become system accelerators, aligning emotion, science and society.

Every experience is a trust touchpoint

Experiential marketing is the bridge between scepticism and momentum. Through experiences, sustainability can be translated into emotive narratives.

They are a powerful tool; designing immersive activations that make progress feel personal, elevating smaller players like SAF pioneers and electric start-ups from side stage to main stage means these are not just promotional moments but opportunities to change people’s perspectives.

Sustainability won’t succeed if it’s seen as a sacrifice. It needs to be seen and felt as an upgrade. Experiential marketing shows the value, not just the cost.

It builds public will, which unlocks capital. It makes complex policy human. It transforms ESG from abstraction into action.",https://www.aviationbusinessnews.com/resources/uploads/2025/09/Margaux-Bang_2.webp,N,,2025-09-25 10:56:40.712341

BEV, Breakthrough Energy Venture’s capital fund founded by Bill Gates, will serve as the fund’s investment manager, bringing deep technical expertise, a rigorous diligence model, and extensive experience supporting the growth of early-stage climate technology companies.

Objectives of the Fund

The oneworld BEV Fund will invest in novel, next-generation SAF technologies; support the growth of alternative fuel markets to meet the long-term needs of the global aviation industry, drive technology innovation and develop a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain to meet future demand.

oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimising other environmental impacts.

The alliance’s members include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Oman Air, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian and SriLankan Airlines.

Challenges in investment

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts.

Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry’s environmental impact.

While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern.

“The oneworld BEV Fund is built to identify and scale breakthrough SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions for jet fuel, compete with fossil-based fuels on cost, and integrate seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure. These are complex systems-level challenges that will take time to solve, and the fund is built with the long-term vision and staying power to help bring solutions to market,” said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy and managing partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Breakthrough Energy Ventures has raised more than $3.5 billion in committed capital and partnered with more than 110 groundbreaking companies.

Other recent developments

In June, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matchmaker platform to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF is expected to reach two million tonnes, or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a six per cent SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines.

In March, Airbus launched a new initiative called the “Book and Claim” system to make SAF more accessible and scalable.

Delta and Maeve target cleaner regional flights

Delta Air Lines has announced a strategic partnership with Maeve Aerospace to support the development of the Maeve Jet, a hybrid-electric aircraft designed to transform regional aviation. The aircraft promises up to 40% fuel savings compared to conventional regional jets, with further reductions possible through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The collaboration marks a significant step in Delta’s journey towards ‘net zero’ emissions by 2050 and reflects its commitment to pioneering cleaner, more-efficient aircraft technologies.

As Maeve’s exclusive North American airline partner, Delta will contribute operational expertise to help tailor the Maeve Jet for the US market. The aircraft’s design is a ‘bold re-imagining of regional travel’, offering the comfort and economics of a narrow-body airliner in a five-abreast, single-aisle configuration. This approach is intended to set a new benchmark for short-haul sustainability and passenger experience.

The partnership also sees Maeve join Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab, becoming the fifth revolutionary fleet partner in the airline’s 2023 Sustainability Roadmap. Maeve’s hybrid-electric solution complements Delta’s existing collaborations with JetZero, Joby Aviation, Airbus and Boeing, each focused on different aspects of future aircraft design and operation. Together, these partnerships form a comprehensive strategy across short, medium and long-haul markets.

Delta’s broader sustainability strategy is built around three pillars: what it flies, how it flies, and the fuel it uses. From investing in next-generation aircraft and scaling SAF adoption to optimising flight operations and reducing onboard weight, the airline is taking a holistic approach to decarbonising air travel.

Bold, forward-thinking innovation

Kristen Bojko, vice president of fleet at Delta Air Lines, said: “Delta is proud to collaborate with Maeve to help shape the next chapter of regional aviation and accelerate progress toward a more sustainable future of flight. As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences, and cut emissions.”

The Maeve Jet’s hybrid-electric engine architecture provides power assistance during low-altitude operations, enabling optimisation of both the power plant and wing design for reduced fuel consumption. The model also supports the integration of more electric aircraft systems, further enhancing efficiency.

Martin Nuesseler, chief technology officer at Maeve Aerospace, added: “It is a privilege to have Delta as a partner in the development of groundbreaking technologies and processes. Their expertise in fleet innovation and commitment to aviation sustainability is unmatched, and we are proud to work together to tailor the Maeve Jet for the US market.”

In addition to its work with Maeve, Delta is partnering with Green Taxi Aerospace to develop electric taxiing technology for regional aircraft. This initiative, also part of the Sustainable Skies Lab, aims to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time and carbon emissions. The Green Taxi collaboration exemplifies Delta’s dual approach — making immediate operational improvements while investing in transformative technologies for the future.

USA BioEnergy, a renewable fuels development and integration company headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, is advancing the energy transition with its new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility in Bon Wier, Texas, built using JM and Honeywell technologies. ChemAnalyst spoke with Nick Andrews, CEO and Co-Founder, about the facility, its use of forest thinnings, and the company’s plan to develop several advanced biorefineries producing ultra-low carbon fuels.

Complete Interview with Nick Andrews

1. Please provide an introduction to your professional background and your role at USA BioEnergy.

Nick Andrews: We created USA BioEnergy to be the world’s leader in advanced fuels. My job is to lead and deliver the performance of the company. My philosophy is that we lead together with our partners.

2. Outline the core mission and vision of USA BioEnergy, and explain how the company is contributing to the global transition toward low-carbon transportation fuels.

Nick Andrews: Our goal is to have the lowest carbon intensity score in the advanced fuels industry. We have determined that an airline like Southwest Airlines can fly 112,000 net neutral flights each year from the sustainable aviation fuel we produce from one facility.

3. The Bon Wier, Texas facility is projected to produce 65 million gallons of renewable fuels annually by 2030. What milestones are being prioritized to ensure the project remains on track from development to commissioning?

Nick Andrews: Having terrific companies like Honeywell and JM go along way of giving the funders the comfort they are seeking. Having some of the strongest commercial agreements help ensure our project remains on track.

4. Forest thinnings are identified as a primary feedstock. How does this strategy address long-term feedstock security, sustainability, and supply-chain resilience for SAF production?

Nick Andrews: We can show super redundancy of our primary feedstock at a location that was formally a plywood manufacturing facility. We have the largest and longest feedstock supply agreement in the history of advanced fuels with LP Corporation.

5. With Johnson Matthey and Honeywell technologies integrated into the facility, what features make this project stand out as an advanced and fully integrated renewable fuel model?

Nick Andrews: We use bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration as a strategy to reduce our carbon intensity score. Working together with Johnson Matthey and Honeywell as the primary technology providers we can fully integrate the processes.

6. Scaling SPK production at commercial levels involves operational and technological challenges. What hurdles are anticipated, and how is USA BioEnergy preparing to address them?

Nick Andrews: Our licensors provide performance guarantees and because of that our EPC provides a wrap that guarantees the project will be built on time, on budget and will meet the performance specifications including the ASTM certification of the fuels. Each of these companies have a big balance sheet to back their commitments.

7. A 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines has been secured. How do such long-term contracts influence market stability and shape the future of SAF adoption in the U.S.?

Nick Andrews: The most important factor for SAF adoption is access to development capital. Having long term commercial agreements are the key to giving the capital markets comfort.

8. With airlines and logistics companies targeting net-zero emissions, demand for SAF is expected to outpace supply. How is USA BioEnergy positioning itself to expand production capacity while maintaining cost competitiveness with fossil fuels?

Nick Andrews: We plan to build twelve facilities using the best fully integrated approach in the advanced fuels industry. We look for efficiencies to lower cost and increase production.

9. Beyond the U.S. market, what strategies are being considered for USA BioEnergy’s participation in the global SAF ecosystem, particularly in Europe and Asia where policy incentives and demand are strong?

Nick Andrews: We have several locations identified in southern US and are actively looking for locations in Europe, Asia and Australia.

“We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require cooperation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers,” said Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment. “With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.”",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Finnair-A350-Marimekko-Livery-Kivet-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 08:56:43.875469

The transportation group tells FlightGlobal its analysis shows that eliminating greenhouse gases like CO2 “alone cannot align aviation with the Paris Agreement”.
“The best available scientific assessments highlight that the net warming impact of non-CO2 emissions is at least the same magnitude as that of aviation’s cumulative CO2 emissions,” ICAO’s paper says.
ICAO in 2022 set its goal for the aviation industry to have net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.","ICAO is reviewing new data showing that reducing contrails will do more to help the aviation industry meet the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals than the sector’s ambitious target of achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

The standards setting group will take up the topic of contrails and other so-called “short-lived climate pollutants” (SLCP) at its 42nd Assembly, happening now in Montreal, according to ICAO agenda documents.

Front and centre is a new report from US group International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) concluding that reducing CO2 will have less impact on mitigating rising global temperatures than will reducing SLCPs, especially contrails.

ICCT says the aviation sector must cut both CO2 and SLCPs to reach the Paris Agreement goals.

“SLCP controls can provide faster and cheaper reductions in Earth’s temperature response to international aviation activity than [greenhouse gas] controls,” says an ICAO White Paper from August reviewing topics to be considered at the Assembly.

“Contrail avoidance, in particular, is modelled to be the most-impactful and cost-effective lever, providing 40% of total avoided warming by 2050,” the paper adds.

An arm of the United Nations, ICAO did not respond to questions about its consideration of ICCT’s report, which that group released publicly on 23 September.

ICAO is scheduled to review the proposal on 25 September, ICCT says.

The transportation group tells FlightGlobal its analysis shows that eliminating greenhouse gases like CO2 “alone cannot align aviation with the Paris Agreement”. It says the industry must focus on reducing contrails, which will cost a “magnitude” less than widespread production and use of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SLCPs include contrails (the result of ice crystals formed from water vapour in jet engine exhaust), and turbofan emissions including nitrogen oxides and “black carbon”, commonly known as soot. Those materials can cause atmospheric heating over hours or days, unlike CO2, which causes warming over centuries.

“The best available scientific assessments highlight that the net warming impact of non-CO2 emissions is at least the same magnitude as that of aviation’s cumulative CO2 emissions,” ICAO’s paper says.

ICAO in 2022 set its goal for the aviation industry to have net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The goal was intended to help the sector comply with the United Nation’s 2015 Paris Agreement, which urges member states take steps to prevent global temperatures from exceeding 2°C warmer than a pre-industrial revolution baseline.

Toward that end, airline groups rolled out ambitious road maps, saying they will achieve net-zero CO2 by means including new technologies (such as hydrogen, hybrid and all-electric propulsion), improved operational efficiencies and use of SAF.

Promises aside, SAF remains in pitiful short supply – 0.03% of jet fuel last year, ICCT says. SAF is also exceedingly expensive, and growing crops for SAF poses land-use challenges and could impact food crops.

On the technology front, aircraft and engine manufacturers have recently walked back hydrogen and all-electric ambitions due to technological limitations.

But ICCT says the CO2 focus is way overrated.

“Overall, 85% of the avoided temperature increase is linked to SLCPs,” its report says, estimating contrails “contribute the largest share” – 40% – of the aviation sector’s contribution to warming temperatures.

“Contrail abatement technologies will would take less time to develop and scale”, and cost far less than other means, ICCT adds. “SLCP reduction emerges as a more-feasible option… in mitigating aviation’s climate impact.”

It says new analytical tools and “advances in contrails science” informed the new study.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/6/1/112861_ecodemonstrator_explorer_737_10_130596.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 10:57:00.586897

Governments plan to produce about more than double (120%) the volume of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, according to the 2025 Production Gap Report.

It further added that if global warming were to be limited to 2°C, even then the volume of fossil fuels in 2030 would be 77% more. If this does happen, then the world will even further away from the goals decided during the Paris Agreement.

The 2025 Production Gap Report was produced by Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Climate Analytics, and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

Since the last time the report was compiled in 2023, countries are planning even higher levels of coal production to 2035 and gas production to 2050. For oil, planned production continues to increase to 2050.

Increasing fossil fuels across the world

The report analysed 20 major fossil-fuel-producing countries responsible for about 80% of global fossil fuel production. Its findings include that 17 of the 20 featured countries still plan to increase production of at least one fossil fuel to 2030.

Eleven now expect higher production of at least one fossil fuel in 2030 than they had planned in 2023. On the other hand, 6 of the 20 profiled countries are now developing domestic fossil fuel production aligned with national and global net zero targets, up from four in 2023, found the report.

Back in 2023, when the former report was compiled, the fossil fuel production gap was 110% above the 1.5°C warming pathway and 69% more than the 2°C pathway.

“In 2023, governments formally acknowledged the need to move away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change – an obligation the International Court of Justice has now clearly emphasized. But as our report makes clear, while many countries have committed to a clean energy transition, many others appear to be stuck using a fossil-fuel-dependent playbook, planning even more production than they were two years ago,” said Derik Broekhoff, coordinating lead author of the Production Gap Report.

Meeting climate targets uphill task

The report underscored the need to undertake steeper and faster reductions in fossil fuel production if the world wants to limit global warming to well below 2°C. Another issue is that the fossil fuel infrastructure, which is primarily subsidised through public funds, will eventually end up as stranded assets.

The report advocated that achieving these reductions will require deliberate, coordinated policies to ensure a just transition away from fossil fuels. While a few major fossil-fuel-producing countries have begun to align production plans with national and international climate goals, most still have not.

“To keep the 1.5°C goal within reach, the world needs rapid reductions in coal, oil, and gas investments, redirecting these resources toward an energy transition that prioritizes equity and justice. By COP30, governments must commit to expand renewables, phase out fossil fuels, manage energy demands, and implement community-centered energy transitions to align with Paris Agreement obligations. Without these commitments, delaying action further will lock in additional emissions and worsen climate impacts on the world’s most vulnerable populations,” said Emily Ghosh, coordinating lead author.

Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use hydroprocessed esters and fatty acid (HEFA) technology such as converting used cooking oil into SAF.
Government policies need to be coordinated to support innovation and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market while the energy industry needs to invest in SAF production capacity and align its business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.
IATA director general Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","A study by IATA and Worley Consulting has stated that technology, not the availability of raw materials is the main bottleneck to the roll-out of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and net zero aviation.

The report concluded that there is enough feedstock - that meets stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use - to enable the airline industry to achieve zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

However the roll-out of technology to enable SAF to be produced from varied sources is slow. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use hydroprocessed esters and fatty acid (HEFA) technology such as converting used cooking oil into SAF.

These face competition with other potential users of the same feedstock so allocating biomass to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised, the report said.

Biomass could produce more than 300m tonnes of the 500mt of SAF needed to achieve net zero by 2050. Some of this potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements.

Power-to-liquid (PtL) technology will be needed to produce the remaining 200mt and reach the 500mt target, the report continues. PtL, or e-SAF, uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, which is then combined with carbon dioxide to form synthetic kerosene and would allow the fuel to be made from multiple sources.

This will require reliable access to low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen and carbon capture systems.

However, in the meantime, maximising volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

For all technology, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiency, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure to scale up commercial SAF production in all regions, found the report.

Government policies need to be coordinated to support innovation and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market while the energy industry needs to invest in SAF production capacity and align its business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.

IATA director general Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.

""There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, added: “Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout.

""Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder.”

Walsh concluded: “We can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/7/6/11776_biofuel-aircraft-shutterstock_2055311654.jpg-resized.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 06:56:12.826893

Meanwhile, Tallgrass has launched the Trailblazer Community Investment Fund, pledging an initial $500,000 to be managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation.

Over the next decade, the company expects to distribute more than $7 million through the fund, supporting early childhood centers, elder care providers, food programs, and volunteer fire departments in 31 counties.

A New Model for Infrastructure Projects

The initiative emerged from negotiations with Bold Nebraska, a grassroots environmental group that once opposed Keystone XL but sought a more collaborative path with this project. Both organizations now describe the partnership as a template for balancing large-scale infrastructure development with meaningful community benefits.

Jane Kleeb, Bold Nebraska’s founder, emphasized that rural communities often bear the burdens of such projects without reaping tangible benefits.

Tallgrass executives framed the fund as a way to invest in the long-term well-being of local residents. “We hope that these investments serve to provide a safety net to our neighbors throughout their lifetimes,” said Kyle Quackenbush, the company’s segment president.

Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is aiming to play a key role in helping to tackle climate change by significantly reducing flight carbon emissions.

While the ASA hasn’t seen too many examples of SAF claims in ads, plans have already been put in motion to increase its use in the sector and so there will, quite understandably, be increased opportunities for advertisers to highlight how it’s being implemented. There are positive messages to be communicated with this concept, however there’s always a balance to be struck in ensuring that those messages don’t give a misleading impression of the environmental impacts of flights through its use.

Here we’ll outline some key green claim requirements so you can get that balance right.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel made from renewable feedstocks, which can range from general household waste and cooking oil, to waste wood and algae (and lots in between). SAF purports to offer a lower carbon alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel, with the aim of significantly reducing carbon emissions. The term itself is widely used and recognised in the aviation sector, as well as government, and was first defined by organisations like the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Unlike other alternatives to traditional aviation fuel, SAF’s chemical make-up means that it can be easily integrated – or ‘blended’ – into current fuel mixes, at a current maximum ratio of 50%. It can also be used in existing aircraft, resulting in minimal impact on infrastructure.

To encourage and secure demand, the UK government implemented a SAF Mandate in 2024, which sets a legal obligation on its supply. This starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand and then increases annually to 10% in 2030 and finally 22% in 2040. It’s estimated that the Mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings per year by the final increase in 2040.

Make sure you make the basis of the claim clear

When it comes to the content of ads, they need to make the basis of any environmental claims clear. This means that any unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information. Additionally, the meaning of all terms used in ads should be clear to consumers.

Results from various ASA consumer research topics (be it related to food, EV and hybrid vehicles, green disposal methods or carbon neutral claims) have shown that there’s typically quite a low level of understanding, and often confusion, when it comes to grasping the meaning of environmental claims. This includes references to new technologies, a bracket that SAF is likely to fall into.

On the basis that consumers will lack in-depth knowledge and understanding of SAF, any negative environmental impacts of the fuel could be considered as material information that will have an impact on a transactional decision. Ads that don’t highlight this type of balancing information are therefore likely to mislead. What we’re considering here is something that explains that SAF produces reduced, but still significant, emissions over its full life cycle (more on that later), and the level of greenhouse gas emission savings that have been obtained.

The consumer’s perspective is therefore key – first, what is the ad’s overall message? What is that likely to mean to them? What’s their likely understanding and interpretation of it? What information are they going to need to help their understanding?

What about absolute claims?

A good place to start when making any objective claim is to make sure that you hold evidence to substantiate it. Absolute claims (like “green” or “eco-friendly”) have historically been taken to mean that something either has no effect on the environment or an actively positive one and will therefore require a very high level of evidence to back them up.

The term “Sustainable Aviation Fuel” is unlikely to be taken as an absolute claim in isolation, but you’ll want to avoid accompanying it with absolute-style descriptors. As we’ve already seen, while the transition to SAF aims to spark a positive shift on climate change compared to using jet fuel, there will still be some unavoidable impact on the environment through its use. This isn’t exclusive to SAF – it’s simply a nigh on impossible task to back up a suggestion that a product or service has absolutely no effect on the environment in some way, however small that might be.

So, if you want to claim “Environmental Advocacy” with “Total Peace Of Mind”, “a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation” or that consumers can “travel better and sustainably”, you’ll probably have a difficult time justifying it.

What could work instead is a claim comparing against a previous product or competitor product (“greener” or “friendlier”). In a SAF context, where different types of SAF exist and uptake may differ between airlines, this might be “one of the greenest” or “Fly more sustainably”, although remember that you’ll need to include the basis for which the claim has been used and be able to substantiate it.

Take into account the full life cycle

Generally the more specific and narrow the claim, the easier and more straightforward it will be to substantiate it. This is particularly relevant considering that, unless an ad states otherwise, environmental claims will need to take the full life cycle of the product or service into account – this means assessing its impact in its entirety, from cradle to grave (or from maiden flight to fini-flight if you’ll indulge me another aviation reference).

For SAF this might include the more obvious environmental impact of the flight itself, but also any impact that results from its production. This will differ depending on the type of SAF, but the ASA has previously seen examples including the diversion of biofuels from other sectors which might then revert back to fossil derived fuels, and the impact of land use changes, both direct and indirect. Where services are directly linked with aviation, it’s likely that claims will be taken in the context of the full life cycle of aviation operations generally, including where aircraft aren’t directly owned or operated.

Remember that nigh on impossible task mentioned earlier for absolute claims?

You might instead attach an environmental claim to a specific part of the process (the flight only for example), and that means that you would only need to hold evidence for the life cycle of that specific part, rather than the whole.

What can often be effective is taking a step back from the creative process at the initial stages and approaching it from a different angle. What claim would you like to make? What evidence do you currently hold? Is there enough there to make a more limited or specific claim? What evidence would you need to help substantiate a broader claim and is that achievable?

SAF being unique to your business and exaggerating fuel mix

You might argue that as a concept SAF is unique, but the practical use of it won’t be. The SAF Mandate is a legal obligation for fuel suppliers in the UK, so it’s important to remember that other companies will be adhering to it as well. If you refer to SAF in your ads, be careful that you don’t suggest that it’s an exclusive initiative or something that only you’re implementing. Be careful to also ensure that you don’t exaggerate your company’s role in the use and uptake of SAF.

Similarly, you’ll want to avoid any suggestion that your fuel mix contains more SAF than it actually does. There’ll be quite a few ways of achieving this, but initially you’ll want to have the likely interpretation in mind. For example, you might think about avoiding blanket statements, making clear in some way that the fuel mix contains SAF in part, or including the specific percentage of SAF contained within the fuel mix.

It’s easy to get caught up in the detail of sectoral targets and net-zero deadlines, but decarbonisation is also about opportunity. We’re not just reducing emissions; we’re building new systems with new priorities. The shift to a low-carbon economy is the greatest chance in generations to create a fairer, greener society where lasting, well-paid, and environmentally responsible jobs become the norm for everyone.

Nowhere is this more visible than in West Cumbria, where Carbon Neutral Fuels (CNF) is preparing to deliver a landmark project that combines climate action with economic renewal.

Backed by £7.4 million in grant funding from the UK Government’s Advanced Fuels Fund, CNF is advancing plans for a state-of-the-art green fuel facility near the Port of Workington. Online in 2031, this facility will produce Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and is expected to generate more than 2,000 jobs during its construction phase, sustaining over 50 full-time, skilled roles once operational. These are not short-term wins but long-term, future-proofed opportunities that make the West Cumbrian coastline an integral part of the new green economy.

A proud industrial legacy

The choice of West Cumbria is more than strategic; it’s symbolic. Having lived in the area, CNF’s Co-founder, Sophie, knows that this county has long powered Britain. Much of the coal that fueled our Industrial Revolution was mined from its hills. A century later, Cumbria became the heart of the nuclear age when Queen Elizabeth II opened the world’s first commercial nuclear power station at Calder Hall in 1956. Known as the ‘Energy Coast’, since the 2000s, the landscape is now home to multiple renewables projects delivering the new age of clean, green power.

Today, CNF’s sustainable aviation fuel project writes the next chapter in that industrial story. At full capacity, the Workington facility will produce 25,000 tonnes of green jet fuel annually, reducing lifecycle emissions by up to 89% compared to traditional fossil jet fuel.

From coal to nuclear to clean aviation, Britain’s Energy Coast continues to show how regional industry can shape national progress.

Aviation’s challenge and opportunity

The aviation sector is an unlikely hero in any sustainability story. Without intervention, it’s projected to be responsible for around 22% of global carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Batteries and hydrogen may help other forms of transport, but for long-haul flights, the weight and energy density challenges remain unsolved. Zero- emission aircraft aren’t likely to be adopted at scale before 2050. That’s where eSAF comes in.

eSAF (sustainable aviation fuel made using electricity) uses just low-carbon electricity, water, and captured carbon dioxide to make jet fuel that works in today’s aircraft without modification. For governments, it’s both a climate breakthrough and an industrial opportunity. For many airlines, alongside biofuels, it’s one of the few realistic options for meeting near-term climate commitments.

The Department for Transport estimates that low-carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the UK economy by 2050. That’s why, in July 2025, it invested £63m across 17 UK projects to deliver clean fuel for the industry, with CNF’s ASAP-DAC consortium receiving £6m, the largest award for an e-fuels project in this funding round. The scale of this support builds upon their previous win in 2023 of £1.4m and reflects strong government confidence in both the technology and CNF’s vision.

As the MP for Workington and Whitehaven, Josh MacAlister, put it:

‘The £6m government funding boost announced today is a real vote of confidence in our area and it will help to fast-track the project to a final investment decision.’

Such backing is critical. Government investment not only signals trust but also unlocks private capital, ensuring the UK can compete internationally as more countries move to establish SAF production. For West Cumbria, it means momentum; for the UK, it marks another step towards Jet Zero by 2050.

According to CNF, Workington was chosen not just for its infrastructure, but for the ambition palpable within the community. The energy transition can’t only be about abstract policy and emissions curves; it has to mean something on the ground. ASAP-DAC is designed to deliver more than fuel. It’s about enabling long-term, well-paid jobs, up-skilling for the local community, and creating a pipeline of skilled work that lasts.

How it works

At the heart of the Workington facility is ASAP-DAC: Advancing Sustainable Aviation via Power-to-Liquid and Direct Air Capture. The process brings together a world-first combination of technologies at commercial scale.

Here’s how it works:

Electricity + water + CO2: The plant uses renewable electricity to power Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC). These convert water and carbon dioxide into syngas, which consists of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

CO2 capture: Around 90% of the carbon dioxide will come from biogenic sources such as farm waste, and 10% directly from the atmosphere using Direct Air Capture technology.

Fuel synthesis: The syngas generated by SOEC is then combined in a Fischer- Tropsch reactor to create long-chain hydrocarbons.

Refining: These hydrocarbons are then refined into synthetic kerosene, certified under ASTM D7566, suitable for blending with Jet A-1 aviation fuel.

The result: 25,000 tonnes of certified eSAF per year, delivering an 89% lifecycle emissions reduction compared with fossil fuels.

This isn’t a lab experiment. It’s a first-of-its-kind commercial facility designed to meet over 35% of the UK’s eSAF mandate in its first year of operation.

A national model

What’s taking shape in West Cumbria offers a model for the rest of the country. It shows that when government policy aligns with private innovation, the UK can build the industries of the future on the foundations of its industrial past.

As demand for SAF accelerates internationally, Britain faces a clear choice: import fuels and forfeit the economic value, or manufacture them domestically, creating jobs, skills, and resilience in regions that need them most.

The Workington project demonstrates that with the right support, the UK can lead.

The future of CNF

Workington is just the beginning for CNF. Aviation is their first focus, but their technology has the potential to serve other hard-to-decarbonise sectors like shipping in the years ahead. Wherever it takes them, the CNF ethos goes beyond clean fuel and into the communities they partner with, giving communities like West Cumbria a stake in a cleaner, fairer future.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Picture1_bigger.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 06:56:33.543409

“Global SAF production could potentially reach 400 million tonnes by 2050,” the study noted.","A lack of technology rollout and infrastructure, rather than feedstock shortages, is the biggest obstacle to scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a new study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), reports Australian Aviation.

The study found there is sufficient feedstock to allow the global airline industry to reach net zero emissions within the next 25 years. Airlines will require about 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to hit that target. IATA estimated potential feedstock at 12,000 million tonnes by mid-century, although less than 35 per cent will be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing demands.

Currently, commercial-scale SAF production relies almost exclusively on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). IATA said the slow development of alternative production facilities has created a gap between potential and actual output.

“Global SAF production could potentially reach 400 million tonnes by 2050,” the study noted. “This would still leave a shortfall of about 100 million tonnes. Closing the gap will require better conversion efficiencies, faster technology rollout, stronger feedstock logistics, and major investment in infrastructure.”

IATA director-general Willie Walsh stressed that the report shows feedstock supply is not the barrier. “There is enough sustainable feedstock to achieve net zero by 2050. The challenge is scaling production. We need shovels in the ground now,” he said.

Walsh urged policymakers and energy companies to accelerate investment, saying the findings amount to an urgent call to action. “We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” he said.

The study comes as the Australian Government ramps up its support for low-carbon fuels. Earlier this month, it announced a $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program to be spent over the next decade. The scheme aims to attract private sector investment into domestic production of cleaner fuels, including SAF. The first “drop-in” fuels that can directly substitute conventional jet fuel are expected by 2029.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-01.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 06:56:40.683902

The EU has imposed duties to protect domestic SAF production. The measures make imported SAF more expensive, giving EU producers an advantage. In addition, ReFuelEU mandates SAF blending from to 70% by 2050, while UK rules set higher targets in the short term and limit HEFA use.

EU Targets SAF Imports

The EU has added sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to its trade defence measures on imports of biofuels from the US, Indonesia and Argentina.

The EU has extended its anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, effective September 15, to cover SAF under existing trade defence rules. The move responds to protests from the European biofuel industry and ensures consistent application of EU trade defence measures.

The new measures in the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation are intended to protect the EU market from unfairly priced or subsidised SAF, create a level playing field for EU-produced fuels, and support domestic SAF production.

Source: USDA

Imports of SAF from the US, Indonesia and Argentina now face combined duties. For example, US SAF is subject to duties of EUR 211–409/tonne, making it more expensive in the EU.

ReFuelEU mandates blending SAF into aviation fuel, starting with 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050, with specific targets for advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels. By establishing binding requirements for all flights originating in the EU, the regulation aims to create a stable and competitive environment for SAF, encouraging investment and production within the EU to meet climate goals.

EU and UK SAF Rules Drive Market Change

According to various sources, SAF mandates are reshaping the aviation fuel market. The EU and UK impose steep non-compliance penalties, turning regulatory requirements into a strategic lever for those who act early. Non-compliance is costly. Penalties range from two to 13 times the cost of compliance, particularly in the UK, making long-term planning essential to mitigate risk.

Beginning in 2025, ReFuelEU mandated that aviation fuel suppliers offer a minimum percentage of SAF and e-SAF (SAF produced from renewable energy sources) at EU airports. By 2030, suppliers must blend at least 6% SAF, including 1.2% e-SAF.

To discourage tankering practices (carrying excess fuel for return trips, which increases emissions), ReFuelEU Aviation requires airline operators to refuel at least 90% of their annual aviation fuel needs at the EU airport of departure.

In parallel, the UK Department for Transport (DfT) mandates a higher SAF blend of 9.5% by 2030 and places greater emphasis on reducing reliance on hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) SAF, which face eventual feedstock supply limits. HEFA’s allowable share will decline annually, from 100% in 2025 to 42% in 2040.

Cambridge University Press & Assessment, which transports over 1.5 million kilos of exam-related materials through DHL, had identified freight as a significant source of its greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 25% of the organization’s measured emissions. The use of GoGreen Plus is expected to reduce their carbon footprint by c. 1,500 metric tons CO2e WtW annually.

Guy Nicholson, deputy managing director of global operations, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, said, “We are already taking significant steps to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chain, and overall we have reduced our direct energy-related carbon emissions by 35% since 2019. This work with DHL builds on our commitment to environmental responsibility and will support us in achieving our broader carbon reduction targets by significantly reducing our freight emissions.”

Duncan Heron, VP, DHL Express, said, “Our customers are increasingly focused on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, and we’re delighted to be able to work with Cambridge University Press & Assessment in their sustainability journey.

“Through GoGreen Plus, we’re providing a powerful tool that enables our clients to cut emissions in their own supply chains. As SAF remains a leading solution for decarbonizing aviation, it’s an effective way for us to help our customers achieve their sustainability goals”.

Insetting through GoGreen Plus allows customers to bring down their Scope 3 emissions, the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in a company's value chain, including downstream transportation and distribution. The service uses the book and claim approach, which enables DHL to directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within their network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported using these fuels. GoGreen Plus is part of DHL Group's sustainability commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Seattle’s working waterfront is the beating heart of our city. This month’s grand opening of the new Waterfront Park is the result of decades of work by many people. I’m proud of how the Port of Seattle was part of this effort.

The transformation of the waterfront marks a new chapter in Seattle’s history. To learn more about our contributions to the past and future of Seattle’s working waterfront, read the Seattle Times op-ed I recently co-authored with the Port’s executive director, Steve Metruck.

In it, we assert Seattle isn’t just a city with a port, we’re a port city. But today, more Seattleites than ever feel disconnected from the working waterfront — resulting in a growing affliction of ""maritime blindness."" To maintain our nautical heritage and the economic benefits of a strong maritime industry here, we’ll need to work closely with our partners in city, state, and federal governments.

This new waterfront is just the beginning. While we remain focused on creating good-paying maritime jobs, we continue to look for ways for community and commerce to coexist by helping create scenic bike and pedestrian paths as well as expanding waterfront parks that don’t conflict with maritime operations.

If you’re interested in learning more about the waterfront’s history, head over to Elliott Bay Book Company to purchase History Link’s latest book, “Where the City Meets the Sound.”

New bike paths at Pier 66 and Terminal 91

The Port’s bike path projects at Bell Harbor Cruise Terminal and Terminal 91, near Magnolia. highlight exactly the kinds of projects I’m talking about when it comes to striking that balance. Earlier this month, reporters came to Terminal 91 to view the demolition of what I’ve been referring to as the “bridge to nowhere” — a too-narrow, outdated pedestrian bridge. It took three years — far longer than it should have — to overcome BNSF’s resistance to this project. Thanks to the hard work of Port staff and our construction team, a new cycling path is slated to be complete by the end of this month. You can find more coverage of the project in the Seattle Times and on KIRO.

In August, I joined Mayor Bruce Harrell and other city officials to celebrate the completion of a new bike path in front of Pier 66 that will enable cyclists to bike along the waterfront safely — even while we have cruise ships loading and unloading goods and passengers.

I’m particularly proud of these mutually beneficial achievements, in light of conflicts that have occurred between bicyclists and industry in other parts of the city.

Learning how to make sustainable aviation fuel in the Tri-Cities

When it comes to the future of low-impact flight, eastern Washington is leading the way. Air travel contributes 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The fastest way to reduce this impact is to fly without fossil fuels. Local companies and Washington State University (WSU) have teamed up to advance the science of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

I had the chance to join a group of officials from the Port and economic development organizations here for a trip to the Tri-Cities, where we toured WSU’s lab and saw presentations from the companies involved in this effort. WSU’s researchers, together with talented entrepreneurs and established industry players, are doing what it takes to deliver SAF on a commercial scale.

At the heart of this effort is WSU’s Tri-Cities-based Sustainable Options for Aviation Research (SOAR) Lab, which provides cutting-edge testing to ensure SAF blends are safe, efficient, and compatible with today’s aircraft. A coalition of private and public partners — including the Port of Seattle — is fostering not just research capacity but also the supply chains, infrastructure, and policy support necessary to make the SAF we need to cut pollution in the aviation sector. They’re proving that sustainable fuel isn’t just a vision for the future — it’s an industry Washington is building today, with the potential to transform aviation around the world.

To continue our commitment to advancing the use of SAF, the Port has become a member of the recently formed Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Institute. The Institute is led by Snohomish County and supported by WSU, Boeing, Alaska Airline, Earth Finance, the Port, and others. This first-of-its-kind global initiative is focused on reducing the economy’s dependence on carbon-based fuels by accelerating SAF adoption through enhanced commercialization of innovative clean fuels solutions.

Pacific Ports Association Conference in Nanaimo, British Columbia

In August, I took a trip to Nanaimo, British Columbia for the Pacific Ports Association (PPA) 11th annual meeting where I learned about the innovative approaches ports are taking across the Pacific Rim to address the uncertainties associated with tariffs and other challenges facing the maritime industry.

I heard some fantastic speakers on a variety of topics. We talked about the ways ultra-modern terminals (including Seattle’s T5) are handling cargo. We discussed how autonomous vehicles are providing benefits for security and sustainability. And I learned more about the way shore power is changing the ferry industry for the better — something that Seattle is about to see a lot more of in the coming years. It was a fantastic forum for sharing some of the latest best practices and innovations that are driving our industry forward through uncertain times.

As you can see, I’ve stayed busy this summer but still found time to savor the sunshine.

The first agreement made with Microsoft covers the supply of low-carbon steel from Stegra’s Boden facility, while the second introduces a system of environmental attribute certificates (EACs) tied to the production of that steel.
The EAC agreement separates the environmental value of green steel from the physical product.
As such, buyers of the physical steel must agree not to make sustainability claims, preventing double counting.
But when physical delivery isn’t yet feasible, signing agreements for environmental attribute certificates demonstrates that emissions reductions are possible in the value chain through credible market mechanisms.","Swedish green iron and steel maker Stegra announced two agreements with Microsoft aimed at advancing the use of near-zero emission steel in the technology company’s datacenter operations.

Founded in 2020, Stegra utilizes hydrogen produced using green power to remove the oxygen from iron oxide, avoiding most of the CO2 emissions normally produced, and uses electricity from 100% renewable sources for the energy requirements generated in the manufacturing process.

The first agreement made with Microsoft covers the supply of low-carbon steel from Stegra’s Boden facility, while the second introduces a system of environmental attribute certificates (EACs) tied to the production of that steel.

Henrik Henriksson, CEO of Stegra, said:

“Sustainable change calls for unconventional partnerships. We are now teaming up with a market leader in Microsoft, to demonstrate how we can work together to accelerate change in the steel industry.”

The physical supply deal will see Stegra deliver steel produced with up to 95% fewer emissions than conventional methods.

While Microsoft does not directly purchase raw materials, it will work with suppliers who will receive coils from Stegra and process them into components for Microsoft’s datacenter equipment.

The EAC agreement separates the environmental value of green steel from the physical product. The steel itself can be sold as conventional, while the associated emissions reductions are sold through certificates.

As such, buyers of the physical steel must agree not to make sustainability claims, preventing double counting. Microsoft can then apply the EACs toward its carbon reduction goals.

Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer at Microsoft, said:

“The end game is to source physical materials with the lowest possible CO₂ footprint. Achieving this requires greater volumes of low-carbon steel available in more regions. But when physical delivery isn’t yet feasible, signing agreements for environmental attribute certificates demonstrates that emissions reductions are possible in the value chain through credible market mechanisms.

“Reaching this level is a daunting task and would represent a major scale-up in SAF capacity. However, it also reveals a significant shortfall of around 100 Mt.

“In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.”

The company is an Australian clean-tech startup working to enable Australasia’s first hydrogen-electric flights.

This hydrogen fuel cell testing has been made possible with the support of Air New Zealand, Hiringa Energy and the NZ Product Accelerator hosted by University of Auckland.

Stralis Aircraft is developing fuel cells to power hydrogen-electric propulsion systems for aircraft and other heavy transport applications that offer high performance and low operating costs.

Their proprietary high temperature PEM fuel-cell technology is lighter than alternatives, enabling aircraft to fly ten times further than battery-electric solutions at a lower cost than fossil-fuel-powered planes. The company is already testing its fuel cells in the U.S. and Japan but has now started testing closer to home in New Zealand.

The testing will provide data to help Stralis understand degradation mechanisms and degradation rates to support a credible lifetime assessment for the fuel cell system product.

Achieving long life HTPEM fuel cells is important to deliver engine maintenance cost savings to airline customers. This measured data will help quantify maintenance savings and encourage adoption of the technology.

Stralis’s propulsion technology delivers benefits like:

Zero emissions (producing only water vapor)

Up to 50% lower operating costs

Reduced noise

Their system integrates their fuel cells, liquid hydrogen tanks, and electric motors into existing and new aircraft designs. It plans to achieve the first flight of its six-seat Bonanza A36 technology demonstrator aircraft later in 2025 in Queensland, Australia.

Stuart Johnstone, co-founder and CTO of Stralis Aircraft says, “We are proud to be working with Air New Zealand to test our unique fuel cell technology in their engine test facility at Auckland Airport. New Zealand is an ideal location to develop, test and adopt emission free aircraft technology, so it is a great place to build capability and understanding.”

Johnstone continued, “The test cell is attractive because it has lots of capacity to grow and enable testing of our higher power systems. It is great to be working with businesses in Australasia to make hydrogen-electric and zero-emission aviation a reality. With the help of our Kiwi partners, we have managed to get the test cell operational in “record” time”.

Air New Zealand’s Sustainability Lead Energy Transition Matthew Connolly says, “Across Air New Zealand we have a significant programme dedicated to preparing for the future of flight, and the energy transition is a critical part of this work.”

Connolly added, “That’s where opening the engine test cell facility to innovative companies such as Stralis comes in, as another step in our collective learning about new technologies, future engine propulsion, and new ways that aircraft will fly people and goods in a lower-carbon future.”

“We believe Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), hydrogen and electricity will all be critical parts of a future aviation eco-system, and we’re proud to be supporting the innovation that Stralis is testing here in New Zealand,” he concluded.

Hydrogen-electric propulsion systems have fewer moving parts and operate at lower temperatures compared to existing aircraft engines, which is predicted to reduce engine maintenance costs by between 40-60%. This is similar to the maintenance cost reductions seen between combustion engine and electric cars.

The hydrogen, stored onboard in a tank, powers a fuel cell that generates electricity to power an electric motor, which drives a propellor.

Airlines are estimated to need 500mn tonnes (Mt) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve the industry’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

This can be achieved from two main sources- biomass and power-to-liquid, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Biomass has the potential to produce more than 300Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL) will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximising the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

Recently, IATA in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely the slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources and competition with other potential users of the same feedstock.

Currently, the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised.

According to the report, there are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonise aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200Mt from e-SAF.

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry remain a major challenge.

Other major challenges, according to IATA, are: Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure, which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Asean identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialisation, and align their business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.

IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.

“The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

Industry analysts say hitting net-zero aviation by 2050 is huge, technically possible, but it won’t happen by accident.

The industry must scale SAF fast, modernise fleets, squeeze out operational savings, build hydrogen and PtL capacity, and deploy robust policy and finance — all co-ordinated internationally and backed by strict sustainability and verification — to credibly reach net-zero by 2050.",https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2025/09/24/360904.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 17:56:37.881744

[2] Allocation of planned storage capacity to these entities assumes that storage projects developed by joint ventures are divided by ownership share.","In 2024, the EU broke new ground by requiring oil and gas producers to start building the CO₂ storage infrastructure needed to reach its climate goals. Under the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), these companies must deliver 50 million tonnes of annual CO2 injection capacity by 2030 — a target critical to keeping industrial decarbonisation on track. Analysis by the Clean Air Task Force shows some international oil companies are well prepared, while several regional operators face steep shortfalls. With national governments now tasked with setting penalties by July 2026, the next two years will determine whether this landmark law drives real investment or risks uneven progress across the EU.

The past few months have seen some major milestones in the implementation of the carbon capture and storage requirements of the NZIA, including the European Commission’s Decision identifying the contributions of the obligated producers. As stipulated under Article 23 of the regulation, these contributions are allocated to holders of production licences in proportion to the share of oil and gas they produced between 2020 and 2023. The Decision identifies 44 obligated entities which produced oil or gas in the EU over the relevant period, and excludes smaller producers which collectively contributed 5% of the total volume (see Figure).[1]

Figure 1. The CO2 storage capacity obligations of all 44 licence-holding entities identified by the European Commission.

Are oil and gas producers on track to meet their obligations?

Following the publication of the Commission’s Decision, CATF’s CO2 storage tracker has featured our analysis of how the company obligations compare with the storage capacity they currently have under development. As many of the obligated entities are joint ventures or local subsidiaries, it is useful to rationalise the list into parent companies (Figure 2). These entities, which include international oil majors such as Shell, Exxon, and TotalEnergies, as well as regional producers with significant state ownership, will be functionally responsible for delivering on the storage obligation. While our analysis has partitioned the obligations of joint ventures according to ownership stakes, in reality the partners may reach different agreements on how they collectively meet the target capacity.

Figure 2. Estimated scale of company obligations under Article 23 of the NZIA and corresponding shares of planned storage capacity in the EU

Over 80% of the 50 Mt/year target is to be delivered by just 12 companies, and around half of the target by only five companies. Should their current storage projects progress according to announced schedules, Shell, Eni, and TotalEnergies are on track to meet their obligations, with the potential to expand further beyond 2030.[2] In contrast, national oil and gas companies in Romania (OMV Petrom and Romgaz) and Poland (Orlen) are in a challenging position, with significant obligations but little or no announced capacity under development in the EU. The regulation has noticeably accelerated activity within these companies and fortunately both countries offer promising geology for CO2 storage. Orlen are investigating potential CO2 storage sites in central Poland and offshore, while OMV Petrom have recently begun exploring a storage site near Botesti.

The companies are not required to satisfy their obligation alone; the regulation allows them to reach agreements between themselves or with other storage developers, providing some flexibility to those entities currently facing a shortfall. The CATF storage tracker identifies potential for another 5 Mt/year of capacity that could feasibly be operational by 2030, which is under development by non-obligated entities. As can be seen in Figure 2, there are also obligated entities which may have surplus capacity in 2030, such as Nordsøfonden in Denmark and Energean in Greece (through its CO2 storage-focused subsidiary Enearth).

In June, the producers were required to submit plans to the Commission detailing how they intend to meet their respective targets – these have not been publicly released. However, starting from June 2026, they will need to submit annual progress reports which will be made public by the Commission..

Next steps to deliver on the target: Effective penalties and Member State support

What remains to be done to ensure the storage target is met on schedule? By 30 June 2026, Member States are required to establish penalties for any infringements of the obligation – a provision which was one of several amendments proposed by CATF and Article 23 Project partners during the NZIA’s consultation process. Penalties can be on an administrative or legal basis and must be ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ (a standard wording in EU law). Effective penalties will be essential to ensuring the obligated producers progress their storage plans in good faith, at the pace required, and dedicating appropriate financial resources.

Compared to some other environmental legislation in the EU, the legislative text offers relatively little guidance on how penalties should be designed. There is therefore potential for significant divergence between Member States and a risk of slower progress by some companies and a disparity in the options available to decarbonising industries. Although obligated entities are not required to develop CO2 storage in the same region as their production activities, they will be subject to penalties according to the Member State in which they are registered. As shown in Figure 3, companies based in the Netherlands, Romania, Italy and Germany represent the majority of the obligation, so penalty design in these jurisdictions will have the most impact on the success of the regulation.

Figure 3. Article 23 obligations according to country of origin of the obligated company

Environmental penalties regimes in the EU have been designed in various ways, and can include administrative fines, periodic penalty payments, and criminal penalties enforced through national courts. Administrative fines are likely to form a key part of penalty design under Article 23, and must be set at a level which effectively deters companies preferring to pay the fine than invest in storage. Fines are typically linked either to the environmental cost, such as the carbon price under the ETS, or the cost of compliance. For example, ReFuel Aviation, which requires aviation fuel suppliers to provide a growing proportion of sustainable aviation fuel, includes penalties for shortfalls of at least twice the cost difference between conventional and synthetic aviation fuel.

For Article 23, penalties could be linked to the volume of ‘unstored’ CO2 emissions and an appropriate carbon price level. Assuming the current penalty level for ETS non-compliance (around €130/t) or at a projected ETS price for 2030[3], these fines could clearly become very substantial, reaching over a hundred million euros for every Mt/year of shortfall. Fines on this scale are unusual – if not unprecedented – in the EU and, while they would represent less than 1% of the annual revenue of the international oil majors, they would be much more significant for regional players like Romgaz. The upfront cost of delivering a storage project at the million tonne scale could easily be on this order of magnitude for offshore storage developments, while onshore sites may be significantly cheaper.[4] Storage project developers are expected to make a reasonable return on their investment by charging the industries which use the infrastructure, so any estimate of compliance ‘cost’ may need to reflect this return relative to the value of alternative investment in oil and gas production.

Strong penalties must also be accompanied by support from Member State governments for storage developers. First-mover countries like Denmark and the Netherlands have well-established procedures for awarding CO2 storage exploration licences and permits, supported by adequately resourced government departments and permitting agencies. In comparison, Poland, Romania and Germany must still put in place some of the procedures, regulations and institutional expertise that will allow their obligated entities to develop capacity within their own areas of operation, rather than buying into projects in other countries. Easy access to geological data also appears to remain a challenge in some Member States, despite provisions within the NZIA to ensure better data sharing. Enabling this greater regional diversity is vital to ensuring the obligation supports the decarbonisation needs of industrial emitters across the EU.

CATF project tracking determines the 50 Mt target is challenging to meet by 2030 under the announced schedule for planned projects, but the obligation should lead to accelerated deployment and new projects. To maintain ambitious deployment timelines, penalties will need to provide a real disincentive to delaying investment, without negatively impacting the ability of smaller entities to deliver on their obligation when they are actively progressing projects. Project deployment will necessarily be subject to timelines dictated by permitting authorities and local engagement strategies. Penalty designs should therefore consider allowing for such mitigating circumstances where developers are demonstrably acting at pace and with appropriate investment, particularly if shortfalls can be recouped once a project is operational. Obtaining exploration licences and initiating applications for full storage permits could be considered a prerequisite for obligated entities to demonstrate reasonable effort, but would need to be backed by real resources and other steps to advance the project.

However, companies should also be expected to build contingency into their plans by exploring a range of possible storage sites. Penalties can be increased under aggravating circumstances, for example, where companies are deemed particularly negligent, untransparent, or uncooperative, and repeated where companies fail to address shortfalls.

As part of a joint initiative with Carbon Balance and Bellona Europa, CATF will continue to track progress and compliance with Article 23, through the live storage tracker, annual reports, and regular policy briefs.

[1] Notably, several of the exempt entities listed in the Commission Decision are subsidiaries of other obligated entities, including Wintershall Dea International, Vermilion Hungary, and Energean Oil and Gas.

[2] Allocation of planned storage capacity to these entities assumes that storage projects developed by joint ventures are divided by ownership share. Shares of capacity belonging to non-obligated entities (e.g. Snam (Ravenna) and EBN (Aramis storage sites)) are partitioned among the obligated partners.

EPA considers wastewater injection permit for Montana Renewables in Pondera County

Evans serves as vice president of government relations for Montana Renewables.

However, Pondera County officials oppose the proposal, citing environmental concerns.

""The commissioners had been assured this would be such a good thing for Pondera County, but the more we looked into it, we thought this if this wastewater migrated into any of the usable aquifers, it could be disastrous,"" Corrine Rose said.

Rose is the Pondera County sanitarian.

Evans said Montana Renewables will comply with all EPA requirements for water quality standards.

""What I can confirm is that what EPA requires from a water quality perspective, for any injection water, we will meet or exceed that,"" Evans said.

Rose also criticized how the EPA has characterized the community in its assessment.

""They characterize us as being, we're losing population and low population. Well, we're important too, and I agree that that's a little offensive. So that is not a reason to then use this area as a waste disposal site,"" Rose said.

We will update you as we get more information.

(JUNE 3, 2024) Many Pondera County and Rocky Mountain Front residents are concerned over a proposed plan to classify wells in the area to Class V, which would allow wastewater from Montana Renewables to be injected thousands of feet below into the Madison Aquifer.

Montalban Oil & Gas is seeking permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, so Montana Renewables can inject their wastewater into the earth.

Pondera County citizens concerned over proposed injection well plan

Montana Renewables create sustainable aviation fuel. To do so they clean feedstocks, creating a by-product referred to as ‘agricultural wash water’. They’re working with Montalban Oil & Gas who are looking to receive permits from the EPA to give the wells Class V distinction. This would permit the injection of treated non-hazardous waste which may have been hazardous prior. Water is taken from the Missouri river.

Some critics have called the extraction of water from the Missouri River to be resource shedding, and damaging to the ecosystem. The water that is pulled goes into an aquifer and not back into the river.

“They need to put up a treatment plant. So at least the City of Great Falls can use that water with that amount of water being taken out of the river,” says David Waldner, a Hutterite living in a colony just a mile or so from one of the proposed injection sites.

Some individuals are calling on Montana Renewables to invest in a treatment plant, so the water can be put back into the river rather than wasted. The company are due to receive a $600 million loan. With he money, they plan to upscale production instead. Montana Renewables have said they plan to submit a discharge permit application to treat their wastewater at the city of Great Falls Water Treatment Plant.

Water planned to be injected has been characterized by Montana Renewables as non-hazardous. Some people are unsure. The Pondera County Sanitarian, Corrine Rose, says despite multiple requests for a sample of injection fluid, she has been repeatedly denied.

When I spoke with Chad Anderson of the Montana DEQ, he told me that Montana Renewables has the responsibility to send in fluid for sampling and testing. With their current Class II permits, they send their sample to Montana Board of Oil & Gas. If the Class V permits are granted, they will send a sample to the EPA. Because the permits haven’t been granted, they have no legal obligation to share their samples with anybody else. If the injection permit is granted, a sample can be shared with the public by way of petition.

Critics who believe Montana Renewables are ‘hiding something’ by withholding their sample say this is counter-intuitive because at this point the fluid would already be in the process of being injected.

I received a letter from the CEO of Montana Renewables Bruce Fleming, which was also sent to Pondera County Commissioners. In it, he outlined a response to some concerns, especially those regarding the contamination of drinking wells. The letter states that the Madison Aquifer (where wastewater will be injected) is not drinkable and that the aquifer does not contact surface water supplies based off geology and experience. It also states the permit they hope to receive would put a ‘cap’ on the maximum quantity of water allowed for injection. The proposed amount being a “tiny fraction of a percent in an enormous, non-potable, deep aquifer.”

The EPA are no longer holding public comment sessions, and many living along the Rocky Mountain Front believe the permits will be granted imminently.

“They're willing to do this because there's not many people there. Well, there's still people there that live in these areas of these two injection wells and those people, according to the Constitution of the state of Montana, have a right to dignity,” says another concerned Montanan, Nathan White.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d8a56e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Fa7%2F3da7cf2f4ebb87a030c696ad04bb%2Fkrtv00002.png,N,,2025-09-24 16:56:32.652814

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is typically made from agricultural waste such as sugarcane, tallow, canola and cooking oils and can reduce emissions from aircraft by 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

But the UNSW project deploys an electrolyser that uses low-cost metals, carbon catalysts and renewable energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into fuel precursors.

The approach could cut out the need for farm waste and make environmentally friendly fuel easier to produce at scale, project leader Rahman Daiyan said.

“Most of the work so far has been on bio-based sustainable aviation fuel projects,” he said.

“But those sort of biomass resources are limited to some extent.”

The Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program, established by the Federal Education Department, has awarded the UNSW research team an additional $1.2 million to scale up its technology.

While the electrolyser has been proven to work in a lab, Dr Daiyan said a validated prototype would be ready within six to nine months and the project would be commercialised with industry partners Tjindu Power and Chinese energy firm Chuangqi Times.

If successful, the project could help realise Australian ambitions to become a green fuel exporter, he said.

“One of the best aspects of this technology is that it allows us to leverage Australia’s potential — we want to be a hydrogen exporter or a low-carbon fuel exporter,” Dr Daiyan said.

“There is domestic demand but there is also overseas demand because apart from Singapore and Malaysia, there are not a lot of places to make SAF for the Asia Pacific region.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered to be one of the leading ways to reduce carbon emission from air travel and is in high demand worldwide after major airlines committed to using the fuel to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

A report by the CSIRO and aircraft maker Boeing, released last year, found Australia could lead the world in production of the sustainable fuel but warned it had made only moderate progress so far.

S Dinakar New Delhi

As crop burning season approaches in Punjab and Haryana, with winds carrying noxious fumes to Delhi, US-based LanzaTech is stepping in with technologies to convert waste and gaseous effluents into advanced biofuels such as ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It has tie-ups with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest refiner, and GAIL India, the state-run natural gas distributor.

Advanced biofuel technologies can power India’s vision of becoming a leading producer and exporter of renewable fuels such as renewable diesel and SAF — premium-priced transport fuels derived from waste or industrial gases. These could enhance energy security if the government incentivises industry and sets mandates for their use, according to Satinder Pal Singh, managing director, LanzaTech India, and research from Deloitte.

“Long-awaited, reasonable policy around carbon tax and premium pricing for fuels generated from waste and other non-food, non-fossil sources are interventions that will create such market signals,” Singh said in an interaction with Business Standard. “Simultaneously raising costs for entities who do not take demonstrable action and incentivising those that do is important.” Aviation turbine fuel accounted for 2.5 per cent of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, but airline emissions are harder to abate than ground transport.

Singh, an oil and gas veteran with 28 years at Shell and Adani TotalEnergies, is working with IOC to operationalise by year-end a 33 ktpa capacity “world’s first refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) to 3G ethanol project” at Panipat refinery. Sister company LanzaJet is also working with IOC to build a SAF plant at Panipat based on its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology with a 90 ktpa capacity. This will be India’s largest alcohol-to-jet SAF facility, Singh said. LanzaJet, co-founded by LanzaTech in 2020, is starting up the world’s first commercial-scale demonstration plant in Georgia, US.

With limited SAF blending mandates in India, exports to western nations are expected. The market for SAF and renewable biofuels has widened after Shell and BP scrapped large biofuel projects in Rotterdam. Deloitte estimates India could build 8–10 million tonnes of SAF capacity by 2040, far exceeding its projected domestic need of 0.8 million tonnes by 2030 at 5 per cent blending. This would attract Rs 6–7 trillion in capital investments. India could also add 3–4 million tonnes of renewable diesel capacity, Deloitte said, with global SAF demand projected at 18 million tonnes by 2050 to achieve net zero.

However, Singh cautioned that government intervention is needed. “Without forward pricing for 2G ethanol and easier access to credit for high-capex projects, the sector’s growth will remain constrained,” said Deepak Ballani, director general, Indian Sugar & Bio-energy Manufacturers Association. He added that the absence of long-term offtake agreements and export restrictions on ethanol also hinder growth.

The UK has committed over £215 million to low-carbon aviation fuel since 2021, with LanzaTech receiving £35 million, making it the largest recipient. In India, ethanol is classified as 1G when derived from food crops, 2G when from agri-residue, and 3G when from waste gases.

Singh said: “We see India as a manufacturing hub for our global projects. This has led us to partner with local engineering firms to adapt solutions for domestic and international markets. Some private equity firms have also shown interest in co-investing with us in India.”

Europe and the UK are valuable markets for India’s SAF because of blending mandates and limited domestic supply. Renewable SAF currently costs up to three times conventional jet fuel, which India exports to Europe. EU rules mandate only non-food feedstocks for SAF production, unlike ICAO guidelines, which permit agricultural crops.

LanzaTech’s strength lies in converting waste and industrial gases into fuels, aligned with EU rules. It is also working with GAIL India to valorise CO2. “While our technology is competitive, we need support in areas such as agri-residue and municipal solid waste through firm blending mandates,” Singh said. “As the ecosystem matures, this handholding should not be required beyond the first few projects.”

Regulatory Push: Government Mandates, Incentives and Net-Zero Targets

The aviation industry is under constant pressure, with regulators, investors, and passengers demanding stronger mandates to drive adoption beyond early adopters for a greener way to fly. Government and regulatory bodies are establishing region-specific frameworks to support SAF deployment, each tailored to local feedstock availability, energy policies, and decarbonization priorities.

Aviation Carbon Footprint Reduction: Four Emission Control Scenarios by 2040

Over the next 15 years, SAF will be the primary enabler of carbon footprint reduction in aviation, helping airlines meet near and mid-term net-zero milestones. Airlines are expected to steadily increase SAF utilization from today’s less than 1% of global jet fuel demand to double-digit blending levels by the late 2030s, driven by regulatory mandates in regions such as the EU, U.S., and parts of Asia.

Infrastructure and Supply Chain Hurdles: Saf Production is One Thing, While Distribution at Thousands of Airports Is Another.

Solving the infrastructure and distribution challenges as SAF needs to be produced at refineries, transported, and blended within existing supply chains requires new logistical capabilities and standardized quality control on a global scale. The SAF supply chain will prioritize the development of multimodal transportation networks, including pipelines, shipping routes, and road transportation, out of which pipelines & trucks will facilitate ~70% of SAF transportations globally, till 2040.

Saf Technology Breakthroughs: Multiple Pathways (Hefa, Achtj, Ft, Ptl) are Maturing.

A combination of technologies, operational measures, and market-based mechanisms is expected to shape the pathway to net-zero aviation by 2050. These will deliver the most significant contribution, accounting for 60-65% of total emissions reductions. Looking ahead, SAF through pathways like HEFA, Fischer-Tropsch, Alcohol-to-Jet, and Power-to-Liquid will significantly support aviation’s decarbonization, making it the key factor of sustainable air transport.

Global and Regional Addressable Market: North America Leads With ~40% Share In 2025, With Europe and Asia Catching Up.

According to MarketsandMarkets, the Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market size is estimated at USD 2.06 billion in 2025. It is projected to reach USD 25.62 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 65.5%. In terms of volume, the market is projected to grow from 0.30 billion gallons in 2025 to 3.68 billion gallons by 2030.

What’s Holding Saf Back and Expected Moves by 2030?

Availability of aviation biofuel feedstock: Waste oils, fats, residues, and algae are promising, but finite.

Industry partnership and deals: Long-term green aviation fuel production plans and airline deals are the key.

Reducing the SAF vs. Jet Fuel price gap: SAF is still 3–5x more expensive than fossil jet fuel.

In the end, SAF won’t solve the emissions problem of aviation alone. It represents one of the most critical pillars of aviation’s transition toward a net-zero future. It provides the sector with a viable, scalable, and immediate solution to decarbonization while maintaining the performance, reliability, and energy density required for global air transport. SAF, such as biojet fuel, alcohol-to-jet fuel, power-to-liquid jet fuel, will remain the most practical alternative aviation fuel lever for the next decades.

Nature and industry transitions are unlocking investable opportunities, from regenerative agriculture to fossil-free steel; investable pipelines are growing across sectors.

With trillions in unmet financing needs for the Sustainable Development Goals, infrastructure and nature-positive transitions, leading investors will embed sustainability into their core strategy.

In 2025, sustainability has been overshadowed by geopolitics and election cycles dominating headlines. However, momentum around sustainable finance has not stalled.

Sustainable debt issuance topped $1 trillion in 2024 for the fifth consecutive year and private finance for nature has grown over elevenfold since 2020. This continued flow of capital reflects more than good intentions; rather, risks are becoming sharper.

Extreme weather, food insecurity and nature loss are actively reshaping economies and portfolios, making resilience a financial imperative, not a choice.

“

Nature finance is no longer emerging; those who act early will capture returns while helping set market-defining rules.

”

This year is about recalibrating for impact. Capital is entering food systems, nature, industry and infrastructure – embedding sustainability deeper into investment and corporate finance.

With available solutions, strengthening demand signals and increasingly measurable opportunities, the challenge now is execution. Leaders in banking, investment and policy have a narrow window to expediently scale solutions. Those who stay the course will protect portfolios and capture the first-mover advantage in the markets of tomorrow.

Connecting the real economy

Financing food systems transformation

Investors are moving beyond broad pledges and channelling capital into real-economy sectors – food systems are rising to the top.

Food underpins the global economy, accounting for 10% of gross domestic product and 40% of jobs. Yet, it is also highly vulnerable: droughts, floods and supply chain disruptions are driving inflation and destabilizing markets.

Transformation is necessary but it is also a major opportunity, as regenerative agriculture, resilient livestock practices and deforestation-free supply chains open new markets, diversify revenue streams and strengthen portfolios.

Momentum is already visible. Climate finance for agrifood systems rose over 300% since 2019, reaching $95 billion annually, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, while blended-finance vehicles are mobilizing billions annually across emerging markets.

A growing body of case studies demonstrates how capital is already being unlocked.

From Intesa Sanpaolo’s €23 billion programme extending reduced-rate loans to 172 agri-food supply chains in Italy, to GrowBeyond’s $100 million blended vehicle supporting smallholder farmers across the Association of Southeast Asian Nation states, and Aceli Africa’s $300 million mobilized across 3,500 loans to reach 1.5 million farmers and workers.

Despite the progress, agri-food systems require $1.1 trillion annually over the next five years, yet less than 5% of that is being met today. Closing this gap is critical but the trajectory is clear.

Financing the nature-positive transition

The world’s largest asset managers now recognize “nature capital” – biodiversity, water and soil – as fundamental to long-term performance.

The World Economic Forum estimates this opportunity to be $10 trillion in annual business value and nearly 400 million jobs by 2030 through nature-positive transitions.

Realizing this requires up to $2.7 trillion annually but capital flows are accelerating with private finance for nature growing from $9.4 billion in 2020 to more than $100 billion by 2024.

With nature underpinning the global economy, investors are starting to integrate it into portfolio assessments, closing the long-standing “data gap,” while pipelines of investable opportunities are expanding across sectors – from agri-food and chemicals to mining and water – supported by emerging financing models, policy frameworks and risk-sharing mechanisms.

Regulation is also advancing: the European Union’s (EU) Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the European Banking Authority’s Environmental, Social and Governance guidance and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures are tightening expectations for nature-related risk reporting.

Nature finance is no longer emerging; those who act early will capture returns while helping set market-defining rules.

Financing industrial decarbonization

Net zero is impossible without tackling heavy industry and transport. Steel, cement, aluminium, aviation, shipping and chemicals produce over one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions. These sectors are among the hardest to decarbonize, still tied to fossil feedstocks and energy-intensive processes.

Yet progress is lagging: only $250 billion has been mobilized against a $1.6 trillion need for low-carbon materials. Clean technologies such as green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and green ammonia exist but scaling is constrained by high upfront costs, fragmented demand and thin pipelines, especially in emerging economies.

The stakes are clear: delay risks stranded assets, disrupted supply chains, and lost growth.

“

For financial leaders, this is about shaping markets as much as preserving them.

”

Momentum is building. Sweden’s HYBRIT has delivered fossil-free steel to Volvo, Maersk is sailing methanol-fueled ships and Cemex is rolling out low-carbon cement across Latin America.

Governments are also shaping markets: the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is rewriting trade rules, Japan’s GX Promotion Act is directing subsidies and India, Brazil and Australia are betting on hydrogen hubs and green iron.

Finance is catching up too, with blended-capital vehicles, aviation fuel price floors and de-risking models for shipping and industrial clusters underway. Together, these moves show how demand signals, enabling policy and innovative finance are converging to shift from pilots to full-scale industrial transformation.

Financing infrastructure

The next bottleneck in the transition is not renewable capacity but the infrastructure that connects and stabilizes it. Modern grids, long-duration storage, resilient ports and digital platforms are the underfunded backbone of the energy transition, requiring $600 billion annually by 2030.

Already, grid congestion in Europe is delaying renewables, while power shortages in the Global South constrain growth and deployment. For investors, these assets combine stable, inflation-protected returns with systemic impact, making infrastructure a portfolio stabilizer and a growth opportunity.

Upgraded grids reduce losses and unlock stranded clean power. Meanwhile, storage smooths volatility and digital platforms optimize utilization, shielding portfolios from disruption. In short, infrastructure is where resilience meets return.

Financing for development

Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will require an additional $4 trillion annually, well beyond public budgets. At the once-a-decade International Conference on Financing for Development in Sevilla, leaders reaffirmed their commitment, backing a tripling of multilateral development banks’ lending capacity and greater use of blended finance to mobilize private capital.

For investors, this means expanding opportunities in emerging and developing economies, with development banks and finance institutions absorbing early risks. Development finance is shifting from aid to a platform for scalable, investable growth aligned with climate and sustainability goals.

A message to financial institutions

The next era of finance will be defined less by headlines than by discipline. Across food, nature, industry and infrastructure, investable opportunities are emerging and capital is already flowing. The test is which institutions have the conviction to stay the course.

For financial leaders, this is about shaping markets as much as preserving them. Those that embed sustainability as a core practice, stay steady through political cycles and build the skills, data and partnerships to turn ambition into execution will secure long-term advantage.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_sQ9tVY_2zBxt0EEqVxjOxOVbKRMy-wgf8Kq65NzyEzs.png,N,,2025-09-24 08:56:49.246993

The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state.
The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.
A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.
“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.","LINCOLN — A Kansas pipeline company is about to activate its $1.5 billion pipeline to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming and, along with it, launch a first-of-its-kind program to share some proceeds with rural communities along the pipeline route.

On Tuesday, officials with Tallgrass Energy said they would soon be shipping CO2 from the first of 11 ethanol plants connected to its pipeline — a converted, former natural gas pipeline — for a 392-mile trip across Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa and Wyoming.

In conjunction with the launch, Tallgrass announced it is making an initial donation of $500,000 to a fund managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation that could financially help more than 230 communities and community organizations on the route.

The company projects that more than $7 million will be distributed over 10 years through the “Trailblazer Community Investment Fund,” with the money targeted for local early childhood centers, elder care facilities and food pantries. That is on top of lease payments to landowners and spending more than $450,000 on disaster response training sessions and equipment purchases for the mostly rural, volunteer fire and rescue departments along the pipeline route.

The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state. The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.

“It’s important to us to strategically invest back into the communities who have supported the project’s development,” said Kyle Quackenbush, segment president at Tallgrass.

“We hope that these investments serve to provide a safety net to our neighbors throughout their lifetimes – from early childhood to eldercare – so that these communities can continue to grow and thrive,” he said.

A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.

Such pipelines in other states have generated opposition, as well as lawsuits and protests. In this case, though, extensive new rights of way weren’t necessary, and many landowners along the pipeline route grow corn, a crop expected to benefit from expanding the markets for corn-based ethanol by making the fuel more environmentally friendly.

Jane Kleeb, the founder of Bold Nebraska, said rural communities “deserve to benefit from the projects that impact them – whether that’s sharing in profits, investing in social services or simply having a seat at the project’s decision-making table.”

Kleeb said the agreement serves as a model for rural as well as urban communities impacted by such projects. She added that Tallgrass and Bold recently gave a presentation to officials with the NAACP.

The new pipeline, formerly the Trailblazer pipeline, is the first of its kind to begin operation as part of a push by the Biden Administration to reduce carbon emissions and make ethanol production more “green.” Making the biofuel less carbon-intensive could make it more attractive for states seeking environmental benefits, officials have said, and the pipeline will give Nebraska-produced ethanol an advantage in its use as sustainable aviation fuel, a new market for the biofuel.

“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.

Jeff Yost, president and CEO of Nebraska Community Foundation, said the new fund will target some of the biggest challenges facing rural communities — quality early childhood education, senior care and food insecurity — providing small grants to sustain jobs and services.

He said the foundation has already identified more than 230 organizations in the 31 impacted counties as eligible for a portion of the funds. To share in a portion of the funds, Yost said that qualified organizations will be invited to submit applications and verify that they are doing the work they profess to do.

Yost added that sometimes companies do this kind of fund sharing “for public relations purposes.”

Available to members of the Finnair for Business program, the new SAF service allows companies to monitor the flight emissions that their business trips generate.
“With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.” In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline aiming to triple that number this year.
Karppinen said: “The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant.
But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”","Finnair has launched the Finnair for Business SAF service for corporate customers keen to help reduce aviation emissions and boost the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Available to members of the Finnair for Business program, the new SAF service allows companies to monitor the flight emissions that their business trips generate.

They can then buy SAF environmental attributes – the quantified benefits of using sustainable aviation fuel rather than conventional jet fuel – to help lower the carbon footprint of flying.

Using a book-and-claim model, companies can make an associated claim to the environmental benefit their purchased attributes represent.

This means the actual emission reduction does not necessarily take place on the flight their employees travel on, as the fuel they purchase is not physically loaded into the aircraft.

The achieved reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sustainable aviation fuel use is verified by a third party, with the company receiving an audited SAF certificate that can be used for its sustainability reporting.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment said: “We want to develop flying in a more sustainable direction and are now taking steps on several different fronts.

“We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require cooperation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers.

“With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.”

In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline aiming to triple that number this year.

For example, Finnair collaborates with Neste to accelerate the adoption of SAF.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is made from 100% renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%* over the entire life cycle of the fuel compared to fossil kerosene.

Karppinen said: “The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant.

“However, the aviation fuel we use will not be fully renewable for a long time, since SAF is blended with fossil fuels. But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”",https://airlinergs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/09/Finnair-A350-Marimekko-Livery-Kivet-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 07:56:47.627967

High-purity CO2 for the food industry as an additional source of income

Prototype for the Flexpower Plus solution from Landmark, Rolls-Royce and ASCO

Rolls-Royce, energy services provider Landmark and carbon dioxide specialist ASCO have teamed up to commission a 10-megawatt gas engine power plant with a carbon capture system in the United Kingdom. Located in Worksop in the East Midlands region, the first tankers carrying purified and liquefied CO2 have already been picked up from the site for use in the food industry to carbonate beverages such as beer and lemonade.

The CO2 is extracted from the exhaust gases of the mtu gas engines - captured by a recovery system - processed, and liquefied. The plant will capture up to 30,000 tons of CO2 per year. The power plant feeds electricity into the grid for around 10,000 households and helps to ensure its stability. The heat produced by the combined heat and power mtu plants will be used both for carbon capture processes and to supply heat to households in the surrounding area.

“Flexible carbon capture gas engine power plants are an important technology for ensuring a stable decentralized energy supply while reducing CO2 emissions” explained Michael Stipa, Senior Vice President Business Development and Product Management Stationary Power Solutions at Rolls-Royce Power Systems. “This plant in Worksop is a great example of the future of sustainable energy and of a successful partnership between technology companies that want to make a difference.”

Rolls-Royce has supplied six highly efficient combined heat and power plants based on mtu Series 4000 L64FNER gas engines for the power plant in Worksop and will ensure the reliable operation of the plant for ten years under a maintenance contract.

ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. is responsible for the carbon capturing and processing plant and ensures the production of high-purity carbon dioxide. The UK-based power generation company Landmark Power Holdings Ltd. has developed and will operate the power plant.

The project is a joint venture with Victory Hill, a specialized investment company for sustainable energy infrastructure.

The Worksop facility is the first project under the FLEXPOWER PLUS™ concept developed by Landmark Power Holdings, which is designed for flexible power generation using mtu gas engines with improved energy efficiency and ASCO CO2 recovery technology. The partnership focuses on the development and distribution of scalable containerized solutions for clean power and heat generation that integrate carbon recovery technologies. With these solutions in line with the Rolls-Royce strategy the company helps its customers to reduce emissions, conserve resources and remain competitive.

“The captured CO2 is an additional source of revenue and a valuable resource for various industries, including food products, synthetic fuels, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and more,” said Ralph Spring, Managing Director of ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. “Carbon capture is one of the key technologies for the energy transition and will play an even more central role in the coming years as CO2 emission taxes rise, regulatory requirements increase, and mandatory net-zero climate targets come into force.”

The demand came as the aviation trade body published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use, the report produced in partnership with Worley Consulting claimed.

However, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions to maximise SAF output, Iata noted.

Director general Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN nations were identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Walsh added: “With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation.

“The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.

""The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”

Iata chief economist and sustainability senior vice president Marie Owens Thomsen said: “The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.

“Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout.

“Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/334/SAF1_Main.webp,N,,2025-09-24 07:57:05.465249

However, current production is only around two million tonnes a year, compared with an estimated requirement of almost 500 million tonnes by 2050 if the industry is to achieve net zero.

India’s feedstock resources include sugar- and starch-based ethanol, waste oils such as used cooking oil and tallow, agricultural residues, forestry by-products and municipal solid waste.

Together, these could provide around 100 million tonnes of raw material by 2030 and 150 million tonnes by 2050. The study noted that non-food energy crops could further expand this supply.

Agricultural residues are expected to make up the largest share in 2030, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the feedstock potential, followed by forestry residues and waste wood at 16 per cent and municipal waste at about 7 per cent.

IATA said India’s experience with ethanol blending and supportive government policy could position it as a leading producer in the region.

The country is already the world’s third-largest ethanol producer and plans to expand by increasing output from sugarcane juice and starch-rich crops such as maize and cassava.

“And pain is the price of progress.” According to Holyoak, traditional sources of CO2 – ethanol plants, ammonia facilities, and geological domes – still account for more than 75% of the US supply.
“SAF alone could impact the US CO2 market by up to 20%,” Holyoak said.
He suggested the companies “don’t care” about these dynamics right now because the CO2 market is in a relatively steady state.
However, as attendees heard today, there are indicators that 2026 will be tough for the CO2 market.","Up to one-fifth (20%) of the US merchant carbon dioxide supply may be needed to meet growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demand.

The observation was shared by Jeff Holyoak, Vice-President of Sales and Market Development, at gasworld’s North America CO2 Summit, who described new technologies as “creative destruction.”

Holyoak warned that SAF and emerging carbon utilisation technologies could force industrial gas companies to rethink how they source and allocate CO2, presenting both a major challenge and a strategic opportunity.

“Creative destruction is the market’s way of self-renewing,” he said. “And pain is the price of progress.”

According to Holyoak, traditional sources of CO2 – ethanol plants, ammonia facilities, and geological domes – still account for more than 75% of the US supply.

These sources, he noted, are increasingly vulnerable to disruption, regulatory pressure, and competition from higher-value applications like SAF.

“SAF alone could impact the US CO2 market by up to 20%,” Holyoak said. “And they’ll likely pay a lot more for it than traditional commercial users.”

SAF production is emerging as a major consumer of captured CO2, particularly through power-to-liquid (PtL) pathways and other synthetic fuel processes. These technologies use CO2 as a feedstock to produce low-carbon jet fuel.

While SAF demand is ramping up quickly, Holyoak cautioned that the CO₂ supply chain is lagging dangerously behind, a mismatch that could leave traditional users at risk.

He said that end-users should be early adopters of alternative capture technologies, not just to support innovation, but to protect their own supply chains.

He suggested the companies “don’t care” about these dynamics right now because the CO2 market is in a relatively steady state. However, as attendees heard today, there are indicators that 2026 will be tough for the CO2 market.

“When everything is great, we undervalue the risk,” Holyoak said. “When it gets bad, we’re going to wish we did something earlier to mitigate [CO2] risks, but it will already be too late.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2304836079-3.jpg",N,,2025-09-24 05:56:23.231748

The Australian Government has announced a landmark $1.1 billion investment to accelerate the domestic production of low carbon liquid fuels, marking a major step towards cleaner energy and stronger fuel security.

The funding will support the new ten-year Cleaner Fuels Program, designed to stimulate private investment in onshore production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. These “drop-in” fuels are compatible with existing engines and infrastructure, with the first production expected by 2029.

Australia is well-positioned to lead in this space, thanks to it’s abundant feedstocks such as canola, sorghum, sugar, and waste, and access to reliable renewable energy. Currently, liquid fuels account for around half of the nation’s energy use. Replacing fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives presents a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and grow the economy.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation estimates that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050, with the potential to reduce cumulative emissions by 230 million tonnes CO₂-e, equivalent to the annual emissions of 86 million cars.

Funding will be awarded through a competitive process, with eligibility criteria to be shaped by public consultation. The initiative builds on existing government programs including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

To further support the industry, the Government is expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has introduced a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

This investment aims to strengthen Australia’s fuel supply chain, support regional jobs, and position the country as a key player in the global transition to net zero.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/59ae4a2a6f4ca38d47990cd8/59af84b68dd04135a0c73712/68d3574ae1fd79660d18107d/1758683680795/unsplash-image-lBP2muAsD94.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-09-24 00:56:10.237909

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.
“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.
The airline first trialed locally produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route from August 2024 to August 2025, successfully verifying the fuel’s safety and performance.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use. The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely:

The slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised.

Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources:

Biomass: This has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximizing the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key findings from the report include:

There are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonize aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF.

​

The main challenges are:

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry.

Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialisation, and align their business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

Korean Air expands use of domestically produced SAF on Japan routes

Korean Air has expanded its use of domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), introducing a SAF blend on flights to Kobe and Osaka. The airline first trialed locally produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route from August 2024 to August 2025, successfully verifying the fuel’s safety and performance. SAF, which can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is considered a key component of the aviation industry’s decarbonization strategy. Korean Air will use a 1% SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe (KE731) and Gimpo to Osaka (KE2117) from September 19, 2025 through December 31, 2026. The program will cover approximately 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route.

The airline’s SAF is sourced from domestic suppliers HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex. Produced from used cooking oil (UCO), the fuel is certified under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This initiative reflects Korean Air’s commitment to driving sustainable aviation in Korea and supporting global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/Neste-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 22:56:13.324954

“Having been to 18 COPs myself, I know COP attendees face a dilemma: flight emissions,” said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat.
“With the COP30 SAF platform, those travelers now have a way to calculate and decarbonize their flight emissions no matter their point of departure or the aircraft they fly on, while supporting real-world deployment of sustainable aviation fuel.

The COP30 SAF platform empowers conference attendees to calculate and address their aviation-related emissions by supporting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets SABA’s world leading sustainability criteria. In this first of a kind opportunity, the platform is available to all COP30 attendees, including those who are not currently SABA members, as part of a concentrated effort to raise the visibility of SAF and scale funding and adoption of this key climate technology.

“Having been to 18 COPs myself, I know COP attendees face a dilemma: flight emissions,” said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat. “With the COP30 SAF platform, those travelers now have a way to calculate and decarbonize their flight emissions no matter their point of departure or the aircraft they fly on, while supporting real-world deployment of sustainable aviation fuel. This is the latest SABA innovation helping connect SAF producers with willing buyers who want to decarbonize their air travel.”

The SAF supported through the new platform is sourced from SkyNRG as the result of a streamlined, competitive procurement process initiated by SABA earlier this year.

“SkyNRG are proud to be the SAF supplier for SABA’s COP30 campaign,” said Theye Veen, chief commercial officer and co-founder of SkyNRG. “We are uniquely positioned as SAF knowledge experts with more than a decade of experience in building supply chains, partnerships, and sustainability standards for high-integrity SAF. We’re pleased to be deepening our collaboration with SABA and we’re excited to help expand SAFc access beyond its membership. The innovative COP30 SAF platform from SABA demonstrates our aligned vision of making SAF more accessible, and in turn, helping the industry to scale.”

SABA’s COP30 initiative is unique because it gives conference goers all the resources they need to decarbonize their COP air travel on a single platform. Attendees first estimate their flight emissions using one of two methods. For commercial flights, travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model, an industry-leading calculation tool, while travelers on private jets will use the Eurocontrol Small Emitters tool. Next, attendees purchase a corresponding quantity of high-integrity SAF certificates pre-vetted by SABA; and later receive a retirement statement from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the transaction meets best-in-class chain of custody requirements. The platform supports those traveling via commercial and private aircraft – crucial flexibility given that as many as 65 private jets travel to COP in a given year.

“Not all sustainable aviation fuels are created equal – which is why the SABA SAF platform is such a useful tool for conference attendees wanting to reduce their emissions from travelling to COP30,” said Elizabeth Sturcken, vice president, Net Zero Ambition & Action for Environmental Defense Fund. “For SAF to be high-integrity, it must meet rigorous environmental standards grounded in science. SABA has done the hard work of vetting the best-in-class SAF so buyers can feel confident their purchase will deliver a meaningful climate impact, while sending a clear message to policy makers and the market that high integrity SAF is in demand.”

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from renewable or waste-derived feedstocks and offering high scalability and CO2 emissions reduction potential. SAF is what is known as a “drop-in fuel”— meaning it is compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure —and represents the best near-term option to decarbonize air travel. While SAF currently makes up only a small percentage of the total aviation fuels market, SABA’s procurements allow voluntary buyers to support SAF production through investment in sustainable aviation fuel certificates connected with an established, high-integrity book and claim system. Book and claim allows parties to invest in SAF and capture its environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on.

Lawmakers from northern and north-central Wisconsin are circulating a bill supporting Johnson Timber Corp. in Hayward to build a processing plant for aviation fuel made from logging debris to establish a processing plant in Wisconsin.

The legislation would reward the company with a $60 million tax credit and access to $150 million in borrowing through Wisconsin’s bonding authority.

Republican lawmakers wrote in a memo circulated Monday seeking cosponsors that the proposal would create 150 jobs and generate $1.2 billion a year in income after three years of operation.

The processing plant in Hayward would be built by Johnson Timber Corp., in partnership with a German company, Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said at a press conference in the state Capitol Monday morning. The German partner is Synthec Fuels, according to Felzkowski’s office.

Wisconsin along with Michigan and Minnesota are all vying for the project, Felzkowski said, “and the state that helps will be the first state” to get the facility and probably the headquarters for the overall processing operation.

She said the process of converting logging waste into aviation fuel was comparable to how corn is grown for and converted into ethanol.

“We will be taking that wood product and turning it into a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation,” Felzkowski said.

As drafted, the bill would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) to create a manufacturing zone for aviation biofuel derived from wood matter and to issue up to $60 million in tax credits for a business operating in the zone.

The bill requires the business to source 80% or more of the wood used from Wisconsin and invest at least $1.5 billion in the project.

The bill also provides for the business to borrow up to $150 million for the project using Wisconsin’s tax-free bonding authority.

At the press conference, lawmakers, Sawyer County officials and a timber industry representative billed legislation as a “forestry revitalization” measure.

Paper and pulp plants in Wisconsin Rapids, Park Falls and Duluth, Minnesota, have all gone out of business in the last five years, accounting for about 30% of the pulp produced by Wisconsin’s timber industry, said Henry Sheinebeck, executive director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.

“We’re growing at a minimum two times more [timber] than we’re harvesting,” Sheinebeck said. Enabling the timber industry to cut down and make use of more trees would preserve and improve the health of forests in the state, he said.

The association and the paper industry are the joint recipients of an unrelated $1 million grant in the state 2025-27 budget to draw up a statewide forestry industry strategic plan.",,N,,2025-09-23 22:56:35.730707

Current SAF production relies almost entirely on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, which processes used cooking oil and similar feedstocks.
The research contradicts previous concerns about feedstock availability limiting SAF production, instead identifying the technology commercialization process as the critical constraint.
Most SAF production pathways beyond HEFA remain at technology readiness levels below full commercial deployment.
While sufficient raw materials exist to fuel a decarbonized aviation sector, realizing this potential depends critically on accelerating the pace of technology development and commercial deployment across multiple SAF production pathways.","The aviation industry possesses adequate sustainable feedstock resources to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but faces critical delays in deploying the production technologies needed to convert these materials into usable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a comprehensive study released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Monday.

The research, conducted in partnership with Worley Consulting, reveals that while sufficient biomass and alternative feedstocks exist globally, the slow pace of technology commercialization represents the primary bottleneck preventing airlines from meeting their decarbonization commitments.

Airlines will require approximately 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions, a massive scale-up from current global production of just 2 million tonnes in 2025. The study demonstrates this target could theoretically be met through available feedstock sources, but only if production technologies advance rapidly from their current developmental stages.

Willie Walsh, IATA Director General, emphasized the urgency of accelerating industrial deployment. The aviation industry has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with SAF expected to contribute roughly 65% of the required emissions reductions.

Current SAF production relies almost entirely on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, which processes used cooking oil and similar feedstocks. However, meeting 2050 targets will require diversifying into multiple production pathways including power-to-liquid processes that convert captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen into synthetic fuels.

The study identifies biomass potential exceeding 12,000 million tonnes by 2050, though competing uses in other sectors reduce availability for SAF production to approximately 1,580 million tonnes. This quantity could support production of over 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF annually, requiring power-to-liquid technologies to bridge the remaining gap.

Regional analysis highlights North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries as critical drivers of global SAF output. These regions possess the feedstock resources, refining infrastructure, and policy frameworks necessary to enable large-scale production.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, stressed that policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration remain essential to unlocking the required scale of investment. The report emphasizes that delays in technology deployment will only make the decarbonization challenge more difficult.

Power-to-liquid pathways face particular hurdles, requiring massive expansion of renewable electricity capacity and carbon capture infrastructure. The study estimates that global renewable power generation would need to nearly double to produce up to 200 million tonnes of synthetic SAF by 2050.

Competition for sustainable feedstocks presents another challenge, with other hard-to-abate sectors including shipping and heavy industry also requiring biomass resources for their own decarbonization efforts. Strategic allocation policies prioritizing aviation’s unique fuel requirements will be essential.

The research contradicts previous concerns about feedstock availability limiting SAF production, instead identifying the technology commercialization process as the critical constraint. Most SAF production pathways beyond HEFA remain at technology readiness levels below full commercial deployment.

Investment requirements for the necessary production infrastructure are substantial. Previous IATA analysis indicates that between 3,000 and 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be needed globally to meet aviation’s 2050 targets, requiring significant annual capital expenditures over the next three decades.

The study’s findings arrive as various governments implement SAF mandates and incentive programs. Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and similar policies in other regions aim to create demand certainty for producers, though the research suggests supply-side constraints may prove more limiting than previously anticipated.

For airlines committed to net-zero emissions, the study underscores both opportunity and urgency.

Five years ago, the Verso paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids shut down. That plant was a major consumer of pulpwood, and its closure left a “big hole” in Wisconsin’s pulpwood market, said state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, R-Tomahawk, who’s among the sponsors of legislation announced Monday.

The legislation began circulating for cosponsors Monday. State Rep. Chanz Green, R-Grand View, was listed as lead sponsor, along with more than half a dozen other Republicans.

Starting this year, airports within the European Union must use at least 2% of what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, within their fuel mix. The EU is set to increase its mandated SAF percentages in coming years. The United States does not currently impose such requirements.

SAF is an alternative to fossil fuel, and the goal of those requirements is to cut back on carbon emissions. SAF can include biofuels, such as energy made from pulped wood.

“There is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said during a Monday morning news conference at the state Capitol.

A German company called Synthec Fuels is looking to run the plant in partnership with Wisconsin-based Johnson Timber, sponsors of the legislation said.

Synthec Fuels is also considering other locations in Minnesota or Michigan, Felzkowski said.

She suggested that the proposed tax incentives could help seal the deal for Wisconsin.

“There’s three states vying for this” Felzkowski said. “The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters.”

The newly announced legislation would set aside $60 million in tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation for the project. Wisconsin would also give out a $150 million grant to help create the plant. That grant would be backed by public borrowing through the Wisconsin Department of National Resources’ forestry account.

In exchange, the company creating the plant would agree to invest at least $1.5 billion into the project over the first five years. And at least 80% of the wood that would be processed at the plant would need to come from Wisconsin forests over that same five-year period.

The facility is expected to create 150 jobs, legislative sponsors said. Those roles would help revitalize a local economy that’s been hit hard by a declining market for paper producers, said Mike Markgren, the county administrator in Sawyer County.

“Logging fell on hard times after the paper mills began to close,” Markgren said. “Demand decreased, prices flattened and we suffered.”

Markgren said Sawyer County’s economy has been increasingly centered on tourism.

“Those hospitality jobs pay on average $37,000 annually, and that is likely with no benefits, so that is not a sustainable wage,” Markgren said.

In contrast, he hopes a new wood pulp factory will bring more “well-paying jobs with full benefits,” to the region.

“Anything that can be done to strengthen the diversification of industry in Sawyer County is very welcome,” Markgren said.

Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of Wisconsin lawmakers introduced separate bills that would create a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for Sustainable Aviation Fuel producers.

Why it matters: Resource conservation can convert waste into value, helping industries cut emissions and reach sustainability goals.

Axios' Amy Harder, Ben Geman and Chuck McCutcheon hosted conversations with Delta Air Lines chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca, World Resources Institute president and CEO Ani Dasgupta, and McLaren Racing sustainability director Kim Wilson. The event was sponsored by Suntory Global Spirits.

Today, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is derived from soy and other crops, but DeLuca said future sources could include materials such as corn or wood waste. She stressed SAF's ""value chain approach,"" which affects corporations, farmers and rural communities.

""You've got a whole rural community that's like, 'I actually don't know where my future is,'"" DeLuca said. ""Sustainable aviation fuel, it's not just a blip. It's not a five-year thing. This is a multiple-decades' worth of a product that we're going to need as an industry that also helps those communities, and that's again where you have that win, win, win.""

Meanwhile, Wilson noted that McLaren Racing pioneered the use of recycled carbon fiber in the racing industry, which can reduce emissions by up to 90%.

After discovering that materials accounted for a significant portion of its footprint, McLaren Racing worked with a supplier to recycle aerospace waste.

""The thing about new materials is you have to think about how do we not compromise between on-track performance … for sustainability, but we also need to find ways to balance that and innovate,"" Wilson said.

McLaren Racing has already used recycled carbon fiber for non-safety-critical parts in Austin and Silverstone and is exploring what's next.

Separately, Dasgupta said technology is transforming the clean energy transition ""at a scale and speed and price that we didn't even think possible.""

However, Dasgupta noted that ""technology itself doesn't produce good outcomes. We need to orchestrate that outcome."" He said collaboration across industries and tech innovators is needed to help ensure a smooth transition.

On Sept. 23, Eni confirmed Italy’s Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security has approved Enilive’s proposal to convert selected units at the Sannazzaro refinery into a biorefining plant equipped to convert 550,000 tonnes/year (tpy) of renewable feedstocks into hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Alongside repurposing the Sannazzaro refinery’s second hydrocracking unit (HDC2) for production of HVO and SAF using the Eni-Honeywell UOP LLC codeveloped proprietary Ecofining technology, the proposed project also will involve construction of a grassroots pretreatment unit for biogenic feedstocks of waste and residues.

While the refinery’s current logistics systems will be adapted to support the site’s future renewable production, Eni said Enilive will source hydrogen required for the biorefining plant’s conversion process via infrastructure already in place, Eni said.

With the proposed plant’s authorization phase initiated following Enilive’s earlier filing of an application for the project’s environmental impact assessment, Eni said it expects the Sannazzaro refinery to begin operations in 2028.

The planned conversion and integration of biorefining works at the Sannazzaro site—which is already connected to northern Italy’s aviation fuel supply chain via a pipeline to Milan Malpensa Airport and depots servicing other regional airports—will not impact the refinery’s existing production capacity for conventional fossil-based fuels, the company said.

Eni decarbonization strategy

Addition of renewable fuels production at Sannazzaro comes as Eni’s latest effort under the operator’s long-term plan to continue conversion of its conventional refineries into renewables-based production centers while retaining strategic optionality around remaining traditional capacity.

Forming part of Eni's broader decarbonization strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in line with the global energy transition, the projects collectively seek to increase Enilive’s current 1.65-million tpy systemwide biorefining capacity to more than 5 million tpy—2 million tpy of which could be SAF—by 2030.

The first global operator to convert two of its conventional refineries into biorefinerie, Eni first began producing biofuels in 2014 by processing vegetable oils and biomass waste into renewable diesel following conversion of the Venice refinery, followed by transformation of the 105,000-b/d Gela refinery on the southern coast of Sicily in 2019.

In addition to the Sannazzaro conversion project, Eni is also progressing on Italy’s northwestern coast with the planned conversion of the idled 84,000-b/d conventional refinery in Livorno, Tuscany, into what will become Italy’s third biorefinery.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","MUMBAI: A new study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has concluded that the airline industry has access to sufficient sustainable feedstock to achieve its net-zero emissions goal by 2050. The study, however, identifies a significant bottleneck in the slow rollout of technology needed to convert these diverse feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a challenge exacerbated by competition from other sectors for the same raw materials. The study done in partnership with Worley Consulting said that all feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use."" The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely the slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently, the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example, converting used cooking oil into SAF. There is also competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised,"" said IATA in a press statement issued on Tuesday. Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources: Biomass, which has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. ""Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades. Power-to-liquid (PtL) will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximising the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap,"" it said. In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions, said IATA. “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. Key findings from the report include that there are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonise aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF. ""The main challenges are enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry. Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL (power-to-liquid), including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method. Achieving coordinated govt policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities. Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output. Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialisation, and align their business strategies with global decarbonisation goals,"" said IATA. “The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Govts, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist. “With this study, it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

A recent study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has highlighted a significant opportunity for the aviation industry to meet its decarbonization goals through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This technological shift has the potential to reshape tourism and travel experiences, contributing to a more sustainable and eco-friendly future for global travel. As the demand for aviation tourism grows, the IATA study underscores the importance of accelerating SAF technology to ensure that the aviation sector becomes a leader in sustainable travel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Game Changer for Tourism

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is considered the most promising solution for reducing aviation’s carbon emissions. SAF is produced from renewable sources like biomass and waste, offering a reduction in carbon emissions by up to 80% when compared to traditional jet fuel. The aviation tourism industry, which plays a pivotal role in global tourism, is poised to benefit from this breakthrough technology. As airlines adopt SAF, tourists will experience a greener, more sustainable form of travel.

The use of SAF will help preserve the environment while enabling the tourism industry to grow, attracting eco-conscious travelers. This can foster growth in sustainable tourism, particularly in destinations known for their natural beauty, such as the Amazon rainforest, Alaska, and the Caribbean. Travelers are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint, and by offering more sustainable travel options, the aviation sector can appeal to this growing market.

The Challenges in Scaling SAF Technology

Despite its potential, SAF technology is still in its early stages of development, creating a bottleneck for the aviation sector. The IATA study indicates that the real challenge lies not in the availability of feedstocks but in the slow pace at which SAF production technologies are being scaled. While feedstocks such as used cooking oil are available in sufficient quantities, the technology to produce SAF at scale remains underdeveloped. This delay is crucial for the aviation tourism sector, as without a reliable and consistent supply of SAF, airlines may struggle to meet their sustainability goals.

The slow pace of SAF technology development means that tourists may face delays in the transition to greener aviation. Airlines that fail to adopt SAF may find themselves at a disadvantage as eco-conscious travelers seek airlines that offer sustainable travel options. Therefore, there is an urgent need for investment in SAF technology to accelerate its deployment, enabling airlines to offer sustainable tourism options and stay competitive in the market.

The Role of Policy and Investment in Tourism

To facilitate the rapid development and adoption of SAF, the IATA study stresses the importance of coordinated government policies and investment in SAF infrastructure. Governments play a crucial role in de-risking investments in SAF production by providing financial incentives, regulatory support, and long-term policy clarity. For aviation tourism, this means ensuring that airports and airlines have access to the necessary infrastructure to support SAF production and distribution.

Governments, especially in regions with high tourist traffic, need to offer financial incentives for airlines that adopt SAF technology. By doing so, they will ensure that tourism remains a sustainable industry, attracting eco-conscious travelers who are increasingly concerned with their environmental impact. A coordinated policy framework will foster the growth of SAF technology, benefiting both the aviation industry and the tourism sector as a whole.

A Sustainable Future for Aviation Tourism

The future of aviation tourism relies heavily on the successful implementation of SAF and other green technologies in the aviation sector. According to IATA, the industry will need approximately 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions. This presents a significant opportunity for the tourism sector, as more tourists will choose destinations with sustainable travel options.

As airlines and governments collaborate to make SAF widely available, aviation tourism will see a rise in demand for more sustainable travel options. Destinations that prioritize sustainability in their tourism offerings will attract a new generation of eco-conscious travelers, driving the growth of sustainable tourism.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-SAF-technology-aviation-tourism-net-zero-emissions-IATA-environmental-impact-aviation-decarbonization.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 13:56:30.496531

Recent research, including a study by Opoku (2024), shows the complex connection between the built environment and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on five key areas: People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnerships.There are still gaps in understanding of how construction and facilities management (FM) can effectively support the goals related to Planet, Prosperity, and Partnership. Closing these gaps is important for creating better solutions based on life cycle assessments. By using sustainable construction and FM practices, we can reduce energy, water, and waste throughout the entire life cycle, from building to maintenance and operation. Collins et al. (2019) studied the divide between sustainable buildings and FM. They emphasized the need to unite design, construction, and FM. FM is now focusing more on sustainability by including the United Nations SDGs in their decision-making processes (Lok et al., 2023). Recent studies from IFMEC (2018) and Klungseth et al. (2022, 2023) show that using technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) in FM can help achieve SDG 9, which is about industry, innovation, and infrastructure. Opoku and Lee (2022) note that FM is moving towards a long-term view that considers the social, environmental, and economic impacts of business decisions. To contribute to the UN SDGs, we need more research to explore the full potential and limitations of these technologies and strategies in meeting broader sustainability goals. This research topic invited studies on construction and facilities in the built environment to the UN SDGs. We aim to explore how sustainable practices improve environmental, economic, and social outcomes while assessing the effectiveness of current standards and technologies. This requires collaboration with key stakeholders to create strategies that enhance health, safety, and well-being. A comprehensive plan should align investments, management, design, construction, operations, and services. Those sectors are focusing on long-term strategies, such as better practices, using digital technology, building partnerships, and following international standards. In our topic we feature three types of contributions: conceptual, empirical, and review. This topic includes eight international publications, comprising three Community Case Studies, two Literature Reviews, and three Original Research Papers. 1.

Agentic AI is the leap from automation to autonomy: a system that rebooks, reroutes, and reallocates without waiting for human input. It is the difference between reacting to delays and preventing them. For an industry under pressure to deliver efficiency, resilience, and sustainability at once, this is the moment to turn intelligence into action.

Today, most airlines manage operational and sustainability data separately. Flight metrics such as fuel burn and load factors are tracked in real-time, while carbon reporting is generally required annually. This delay creates blind spots that make compliance harder and slow progress.

DataArt bridges this divide. With Agentic AI and the AI Lake Accelerator (AILA), airlines unify fragmented data, moving from retrospective reports to real-time action:

Agentic AI moves beyond rule-based automation, proactively supporting goal-driven decisions while keeping humans in control.

AILA provides the data foundation: a cloud-native environment that unifies operational and environmental data into one reliable source.

Together, they help airlines progress in three areas: sustainability, commercial performance, and operational efficiency.

Sustainability: From reports to real-rime action

Under ICAO’s CORSIA framework, international airlines must report and offset emissions starting in 2027. Many carriers invest in newer fleets, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and waste reduction. Yet SAF use remains low, accounting for less than 0.3% of total aviation fuel in 2024. Emissions tracking, meanwhile, remains fragmented and retrospective.

Real-time data changes this. One regional carrier found that 12% of its emissions came not from flying but from delays at the gate. Linking ground operations data into emissions dashboards cut turnaround fuel burn and improved punctuality.

Agentic AI goes further: forecasting contrail formation, suggesting taxi routes that minimise fuel burn, or reallocating resources to prevent delays. These steps cut carbon and cost at once.

DataArt’s experience in other sectors shows the value of real-time optimisation. A smart city platform aggregated air quality data from multiple sources and adjusted commuter routes to reduce exposure. The same principle applies in aviation: with AI, similar results to traditional optimisation methods can be achieved in a fraction of the time, dynamically optimising routes based on real-time information the AI agent receives.

Commercial growth: Personalisation meets responsibility

Aviation’s profitability hinges on ancillary revenue, loyalty programs, and differentiated experiences. At the same time, younger travellers increasingly choose carriers demonstrating climate responsibility.

Agentic AI acts as an information broker across fragmented commercial systems. By unifying reservation, sales, and loyalty data, it enables:

Dynamic pricing that factors in both demand and route-level carbon intensity.

Sustainability-linked rewards, such as extra points for booking SAF-backed flights.

Real-time service recovery, providing tailored compensation or rebooking while prioritising lower-emission alternatives, such as offering SAF-backed flights or more efficient connections.

Airlines like KLM, Lufthansa, and Virgin Atlantic highlight sustainability as a differentiator in CEO messaging. Yet without integrated data, these remain ambitions, rather than outcomes. Embedding environmental signals into loyalty and sales programs helps airlines align revenue with climate goals while building trust.

Similar approaches have proven effective outside aviation. DataArt built a chatbot for a sustainability information provider that turned unstructured data into structured supply chain models. It tripled the speed of analysis, enabling better commercial decisions. Airlines can adopt similar approaches to transform fragmented loyalty and reservations data into actionable insights.

Operational efficiency: Smarter, leaner, greener

Delays increase fuel burn, crew overtime, and compensation costs, which Eurocontrol estimates to be several billion euros. In Europe, nearly one in four scheduled flights runs late.

Many airlines still depend on manual data entry and siloed IT systems, slow information flow fragments situational awareness, leading to reactive decisions.

Agentic AI can help. By analysing data across operations control, ground handling, and flight crews, it identifies disruption risks and suggests timely interventions. Airlines emphasise that AI should support, not replace, human decision-makers by accelerating awareness, forecasting disruption impacts, and reducing information overload.

Consider an airport that integrated building management data into a central sustainability lake. Predictive forecasting cuts emissions and energy costs. The same logic applies to aircraft turnaround and crew scheduling: efficiency and sustainability reinforce each other.

Why now?

Three forces make this shift urgent:

Regulation is accelerating. CORSIA, the EU’s CSRD, and IFRS frameworks demand verifiable, near real-time reporting.

Stakeholder expectations are rising. Investors, regulators, and passengers want measurable progress, not aspirational targets.

Technology has matured. With accelerators like AILA, even mid-sized carriers can deploy integrated data lakes in weeks, not years.

From intention to impact

Agentic AI and AILA are not silver bullets. Success requires cultural change, integration with legacy systems, and human-AI collaboration. But the payoff is clear:

Credible sustainability progress is traceable to source data.

Commercial strategies that reflect climate responsibility.

Resilient operations that cut cost and carbon together.

By 2030, airlines that embed AI into daily operations will pull decisively ahead of those that do not. The leaders of the next decade will treat sustainability as a live operational discipline, not a side report.

At the World Aviation Festival 2025, on October 7, DataArt experts will share how Agentic AI and AILA help carriers turn sustainability ambition into operational impact.

They will be able to monitor emissions from business trips and co-fund the use of alternative fuels, which are known in the aviation industry as “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF).
Book-and-claim is becoming a more common way for corporates to contribute to the cost of alternative fuels and reduce their emissions from flights.
The airline last month announced that it would take part in a new production pilot programme aimed at producing a “synthetic” type of alternative aviation fuel.
Finnair added that around 31,000 individual customers have contributed a “small amount” to promoting the use of alternative fuels since the option was made available a year ago.","Finnair is launching a new service for corporate customers allowing them to support the use of alternative aviation fuels.

The carrier said the new scheme has been designed for members of its Finnair for Business programme. They will be able to monitor emissions from business trips and co-fund the use of alternative fuels, which are known in the aviation industry as “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF).

Finnair explained that emissions reductions through using alternative fuels will be verified by a third party; the client will receive an audited SAF certificate for their investment, which can be used as part of their sustainability reporting.

The scheme will use the “book-and-claim” system, which allows corporates to claim the reduction in emissions without the alternative fuel having to be physically used on flights taken by the organisation’s travellers.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair's head of environment, said: “We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require co-operation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers.

“With Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.”

Using alternative fuels can reduce the emissions from aviation by up to 80 per cent over the lifecycle of the fuels compared with traditional kerosene. The fuels are produced from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fat and agricultural residues.

Book-and-claim is becoming a more common way for corporates to contribute to the cost of alternative fuels and reduce their emissions from flights.

Specialist fuel producer Neste launched a book-and-claim platform last year, while leading TMC American Express Global Business Travel created its own Avelia book-and-claim system in 2022 in partnership with Shell Aviation and Accenture.

Alternative fuels only accounted for 0.5 per cent of Finnair’s total fuel procurement in 2024 but this percentage is set to “roughly treble” this year, according to the airline. The EU is now requiring airlines to use at least 2 per cent SAF in their fuel mix from this year.

The airline last month announced that it would take part in a new production pilot programme aimed at producing a “synthetic” type of alternative aviation fuel.

We have partnered with ABB, Fortum, and Finavia to produce eSAF, which gives us a huge advantage as an alternative or an extra to SAF,” Kirchner explained .
Beyond fuel: operational innovation While SAF dominates the long-term decarbonisation debate, Kirchner also drew attention to practical measures Finnair Cargo has already implemented in its operations.
In cargo operations, even waste streams are being redirected: unsellable fish from its Helsinki cool hub are now donated to the Helsinki Zoo as animal feed .
“Rome wasn’t built in a day – and neither will aviation sustainability,” she remarked .","At the Caspian Air Cargo Summit 2025, Anna-Maria Kirchner, Head of Global Sales at Finnair Cargo, outlined how the Nordic carrier is tackling the sustainability challenge, with a sharp focus on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the most impactful tool available to the sector today.

Net-zero depends on SAF

Kirchner pointed out that aviation’s path to net-zero by 2050 is inseparable from SAF adoption. “If we continue with our net zero goals for 2050, IATA has calculated that we will need 65 percent of SAF to be fuelled on the aircraft,” she said .

Despite this, progress remains limited. In 2024, just 1.3 million litres of SAF were purchased by airlines in the EU – amounting to a mere 0.3 percent of global consumption . With the EU now mandating a 2% SAF blend, Kirchner stressed that scaling production and uptake is critical to ensuring that airlines can meet their climate commitments.

Finnair estimates that 75 percent of its net-zero pathway will rely on SAF and emerging alternatives such as electrofuels, with the balance coming from new technologies like electric and hydrogen flight once they become commercially viable .

Pioneering new fuels with Liquid Sun

In August 2025, Finnair took a step beyond conventional SAF with a partnership on Liquid Sun, an electrofuel project that uses solar power to split water into hydrogen, which is then converted into renewable fuel.

“Part of the Finnair strategy is preparing for an energy transformation. We have partnered with ABB, Fortum, and Finavia to produce eSAF, which gives us a huge advantage as an alternative or an extra to SAF,” Kirchner explained .

Although still at an early stage, she highlighted that every incremental step matters. “This has just started now in August. It will be little what we get out of it, but we always say every step counts in the journey of sustainability,” she said .

Beyond fuel: operational innovation

While SAF dominates the long-term decarbonisation debate, Kirchner also drew attention to practical measures Finnair Cargo has already implemented in its operations.

Trials are underway using lightweight cardboard pallets, developed by Finnish company Atte, which are 50–100kg lighter than traditional wooden pallets. These provide lower emissions, reduced costs, and reusability on long-haul flights such as those to Seoul .

In line with Finland’s circular economy principles, Finnair has also developed a recycling programme for uniforms, turning old garments into new textiles. In cargo operations, even waste streams are being redirected: unsellable fish from its Helsinki cool hub are now donated to the Helsinki Zoo as animal feed .

Terminals powered by the sun

Another notable step is the installation of 2,990 solar panels at Finnair Cargo’s state-of-the-art hub in Helsinki, opened in 2018. These panels generate 37 percent of the facility’s annual electricity needs, with surplus power fed into catering operations and airport offices during the long days of Finland’s summer .

Kirchner said that while these efforts may seem modest compared to the scale of aviation’s climate challenge, they demonstrate how incremental action adds up. “Rome wasn’t built in a day – and neither will aviation sustainability,” she remarked .

Education and collaboration

Kirchner stressed that collaboration across the aviation value chain is vital, particularly when it comes to standardising emissions reporting and SAF claims. Finnair has partnered with Neste, also headquartered in Finland and one of the world’s leading SAF producers, to create education programmes for forwarders and shippers.

“We hear a lot about reporting. How are the emissions being calculated? What is a booking claim process? How can shippers, how can forwarders, how can we do this together? The most important journey for us is our future, but also how we collaborate with partners in the industry,” she said .

For Kirchner, the most important message is credibility: the industry must “walk the talk.” By investing in SAF, testing new fuels, and embedding circular economy thinking into daily cargo operations, Finnair Cargo is positioning itself as a frontrunner in aviation sustainability.

“Most important is to think about what else we can do to make sure that the planet we’re living in will also be something with a 2050 net-zero target achieved,” she concluded .",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-16.41.05.png,N,,2025-09-23 10:56:12.309648

Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.
“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonization.
“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","Geneva - The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely:

The slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritized.

Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources:

Biomass: This has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximizing the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximize SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonization. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key findings from the report include:

There are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonize aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF.

The main challenges are:

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry.

Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialization, and align their business strategies with global decarbonization goals.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonization. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

Munich-based VÆRIDION and Deutsche Aircraft have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on flight testing and technology development. The two will combine their expertise in electric propulsion, aircraft design, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

As part of the agreement, VÆRIDION’s advanced battery technology will be tested on the D328 UpLift flying test bed, operated by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR). Deutsche Aircraft will contribute its experience in structural engineering, industrialisation, and testing processes to support the development of VÆRIDION’s Microliner, a nine-seat commuter aircraft.

Microliner and D328eco: two pathways to cleaner aviation

VÆRIDION is pursuing a fully battery-electric solution with its Microliner. The 100% electric aircraft is designed for short-haul routes of up to 400 kilometres, and features modular wing-integrated batteries and a glider-inspired design. The company aims to provide affordable, zero-emission connectivity for underserved regional markets.

Deutsche Aircraft is developing the D328eco, a 40-seat regional aircraft designed to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. The aircraft is a next-generation successor to the Dornier 328, and leverages the OEM’s system integration capabilities as Germany’s only certified aircraft manufacturer.

The company has been steadily moving the programme forward, including the rollout of its first D328eco test aircraft (TAC-1) earlier this year, and the integration of Garmin’s G5000 Prime flight deck into the turboprop.

Advancing emission-free regional flights

“This MoU marks a pivotal moment in our journey toward emission-free regional flights,” said Markus Kochs-Kämper, CTO and Managing Director of VÆRIDION. “By uniting our technological expertise with Deutsche Aircraft’s long-standing engineering excellence and design quality, we aim to accelerate the Microliner programme and provide sustainable, cost-effective air travel solutions to underserved markets in Europe and beyond.”

Frederic Fischer, Head of R&T at Deutsche Aircraft, stated that the partnership underscores the increasing significance of collaborative innovation. “We are proud to collaborate with VÆRIDION in shaping the future of regional aviation. This partnership reflects our shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and the transformation of air mobility,” he said.

Bavaria as a hub for innovation in green aviation

This MoU also reflects a regional strategy for accelerating European clean aviation goals by leveraging collaboration and shared expertise in Bavaria’s aerospace cluster.

Both companies are based near Munich and maintain a presence at the AirTech Campus in Oberpfaffenhofen, a cluster of aerospace activity that includes startups, research institutes, and established players.

Their work also aligns with Deutsche Aircraft’s industrial ramp-up plans, including the construction of its new final assembly line at Leipzig Airport, developed in partnership with Weerts Group.

The facility will eventually produce up to 48 aircraft per year. However, the programme has faced headwinds, with the entry into service of the D328eco delayed to Q4 2027 due to certification and design integration challenges.

A focus on decarbonising regional flights

By collaborating, VÆRIDION and Deutsche Aircraft can cover a wide range of regional aviation needs. Battery-electric designs, such as the Microliner, promise zero-emission operations but face challenges related to weight, charging infrastructure, and limited range.

SAF-powered aircraft, such as the D328eco, offer more immediate reductions in lifecycle emissions while remaining compatible with existing airport infrastructure and supporting longer-range operations.

The collaboration comes amid increasing efforts to decarbonise regional aviation. Startups like Heart Aerospace, with its hybrid-electric ES-30, and MAEVE, with its Maeve Jet, have also set their sights on the commuter and regional markets with new propulsion concepts.

Regional aircraft manufacturers ATR and Embraer are also pursuing hybrid and SAF-based solutions.

All these projects acknowledge that multiple technologies will be required to achieve net-zero aviation by 2050.

The work between VÆRIDION and Deutsche Aircraft could accelerate certification, testing, and industrialisation timelines. Together, they could bring both battery-electric and SAF-powered next-generation aircraft into service before the end of the decade.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Deutsche-Aircraft-D328eco-UpLift-flying-test-bed.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 09:56:35.878237

“The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters then located at that,” she said.","Wisconsin’s Forestry Industry is a $42-billion industry providing more than 126,000 jobs, many in the northern portion of state.

But, as WXPR has previously reported, the industry also faces many challenges.

Disease, pests, climate change, and loss of mills are a major concern. There’s been a decline in harvesting since the closure of several mills starting in 2020—including the Verso Mill in Wisconsin Rapids and the Park Falls Paper Mill.

Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association Executive Director Henry Scheinebeck says those mills were taking in about 30% of the pulp produced in the state.

“We're growing, at a minimum, two times more than we're harvesting,” Schienebeck said at a press conference in Madison Monday.

Because of the decline, Scheinebeck supports legislation being introduced that would incentivize the building of an aviation bio-fuel facility in Hayward.

He says maintaining sustainable harvesting is important for forest health and the economy.

“This is the number two industry in the state. We're still, fortunately, the number one paper producing industry in the nation,” said Schienebeck. “If we can keep that going along with sustainable aviation fuel for the future, I think this is a win-win.”

The plant would take low quality wood and convert it to aviation biofuel.

While the U.S. has not required the use of this fuel type, the European Union has called for 70% of jet fuel to be sustainable by 2050.

The legislation introduced Monday would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation to create an aviation biofuel tax credit of $60 million as an Enterprise Zone Tax Credit.

It would also award the company that wants to build the facility a grant of $150 million through state bonding, which would be repaid through the Forestry Account.

Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) is one of the bill authors.

“There is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” she said. “We have a piece of legislation right now that will help spearhead this investment.”

In return, the company would source 80% of biomass needed to make the fuel from Wisconsin’s forests and invest $1.5 billion in economic activities in the state within five years. Felzkowski said the plant would provide about 150 jobs.

Michigan and Minnesota are also being considered as locations for the plant, according to Felzkowski.

“The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters then located at that,” she said. “There is a little bit of pressure to be the state that helps so that they have the first plant and hopefully the headquarters.”

Felzkowski said she’s talked to the Governor who seems interested but wouldn’t commit until he saw the legislation which was just announced Monday.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d9ae47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2587+0+677/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2Fa6%2F70a381aa471780278d98d276e137%2Fimg-20201001-082304-459.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 08:56:13.539447

Northwoods Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would spend $210 million in state assistance to help attract a $1.5 billion plant in Hayward. It would turn bark, branches, cutter shavings, tree tops, slash and forestry processing residue into fuel for airplanes.

Senate President Mary Felzkowski, of Tomahawk, during a press conference Monday morning said Wisconsin is competing with Michigan and Minnesota to attract a new business headquarters.

“There is a little bit of pressure to be the state that helps,” she said.

State Rep. Jeff Mursau, R-Crivitz, said the project would be a boost to a forestry industry that has taken a downtown after the closure of a paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids. Before that, the state had been harvesting 1.2 million cords. It’s now down to 839,000 cords, and the proposed project would add 440,000 cords to the annual harvest.

The project would be a partnership between Wisconsin-based Johnson Timber and Synthec Fuels, a German company with a Wisconsin subsidiary. It would be located on property adjacent to the Johnson Timber plant in Hayward, and the Wisconsin company would do the initial processing of the wood that would be turned into the sustainable aviation fuel.

The legislation calls for $60 million in WEDC Enterprise Zone Tax Credits and $150 million in state bonding that would be supported through the forestry account. Felzkowski said the plant would employ 150 people.

Felzkowski argued Wisconsin is primed to be a leader of sustainable aviation fuel as the market grows due to sustainable aviation fuel mandates in the European Union. The mandates require aviation fuel to be a 2% blend with sustainable aviation fuels in 2025, growing to 70% in 2050.

That means the EU would require over a trillion gallons of biofuel by 2050, Felzkowski added.

“So there is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” she argued.

The bill would also require Johnson Timber and Synthec Fuels to invest the $1.5 billion in the facility in the first five years, and that 80% of the biomass used to create the fuel come from Wisconsin.

Sawyer County Administrator Mark Markgren said the new plant would help bring demand back to the logging industry after several paper and pulp mills have shut down in the past few years.

“It would bring back the forestry industry and all the subsidiaries that would help, probably another 200 jobs at least. And all of those would be a living wage,” he said. “It would just be a huge economic boon for the local economy, which is suffering right now.”

Great Lakes Timber Professional Association Executive Director Henry Schienebeck praised the measure as both a way to bring jobs back and improve forest maintenance.

Following a successful year-long trial on the Incheon–Haneda route, the airline is now deploying a 1% SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe and from Gimpo to Osaka. This move aligns with broader national plans to reduce aviation emissions and support the transition to cleaner energy in the skies.

New SAF Routes Strengthen Commitment to Carbon Reduction

Starting September 19, 2025, Korean Air began operating with a 1% SAF blend on two additional routes: Incheon–Kobe (KE731) and Gimpo–Osaka (KE2117). This expansion will continue through December 31, 2026, covering approximately 90 flights to Kobe and 26 to Osaka. The fuel, derived from used cooking oil and supplied by domestic refiners HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex, meets international standards under ICAO’s CORSIA framework.

Building on a successful Trial program

The airline’s decision to expand SAF usage follows a successful trial on its Incheon–Haneda route, conducted from August 2024 to August 2025. During this period, Korean Air tested the performance and safety of SAF, gaining confidence in its viability as a cleaner alternative to conventional jet fuel. With SAF capable of reducing life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80%, the trial played a critical role in validating the fuel’s operational reliability.

Preparing for Future Regulations and Industry Trends

Korean Air’s initiative also positions it ahead of impending government regulations. Starting in 2027, South Korea will require all outbound flights to use at least a 1% SAF blend, with this mandate increasing to 3–5% by 2030 and up to 10% by 2035.

BRISBANE AIRPORT, QLD, AUSTRALIA, September 23, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- • Stralis Aircraft is testing groundbreaking high-temperature fuel cell technology that will power emission free, cost effective and quieter aircraft in the future.

• Stralis Aircraft has been working with Air New Zealand, Hiringa Energy and the NZ Product Accelerator to set up and undertake the testing in Air New Zealand’s engine test cell facility at Auckland Airport

• The testing will collect performance data that will help Stralis understand degradation rates to support a credible lifetime assessment for the fuel cell system product.

Australian clean-tech startup Stralis Aircraft is testing its groundbreaking high-temperature fuel cell technology in an Auckland test facility, to help enable Australasia’s first hydrogen-electric flights. Working with the support of Air New Zealand, the NZ Product Accelerator hosted by University of Auckland and Hiringa Energy, hydrogen fuel cell testing has been made possible.

Stralis Aircraft is developing fuel cells to power high-performance, low operating cost, hydrogen-electric propulsion systems for aircraft and other heavy transport applications. Their proprietary high temperature PEM fuel-cell technology is significantly lighter than existing alternatives, enabling aircraft to fly ten times further than battery-electric solutions at a lower cost than fossil-fuel-powered planes. The company is already testing its fuel cells in the U.S. but has now started testing closer to home in New Zealand.

The testing will provide data that will help Stralis understand degradation mechanisms and degradation rates to support a credible lifetime assessment for the fuel cell system product. Achieving long life HTPEM fuel cells is important to deliver engine maintenance cost savings to airline customers. This measured data will help quantify maintenance savings and encourage adoption of the technology.

Stralis’s propulsion technology delivers significant benefits: zero emissions (producing only water vapour), up to 50% lower operating costs, and reduced noise. Their system integrates their fuel cells, liquid hydrogen tanks, and electric motors into existing and new aircraft designs, and plans to achieve the first flight of its six-seat Bonanza A36 technology demonstrator aircraft later this year in Queensland, Australia.

Stuart Johnstone, co-founder and CTO of Stralis Aircraft says “We are proud to be working with Air New Zealand to test our unique fuel cell technology in their engine test facility at Auckland Airport. New Zealand is an ideal location to develop, test and adopt emission free aircraft technology, so it is a great place to build capability and understanding. The test cell is attractive because it has lots of capacity to grow and enable testing of our higher power systems. It is great to be working with businesses in Australasia to make hydrogen-electric and zero-emission aviation a reality. With the help of our Kiwi partners, we have managed to get the test cell operational in “record” time”.

Matthew Connolly, Air New Zealand’s Sustainability Lead Energy Transition, says “Across Air New Zealand we have a significant programme dedicated to preparing for the future of flight, and the energy transition is a critical part of this work. That’s where opening the engine test cell facility to innovative companies such as Stralis comes in, as another step in our collective learning about new technologies, future engine propulsion, and new ways that aircraft will fly people and goods in a lower-carbon future. We believe Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), hydrogen and electricity will all be critical parts of a future aviation eco-system, and we’re proud to be supporting the innovation that Stralis is testing here in New Zealand.”

Hydrogen-electric propulsion systems have fewer moving parts and operate at lower temperatures compared to existing aircraft engines, which is predicted to reduce engine maintenance costs by between 40-60%. This is similar to the maintenance cost reductions seen between combustion engine and electric cars. The hydrogen stored onboard in a tank, powers a fuel cell that generates electricity to power an electric motor, that drives a propellor. Hydrogen-electric propulsion systems can be used for aircraft battery replacement, retrofit airframes, new clean sheet designs or even as auxiliary power units (APUs) onboard larger aircraft.

More information for editors:

More than 190 countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have agreed to target net zero carbon emissions from aviation in 2050. By the mid 2030’s, the sector needs to be actively deploying zero emission technologies and solutions. One solution that can genuinely reduce CO2 and non-CO2 emissions is hydrogen-electric propulsion. The only emission released from a hydrogen-electric fuel cell powertrain is water.

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis of water using renewable electricity. Hydrogen’s energy density is three times higher than kerosene and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and it is over 100 times higher than batteries, with a relatively fast refuelling capability when using liquid hydrogen. In the last five years, the aviation sector has turned to hydrogen as a credible alternative fuel to reduce emissions, costs and noise, although it has been flown in multiple demonstrator aircraft globally since 1957.

Stralis is developing a hydrogen electric propulsion system in which electricity is supplied to an electric propeller motor via a fuel cell. The system generates power through the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen (from ambient air) within a fuel cell stack. However, current commercially available fuel cell systems remain too heavy to meet the strict performance and weight requirements of commercial aviation. Stralis is developing a novel lightweight fuel cell based around a new type of high temperature membrane, which allows Stralis to achieve higher propulsion system specific power making it suitable. If Stralis meets our reasonable cost and lifetime targets, we will be able to cut the operating cost of a 50 seat, propeller driven aircraft in half, compared to today’s Jet Fuel burning turboprop aircraft.

Globally, most domestic aviation services could be serviced by emerging battery electric (short range) and hydrogen-electric (medium range) technologies reducing an estimated 50% of global air travel CO2 emissions that come from flights under 2200km. Considering both emissions reduction and aircraft performance in terms of range and power, hydrogen-electric aircraft offers a credible alternative.

It is precisely this core function that is now threatened by a misguided energy policy.
Policy should no longer focus on subsidizing failed projects by fossil fuel giants, but on strengthening our real assets: logistical efficiency, an advanced circular economy, and high-tech innovation.","The departure of Shell and BP from the port of Rotterdam comes as no surprise, but is the predictable outcome of a disastrous policy, writes Merien ten Houten in this opinion piece. For decades, Dutch politicians have taken a double, fatal gamble: they have outsourced the energy transition to the fossil fuel industry itself and bet on the technological mirage of biofuels. The result is a looming deindustrialization, in which the port is no longer the beating heart but threatens to become a museum of faded glory.

Shell and the myth of sustainable aviation fuel

The political obsession with biofuels as a quick fix for sustainability has been mercilessly debunked by the industry itself. The final nail in the coffin came from Shell CEO Wael Sawan, who openly admitted that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is not a serious alternative. According to Sawan, SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of total demand in aviation, and can only grow with strict, enforced mandates. This is not a sign of confidence; it is an admission that the business case simply does not exist without government coercion. Politicians have invested billions in a solution that the intended producer itself does not believe in. The withdrawal of Shell and BP is therefore a cold, business decision based on an irrefutable fact: the strategy is a failure.

Wrong choices, wrong partners

The root of the problem lies deeper than a wrong choice of technology. It is the fundamental misconception that innovation can come from the old, established order. An opinion piece by current CDA leader Henri Bontenbal from 2020 painfully exposes this naivety. He argued for close cooperation with Shell to shape the transition. This is like asking Kodak to invent the digital camera or giving a tobacco manufacturer the lead in an anti-smoking campaign. It is a strategic blunder of the first order. Despite all the green rhetoric, large fossil fuel companies are primarily focused on maximizing profits from their existing fossil fuel activities. Asking them to lead the transition is asking them to dismantle their own revenue model. It is a recipe for delays, half-hearted projects, and an eventual return to fossil fuel core activities as soon as the wind changes.

The illusion of a Dutch energy superpower

The crisis in the port forces us to ask an even more fundamental question: what battle is the Netherlands actually trying to fight? The port is not only an energy hub, but above all a global player in logistics, storage, transshipment, and general cargo. It is precisely this core function that is now threatened by a misguided energy policy. Should a densely populated country without its own oil, with limited space for sun and wind, really want to compete with regions that have an overwhelming natural advantage?

Countries in the Middle East have oil and sun. Spain has space and sun. Iceland has an abundance of geothermal and hydroelectric power. Competing with these countries in energy production is a battle that the Netherlands will lose from the outset. Politicians must stop pursuing this illusion and focus on what the Netherlands can excel at.

A radical change of course is inevitable. Policy should no longer focus on subsidizing failed projects by fossil fuel giants, but on strengthening our real assets: logistical efficiency, an advanced circular economy, and high-tech innovation. Only by making these tough, strategic choices can the port of Rotterdam maintain its relevance and avoid becoming a silent witness to a failed industrial past.",https://ioplus.nl/api/media/file/waalhaven-rotterdam-2975676_1280-6.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 08:56:56.110690

This study addresses the direct reduction of iron ore with hydrogen and solar energy as the process heat source for clean iron/steel making and decarbonation of the metallurgical process. A novel rotary-type solar reactor was designed, constructed and tested for demonstration of hydrogen-based direct iron ore reduction under real direct solar irradiation. Such a solar reactor concept for clean ironmaking has never been implemented before. The reactor was first simulated to determine the temperature field, gas velocity, and H2 mole fraction contours in the directly-heated cavity for design validation. The on-sun experimental study focused on reactor testing and performance analysis (including Fe products yields and quality). The effect of increasing temperature (>900–1000 °C at the cavity center, depending on cavity size) or H2 flow rate (0.5–1–2 NL/min), and decreasing particle size on promoting the reduction extent was emphasized. Two different cavity designs and materials (stainless steel and mullite) were also considered to show their impact on the process performance. Using a ceramic cavity with smaller diameter allowed reaching higher temperatures over 1000 °C at its center, with faster heating rates and enhanced conversion. High Fe2O3 particle conversion up to 100 % was obtained based on continuous quantification of the H2 consumed by the reduction reaction. Solid products analysis (XRD, SEM/EDX) confirmed the production of pure Fe by the solar-driven process, therefore offering a promising route toward sustainable solar metallurgy.

The service allows companies to track the emissions from their flights and contribute to the purchase of SAF through a co-funding model. The emission reductions are verified by a third party, and customers receive an audited SAF certificate that can be used in sustainability reporting.

The reductions are allocated using a book-and-claim model, which means companies can claim the benefits of SAF even if the fuel is not physically used on their own flights.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment, said the initiative is part of a broader effort to make flying more sustainable. “Real progress requires cooperation across the system – from policymakers and energy producers to airlines and customers. With this new service, we want to speed up the adoption of alternative aviation fuels made from renewable materials.”

In 2024, about 0.5% of Finnair’s fuel purchases were SAF. This year, the airline aims to nearly triple that share. Finnair is working with partners such as Neste to expand the use of renewable fuels.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel, produced from materials including used cooking oil and animal fat waste, can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its life cycle compared to fossil jet fuel.

Karppinen noted that while aviation fuel will not become fully renewable in the near future, increasing the use of SAF can deliver meaningful emission reductions.

While it currently accounts for only a small share of global aviation fuel, initiatives like this aim to expand demand and investment.
“This isn’t just about travel emissions.
The COP30 platform marks SABA’s third procurement in 2025, following the launch of SAFc Connect and a new program to support next-generation SAF projects.","Washington: The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) has introduced a new platform to help COP30 participants address emissions from their travel to the UN climate summit in Belém, Brazil, in November 2025, reports PR Newswire.

The platform allows attendees to calculate their flight-related emissions and purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) certificates that meet SABA’s environmental standards. It is the first time such a tool has been made available to all COP participants, including those outside SABA membership, as part of efforts to boost awareness and adoption of SAF.

Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of the SABA Secretariat, said the initiative responds to a long-standing concern. “For years, people traveling to COP have worried about the emissions from their flights. Now they will have a way to measure and reduce those emissions while supporting the wider use of sustainable aviation fuel.”

The SAF used in this initiative will be supplied by SkyNRG following a competitive process run by SABA earlier this year.

Theye Veen, Chief Commercial Officer and Co-Founder of SkyNRG, welcomed the collaboration. “We’ve spent over a decade building supply chains and sustainability standards for SAF. This platform opens access to more people and helps the industry grow.”

Through the platform, commercial travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model to calculate emissions, while private jet passengers will rely on the Eurocontrol Small Emitters tool. After estimating emissions, attendees can purchase SAF certificates vetted by SABA. Buyers will then receive confirmation from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the process meets best-in-class chain-of-custody standards.

Elizabeth Sturcken, Vice President of Net Zero Ambition & Action at Environmental Defense Fund, said the platform’s strength lies in its quality assurance. “Not all sustainable fuels are the same. SABA has already vetted the fuel so buyers know their investment truly reduces emissions.”

SAF, produced from renewable or waste-based feedstocks, can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure. While it currently accounts for only a small share of global aviation fuel, initiatives like this aim to expand demand and investment.

Bryan Fisher, Managing Director at RMI, noted the broader impact. “This isn’t just about travel emissions. It shows how demand signals and trusted systems like the SAFc Registry can drive investment and speed up adoption of cleaner fuels.”

Since its launch in 2021, SABA has directed around $200 million toward SAF investments, including a multi-year procurement involving 27 organizations and supporting 50 million gallons of fuel. The COP30 platform marks SABA’s third procurement in 2025, following the launch of SAFc Connect and a new program to support next-generation SAF projects.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-12.png,N,,2025-09-23 05:56:11.011668

What Does This Award Mean For Wizz Air?
Winning this landmark award certainly offers a credibility boost for Wizz Air that can be converted into direct improvements in financial performance.
The Bottom Line At the end of the day, Wizz Air is a low-cost carrier capable of carbon-conscious operations.","Wizz Air won 'Sustainable Airline of the Year 2025' at the annual Sustainability Awards presented by Airline Economics, with the carrier being recognized for transparent reporting and investment in fuel-efficient aircraft. The airline offered an operations-focused environmental strategy, and it was recognized for its ability to execute this strategy. The airline reaffirmed its commitment to its Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, urging radical industry and government action.

The airline's full-year 2025 emissions intensity was set at 52.2 grams per passenger-kilometer, and by 2030, Wizz Air targets a 25% cut in carbon intensity and aims for 10% of flights to be powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The carrier's strategy rests on three pillars, including flights, fuel, and footprint, with the airline looking to reduce emissions by 30% through its fleet renewal strategy alone.

A Deeper Look At The Company's Sustainability Award

Wizz Air recently won 'Sustainable Airline of the Year 2025' at the Airline Economics Sustainability Awards Gala, which was held at the Natural History Museum in London during the Growth Frontiers London event and hosted on September 17, 2025. The judges recognized the airline's interest in maintaining industry-leading transparent reporting standards and investment in an extremely fuel-efficient fleet, according to an analysis from AeroTime Hub.

Low-cost airlines are some of the most interested in lowering carbon emissions, as reducing fuel costs contributes to their cost advantage. The airline aims for 10% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage by 2030, making Wizz Air one of the most committed to reducing its overall carbon footprint.

This award helps highlight the process that Wizz Air is making towards low-carbon flying across flights, fuel, and its overall carbon footprint. In a statement, Dorottya Durucsko, the Head of Government Affairs and Sustainability at Wizz Air, had the following words to share:

""Recognition from Airline Economics and Estuaire strengthens our belief that we are on the right path of strengthening ecosystem of aviation. Let’s WIZZ.""

What Does This Award Mean For Wizz Air?

Winning this landmark award certainly offers a credibility boost for Wizz Air that can be converted into direct improvements in financial performance. For customers, the airline's focus on sustainability offers some reputational improvements, especially when it comes to corporate travelers with ESG mandates. This validates choosing Wizz Air on high-volume European routes over other players, something the airline would like, especially when it competes with legacy players.

For investors and aircraft lessors, this award reinforces the thesis that even in a low-cost, high-utilization model, airlines can reduce per-passenger carbon emissions and potentially improve capital access and lease terms for customers. This continues to strengthen Wizz's hand in SAF offtake talks and airport slot negotiations, where noise and carbon emissions are very important.

Internally, this award rallies employees around its Net Zero plan, and it helps create a healthy pressure for the company to deliver on its target sustainability metrics. The flip side of this is that the airline faces increased scrutiny when it comes to emissions reporting, SAF sourcing, and on-time fleet renewal.

The Bottom Line

At the end of the day, Wizz Air is a low-cost carrier capable of carbon-conscious operations. As low-cost airlines typically face the highest cost pressures, many shy away from engaging directly with the more expensive aspects of ensuring sustainability in air travel operations.

Furthermore, there are also many steps left for airlines to take to reduce carbon emissions. Some carriers have taken more audacious steps than others, underscoring their ability to perform under pressure from investors.

All of this, and more, means that aviation will not be able to completely decarbonize any time soon. The days of hydrogen-powered aircraft that emit zero carbon are long ahead of us, and passengers will still see some individual carbon output for years to come.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/wizz-air-airbus-a320.jpeg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-23 05:56:19.484889

The airline association warns that an adequate supply of SAF remains the industry’s most significant hurdle to decarbonization.

At the same time, troubling reports over the environmental impact of some feedstocks used to produce sustainable aviation fuel raise questions over whether there is reliable control of the supply chain.

SAF Supply Is Critical To Meet Airline Net Zero Targets

“SAF is absolutely critical to the industry achieving its net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, during a press briefing last week, ahead of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s meeting. “We’re disappointed at the progress that has been made in relation to the production of SAF. It’s not where we need it to be…The problem, as we see it, is one of supply and not one of demand.”

IATA urges governments to provide direct incentives to producers, harmonize global standards, and reaffirm the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the only international framework for carbon offsetting. Walsh warned that SAF costs are rising, without resulting in higher production levels, due to overlapping national and regional mandates to adopt sustainable fuels.

SAF Supply Chain Credibility Under Pressure

For many years, IATA has said that it supports sustainable feedstocks for SAF. However, a recent Reuters investigation revealed that Diamond Green Diesel, a major U.S. biofuel refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, sourced beef tallow from Brazilian suppliers linked to illegal deforestation in the Amazon.

Despite the links, the refinery’s fuels are certified under the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification system and count toward CORSIA compliance. This allows airlines such as JetBlue and Southwest to claim emissions reductions. Critics argue that certification loopholes—specifically, treating tallow as a byproduct of beef production—mask indirect deforestation impacts.

Since 2022, the refinery has received more than $3 billion in U.S. tax credits.

From Sargassum To SAF: Innovation From Mexico’s Caribbean Coast

New pathways for SAF feedstock are emerging. Mexico is exploring the potential for sargassum algae—an invasive seaweed that has overwhelmed Caribbean beaches in recent years—as a potential SAF input. The project, supported by Mexico’s environment ministry and EU partners, will process sargassum at a new Circular Economy Centre in Quintana Roo.

Researchers in Puerto Rico, backed by the U.S. Department of Energy, are also exploring how to convert the troublesome algae into biofuels. The approach offers significant advantages: sargassum is abundant, does not require farmland, and provides a solution to an environmental problem that threatens local ecosystems and tourism.

For IATA SAF Technology Delays Outweigh Feedstock Supply Issues

However, IATA doesn’t feel that developing new feedstocks alone can fix the problem of SAF production.

“Feedstock is not the hindrance here for us reaching the 500 million tons of SAF that we need in 2050,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Chief Economist and SVP for Sustainability, during the IATA briefing. “The main bottleneck is actually how quickly we can mature and bring the technologies to commercial viability. They need a lot of support and incentives to be able to mature quickly.”

Walsh agreed, saying: “There’s a strong case to be made for aviation to have a fair share of the available feedstocks, principally because the airline industry is difficult to decarbonize. In the short to medium term, there’s plenty of feedstock available to fulfill the requirements for the airline industry.”

Setting A Successful SAF Policy

The 42nd ICAO Assembly could establish the framework for global aviation sustainability policy in the years to come. For IATA, the priorities are to ensure aviation has access to a fair share of available feedstocks, that governments provide incentives for producers to scale up, and to prevent policy fragmentation that could drive SAF costs higher without boosting output.

“We’re concerned that we’re not making sufficient progress in that area. We’re also concerned about the unintended consequences of some of the mandates that have been introduced, particularly under EU RefuelEU and in the UK, where fuel suppliers are mandated to produce 2% of SAF,” Walsh said. “This has led to a significant increase in fuel costs for airlines operating in the EU and in the UK, but has not translated into a significant increase in the production of SAF.”

Whether the airline argument results in favorable government action after the Montreal meeting is still an open question, though Walsh expressed optimism that it would.

The ICAO Assembly will decide whether SAF is a credible path toward net-zero aviation or if supply shortages, skepticism, and failed policies undermine airlines’ climate commitments.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d25596657ce41d9856dfca/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-23 05:56:23.954951

This reckless action also undermines efforts to establish a sustainable aviation fuel blending hub in East Chicago, a project that would reduce harmful emissions, strengthen domestic manufacturing, and open new markets for American workers and businesses.

Mrvan’s letter to Secretary Duffy stated:

“Dear Secretary Duffy,

I write today regarding awarded projects under the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) Grant Program.

In August 2024, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) announced the FAA awarded approximately $291 million to 36 projects in 22 states through the FAST Grant Program. This investment in advancing the nation’s development of low-emission aviation technologies heavily favored applicants dedicated to producing, transporting, blending, or storing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The infrastructure proposed for construction under these awarded projects aimed to put to work our building and construction trades at the onset, then support the capacity for new jobs and develop supply chain partnerships upon completion, thereby increasing the competitiveness and efficiencies within the commercial aviation and aerospace industry.

Recently, and regrettably, it has come to my attention that some awardees under the FAST Grant Program received notification from the FAA that FAST-SAF grant awards are rescinded.

This update as to the partnership between the government and awardees is disheartening given the magnitude of increased economic impact these projects would have within their respective regions as well as nationally. One such project is the award for CITGO’s East Chicago Terminal, in Indiana’s First Congressional District, where the project would be integrated into the existing jet fuel distribution hub and where existing pipeline infrastructure allows for the movement of fuel to Chicago O’Hare, Chicago Midway, Rockford and Milwaukee airports. The awarded proposal noted jet fuel end users at commercial and general aviation airports would be positioned to benefit from the project, including over forty airlines utilizing commercial airports within the Chicago region.

As we work to create opportunities for employment and wealth throughout our nation, the disinvestment in America’s aviation supply chains and within the commercial aviation and aerospace industry is counterproductive to the efforts to invest in America, particularly in manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure. I respectfully ask for your insight as to the rescinding of FAST Grant Program awards and as to similar future funding opportunities that DOT may offer.

The rise of greenhushing

In addition, greenhushing – where firms scale back communications about environmental and social commitments – is also reshaping consumer trust and brand perception, the report found, with mentions of top US companies tied to sustainability dropping nearly 10%.

‘From shifting consumer expectations to declining trust and lost market opportunities, this report reveals why going silent might be more damaging than speaking up,’ 3BL noted.

DEI commitment

The Phase 2A Taxonomy builds on Phase 1 of the Hong Kong Taxonomy published in May 2024 (see our previous blog post) by adding new sectors, economic activities, and transition elements. The Phase 2A Taxonomy also introduces climate change adaptation as an environmental objective, being one of the first few taxonomy frameworks globally to address this issue.

To recap - the Hong Kong Taxonomy aims to provide guidance for market participants to make more informed investment decisions regarding “green” and sustainable finance products in order to scale up the flow of capital towards green and sustainable assets, projects, and investments (not only in Hong Kong, but also in Mainland China and internationally). It is intended to provide market participants with greater confidence in sustainability claims, addressing greenwashing concerns and enhance comparability across portfolios and investments.

In this blog, we set out the key developments in the Phase 2A Taxonomy:

Expanded sector coverage

Two new sectors - manufacturing and information and communications technology - have been added to the four sectors under the Phase 1 Taxonomy (being energy; transportation; construction; and waste), therefore, increasing the total number of sectors from four to six.

Increase in economic activities

13 new economic activities have been added, bringing the total number of economic activities from 12 to 25. Updates have also been made to the technical screening criteria of a number of activities introduced under the Phase 1 Taxonomy.

The table below (reproduced from the consultation document) sets out the expansion of scope from Phase 1 to Phase 2A with new activities in bold:

* Activities published in Phase 1 and updated in Phase 2

Transition elements

The Phase 1 Taxonomy focused on defining criteria for “green” activities under the climate change mitigation environmental objectives whereas the Phase 2A Taxonomy introduces a “transition” category. As with other transition taxonomies developed in certain Asia jurisdictions, the aim is to scale up transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing.

For activities focused on climate change mitigation, the Phase 2A Taxonomy adopts a classification framework that categorises activities as Green, Transition, or Exclusion, based on their level of alignment with the globally recognised Paris Agreement 1.5°C climate goals.

Activities classified as Green are those that contribute substantially to climate change mitigation.

The Transition category covers “carbon-intensive activities that are on a time-bound decarbonisation journey to align their operations with a 1.5°C trajectory, ultimately reaching net zero in 2050”. The Transition category also covers activities or measures that enable substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the short term, even if these activities or measures ultimately may, or may not, align with the Green criteria. Accordingly, the two types of classifications under the Transition category are (i) “Transition Activity” and (ii) “Transition Measure”.

The Exclusion Category activities are currently not eligible under the Hong Kong Taxonomy, because, for example, the activity is not compatible with, or is not progressing rapidly enough towards, a 1.5°C decarbonisation pathway.

For the Transition category to apply, the Phase 2A Taxonomy sets out the following principles:

Transition applies only to activities with limited or no low-carbon alternatives to decarbonise - For example, fossil-based land transport vehicles are not eligible under the Hong Kong Taxonomy, as low-carbon alternatives such as electric vehicles are available.

Transition requires demonstrable progress – A suitable level of reduction in emissions intensity and/or an increase in energy efficiency to show steady improvement and growing alignment with the Green criteria must be demonstrated. Where feasible, forward-looking thresholds, based on currently available technologies, should be established for different time periods, reflecting anticipated improvements. These thresholds are subject to review in future iterations of the Hong Kong Taxonomy and may potentially be revised as new technologies and methodologies emerge.

Transition is time-bound - A “sunset date” must be set by which point all activities must either fully meet the Green criteria or be deemed non-aligned with the Hong Kong Taxonomy. Sunset dates are determined based on a range of factors and therefore vary across sectors / activities e.g. the maritime transport sector has a sunset date of 2030, while the energy sector has a longer lead time till 2035.

Transition focuses on existing infrastructure - Transition should primarily apply to existing infrastructure and activities, rather than new developments to prevents carbon lock-in and ensure that the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives are not hindered.

New environmental objective – climate adaption:

The Phase 2A Taxonomy introduces climate change adaptation as a new environmental objective. Climate change adaption has been introduced as one of the core objectives to address the growing funding needs for managing physical risks and responding to the increasing frequency of extreme weather events.

The adaptation framework set out in the Phase 2A Taxonomy (the Adaption Framework) has the following four core principles:

Building block approach for phased development – Recognising that climate change adaptation is relatively nascent and still evolving, the Adaptation Framework adopts a “building block approach” so that it can be expanded as circumstances and market needs change.

Localised for Hong Kong and adjacent regions - The Adaptation Framework prioritises the most relevant adaptation-related investments for Hong Kong and its adjacent regions that face similar physical risks.

Adapting measures-focused - The Phase 2A Taxonomy prioritises the water sector (with flood damage and water stress being identified as two climate hazards for the sector). It identifies four “adapting measures” within the water sector using the “whitelist approach” (explained below).

Graduated assessment approach – Similar to mitigation activities, adaptation-related investments must meet the defined substantial contribution criteria to be deemed taxonomy-aligned. Initially, the Adaptation Framework relies on a Whitelist approach which puts forward a “whitelist” of adapting measures that are automatically deemed eligible without the need to meet specific criteria.

What’s next?

The public consultation closes on 8 October 2025. The consultation paper is available on the HKMA website.

The Phase 2A Taxonomy is clear that the intention is for the scope of the taxonomy to evolve and expand in response to market dynamics, technological advancements, policy priorities and evolving green and sustainable practices and expectations.

Areas under consideration for future development on the Hong Kong Taxonomy include, in the energy sector, natural gas-fired power generation and nuclear energy power generation as transitional and low-carbon energy sources, as well as hydrogen for electricity generation; in the transportation sector, air transport, including emerging technologies to reduce emissions in the aviation sector (e.g. sustainable aviation fuel); and in the manufacturing sector, activities such as the production of cement, iron and steel, basic chemicals, low-carbon liquid fuels, and biofuels. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is a new sector which is under review, while the role of “Do No Significant Harm” will be explored in future iterations of the Hong Kong Taxonomy.

In terms of climate adaption, other climate hazards significant to Hong Kong and its adjacent regions - for instance, storm damage, mass movement damage, and heat stress - will be explored in future iterations of the Taxonomy.",https://images.passle.net/fit-in/1200x630/Passle/5f6c57568cb62a0d7c9eadee/SearchServiceImages/2025-09-22-08-31-56-334-68d1097c4212553ec5d5fd66.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 06:56:53.087634

Danny Elia, IFM executive director, global asset management, infrastructure, told Agri Investor that the government has “absolutely delivered” on its commitment last year to produce policy to boost the development of low-carbon liquid fuels.
Currently, Australia exports about A$4 billion worth of feedstocks for low-carbon fuels including canola and tallow.
Elia said standing up a low-carbon liquid fuel industry in Australia could bring benefits for agricultural investors, including more domestic crushing facilities.
According to research by Deloitte for Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation, liquid fuels account for about 32 percent of national emissions.","The Australian government is investing A$1.1 billion ($728 million; €618 million) in a program to support the domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels.

The Cleaner Fuels program will offer funding to producers of fuels including sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and e-fuels, for use in “hard-to-abate” sectors like aviation, heavy freight and mining.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers and other government representatives made the announcement at transport fuel provider Ampol’s oil refinery in Queensland, where Ampol is developing a A$2 billion renewable fuels facility in partnership with asset manager IFM Investors and grain processor GrainCorp.

Danny Elia, IFM executive director, global asset management, infrastructure, told Agri Investor that the government has “absolutely delivered” on its commitment last year to produce policy to boost the development of low-carbon liquid fuels.

However, he said there are three prongs to this policy that need to be worked through: supply, demand, and certification.

“[Wednesday’s] announcement was a supply-side announcement, and that will ultimately help to reduce the cost to the end customers and support the feasibility of these investments,” Elia said.

“There are other areas of policy that will have to continue to evolve around certification – but there’s great consultation going on with government there – and then there’s demand-side support.

“Effectively, we’re talking about a mandate there.”

Australia does not yet have a mandate around the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in contrast with the EU, which has required jet fuel suppliers to blend 2 percent SAF in with traditional fuels from 2025, and to increase this blend to 70 percent by 2050.

“The whole industry will need mandates because we’re talking about a new product,” Elia said.

“Everybody’s building up scale, the technology will get more cost-effective, supply chain will change to specialized feedstocks over time – all those things could take a decade, two decades.

“A mandate will be important because effectively we’ll otherwise be asking customers to buy a higher-cost product.”

Elia is pushing for a level of government support that allows local airlines to buy the SAF at around the same price as they could buy an imported product.

Currently, Australia exports about A$4 billion worth of feedstocks for low-carbon fuels including canola and tallow.

Elia said standing up a low-carbon liquid fuel industry in Australia could bring benefits for agricultural investors, including more domestic crushing facilities.

Currently, Australia exports most of its canola overseas, including more than 1.8 million tonnes annually to European countries, which can use it to make transport fuels, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

Fueling ambition

Since IFM partnered with Ampol and GrainCorp last year, Elia said it has spent more than A$30 million on engineering and technical feasibility assessments and has already signed agreements with technology providers.

The partnership has also increased its production ambitions from 500 million liters to about 750 million liters of SAF per year by 2030 – almost 40 percent of the government’s target of 2 billion liters by the same date.

Elia expects IFM to make a final investment decision on the Queensland SAF facility by mid-2026.

The Cleaner Fuels announcement comes as Australia prepares to present its updated emissions reduction target to the General Assembly of the UN next week.

On Thursday, prime minister Anthony Albanese announced a target to reduce emissions by 62-70 percent below 2005 levels by 2035.

Reducing emissions from liquid fuels could become an even more vital component in reaching this target as Australia’s offshore wind ambitions face a setback, with the state of Victoria this week delaying its first auction indefinitely.

According to research by Deloitte for Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation, liquid fuels account for about 32 percent of national emissions.

The CEFC report estimates that a domestic low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth A$36 billion by 2050, while cutting emissions by about 230 million tonnes CO2-e, which is equivalent to nearly half of Australia’s annual emissions.

Details of the Cleaner Fuels grants on offer are still being determined, with the government set to finalize the program design in 2026 and open applications by the following year.",https://media.agriinvestor.com/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2219151696.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 06:57:00.129768

This ambitious initiative is designed to reduce the industry’s dependence on imported fuels, create thousands of skilled jobs, and position Australia as a leader in clean aviation technology, driving both environmental responsibility and long-term economic growth.

Australia is preparing to transform its aviation sector with a historic investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The federal government has pledged AUD 1.1 billion (approximately \$720 million USD) over the next decade to establish a robust domestic SAF production industry. This funding will be distributed through grants to qualifying companies, enabling airlines to access locally produced alternatives to conventional jet fuel. The move marks a decisive step in reducing the nation’s reliance on imported fuels and accelerating the transition to low-carbon aviation.

The introduction of this program addresses multiple challenges facing the aviation sector. Air travel remains a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the demand for more sustainable solutions continues to rise globally. By building local SAF production capacity, Australia aims to tackle these emissions directly while also positioning itself as a leader in clean aviation technology. The initiative reflects a broader commitment to integrating environmental responsibility into the country’s transport and energy strategies.

Airlines across Australia have already signaled strong support for this program. They view SAF as a critical tool for achieving net-zero carbon goals and meeting growing regulatory requirements for carbon reduction. Although sustainable aviation fuel currently costs more than traditional jet fuel, increasing domestic production is expected to reduce prices over time. The government’s backing will provide the certainty and scale needed to make SAF a financially viable and widely adopted option for the aviation industry.

Scaling up SAF production carries benefits that extend far beyond the aviation sector. The initiative is poised to create thousands of new jobs across renewable energy, advanced manufacturing, and related fields. Regional economies stand to gain significantly as production facilities are established in locations outside major cities. This expansion will drive investment in infrastructure, boost local business opportunities, and foster economic development in areas that have historically relied on conventional industries.

The environmental impact of SAF adoption is substantial. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent depending on the feedstock and production process used. This reduction addresses both direct emissions from aircraft and the broader environmental footprint of fuel production. Airlines using SAF can report measurable progress toward sustainability targets, enhancing their environmental credentials and appealing to a growing population of eco-conscious travelers.

Travelers themselves are increasingly influencing the aviation industry’s shift toward sustainability. Many passengers now consider the environmental impact of their flights when choosing airlines and destinations. By integrating SAF into regular operations, Australian airlines can respond to this demand while strengthening their reputation for responsible travel. Hotels, resorts, and tourism operators benefit indirectly, as the adoption of low-carbon aviation options supports broader sustainability commitments and improves the overall environmental image of travel destinations across the country.

The government’s decade-long commitment signals that SAF will play a central role in Australia’s aviation strategy. Rather than relying on short-term incentives or ad hoc projects, the program provides a structured, long-term approach to developing a sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem. By supporting local production, the policy reduces dependence on imported fuels, strengthens energy security, and ensures that Australia benefits economically from the growing global market for SAF.

Innovation and research will play a key role in achieving these goals. Developing SAF at scale requires advancements in feedstock processing, bio-refining technologies, and supply chain logistics. Government funding will support companies investing in these areas, encouraging collaboration between energy producers, airlines, and research institutions. By fostering innovation, Australia can develop proprietary solutions that not only meet domestic demand but also position the country as a global exporter of sustainable aviation technologies.

In addition to its environmental and economic benefits, SAF contributes to energy diversification. As the aviation sector faces volatile fuel prices and geopolitical risks associated with imported fossil fuels, domestic SAF production provides a more stable, resilient energy source. This security allows airlines to plan operations with greater certainty and reduces exposure to international price fluctuations, benefiting both the industry and consumers.

The adoption of SAF also aligns with global sustainability trends. Governments, international aviation organizations, and major airlines are increasingly focused on decarbonizing air travel. By investing early and decisively, Australia can demonstrate leadership on the international stage and influence global standards for SAF production and use. This leadership strengthens the country’s negotiating position in climate discussions and opens opportunities for collaboration with other nations pursuing similar low-carbon aviation goals.

Looking ahead, the rollout of SAF is expected to accelerate further as production scales up and costs decline. Airlines will integrate SAF into flight operations, gradually increasing the proportion of sustainable fuel used across domestic and international routes. The resulting emissions reductions will support Australia’s broader climate targets, contribute to global aviation sustainability efforts, and help the industry adapt to evolving regulatory frameworks.

Ultimately, the government’s investment in sustainable aviation fuel represents a transformative step for Australia’s aviation sector. By establishing a domestic production base, supporting innovation, creating jobs, and promoting regional economic development, the SAF program ensures that low-carbon aviation becomes both feasible and competitive. For travelers, airlines, and the environment, the benefits are clear: cleaner skies, stronger local economies, and a sustainable path forward for air travel.

CGF, a wholly owned subsidiary of Catagen, will use patented modular-reactor technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using off-grid renewable/low-carbon electricity sources—meaning fuel can continue to be produced consistently and is flexible and resilient to any fluctuations in grid connectivity.

Unlike centralized SAF projects that require large investments, lengthy approval processes, extended build times and extensive energy supply, ClimaHtech Green Flight is a decentralized, electrified, modular-production model.

Marking the launch of CGF, Catagen announced new strategic partnerships with Ryanair and Shell Aviation Ireland Ltd. for offtake agreements of SAF production and use.

The partnerships were unveiled at the ClimaHtech Technology Campus launch event, where Catagen showcased its patented BioHGen and eFuel Gen reactor technologies for producing SAF through two pathways: biobased SAF (power-and-biomass-to-liquid) and eSAF (power-to-liquid).

CGF production systems will be manufactured off-site and can be deployed close to renewable electricity assets or close to airports where fuel is needed and with minimal disruption to operations.

Using an industrial waste stream and renewable energy, each unit from CGF will be capable of producing 1 million liters (264,000 gallons) of SAF per year, with over 90 percent reduction in emissions from-well-to-wing compared to fossil jet fuel.

“Progressing towards our sustainability goals depends on securing scalable and affordable SAF,” said Steven Fitzgerald, Ryanair’s director of sustainability and finance. “Catagen’s decentralized SAF model allows production to be brought closer to demand, enabling faster deployment and reducing the bottlenecks that slow down traditional SAF projects. We see this as a critical pathway to reducing our emissions while continuing to deliver affordable travel.”

Catagen’s decentralized, modular approach provides a new way of producing SAF that can complement centralized facilities, shorten timelines and provide more flexible access to fuel. This model has the potential to reduce reliance on imported SAF, increase energy independence, unlock new markets and accelerate the industry’s journey to net zero.”

Mel Courtney, CEO ClimaHtech Green Flight, said, “The U.K. has a mandate to have 10 percent of flights using SAF by 2030, with the EU having a 70 percent target by 2050. On current supply, these targets are ambitious, with the International Air Transport Association currently estimating demand surpassing 360 million tons by 2050, up from 1 million tons that were available in 2024. To reach these targets, we need technologies that can be scaled up alongside the development of surrounding infrastructures around airports. In the U.K., challenges around energy security have been made clear, hence the push from government to increase our use of renewables in the grid. Our approach to SAF should match this approach and be accessible to the market where it is needed to be deployed. The launch of ClimaHtech Green Flight is the next step in our plan to decarbonize the aviation industry.”

Catagen was the first company to submit a sample of SAF to the EU SAF clearinghouse in 2024 and is progressing through fast-track certification on the ASTM D7566 Annex A1 approved pathway.

The company’s preproduction units, supported by the U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, are already operational.

Catagen’s first-of-a-kind SAF production system will reach commercial operation in a short time horizon, according to the company, producing 1 million liters (264,000 gallons) of SAF per year.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_b455ca0c11d242729a5c09487334c3c8~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_732,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/80995f_b455ca0c11d242729a5c09487334c3c8~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-09-23 03:56:19.245458

The report, prepared by the Ministry of Civil Aviation with the UN aviation body ICAO and supported by the European Union, estimates India could produce 14–33 million tonnes of SAF annually from sources such as vegetable oils, sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, and municipal solid waste. The figure does not include SAF from waste gas fermentation or power-to-liquid technologies.

ICAO’s Global Framework aims for a 5% cut in CO2 emissions from international flights by 2030 through SAF, lower-carbon aviation fuels, and cleaner energy. India has set targets of 1% SAF by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030 for international flights, in line with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme (CORSIA).

The report calls for urgent policy action, including forming a SAF Council with senior officials and industry leaders to plan the sector’s growth. It also recommends a clear policy framework to tackle issues such as slow commercialisation and high production costs.

The alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) process is identified as the “largest opportunity” for India due to the availability of ethanol feedstocks and easier transport. However, the report warns of potential competition for ethanol from the road transport sector, where ethanol-blended petrol (E20) is being promoted.

The study also notes that first-generation ethanol from food crops is the most practical option currently, as second-generation ethanol from agricultural residues, grasses, and wood is still scaling up slowly.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SAF-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 05:56:52.326373

Sustainable aviation fuel in Australia is set for a major boost as the federal government pledges AUD 1.1 billion (approx. $720 million USD) over the next decade to build a domestic production base. The funding will be distributed through grants to eligible companies, ensuring that aviation has access to locally produced alternatives to conventional jet fuel.

The investment comes after years of pressure from airlines and industry leaders, including former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, who consistently highlighted the urgency of accelerating the transition to low-carbon aviation. By scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Canberra aims to position Australia at the forefront of green aviation innovation.

Both Qantas and Virgin Australia have welcomed the initiative, noting that SAF is central to achieving their net-zero targets and addressing growing regulatory and consumer expectations around carbon reduction. At present, sustainable aviation fuel costs significantly more than traditional jet fuel, but building local production capacity is expected to narrow this price gap over time.

The broader benefits extend beyond aviation. The SAF program is expected to create new jobs in renewable energy and advanced manufacturing, while also supporting regional economies where production facilities may be established. For the travel and hospitality sector, the adoption of SAF strengthens environmental credentials and helps meet the demands of increasingly eco-conscious travelers.

The government’s long-term commitment underlines how sustainable aviation fuel in Australia is becoming a central pillar of its aviation policy. By reducing reliance on imported fuels and cutting lifecycle emissions, SAF will play a crucial role in ensuring the industry’s sustainable growth.",https://www.traveldailynews.asia/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sap-1200x580.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 19:56:09.871549

If the project takes off, pulp from that facility would be used to make fuel for planes and other aircraft. Officials are eyeing a site for the wood pulp plant in Hayward, on a property that adjoins an existing LP Building Solutions manufacturing plant.

Five years ago, the Verso paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids shut down. That plant was a major consumer of pulpwood, and its closure left a “big hole” in Wisconsin’s pulpwood market, said state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, R-Tomahawk, who’s among the sponsors of legislation announced Monday.

Starting this year, airports within the European Union must use at least 2 percent of what’s known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, within their fuel mix. The United States does not currently impose such requirements, but the EU is set to increase its mandated SAF percentages in coming years.

SAF is an alternative to fossil fuel, and the goal of those requirements is to cut back on carbon emissions. SAF can include biofuels, such as energy made from pulped wood.

“There is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said during a Monday morning news conference at the state Capitol.

A German company called Synthec Fuels is looking to run the plant in partnership with Wisconsin-based Johnson Timber, sponsors of the legislation said.

Synthec Fuels is also considering other locations in Minnesota or Michigan, Felzkowski said.

She suggested that the proposed tax incentives could help seal the deal for Wisconsin.

“There’s three states vying for this” Felzkowski said. “The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters.”

The newly announced legislation would set aside $60 million in tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation for the project. Wisconsin would also give out a $150 million grant to help create the plant. That grant would be backed by public borrowing through the Wisconsin Department of National Resources’ forestry account.

In exchange, the company creating the plant would agree to invest at least $1.5 billion into the project over the first five years. And at least 80 percent of the wood that would be processed at the plant would need to come from Wisconsin forests over that same five-year period.

The facility is expected to create 150 jobs, legislative sponsors said. Those roles would help revitalize a local economy that’s been hit hard by a declining market for paper producers, said Mike Markgren, the county administrator in Sawyer County.

Hayward, where the plant could be located, is the largest city in that county.

“Logging fell on hard times after the paper mills began to close,” Markgren said. “Demand decreased, prices flattened and we suffered.”

Markgren said Sawyer County’s economy has been increasingly centered on tourism.

“Those hospitality jobs pay on average $37,000 annually, and that is likely with no benefits, so that is not a sustainable wage,” Markgren said.

In contrast, he hopes a new wood pulp factory will bring more “well-paying jobs with full benefits,” to the region.

“Anything that can be done to strengthen the diversification of industry in Sawyer County is very welcome,” Markgren said.

The legislation began circulating for cosponsors Monday. State Rep. Chanz Green, R-Grand View, was listed as lead sponsor, along with more than half a dozen other Republicans.

The office of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers did not respond to WPR’s request for comment Monday, but Felzkowski described the governor as “very interested” in the proposal.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/250806_MADISONWI05-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 18:56:08.148869
