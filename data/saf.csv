,,2025-09-16 12:54:54+00:00,Business Airport International,Is business aviation being left behind in the sustainable fuel race?,"Paige Smith, Web Team",,,,,https://www.businessairportinternational.com/features/is-business-aviation-being-left-behind-in-the-sustainable-fuel-race.html,"As the aviation industry races toward decarbonization targets, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the primary pathway to reducing emissions.
“Business aviation operates in a fragmented ecosystem,” explains Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR.
“We don’t anticipate business aviation will be priced out or deprioritized in the USA, as business aviation has been at the forefront of adopting and integrating SAF into the supply chain,” he says.
Ricci says “Business aviation may not always command the same priority as commercial airlines in the SAF market.
“Particularly at tier one and tier two business aviation hubs,” Ricci says.","As the aviation industry races toward decarbonization targets, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the primary pathway to reducing emissions. However, the fragmented nature of business aviation’s supply chain creates several hurdles in securing consistent access to this critical fuel source.

“Business aviation operates in a fragmented ecosystem,” explains Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR. “Unlike commercial carriers that benefit from large, centralized fuel purchasing and dedicated airport infrastructure, business aircraft rely heavily on fixed-base operators and decentralized supply chains.

“This makes consistent SAF access more difficult, particularly at secondary or regional airports.”

The infrastructure challenges are particularly acute for smaller airports that serve business aviation. C.R. Sincock, II, executive vice president of Avfuel Corporation says, “The primary limitations to SAF availability stem from geographic and infrastructure constraints, particularly around access points like blending terminals and truck racks. With only a handful of blending facilities in operation, transporting SAF from these locations to smaller airports presents both economic and logistical challenges.”

The SAF landscape

The supply for sustainable aviation fuel chain remains in its infancy compared to traditional jet fuel infrastructure. “The SAF supply chain is still developing and remains relatively immature in breadth compared to the established production infrastructure for traditional Jet-A,” Sincock explains. “Currently, the primary pathway used to produce SAF is the HEFA-SPK process, whereby SAF is derived from used cooking oils and tallow.”

Production capacity, while growing, still lags significantly behind demand. “SAF production is steadily increasing but supply still lags behind the volumes required to both reach industry goals, like America’s SAF Grand Challenge to produce 3 billion gallons annually by 2030, and the various mandates in the UK and EU,” Sincock says.

This creates a complex web of challenges. “One of the primary challenges is the geographic gap between where SAF is produced, where it’s blended and where it’s ultimately used, making efficient distribution a logistical hurdle,” Sincock explains.

Commercial competition

The situation becomes more complex as major airlines sign substantial multi-year offtake agreements with SAF producers. “Larger hub airports are typically prioritized for SAF deliveries due to their existing airline contracts, robust infrastructure and direct pipeline supply from refiners,” Sincock explains.

“Access to pipeline-fed fuel storage enhances SAF distribution’s efficiency and economic viability.” This prioritization has become particularly evident in regulated markets. “This has become especially evident in the EU where mandates and different country’s regulations favor delivery to high-traffic airports within the producing country’s boundaries,” Sincock notes.

However, Sincock remains optimistic about business aviation’s position. “We don’t anticipate business aviation will be priced out or deprioritized in the USA, as business aviation has been at the forefront of adopting and integrating SAF into the supply chain,” he says.

The numbers support this assertion. “Business aviation continues to punch above its weight, while it accounts for roughly 4% of total jet fuel consumption, it is responsible for more than 10% of all SAF usage,” Sincock notes.

Despite this leadership, concerns about long-term access persist. Ricci says “Business aviation may not always command the same priority as commercial airlines in the SAF market. However, what offsets this is flexibility. Business aircraft can often refuel at airports with SAF availability, and many operators are leveraging book and claim models.”

Regional disparities

Geographic location significantly impacts SAF access, with notable differences between markets. “Europe, particularly in countries like the Netherlands, France, and Sweden, has more consistent SAF availability at major business aviation airports due to both regulatory pushes, for example blending mandates, and infrastructure readiness,”Ricci says. “North America is still largely opportunistic, SAF is available at a few key hubs but not widely.”

The European regulatory environment creates both opportunities and challenges. “In the EU, however, SAF is more challenging to obtain outside of major hubs,” Sincock explains. “This is largely due to legislated mandates that prioritize larger airports and airline carriers, making SAF access and logistics more difficult for smaller airports,” he says.

Some operators are finding innovative ways to address supply chain concerns through local production. Johan Emmoth, CEO and FBO manager at Grafair Flight Management in Sweden, has pioneered an approach that addresses environmental concerns about SAF transportation.

“Historically SAF has had to be transported over long distances, which sometimes leads you to think — how good is that for the environment when the fuel had to travel overseas or by trucks?” Emmoth explains. “What’s very interesting for us now is that Sweden actually has a refinery that can produce SAF locally and it is not too far from our FBO. We got our first locally produced SAF driven to us in a dedicated trailer that’s only used for full blend SAF. And it’s been pulled by a truck that only runs on 100% renewable diesel fuel, so it’s environmentally friendly.”

Storage challenges

The technical aspects of SAF distribution present both opportunities and obstacles. “From a storage perspective, SAF is treated simply as jet fuel. They both conform to ASTM D-1655 specifications,” Sincock explains. “Because of this, in most cases, SAF is intermingled with jet fuel in the airport’s established fuel storage system, and management systems carefully track its inventory.”

However, the distribution infrastructure creates more complex challenges. “To help lower supply costs, larger airports benefit from pipeline access and higher load capacity,” Sincock notes. “In contrast, smaller airports rely on a trucking system to deliver SAF. This may be a less economical option than pipeline transport, but it works within the system’s existing infrastructure.”

The scale of operations at smaller airports creates additional economic pressures. “Additionally, the scale of fuel uplift is smaller, making the business case for physical SAF delivery less compelling for suppliers focused on volume and throughput,” Ricci says.

Book and claim solutions

To address supply chain gaps, fuel suppliers have developed book and claim systems that allow operators to purchase SAF’s environmental benefits without requiring physical delivery at their location.

“Through Avfuel’s book and claim system, customers can purchase the environmental attributes of SAF, the emissions reduction benefit that is linked to actual SAF volumes delivered elsewhere,” Sincock explains. “This allows customers to claim the sustainability value without requiring physical SAF to be available at their specific location.”

The adoption of these programs has accelerated significantly. “We’ve seen a significant uptick, both in volume and in the sophistication of client questions,” Ricci says. “Operators, flight departments, and even fractional jet owners are now integrating SAF credit purchases into broader sustainability strategies. The demand isn’t just compliance-driven, it’s reputational and competitive as well.”

However, some operators prefer the transparency of physical SAF delivery. “I think book and claim will remain the major model. It makes the most sense,” Emmoth explains.

Market demand

The demand profile for SAF in business aviation shows encouraging trends. “Demand for SAF is growing steadily, driven by strong interest from sustainability-focused operators and Fortune 500 companies,” Sincock says. “The highest demand comes from those with defined ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] targets and active carbon offset programs.”

FBOs are responding with infrastructure investments. “Particularly at tier one and tier two business aviation hubs,” Ricci says. “FBO operators that have been early movers, have invested in tank modifications, SAF-ready fuel trucks, and staff training.”

Looking ahead, industry experts anticipate continued growth in SAF availability. “By 2030, I envision SAF being routinely available at most major bizav hubs in North America and Europe, with scalable options in Asia and the Middle East,” Ricci forecasts. “Pricing will likely remain at a premium, but we expect more stability and incentives to narrow the gap.”

Industry leaders identify several key areas requiring attention to accelerate SAF adoption. “First and foremost, we need consistent, stable, long-term policy support, such as tax credits and incentives, at all levels of government to encourage the significant investment required for SAF production,” Sincock says.

Awareness of SAF remains equally critical. “Secondly, ongoing education is critical, not just for end-users, FBOs and airports, but also for government agencies to build widespread understanding of SAF’s environmental benefits when clients are deciding to go in the green direction and making sure it’s not just green washing.

“Sweden has a history of flight shaming and environmental consciousness, so I think it’s a good to show SAF is an option but it’s up to the customer to choose whether they’d like to have.”

“Third, we must encourage end users to engage on how their flight departments can play a role in meeting corporate ESG goals through SAF adoption,” Sincock explains.

The path forward for business aviation’s SAF access will likely require a multi-faceted approach. While book and claim systems provide immediate scalability, operators like Grafair show that physical SAF delivery can work when supported by local production and dedicated infrastructure. The industry’s challenge lies not in choosing between these models, but in developing parallel systems that serve different market segments and operational needs.

Success will ultimately depend on continued investment in production capacity, infrastructure development, and education initiatives that help operators understand their options. As Emmoth notes, “You need to produce SAF and pump it into the system. What we’re doing puts SAF on the table for decision makers and big companies.” With business aviation punching above its weight in SAF adoption, the sector’s continued leadership in sustainable fuel integration will be crucial for achieving industry-wide decarbonization targets.",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/82-3756897089-68835a103ee28.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:56:11.528100

Plans to serve 160+ destinations from EWR this fall and winter – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin

United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark

NEWARK, N.J., Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- United CEO Scott Kirby was in Newark (EWR) today to celebrate the airline's operational turnaround at EWR and discuss the bright future for the carrier's premier East Coast hub.

This summer, United celebrated its best operational summer ever at EWR, putting the airport on par with JFK and LGA for on-time performance. In fact, United flights out of Newark arrived on-time more often this summer than flights operated by airlines out of JFK or LGA.*

These rankings come as more than six million people flew United on-time through Newark this summer, the most in the airline's history.** In addition, United's Connection Saver technology helped more than 28,000 customers make tight connections in Newark this summer.

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin. Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Additionally, United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark.

""Newark is operating better than ever and United's future here is bright – that's a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,"" said Kirby. ""I want to also thank Secretary Duffy, FAA Administrator Bedford, Governor Murphy and all the national, state and local leaders who helped ensure that Newark remains a safe and reliable crown jewel for millions of domestic and international travelers. As the FAA and DOT implement their plan of increased staffing and improved technology, the reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.""

""Millions of passengers each year rely on Newark Airport for their travel needs. Over the past several months, we have worked diligently with our partners at the Port Authority and the FAA to move towards a return to full capacity at Newark Airport, and I am pleased with our progress,"" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. ""United's continued investment in Newark Airport will serve as a significant economic driver for our region, creating thousands of new jobs for New Jersey communities. I thank United CEO Scott Kirby for his partnership in supporting our region's world-class transportation infrastructure.""

In April and May, challenges associated with air traffic control staffing, technology outages and runway construction led to a concentrated number of delays and cancelations out of Newark. But since that time, bookings and customer confidence in flying through Newark have bounced back thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees, including:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2

Beginning in May, the FAA limited Newark flight operations to 68 per hour. This was down from a high of 86, a number that was well above EWR's maximum theoretical capacity even in ideal operating conditions. The FAA has tentatively limited flights out of Newark to 72 per hour through summer 2026.

In July, the FAA installed a new fiber optic network to support the air traffic control system

""We're building a brand new air traffic control system, and we started by addressing the challenges of outdated technology at Newark,"" said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. ""This summer, the FAA took immediate action to relieve substantial inconveniences to the traveling public—deploying a temporary satellite backup system, upgrading fiberoptic technology, expanding high-bandwidth telecommunications, increasing controller staffing, and limiting arrivals and departures. Through strong partnerships with the Port Authority and United, we made significant progress this summer.""

United invests more in Newark destinations

As the gateway to the Atlantic, Newark plays a critical role in connecting passengers to United's industry-leading international network.

United's most talked about 2025 destination, Nuuk, Greenland, will return to Newark for summer 2026 following a successful and enthusiastic first season.

This summer, EWR had more international departures (over 20,000) and more departures to Europe (more than 8,200) than any other United hub

This summer, all of United's 32 European destinations were served from EWR

In 2025, United serves 82 international destinations from EWR

EWR serves the most international destinations unique to United (seven) of any hub

By the end of 2025, United will have grown its international network in EWR by 12 destinations since 2018, including the six additions this year

EWR has more widebody departures than any other United hub

United hiring in Newark

United proudly employs more than 14,000 people in the Newark/New York City area, including more than 3,000 pilots at its pilot base and more than 5,700 flight attendants.

United looks to hire another 2,500 employees before the end of 2026.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Comes to Newark

United will be the first airline to bring sustainable aviation fuel to Newark, with plans to purchase up to one million gallons from Neste for use at EWR this year. United purchased more than 13 million gallons of SAF in 2024, more than any other U.S. airline.

“Securing long-term SAF supply is not only an investment in our operations but a commitment to our clients and to the industry’s future,” said Patrick Hansen, chief executive of Luxaviation Group. “Together with Haffner Energy, we are setting the benchmark for how business aviation can accelerate the scale-up of sustainable fuel production across Europe.”

France-based Haffner Energy develops clean fuel solutions using biomass residues including agricultural and municipal waste through proprietary technology. The company has announced SAF projects in France and Iceland with full-scale production expected by 2030 to align with European SAF mandate requirements.

The European mandate requires airlines to blend SAF into jet fuel at 6 percent or higher ratios starting in 2030. Philippe Haffner, co-founder and chief executive of Haffner Energy, noted that securing long-term offtake agreements remains crucial for financing SAF production facilities.

“We are pleased with this offtake partnership with Luxaviation as it will significantly facilitate the financing of our SAF projects in Europe,” Haffner said. “These agreements guarantee SAF purchase at stable prices over periods exceeding five years.”

Both companies participate in Project SkyPower, an international chief executive initiative focused on accelerating SAF development and adoption. According to the companies, pricing assumptions fall within the lower end of current industry benchmarks.

The collaboration addresses policy goals including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan. The offtake agreement expects finalization by September 2026.

Haffner Energy draws on 32 years of experience designing, manufacturing and operating clean fuel solutions using wet and dry biomass residues.

At the time of the arrest, Frialto stated it had suspended business with the rancher’s properties.
The company claimed it has since blocked both the farm and another property from the same supplier from future sales.","DGD (Diamond Green Diesel), a U.S. leader in renewable diesel production, imports beef tallow from a supplier fed by Brazilian slaughterhouses, which purchased it from farms fined for illegal deforestation. These include a plant that purchased cattle from a rancher described by Brazilian authorities as the “largest destroyer of the Amazon” ever investigated.

Repórter Brasil obtained documents about DGD’s supplier chain and identified cases with connections slaughterhouses that bought cattle from ranchers fined for practices associated with large-scale illegal deforestation (more details below).

These cases raise a red flag about the potential harmful climate impacts of alternative fuels. Despite biofuels’ image as a ‘green’ fuel, the use of livestock inputs in their production can increase deforestation, warns Tim Searchinger, a senior researcher at Princeton University. “The reason land is being deforested is to meet growing demand for food and biofuels,” he says.

Deforestation accounts for around 13% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to UN estimates. In Brazil, it is the leading driver of such emissions.

On its website, DGD claims its industrial plant can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil diesel. However, it does not mention any measures to prevent the purchase of tallow sourced from deforested pastures. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to fueling cars and trucks, DGD’s Texas facility produces SAF – short for “sustainable aviation fuel” – a product intended to reduce the climate footprint of the aviation industry. Avfuel Corporation, one of the main independent jet fuel suppliers in the U.S., received the first SAF delivery from DGD in December 2024.

From forest destruction to biofuel production

According to customs documents reviewed by Repórter Brasil, DGD regularly purchases beef tallow from the Fasa group, a Brazilian company specializing in processing slaughterhouse by-products. DGD and Fasa belong to the same economic group, as the Brazilian company was acquired in 2022 by Texas-based multinational Darling Ingredients, one of DGD’s owners through a joint venture with Valero Energy. Also headquartered in Texas, Valero Energy is one of the largest fuel producers in the U.S.

The Fasa group has subsidiaries in the Amazon – called Araguaia and Rio Verde – which source tallow from various slaughterhouses in the region. The supplier’s history, according to official documents obtained by the report, includes Frialto, a slaughterhouse from Mato Grosso identified through GTAs (animal transport guides) purchasing cattle from a rancher arrested by the Brazilian Federal Police in 2023. He was accused by the Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office of clearing an area of forest equivalent to about 12,000 American football fields and is identified by the agency as the largest Amazonian deforester ever investigated.

One month after the arrest, Repórter Brasil revealed that Frialto had bought cattle from the rancher and his relatives. Now, the outlet has obtained an official letter from the government of Mato Grosso, dated October 2023, related to the renewal of Frialto’s operating license. In the document, a Fasa subsidiary is listed as the recipient of residues generated by Frialto. According to customs records, this same Fasa unit sent beef tallow to DGD multiple times between 2023 and 2024.

At the time of the arrest, Frialto stated it had suspended business with the rancher’s properties. Repórter Brasil contacted the slaughterhouse again to inquire about its dealings with Fasa and any measures taken to avoid sourcing from illegally deforested areas but received no response.

Fasa, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, and DGD also did not respond to requests for comment.

Another illegal deforestation case linked to DGD’s supply chain involves the LKJ slaughterhouse. Cattle movement records accessed by Repórter Brasil show that in July 2023, LKJ purchased animals from a ranch in Brazil’s Cerrado biome — called Apucarana Farm—which had 381 hectares embargoed after environmental authorities confirmed illegal deforestation. The Cerrado is another native biome in Brazil facing rapid destruction and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

A Fasa subsidiary in Pará state regularly received residues from LKJ between 2022 and 2023, according to corporate documents obtained by Repórter Brasil showing truck routes for raw material deliveries. That same subsidiary also supplied beef tallow to DGD from 2023 to 2024, according to customs records.

When contacted, LKJ attributed the cattle purchase from Apucarana Farm to a failure in its internal procedures, stating that it has a policy of not buying from embargoed areas (see full response here). The company claimed it has since blocked both the farm and another property from the same supplier from future sales. LKJ did not comment on its business relationship with Fasa.

Like other slaughterhouses, LKJ is a signatory to an agreement with Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office (MPF) that requires adopting anti-deforestation criteria in cattle procurement in the Amazon. In May of this year, MPF released audit results focused on LKJ’s operations, revealing that roughly 2,700 animals slaughtered by the company in 2022 – about 8% of the audited sample – did not meet the agreement’s criteria. It was the worst result among the six audited slaughterhouses in the state of Tocantins, where LKJ is located.

In 2023 and 2024, in addition to sourcing tallow from Fasa, DGD also imported tallow directly from Minerva, Brazil’s second-largest beef company, customs data show.

Last year, a study by the organization Mighty Earth identified the company as a client of deforester in the Brazilian Pantanal, who was fined with the highest penalty ever imposed by the Mato Grosso State Department of the Environment. The individual was held responsible by the state’s Civil Police for the destruction of 81,200 hectares of native vegetation – an area larger than the island of Manhattan – through the aerial spraying of pesticides containing chemicals also found in “Agent Orange.” At the time of publication, which used data gathered by Repórter Brasil, the company reported that it had blocked the rancher from future business.

Minerva’s plant in Araguaína (Tocantins state) is among those listed in customs documents exporting tallow to DGD. A 2021 Repórter Brasil report showed that this facility had purchased cattle from a rancher fined for illegally clearing 80 hectares of Amazon rainforest. Another investigation that same year revealed that the plant’s indirect supply chain included a farm where Brazilian authorities rescued workers from conditions analogous to slavery.

Minerva was contacted to comment on its cattle procurement policies and its relationship with DGD, but did not respond.

Brazil is exporting more tallow to the U.S.

In 2022, Brazil exported 63,000 tons of tallow to the U.S. In 2023, that number jumped to 202,000 tons. And in just the first five months of 2025, Brazil had already shipped 111,000 tons, according to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services.

The increase coincides with the acquisition of the Fasa group by Darling Ingredients. Last year, the U.S. was the destination for 90% of all Brazilian tallow exports.

Beef tallow is derived from bovine tissue waste and has a relatively low production cost, as it is extracted from less valuable parts of the animal, such as the carcass. Its use is often described as “animal recycling” and is commonly promoted as a solution for disposing of slaughterhouse residues.

Because it is considered a by-product, tallow is not subject to the same traceability requirements as beef. However, according to Searchinger, tallow is a valuable commodity for the food industry – it is, for example, widely used in animal feed. When diverted to fuel production, he explains, it increases the demand for vegetable oils and other fats to replace it. “This, in turn, increases pressure on land,” he says.

Searchinger argues that the growth of biofuels is only viable because of public subsidies. He believes that instead of supporting the sector, rich countries should fund environmental conservation in the Global South.

“A $100-per-ton CO₂ tax on airline tickets could generate a $100 billion annual fund. That money could be used to pay countries like Brazil to conserve their forests and boost livestock productivity in already cleared areas,” Searchinger suggests.",https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/desmatamento-parque-guaraja-mirim-alessandro-falco-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:57:05.334420

The 25-point roadmap, unveiled on 15 September at the Aviation Industry Association Conference in Wellington by Associate Transport Minister James Meager, sets out a programme of deliverables to address regulatory bottlenecks, workforce shortages, fragile regional connectivity and the transition to lower-carbon aviation.

“Aviation is vital to New Zealand’s economic prosperity and our way of life,” Meager said. “This plan is a practical roadmap that tackles the challenges head-on — from strengthening regional connectivity and passenger rights to embracing new technologies and building a skilled workforce.”

A major milestone for New Zealand’s aviation sector

The Action Plan is the first of its kind, developed jointly by industry and government through the Interim Aviation Council following the Air Navigation System Review.

It marks a decisive attempt to provide long-term leadership for an industry that contributes more than 5.6 per cent of GDP and supports thousands of jobs across tourism, trade, logistics and essential services.

Meager stressed that progress is already underway. “We’ve made progress on several fronts, including $30 million in loans from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to support regional routes, and the start of a first-principles review of Civil Aviation Authority funding,” he told delegates.

The Interim Council will now transition into a permanent Aviation Council to provide oversight and refresh the plan every three years.

Civil Aviation Authority reforms to support aviation growth

A central focus is on reforming the regulatory environment. The Civil Aviation Authority and Ministry of Transport will rework rules for emerging technologies such as drones and uncrewed aircraft, while also introducing a two-year rolling programme of rule changes to accelerate decision-making.

Certification wait times are to be shortened through better resourcing, digitised systems and automation of routine processes. The government’s stated ambition is a framework that is robust, internationally credible and agile, maintaining safety standards while supporting innovation.

Industry bodies have highlighted the need for such reforms. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has previously criticised New Zealand’s airport economic regulatory framework as “not fit for purpose,” urging changes to ensure fairer and more efficient outcomes for airlines and passengers.

Aviation workforce shortages and new training pathways

Workforce reform is another urgent priority. Ringa Hora, the workforce development council, will update pilot training by the end of 2025, creating an airline-approved qualification that can be completed more quickly and aligned more closely with industry needs.

A broader package will address retention, recruitment and diversity, with an emphasis on encouraging more Māori and women into aviation careers.

“The aviation workforce is critical to the success of the whole aviation system,” said Meager. “We need to make aviation an attractive and sustainable career path, so that the sector has the skilled people it needs to grow.”

International mutual recognition of licences will also be pursued, allowing skilled personnel to move more easily between jurisdictions.

RNZAF Ohakea runway access and future aviation infrastructure

One of the most eye-catching measures is the decision to make RNZAF Base Ohakea permanently available as an alternate runway for widebody aircraft by December 2026.

The move underscores the need for resilience in the face of disruption at Auckland or Wellington and highlights growing civil–military cooperation.

The plan also directs the mapping of future aviation infrastructure requirements, including capacity for sustainable aviation fuel, electrification of smaller aircraft, and new technologies such as electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles.

Airports and airlines will work with the government to ensure the system can adapt to next-generation needs.

Support for regional air routes and stronger passenger rights

The fragility of regional routes has been acknowledged with targeted support.

New Zealand’s regional airlines have faced mounting pressures in recent years, with rising fuel, maintenance and regulatory costs making thin-margin routes increasingly hard to sustain.

Smaller carriers such as Sounds Air and Air Chathams have struggled to finance new aircraft and maintain connectivity, with Sounds Air announcing the sale of five Pilatus PC-12s and the withdrawal of several routes.

The plan authorises the use of the Regional Infrastructure Fund to help small airlines acquire or lease aircraft, refinance debt on concessionary terms, and invest in IT systems to enable interlining with larger carriers. These measures are intended to secure lifeline connections for communities until market conditions improve.

Passengers are also in focus. By early 2026, the Aviation Council will introduce improvements to make air travel more accessible for disabled people, while the Ministry of Transport will review consumer rights against international benchmarks on disruption, refunds and compensation.

Sustainable aviation fuel and net-zero growth plan

In line with New Zealand’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, the plan outlines steps to support the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and alternative propulsion.

Work will begin in 2025 with Australia on regional supply chains for SAF, while the government will reaffirm its participation in the international Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Electric aircraft and uncrewed aerial systems are also flagged as opportunities to transform the economics of regional routes and create new markets in agriculture and forestry.

Air New Zealand’s recent decision to drop its 2030 carbon intensity target, citing slow progress on new aircraft deliveries and SAF availability, highlights the importance of these policy interventions in bridging near-term gaps and sustaining momentum toward net zero.

Permanent Aviation Council to drive accountability

Perhaps the most significant feature of the plan is its structure. Every action has a named lead organisation, a delivery timeline and a monitoring mechanism.

The new permanent Aviation Council will report annually to the Minister and refresh the plan every three years, ensuring that it remains a living document rather than a static policy exercise.

“This plan is not a one-off document,” said Meager. “It is a foundation for long-term change, with accountability built in, to make sure our aviation sector continues to connect us, lift prosperity and support communities across New Zealand.”

How New Zealand’s aviation plan compares internationally

New Zealand’s initiative sits alongside similar moves overseas. Australia’s 2024 Aviation White Paper laid out 56 policy initiatives spanning workforce, regional connectivity, regulation, safety and emissions.

The UK has also submitted its State Action Plan to ICAO, with comparable emphases on SAF and emissions tracking.

Closer to home, New Zealand’s Space and Advanced Aviation Strategy 2024-2030 already sets ambitions in regulation and R&D for advanced aviation.

The new Action Plan builds on that foundation, giving the sector a more integrated and accountable framework for the future.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Air-Chathams-ATR-72.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:57:31.008356

Indian Diesel Export to EU At 11 Month High Before a Looming Ban on Russian Crude Oil

Indian diesel exports to Europe surged to an eleven month high as EU plans to ban Russian crude oil from third countries. India exported 260,000 per day last month, 63% percent increase from July, reported Independent. European buyers are building reserves while they can to stockpile the oil.

Almost all the cargoes exported were from Reliance Industries, India’s largest private refiner. The EU banned the direct import of Russian oil in February 2023 and from January 2026, it will also ban the import from third countries.

China’s Push for Renewable Energy Can Fuel Global Energy Transition

China’s rapid adoption of green energy and reliance on electricity can result in the decline of the world’s usage of fossil fuels by 2030. Between 2015 and 2023, China’s final energy consumption fell by 1.7% across buildings, infrastructure, and transport and electricity use rose 65%, reported CarbonCopy.

China is investing heavily in renewable energy. In 2024, China invested $625 billion in clean energy, which is 31% of the global investment. This has also led to decline in power and technology prices that is helping many emerging economies shift to clean energy.

Fossil Fuels Subsidies in US for Have More Than Doubled Since 2017

The United States subsidises the fossil fuel industry of $31Billion per year. This figure has more than doubled since 2017 which is likely an understatement due to the difficulty in quantifying the financial gains from some government support, reported The Guardian.

According to the report, these handouts can pose a massive barrier to decarbonisation, which is very crucial to avoid the worst impact of climate change. US President Donald Trump’s signature tax-and-spend bill will further aggravate the issue as it is poised to hand out another $4Billion per year across the next decade.

US Government Outlines Plan on Oil and Gas Exploration And Offshore Carbon Shortage Regulations

The US government is planning to boost the oil and gas industry and laying out a timeline for offshore carbon shortage regulations in its “Spring Unified Agenda”, reported PoliticoPro.

With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry—and wider business travel sector—is running out of time to decarbonize.","Most corporate travel managers are still on their first steps of their sustainability journeys. It is clear that, no matter what the messages are that are emerging from the EU or the White House, that more companies are taking those steps.

Those companies in the early stages of their sustainability journeys will quickly mature thanks to the proliferation of technology and expertise in the market today.

“There is an expectation in the uplift of the quality of sustainability data to finance-level, audited data,” said CTM head of sustainability Lauren Hook. “What this means is the need for accurate and timely data will become increasingly important for businesses at both ends of the sustainability maturity spectrum.”

While we have seen that companies are reacting to regulatory pressure more than anything else in their sustainability strategies, peer pressure is also important.

“We are seeing very significant pressure being applied by some of the largest companies in the world, in particular, Microsoft, AstraZeneca, Salesforce, Schneider Electric and Siemens [are] asking their suppliers to report on their emissions and set up their own forward-looking targets,” said Adam Braun, founder and CEO of Clarasight.

“We actually believe that added business pressure is more powerful than just the regulatory pressure. Often, we're hearing from companies saying we need to do more than just report on last year's emissions. We now need to set credible targets going forward and then have both a system of record and a system of action to be able to credibly achieve that goal.”

Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Aspen believes we will see more carbon budgets being used by corporates. Indeed, Concur is set to facilitate carbon budgets in its booking tool this quarter.

In May, Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Apsen told BTN Europe that it will be the first organization to take advantage of the new capability, with “several corporates lined up for the initial rollout, including a mix of Fortune 500s.”

Aspen believes that carbon budgets at the team level will be the most popular. “How can an individual make that decision? If they think their trip is more important than their boss's trip in two months’ time they’re going to book it anyway,” he said. “There are also many places out there where there is only one flight a day. If your carbon budget said you now have to reduce your carbon by 10 per cent then that is useless information—you are going to take that one flight.”

He continued: “When you have budgets at a division level with 10,000 people, it is too impersonal. What does it matter that you are emitting one tonne of CO2 when the division still has thousands of tonnes to emit.” Teams are therefore the sweetspot where a budget is most meaningful and can truly change behavior and thus impact.

FLYING TOWARDS 2050

Decarbonizing aviation in particular will remain crucial to decarbonizing business travel by 2050. The figure below shows a range of different pathways that aviation might achieve net zero by 2050. It shows scenarios outlined by IATA, ICAO, the International Council on Clean Transportation and the Air Transport Action Group.

American Express Global Business Travel’s head of sustainability, Nora Lovell Marchant, said the figures reveal that “the low-hanging fruit is basically gone” but that sustainable aviation fuel, shown in green, is a major part of all these scenarios.

Operations (shown in yellow), such as using greener flight paths, and tech (in blue), like more fuel-efficient planes, make up another significant part of the emission reductions.

Carbon removal and market-based measures (light grey), such as carbon pricing in Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme, are also important in many of the scenarios. Other scenarios leave residual emissions (in dark grey)—carbon emissions that cannot be removed by other methods—that need to be offset in some other way.

CONTROLLING DEMAND

Many of the scenarios include a purple bar denoting demand impact or reduction—i.e. reducing the demand for business travel.

Will fewer business trips be part of the solution? The BTN Intelligence survey showed that 46 percent of travel managers are promoting the use of virtual meeting tools instead of face-to-face travel, although few if any companies are mandating this.

Katharina Riederer, co-founder of eco.mio, said: “Obviously it's the best solution not to travel but the difficulty in our industry is that this industry exists because of travel, so reducing travel... no one really wants to push that. Also, when I do my booking, I have already decided that I have to travel and I have already got the approval.”

Nora Lovell Marchant said the pandemic showed that meetings could move to Zoom. “Now aviation traffic is growing because people know the value of business trips and putting people in front of people,” she said. “Are there some business trips that can and should be replaced with Zoom? Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever? Absolutely.”

She continued: “We need to think about how to decarbonize that... because even the most liberal non-profit organizations recognize that other types of solutions besides demand management alone will be needed in order to decarbonize aviation.”

Benjamin Park, head of travel and sustainability at Parexel, expects sustainability in business travel to become more data-driven, with increased transparency and accountability. “Emissions methodologies will evolve, and corporates will need to adopt more granular tracking and reporting,” he said.

Park also believes that employee and customer expectations will increasingly influence corporate travel programs. “For roles requiring travel, the maturity of a company’s sustainable travel strategy may become a differentiator in talent attraction and retention,” he said.

Park added: “While cost management remains important, we are seeing a shift toward ‘purposeful travel’ where the value of each trip is weighed against its environmental impact. This mindset helps us reduce unnecessary travel while preserving essential face-to-face patient and customer engagement.”

As Advito’s senior director of sustainability Julien Etchanchu said, in spite of delays to the full roll-out of CSRD, “at some point, we will have to travel less not just because of the environment but because at some point there will be an energy crisis.”

Could unbridled aviation growth be managed through taxes and fees that are reinvested in the industry’s pursuit of net zero? “One percent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 percent of aviation emissions. People want to travel. At the moment, someone traveling once every 10 years is taxed in the same way as a business traveler traveling 20 times a year.

“The problem is you don’t pay for the pollution you make—that is the ultimate issue. You could imagine a frequent flyer levy where the first trip is free of tax, the second you start to increase it a bit and by trip 10 you are highly taxed and ever more highly in business class. The pressure for levies will grow,” warned Etchanchu.

With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry—and wider business travel sector—is running out of time to decarbonize. While plans, policies and ideas are rife, now is the time for action.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is reshaping the landscape of air travel and sustainable tourism by offering a viable alternative to conventional jet fuels. Airports and airlines across the globe are actively integrating SAF into their operations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and foster more environmentally responsible travel. Portland International Airport (PDX) and Delta Airlines are leading the charge in the United States, demonstrating a clear commitment to sustainability in aviation. These initiatives have implications beyond the aviation sector, extending into the tourism industry, where the demand for eco-conscious travel options is rapidly increasing.

Portland International Airport and Delta Airlines Leading SAF Adoption

Portland International Airport recently received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel, with Delta Airlines being the first commercial airline to utilize this blend. The fuel is composed of two main components: conventional jet fuel, which constitutes half of the mixture, and the feedstock, which provides the sustainable element. The blending process results in a fuel that can be directly used by aircraft without requiring modifications to engines or airport infrastructure.

The adoption of SAF at PDX aligns with broader efforts to improve local air quality and reduce carbon emissions. By transitioning to blended fuels, flights departing from Portland can contribute to lowering the airport’s environmental impact while supporting the local community. While the cost of SAF remains two to three times higher than conventional jet fuel, Delta Airlines has been actively working with suppliers to manage expenses and increase adoption without compromising operational efficiency.

Challenges and Criticisms of SAF

Despite the benefits, the use of sustainable aviation fuel has faced criticism. Some environmental organizations, such as 350PDX, argue that SAF could be a form of greenwashing rather than a definitive climate solution. Concerns have been raised about the risks associated with storing combustible fuels in sensitive areas, such as earthquake-prone zones along rivers. Additionally, producing SAF at the scale required to meet global aviation demand would necessitate an unprecedented increase in production, potentially leading to environmental impacts from land use changes and agricultural practices.

The debate highlights the importance of balancing innovation in sustainable fuels with rigorous oversight and accountability. Advocates emphasize that SAF should be part of a broader strategy, which includes alternative technologies, carbon offsetting, and innovations in flight efficiency to achieve meaningful reductions in aviation-related emissions.

Global SAF Integration in Airports

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel is not limited to Portland. Airports worldwide are embracing SAF to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel and promote eco-friendly tourism.

Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), Malaysia: Petronas, Malaysia’s state energy company, supplied domestically blended SAF to Malaysia Airlines through the Malaysia Aviation Group. This initiative supports daily flights to London and contributes to Malaysia’s net-zero emission targets.

Ontario International Airport (ONT), USA: Neste has partnered with Amazon Air to supply SAF to Ontario International Airport. Amazon has become the first company in the region to purchase and utilize SAF, aligning with its commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across global operations by 2040.

John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), USA: JetBlue has established a regular supply of SAF at JFK, reinforcing the airline’s dedication to reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable aviation.

Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW), USA: Southwest Airlines has entered a supply agreement with Valero Energy to provide SAF at MDW. This partnership represents the largest SAF deal in Illinois and supports Southwest Airlines’ sustainability goals.

Sydney Airport (SYD), Australia: Qantas and Sydney Airport have collaborated with Ampol to import 1.7 million liters of SAF derived from organic sources such as biowaste. The fuel will be used for up to 900 Boeing 737 flights between Sydney and Auckland, representing the largest SAF transaction in Australia.

Thiruvananthapuram International Airport (TRV), India: An open access fuel farm and aircraft refueling facility has been launched to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability. By centralizing fuel distribution, multiple oil marketing companies can share infrastructure, reducing emissions associated with redundant handling processes.

Airlines Leading the SAF Movement

Airlines are increasingly investing in sustainable aviation fuel to reduce environmental impact and support green tourism.

Emirates: The airline has successfully conducted test flights using SAF and has operated commercial flights with blended SAF on routes from Dubai to Sydney and London. Collaborations with Neste and Shell Aviation have ensured SAF availability at airports including Dubai, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

United Airlines: United Airlines has launched an investment fund supporting SAF startups and has secured agreements for future production of up to five billion gallons of SAF, surpassing other global airlines in scale.

Hawaiian Airlines: SAF has been incorporated on flights between Osaka and Honolulu under an agreement with Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., contributing to the airline’s strategy of reducing carbon emissions while fostering SAF market growth.

Cebu Pacific: The airline has signed agreements with Shell Aviation and Neste, completing SAF-powered flights from Singapore to Manila and from Narita International Airport to Manila. These efforts reflect a commitment to sustainable operations and regional eco-tourism promotion.

Bangkok Airways: SAF has been introduced on commercial flights, with a 1% blend to conventional jet fuel to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The airline continues to explore sustainable fuel sourcing partnerships.

Västflyg: The Swedish virtual airline has partnered with Trollhättan-Vänersborg Airport to operate flights entirely on SAF blends. Passengers can opt to purchase biofuel for flights, and operational strategies, such as flying at lower altitudes, are employed to further reduce fuel consumption.

Ecojet Airlines: A proposed British regional airline aims to operate a fully electric fleet powered by renewable energy once operations commence, potentially becoming the world’s first fully electric airline.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Tourism

Sustainable aviation fuel plays a crucial role in transforming tourism into a more environmentally responsible sector. Air travel contributes significantly to global carbon emissions, making SAF adoption vital for reducing the ecological footprint of tourism. By offering flights powered by SAF, airlines enable travelers to make more conscious choices, aligning travel experiences with environmental values.

The integration of SAF also presents economic opportunities. Investment in SAF production stimulates local economies, fosters renewable energy markets, and encourages innovation in green technologies. As SAF production scales up, costs are expected to decrease, making sustainable travel more accessible to a broader range of tourists.

Government policies and industry collaboration are critical in supporting SAF adoption. Incentives, blending mandates, and funding for research and development accelerate the availability and use of SAF across international aviation networks. Such collaboration ensures that airlines, airports, and fuel producers can collectively achieve meaningful reductions in emissions while supporting sustainable tourism goals.

Future Outlook

The future of sustainable aviation and eco-friendly tourism is closely tied to the continued development and implementation of SAF. Efforts to improve production technologies, expand infrastructure, and streamline supply chains will determine how effectively SAF can replace conventional fuels. Despite challenges such as high costs and production scalability, ongoing initiatives at airports and airlines globally indicate a growing commitment to greener air travel.

By integrating SAF into operations, airlines and airports are not only reducing carbon emissions but also enhancing the perception of tourism as a sustainable activity. Travelers increasingly consider environmental impact when choosing destinations and transportation options, making SAF a key component of the travel industry’s evolution toward sustainability.

Conclusion

Sustainable aviation fuel represents a transformative advancement for the aviation and tourism industries. From Portland International Airport and Delta Airlines to global leaders like Emirates and United Airlines, SAF is driving a shift toward more responsible air travel.

While speaking to BW Businessworld, he emphasised that fuel producers bear the responsibility to innovate and reduce SAF costs while maintaining environmental sustainability, ensuring adoption is feasible across India, Europe, the US, and the Asia Pacific.

India’s aviation sector is growing rapidly, driven by rising domestic travel and expanding international connectivity. India currently accounts for roughly 2.5 per cent of global ATF demand, exporting nearly half of its production, highlighting the potential for domestic SAF adoption.

With the country poised to become one of the world’s largest aviation markets, concerns over rising carbon emissions are mounting. Aviation’s share in India’s transport emissions is expected to increase significantly. Policymakers and stakeholders are exploring sustainable alternatives like SAF to meet climate targets while keeping air travel affordable for India’s price-sensitive passengers without disrupting the sector’s growth.

According to the Deloitte study, Passenger traffic in India is projected to grow at about 10 per cent CAGR, rising from 220 million in 2023-24 to nearly 390 million by 2030. Freight volumes are expected to increase at a 13 per cent CAGR, from 2.4 million tonnes to 5.1 million tonnes. ATF demand is set to double to 15 to 16 million tonne.

Is SAF Feasible for India?

Achieving net-zero aviation emissions in India depends on integrating SAF with traditional jet fuel. Initial SAF blending mandates focus on international flights, but scaling domestic production is critical. Abundant feedstocks, including agricultural residues, sugarcane, sweet sorghum, and used cooking oil, offer a pathway to a competitive SAF ecosystem. Efficient integration of technology, rural supply chains, and production infrastructure is necessary to make SAF adoption practical, sustainable, and aligned with India’s aviation and climate goals.

India’s SAF blending targets are 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. SAF is expected to contribute 53 to 66 per cent toward India’s net-zero aviation targets by 2050. Key technologies include HEFA, alcohol-to-jet, fischer–tropsch and power-to-liquid. Domestic feedstocks such as agricultural residues, used cooking oil, sugarcane, and sweet sorghum can reduce carbon intensity by up to 84 per cent, making SAF technically feasible and sustainable for the Indian market.

“If you set up your SAF plant in the correct manner, it is very much financially viable,” Olsson said. He added, “The key is to rethink and innovate across the entire SAF value chain, from feedstock collection to final fuel production. At low blending mandates of 1 to 5 per cent, the cost impact on Indian airlines is minimal. With careful planning, technological adoption, and efficient supply chains, SAF can be produced and supplied in a way that is practical, financially sustainable, and beneficial to all stakeholders.”

Can Airlines Afford SAF?

The high cost of SAF raises concerns for Indian airlines, particularly low-cost carriers. Gradual integration, blending mandates, and innovative pricing strategies are needed to ensure airlines remain financially viable. Oil companies and policymakers must support SAF production, blending, and logistics infrastructure. The goal is to maintain operational efficiency while meeting India’s environmental commitments, ensuring the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel does not disrupt the affordability of air travel for passengers.

SAF costs about two to five times more than regular jet fuel, depending on feedstock. Using agricultural residues costs USD 550 to 650 per tonne, used cooking oil USD 800 to 900 per tonne, and sugarcane USD 300 to 400 per tonne. Notably, domestic SAF demand at 5 per cent blending is expected to reach 0.8 million tonnes by 2030. With a production potential of 8 to 10 MT, India can meet domestic needs and even export. In India, over 3,000 crore Indian rupee has already been committed under central and state schemes to support SAF production.

“At low blending mandates of 1 to 5 per cent, the price impact on airlines is minimal,” Jimmy Olsson said. He added, “Airlines can manage SAF costs through a blended approach and adjust pricing strategies. Even low-cost carriers can adopt SAF without affecting profitability. European carriers like KLM and Lufthansa are already offering low-carbon flights at a small premium, showing that sustainable aviation can be integrated successfully while keeping operations viable.”

Does SAF Threaten Food Security?

Concerns about land use, crop availability, and nutrition emerge when SAF feedstocks come from agriculture. Effective SAF adoption must avoid disrupting food security while supporting rural development. Linking SAF production to farmer incomes, employment, and sustainable practices ensures socio-economic benefits. The challenge is to implement SAF policies that achieve environmental goals without straining India’s food system, ensuring that sustainable aviation fuel supports communities, airlines, and the nation’s climate commitments.

India’s SAF feedstocks, including crop residues and used cooking oil, can reduce carbon intensity by 72 to 84 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel. Crop Residue Management programs in Haryana and Punjab reduced stubble burning by 45 to 69 per cent, cut one million tonnes of CO2 emissions, saved lives, and increased farmer incomes by USD 14 million. Global SAF hubs, like Singapore Changi Airport, demonstrate integrated supply chains and modular blending, offering lessons for India’s aviation sector.

“Any sustainable SAF business in India must consider all stakeholders,” Jimmy Olsson said. He added, “It is crucial that SAF production supports rural livelihoods, remains affordable, and does not compromise food security or nutritional needs. A well-designed SAF ecosystem can uplift farmers, provide economic opportunities, and still reduce aviation emissions significantly. By addressing price, sustainability, and social impact together, India can develop a robust SAF market that benefits airlines, passengers, and communities alike.”

India’s aviation sector is at a critical juncture, balancing rapid growth with environmental responsibility. With domestic SAF production potential exceeding projected demand, the country can reduce aviation emissions while exploring export opportunities. Gradual blending mandates, supply chain innovation, and strategic pricing can allow airlines to adopt sustainable fuel without affecting profitability. Olsson highlighted, “With proper planning, innovation across the SAF value chain, and a collaborative approach, India has the potential to become a global SAF hub, benefiting airlines, passengers, and rural communities alike.”",https://static.businessworld.in/1605260979_mxTK8R_aviation.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 03:56:26.815464

Portland International Airport received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel earlier this month.
Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger said in a statement, “We’re excited about this step toward bringing sustainable aviation fuel to PDX.
“By adding ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ to their portfolio, they are supercharging that risk,” 350PDX said.","PORTLAND, Oregon — In the latest edition of Environment Northwest, we look at an airline flying out of Portland International Airport with sustainable aviation fuel, and the cost may surprise you. Zenith Energy hopes the Portland terminal will be filled with renewable energy, and the facility already has plenty of room to store sustainable aviation fuel.

JT Hendrix, terminal manager for Zenith Energy, said the fuel has two components.

“You have your conventional jet fuel, which is 50 percent of the blend, and the feedstock, which is the blending component. We blend those two together — that’s how you get your sustainable aviation fuel,” Hendrix said.

Portland International Airport received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel earlier this month. Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger said in a statement,

“We’re excited about this step toward bringing sustainable aviation fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities.”

Delta Airlines was the first commercial airline to use the fuel at PDX. But the cost to keep jets in the air isn’t cheap. Charlotte Lollar of Delta Airlines said the airline is working with different suppliers to manage expenses.

“Today it’s two to three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, so our ambition is to work through the supply chain to bring the cost down as much as possible,” Lollar said.

While flying with sustainable fuel is costly, Lollar said Delta is committed to lowering expenses while moving toward a greener way to take to the sky.

Not everyone is convinced sustainable aviation fuel is a solution. 350PDX, a Portland-based nonprofit focused on climate justice, shared a statement with KGW warning the fuel may be a form of greenwashing.

“The real problem here is that so-called renewable fuels and biofuels are a false climate solution,” the group said.

The statement added that Zenith’s operations already pose significant risks because the terminal stores highly combustible fuels on an earthquake liquefaction zone along the banks of the Willamette River. The organization also raised concerns about risks to local neighborhoods and public oversight.

“By adding ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ to their portfolio, they are supercharging that risk,” 350PDX said. “When you add the word ‘sustainable’ or ‘renewable’ it sounds better, but it’s greenwashing at best. First, this is still a fuel and it still releases CO2 into the atmosphere. Second, the land use changes needed to produce this fuel can lead to increased pollution and a decrease in nature-based carbon sequestration solutions. Third, ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ sounds like a complete solution, but to meet aviation needs it would require an 18,887% increase in production this decade, based on 2022 production levels.”

350PDX urged greater accountability from companies and wealthy individuals who contribute to emissions and called for a climate superfund to fund adaptation and resiliency efforts in Oregon.

“There are a multitude of options for innovation that do not require the sacrifice of North Portland communities or communities in feedstock production areas throughout the U.S. that are already dealing with the air, soil, and water impacts of monocrop agriculture,” the group said.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/3791fe97-baca-4b88-a149-25590ddd00b8/20250916T003735/3791fe97-baca-4b88-a149-25590ddd00b8_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 23:56:18.904983

Australia's Construction Waste: Transformation Through Circular Design

A recent report ""Australia's Waste[d] Opportunity 2025"" (AWO Report) has identified that Australia's construction industry stands as the nation's largest source of waste, which reportedly contributes to a staggering 29% of Australia's total waste.

The AWO Report describes ""waste"" as a valuable material which stakeholders have failed to value. It observes that the average building project discards 141kg of material per square metre, which amounts to AU$384 per square metre on wasted materials. The top three categories of wasted materials are ""Mixed Concrete, Masonry and Tile"", ""Soil, Sand and Rubble Fines"" and ""Timber"".

The AWO Report makes recommendations which are intended to drive accountability and circularity in construction. Importantly, it notes that design decisions play an important role in setting the circular direction and recommends practices such as setting clear objectives and targets for design, construction, operation and end of life stages to reduce waste through the building's life cycle.

It also recommends that construction and lease contracts can include on-site material management, the obligation to report against material benchmarks, and/or setting out de-fit or deconstruction responsibilities.

At a policy level, the AWO Report suggests embedding circular targets into national policies and ensuring national building regulations prioritise circular principles. It recommends that State governments can also introduce financial incentives and dedicated grants.

Unless changes are made, the AWO Report warns that Australia is expected to waste up to $64 million in construction materials over the next five years.

Australia's Low-Carbon Liquid Fuel Opportunity

Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and Deloitte recently released a report ""Refined Ambitions: Exploring Australia's Low Carbon Fuel Potential"" (Refined Ambitions Report). It identifies that Australia may have the potential to build a low-carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry which could have a AU$36 billion market opportunity by 2050.

LCLFs are renewable alternatives to traditional fossil-based liquid fuels. Common examples include sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and synthetic e-fuels.

The Refined Ambitions Report identifies that Australia is a major user of liquid fuels, which is central to the energy demands of 11 major sectors of the nation's economy. However, as the world decarbonises, Australia's dependence on imported liquid fuels will leave these sectors exposed to international volatility.

It is anticipated that Australia will still require 30 billion litres of liquid fuels, predominantly in the mining, aviation and long-haul freight sectors. The Refined Ambitions Report anticipates that among other benefits, an LCLF industry:

Will enhance the nation's fuel security by developing sovereign capability and resilience;

Is critical to ensuring the long-term competitiveness of these industries; and

Can deliver significant economic benefit to Australian farmers and fuel producers.

Consultation Paper: Climate-related Transition Planning Guidance

The Treasury is developing guidance for climate-related transition planning and is inviting feedback on the direction and design of the guidance. The consultation period started on 15 August and will end on 24 September 2025.

The objective of the guidance is to support organisations to address climate risks and opportunities, and to enhance overall financial market resilience. In practice, this means supporting organisations to plan for climate risks and seize opportunities, while meeting expectations of transition plans from investors, lenders and other stakeholders. Accessible, clear, and robust transition plans can help investors and lenders understand the long-term business strategy of organisations, price risk and make capital allocation decisions.

The Consultation Paper is divided in two parts:

Part A - Outlines the role of transition planning and proposed design approach; and

Part B - Provides illustrative draft guidance aligned with the proposed approach.

Appendix A to the Consultation Paper includes a list of relevant materials consulted by the Treasury, including the Transition Planning Guide of the Australian Institute of Company Directors published in July 2025.

The main objectives of the guidance are to:

Support international alignment to make it easier to compare transition plans;

Outline domestic policy and regulatory considerations;

Balance encouraging high ambition with providing flexibility; and

Take a ""climate first but not only"" approach.

The Australian Government committed to publishing the guidance by the end of 2025. This is one of the priorities under the Sustainable Finance Roadmap.

Productivity Roundtable: Reforming Federal Environmental Laws

The federal government convened the Productivity Roundtable from 19 to 21 August 2025 in Canberra. The event built on propositions to improve Australia's productivity, economic resilience and strengthen budget sustainability, as proposed by stakeholders during the public consultation period held in June and July of this year.

Among the key topics discussed was the need to reform and expedite approvals required under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC). The proposed reforms aim to streamline the approvals process by removing duplication between state and federal processes and will introduce strong national environmental standards that will set minimum expectations for a project. The discussions also highlighted the need for an independent regulator to be held to account for the speed and quality of its decisions.

The revised EPBC is expected to be proposed by the end of the year, which is six months ahead of schedule.

US State Officials Warn Major Investment Firms Against Considering Sustainability Factors in Investments

On or around 29 July 2025, a coalition of 26 Republican state finance officials sent letters to various major investment firms to warn them against using ""long-term risk mitigation"" strategies that involve ""speculative assumptions about the future"" such as climate change.

The letters emphasise the importance of investment firms' traditional fiduciary duty, which is said to act as a safeguard to facilitate ""efficient capital allocation"" based on financial, not political considerations. The letter requests investment firms to take the following steps to confirm their commitment to their traditional fiduciary duty:

Stop framing ""deterministic future outcomes as long-term risks"" to justify ""immediate ideological interventions"" through utilising corporate engagement or proxy voting, with climate change being an example of this issue;

Commit not to use ""passive investment vehicles for activist proxy voting or corporate engagement"";

Commit not to embed international political agendas into ""default investment strategies and corporate engagement"", citing net-zero climate mandates and EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive as examples;

Have ""clear and transparent proxy voting guidelines and stewardship practices"" that focus on shareholder value, not environmental or social goals; and

Provide full disclosure about all of its affiliations and collaborative initiatives that may influence its investment strategy or priorities, citing Climate Action 100+ as an example.

The letters invite investment firms to respond and provide detailed evidence that the firms' practices align with traditional fiduciary standards.

ICJ Advisory Opinion on States' Climate Change Obligations

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has released its Advisory Opinion on the ""Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change"". The ICJ that the consequences of climate change are ""severe and far-reaching"" and pose an ""urgent and existential threat"".

In summary, the ICJ reinforces that states have an obligation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under international law. The failure to do so may constitute ""an internationally wrongful act"" which is attributable to that state.

This follows the UN General Assembly's 2023 request for an advisory opinion outlining state obligations related to environmental protection, including any legal consequences for states causing significant climate harm.

The ICJ opines that all state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are obliged to implement measures to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. There is a further obligation imposed on developed countries to lead the charge in combating climate change by limiting their GHG emissions and enhancing their GHG sinks and reservoirs.

This ICJ opinion is not legally binding, however the obligations that it identifies are under international law. The ICJ notes that states are obliged to regulate the activities of private actors which impact climate change, sustainability and human rights.

The plan was developed by the Interim Aviation Council, which included NZ Airports and Auckland International Airport among its members. It sets a shared direction for a safe, sustainable and innovative aviation system that enables growth and strengthens New Zealand as an aviation nation.

Billie Moore, Chief Executive of NZ Airports, said the plan is an important opportunity to align industry and government efforts.

“This is the first time that government and industry have come together to set out a long-term strategy for aviation.

“New Zealand relies on aviation to connect our people and businesses, to support tourism and trade, and to deliver essential regional services. Despite this, the sector has often been a footnote in transport policy due to the heavy focus on land transport in the Crown budget.

“The Government deserves huge credit for elevating the role of aviation in its economic growth strategy.”

The Aviation Action Plan addresses several areas of particular importance to the airport community:

A two-year civil aviation rule-making programme to make the regulatory environment more agile and responsive, while maintaining high safety and security standards.

A new indicator framework to track the health of the aviation system, providing data on costs, efficiency, and performance to guide better decision-making.

As confirmed in a previous announcement from Ministers Jones and Meager, support for vulnerable regional routes through the Regional Infrastructure Fund, including concessionary finance for aircraft and IT investment to enable interlining between regional carriers and larger airlines.

A greater focus on future infrastructure requirements, including integrated airspace planning to support busier and more diverse air operators.

Collaboration with Australia on a regional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) strategy to support the transition to cleaner energy.

The Action Plan was a major recommendation from the 2023 Air Navigation Systems (ANS) review, which highlighted the public good role of aviation in New Zealand, and the need for future investment.

“We would like to acknowledge the Ministers who progressed the ANS review, and Minister Meager who has delivered this plan. We hope this work will have bipartisan support so that aviation remains a national priority.”

NZ Airports will continue to work with Government and industry partners to deliver the plan’s initial commitments.",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 19:56:51.402000

Securing long-term offtake agreements is one of the most crucial conditions for financing SAF production facilities, as they guarantee the purchase of SAF at a stable price over periods exceeding five years,” said Haffner Energy co-founder and CEO Philippe Haffner.
Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are members of Project SkyPower, an international CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF.
The collaboration addresses the urgent need for scalable, high-integrity SAF solutions and supports broader policy goals, including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP).
The pricing assumptions are within the lower end of current industry benchmarks, and the offtake agreement is expected to reach finalization by September 2026.","Haffner Energy, a leading solid biomass-to-clean fuels solutions provider, and Luxaviation Group, a leading global operator in the business aviation sector, are strengthening their partnership with a non-exclusive 15-yr offtake agreement in Europe with fixed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) volume and price terms.

Luxaviation and Haffner Energy first joined forces to accelerate SAF production and promotion when Luxaviation signaled interest in SAF-dedicated entity SAF Zero in June this year.

Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group, said: “This agreement marks a decisive move from vision to reality. For Luxaviation, securing long-term SAF supply is not only an investment in our operations – it is a commitment to our clients and to the industry’s future. Together with Haffner Energy, we are setting the benchmark for how business aviation can accelerate the scale-up of sustainable fuel production across Europe, establishing a new standard for our industry.”

Luxaviation operates one of the largest fleets of private aircraft worldwide. It is actively committed to the decarbonization of aviation through a three-pronged strategy: improving fuel efficiency; reducing emissions by actively increasing SAF use and electrification of ground operations; and buying offsets for remaining GHG emissions. Since 2021, Luxaviation’s annual sustainability report tracks progress against targets. In 2023, Luxaviation launched “Go-to-Zero” Investment Fund to foster SAF production.

“We are very pleased with this offtake partnership with Luxaviation as it will significantly facilitate the financing of our SAF projects in Europe. Securing long-term offtake agreements is one of the most crucial conditions for financing SAF production facilities, as they guarantee the purchase of SAF at a stable price over periods exceeding five years,” said Haffner Energy co-founder and CEO Philippe Haffner.

France-based Haffner Energy relies on its 32-yr experience to design, manufacture, supply, license and operate proprietary disruptive clean fuels solutions, including critical technology for SAF production, using all types of biomass residues wet or dry, such as agricultural and municipal waste. The company has already announced the development of a couple of SAF projects, notably in France and in Iceland. In both cases, full scale production is expected to be reached by 2030 when the next stage of the European SAF mandate kicks in, requiring airlines to blend SAF in their jet fuel at a 6% ratio or higher.

Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are members of Project SkyPower, an international CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF.

The collaboration addresses the urgent need for scalable, high-integrity SAF solutions and supports broader policy goals, including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). The pricing assumptions are within the lower end of current industry benchmarks, and the offtake agreement is expected to reach finalization by September 2026.

Despite Shell's pullback and accusations of the company participating in greenwashing, demand for alternatives to fossil fuel-based jet fuel continues to rise.
Airlines including United and Lufthansa have signed major agreements to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, while the European Union has adopted mandates requiring a growing share of aviation fuel to come from renewable sources in the coming years.","Shell has officially abandoned one of Europe's most ambitious efforts to turn waste into low-carbon jet fuel, raising fresh concerns about the oil giant's commitment to renewable energy, per The Guardian.

What's happening?

Shell has scrapped plans to complete a massive biofuels facility in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, that was once set to become one of Europe's largest converters of waste into green jet fuel.

The company began construction in 2021 with hopes of producing 820,000 tonnes (904,000 tons) of biofuels annually, around half of which would have gone toward sustainable aviation fuel, per The Guardian.

After pausing construction last year over technical challenges, Shell has now confirmed the project is dead, citing that it would be ""insufficiently competitive"" to deliver affordable low-carbon products.

Why is this important?

The move marks another major retreat from renewable energy projects by one of the world's biggest oil companies.

Aviation currently accounts for about 3% of global carbon pollution, according to the International Energy Agency, and experts widely agree that cutting those emissions is critical if the world hopes to slow down rising temperatures.

Sustainable aviation fuel, made from waste cooking oil and animal fat, is considered one of the most viable near-term solutions, yet supply remains limited and costs stay high.

Scrapping the project is another example of fossil fuel giants prioritizing short-term profits over long-term responsibility.

What's being done about it?

Despite Shell's pullback and accusations of the company participating in greenwashing, demand for alternatives to fossil fuel-based jet fuel continues to rise.

Airlines including United and Lufthansa have signed major agreements to purchase sustainable aviation fuel, while the European Union has adopted mandates requiring a growing share of aviation fuel to come from renewable sources in the coming years.

On an individual level, consumers can also help curb aviation pollution by choosing trains or buses for shorter trips, cutting back on unnecessary flights, and supporting policies that invest in greener transportation infrastructure.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Qj4QEN.et2LM63.UxocGTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/a4dd6a2e248bfac4521b54e686b91f64,N,,2025-09-15 16:56:11.694057

In a recent article, California Refineries Close as Gasoline Demand Slips into Permanent Decline, I wrote that diesel consumption in California had not declined even as gasoline demand slipped. Jeremy Martin from the Union of Concerned Scientists reached out to me to point to some data I’d missed. I reviewed it and saw that renewable diesel plus biodiesel now supply more than 70% of diesel consumed in California. Fossil diesel consumption has declined faster than I thought. That changes how we should think about the state of refining, the role of refineries, and what their future might be.

Renewable diesel and biodiesel are often lumped together, but they differ in how they are made, how they perform, and how much emissions they avoid. Biodiesel, also called FAME biodiesel, is made by chemically reacting fats or oils with an alcohol, usually methanol, in a process called transesterification. It has oxygen in the molecule and typically needs to be blended with petroleum diesel in many engines.

Renewable diesel is made by hydroprocessing or hydrotreating fats, oils, or waste lipids in a way that produces molecules much closer to petroleum diesel. It is a drop-in fuel, meaning engines and infrastructure built for regular diesel can use it without modification. According to CARB’s lifecycle studies, renewable diesel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 65% compared with petroleum diesel depending on feedstock such as waste oils or tallow, while biodiesel’s emissions reductions vary more depending on feedstock and blending ratio.

Refineries cannot easily change the basic yields they get from crude oil, and heavy crudes in particular deliver a relatively fixed gasoline-to-diesel ratio. With California’s demand for fossil diesel shrinking while renewable diesel fills the market, refiners are left with a surplus of petroleum diesel they cannot sell in state. The response has been to export that diesel into other markets, often in Latin America or Asia, where demand for middle distillates is stronger. This keeps refineries operating but reduces margins, since exports are usually at lower prices than domestic sales and add shipping costs. The structural imbalance between what California needs and what refineries are designed to produce is one of the forces eroding their long term viability.

Among the two refineries discussed, the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles is definitely closing. It has been confirmed that the 139,000 barrels-per-day LA area facility will begin winding down operations in early September 2025, and permanent closure is expected by October 2025. The Valero refinery in Benicia is a bigger concern for policymakers because it accounts for a large share of Northern California’s refining capacity. Valero has announced its intent to close or restructure the Benicia refinery by April 2026, citing high regulatory costs and declining demand. But there are active discussions in Sacramento about state funding or regulatory relief to keep it operating.

Keeping Valero open is more politically and practically important because the Los Angeles region has more refining capacity overall than the Bay Area, so loss of Benicia would produce greater supply disruptions, especially in Northern California. Analysts estimate that the combined closures of Phillips 66 LA and Valero Benicia could remove roughly 17% of the state’s gasoline refining capacity.

The fuel policy framework known as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard is central to all of this. Under LCFS, fuel producers are required to reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of fuels sold in California. Renewable diesel and biodiesel earn credits when their CI is below the benchmark. These credits can be traded. The more demand there is for low CI fuels the greater the price on fossil fuels or fuel pathways that do not meet CI targets. California’s LCFS pathways show that renewable diesel from used cooking oil, tallow, or waste lipids often performs better, with lower CI, than feedstocks like soybean oil. Biodiesel’s CI depends strongly on feedstock, energy used in processing, land use, and transportation.

There are risk points in this transition. Renewable diesel supply depends on feedstock that may be limited, or become more expensive, especially waste oils or fats. Scaling up renewables risks feedstock scarcity or competition with other uses such as food or international markets. Biodiesel may face limits on blend levels or performance in cold weather. Regulatory and permitting burdens remain high. Also refinery closure or conversion faces large capital costs, labor impacts, and local community consequences.

The economic implications are clear. Refineries built for gasoline and fossil diesel have product slates optimized for those markets. As diesel is displaced, their ability to adjust output matters. Refiners may shift to processing more renewable diesel themselves, or importing it, or converting existing refining units. For Phillips 66, shutting LA means lost jobs, lost local refining throughput, and increased imports. For Valero Benicia, the stakes are higher for Northern California given its role in supply and because keeping it open is under active negotiation.

The remarkable rise of renewable diesel in California is best understood as a bridge rather than a permanent solution. The credits and incentives under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard created a strong market for drop-in replacements that could be used immediately in heavy duty engines, but that displacement is temporary. Over the next decade, battery-electric trucks will begin to scale in exactly the same way that passenger cars already have. The economics of charging infrastructure, battery pack size, and total cost of ownership are improving year by year, and when fleets begin adopting electric trucks in volume, the effect on diesel demand will be unmistakable. Diesel has lagged gasoline in its decline because there was a ready substitute in renewable diesel, but once electric freight and delivery vehicles hit the road at scale, fossil and renewable diesel alike will fall. The best estimate is that this will trail gasoline’s decline by about ten years, giving California a temporary period of high renewable diesel penetration before a longer term contraction in overall diesel consumption.

Another factor shaping refinery futures is that the same waste oils, fats, and plant-derived lipids that now flow into renewable diesel will be diverted to other sectors under policy pressure. Aviation is pushing hard on bio-sustainable aviation fuel because there are no near-term alternatives for long-haul flights. Maritime shipping is also beginning to blend bio-fuels to meet international decarbonization targets. As more of California’s low-carbon feedstock supply is redirected toward these uses refiners will be forced to reconfigure units once again. That shift would add another layer of adjustment for the state’s remaining refineries, which would have to balance smaller gasoline markets, declining fossil diesel, and growing external competition for renewable feedstocks.

Going forward, diesel displacement looks likely to increase under current policy pressure. Electric trucks will play a role. Renewable diesel capacity may increase. But fossil diesel is likely to shrink more rapidly than most forecasts assume. Getting the technical details right matters. I got the diesel wrong before. It matters for policy, for markets, for refining jobs, for fuel security.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-15-2025-09_53_48-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-09-15 14:56:16.231713

I would say that it is at stage zero. And we would like your (industry's) feedback. We would also reach out to our line ministries to seek their views on the draft.”

Biomass at the heart of decarbonisation push

Speaking at the same conclave, Dr Sangita M Kasture, Scientist G at the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), stressed that biomass will be central to India’s efforts to decarbonise aviation.

“We need to understand how much biomass is available and how much of it is being utilised. The government is already conducting a study to ascertain these things and find out how much can be made available for production of SAF,” she said during the inaugural session.

The assessment is expected to provide a clearer picture of the feedstock base that India can mobilise to support SAF production at scale, particularly from agricultural residues and waste streams.

India’s SAF journey so far

India has already taken initial steps to integrate SAF into aviation. In 2018, SpiceJet operated the country’s first biofuel-powered test flight. More recently, in 2023, AirAsia India and Indian Oil collaborated on India’s first commercial flight using an indigenous SAF blend on the Delhi–Pune route.

At the international level, India has reaffirmed its commitment to align with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050. Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu recently underscored India’s readiness to support these targets, emphasising that domestic initiatives on SAF will form a key part of the strategy.

Industry prepares for scale

Alongside policy discussions, India’s fuel and bioenergy industry has begun investing in capacity and technology to prepare for large-scale SAF adoption. Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery has secured ISCC-CORSIA certification and is targeting 35,000 tonnes of SAF production by 2025. Praj Industries, in collaboration with LanzaJet, has commissioned a 1 kilolitre per day Alcohol-to-Jet demonstration plant in Pune, and has already powered a commercial flight with its output. Meanwhile, TruAlt Bioenergy is planning a 15–20 kilolitre per day commercial facility in Karnataka.

These early projects are seen as the first steps toward building a domestic SAF ecosystem that can both meet India’s blending requirements and, in the long run, cater to export markets where binding SAF mandates are tightening.",https://media.assettype.com/psuwatch%2F2025-09-15%2Fum89n92y%2FIndigo-psu-watch.jpeg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 13:56:13.028479

The report, titled “SAF Samarthya – The opportunity of AtJ SAF in India”, marks one of the first industry-backed assertions that India’s role in the global aviation fuel transition may extend beyond consumption to export leadership.

The paper notes that while the government has already set SAF blending targets of 1 percent by 2027 and 5 percent by 2030 for international flights, the abundant feedstock base and developed ethanol ecosystem could enable production volumes well in excess of domestic needs. “After meeting domestic demand, India could position itself as a regional exporter to markets with binding SAF requirements,” the report says.

Surplus feedstock and ethanol ecosystem

India produces over 500 crore litres of ethanol annually and generates more than 400 million tonnes of surplus biomass every year, including agricultural residues, forestry waste, and municipal solid waste. This resource pool, coupled with the country’s low-cost renewable power, gives India a competitive edge in scaling Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) fuel production.

The knowledge paper draws a parallel with the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), which helped India move from 1.5 percent petrol blending in 2014 to 20 percent in 2025, five years ahead of schedule. The same logistics networks, pricing mechanisms and procurement systems used by oil marketing companies for ethanol can be repurposed to support SAF production and distribution.

First wave of commercial projects

Several companies are already investing in capacity and technology to prepare for this transition. Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery recently became the first domestic player to secure ISCC-CORSIA certification, targeting 35,000 tonnes of SAF by 2025. Praj Industries, in collaboration with LanzaJet, has commissioned a 1 kilolitre per day AtJ demonstration facility in Pune, while TruAlt Bioenergy is planning a 15–20 KTPD commercial plant in Belagavi, Karnataka.

Industry experts see these developments as the foundation for scaling up production not just for India’s aviation sector but also for export markets in the EU, UK and US, where binding SAF mandates are tightening and demand is expected to outstrip local supply.

A strategic pivot

With its fast-growing aviation sector — expected to field 1,600 aircraft by 2030 and 2,200 by 2035 — India is already one of the largest potential SAF markets.

AfA members are helping customers adapt to shifting trade flows and rising costs by keeping freight moving and offering practical solutions in uncertain markets, Fried told members of the Los Angeles Air Cargo Association.

Fried pointed to pressures that continue to test supply chains, including cyber risks exposed by the CrowdStrike outage, an increase in extreme weather events, and geopolitical instability from Ukraine, the Red Sea, and the Taiwan Strait.

He added that aging airport warehouses, truck congestion, and outdated facilities still hold the industry back, underscoring the importance of federal investment in cargo infrastructure.

“Forwarders are the stabilizing force when disruption hits,” said Fried.

“We were tested by shocks in 2024, and we adapted. We are ready to protect shippers and keep goods moving through whatever comes next.”

AfA members are also finding opportunity, he said. Reshoring and nearshoring are shifting flows from China toward Southeast Asia and Mexico, while defense logistics and pharmaceuticals continue to deliver steady volumes, while semiconductors are establishing high-value growth corridors.

“Los Angeles is at the center of global trade, and our community depends on forwarders to keep supply chains resilient,” said David Gibson, President, Los Angeles Air Cargo Association.

“As tariffs shift and regulations tighten, AfA members are proving that they are not just adapting, they are leading. Their ability to find solutions in the face of uncertainty is what keeps cargo moving through LAX and beyond.”

Fried said forwarders are applying technology beyond the hype, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) already being used in pricing, Customs automation, and fraud detection, while automation and paperless processes are driving efficiency.

He added that sustainability remains a critical test, with demand for greener supply chains rising faster than the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“Policy shifts and regulation will continue, but forwarders are the partners who bring resilience, compliance, and solutions,” Fried concluded.

“Our members are essential to maintaining confidence in global trade.”

Sustainability will be a key topic at AfA’s AirCargo Conference in Orlando next February, for which registration is now open at airforwarders.org.

“India has a vast raw material base to become a global SAF leader,” the report concludes.","New Delhi: India possesses a significant but largely untapped supply of bio-feedstock—including used cooking oil (UCO), crop residues, and innovative bioenergy crops like sweet sorghum—that could dramatically boost the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a report unveiled at the India SAF Conclave 2025 on Monday. However, inefficiencies in collection and supply chain management continue to hold back the country’s full potential.

The report, titled “A Roadmap for Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel in India” and prepared by Deloitte in collaboration with the SAF Association, highlights that streamlining these supply chains could not only help India meet its domestic aviation decarbonization targets but also establish the country as a leading SAF exporter to global markets.

Used Cooking Oil: A Valuable Yet Wasted Resource

India generates approximately 2.4 million tonnes of used cooking oil annually, but the report points out that nearly 60% of it is improperly recycled back into the food system, despite clear disposal regulations. Most UCO comes from commercial kitchens (65%), while the rest is scattered across households. The report recommends creating structured collection systems with strict quality control and traceability to consolidate this fragmented resource into viable volumes necessary for expanding Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA)—the most mature SAF production pathway.

Crop Residue: From Environmental Hazard to Clean Fuel Source

Each year, millions of tonnes of crop residue, primarily paddy straw, are burned across northern India, causing severe pollution and health issues. In 2021 alone, around 13 million tonnes were burnt in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. The report suggests that organized biomass marketplaces and aggregation mechanisms could turn this waste into a reliable feedstock for SAF production, while also mitigating air pollution.

Pilot projects in Haryana have already shown success, with a 54% reduction in stubble burning across 666 villages when residue collection was linked to industry demand.

Sweet Sorghum: An Efficient Crop for Sustainable Fuel

The report also highlights sweet sorghum as a promising alternative ethanol crop to support Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) SAF production. Though it yields slightly less ethanol compared to sugarcane, its water efficiency—using five times less water—and shorter growing cycle of four months make it highly suitable for semi-arid regions, offering a more sustainable and climate-resilient feedstock option.

Unlocking Export Potential Through Supply Chain Reforms

Currently, India’s fragmented and seasonal feedstock supply chains discourage large-scale SAF investments. The report argues that formalizing collection systems—such as UCO recovery and stubble-to-fuel initiatives—combined with encouraging cultivation of water-efficient crops like sweet sorghum, will provide a steady, low-carbon feedstock supply.

With India already exporting nearly half of its Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), the report forecasts that increased SAF production could make the country a competitive exporter to global aviation hubs such as Dubai and Amsterdam, where SAF mandates are becoming increasingly stringent.

“India has a vast raw material base to become a global SAF leader,” the report concludes. “The key is to formalize and integrate supply chains connecting farmers, households, and waste generators with fuel producers.”

With infrastructure bottlenecks still a challenge, proximity to fuel infrastructure and demand centres positions early developers to scale more efficiently as the market matures.","The energy transition is facing significant headwinds, especially for those industries operating at the leading edge, like the power to X value chains. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been one of the shining lights of the energy transition, with investment and regulation remaining strong in the geopolitical turmoil. SAFs have more regulatory certainty than any other energy transition technologies. The UK has emerged as a SAF leader, with a strong SAF mandate in effect since January 2025, and a revenue certainty mechanism which is expected to be in place by the end of 2026. The EU also put into force its SAF mandate (ReFuelEU Aviation), and we would expect a revenue certainty mechanism to follow. Positive signals are also coming from other countries, including Japan, with a 10% blending target proposed by 2030,[1] and India with a proposed blending target of 1% for international flights from 2027.[2]

Recently, SLR sponsored the Global SAF Summit, chairing a panel with cross-representation from feedstock suppliers, SAF developers, and airlines representing the Middle East, Europe, and North America, covering flag carriers, the low-cost model, and cargo.

What was very clear from the discussions is that even with the regulatory certainty, the industry is facing significant bottlenecks and is wrestling with how to get the risk-reward balance right across the end-to-end value chain.

Here we discuss the overarching three lessons we learned about how risk-reward can be rebalanced, bottlenecks can be broken, and SAF developers today can turn their first mover risk into a first mover advantage.

The risk-reward balance

We know from across the energy transition that the markets which can accept the most expensive solutions are those with the most price elasticity. Aviation is one of these sectors.

Air travel is a luxury. Only ~11% of the world’s population take a flight annually with less than 4% taking international flights and even fewer flying more than once a year.[3] Air cargo transports circa 33% of the value of world trade, while only transporting less than 1% of its volume.[4] It is primarily used for transporting high-value, perishable or time sensitive goods. Therefore, the cost of decarbonisation passed down to end-consumers is very palatable politically. This is why SAFs have seen more regulatory stability than anywhere else in the energy transition, and why aviation will remain a key target industry to decarbonise.

The challenge, however, is that airlines, where this price elasticity sits, are notorious for going out of business. In 2023, 17 airlines filed for bankruptcy,[5] and just last month Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy just months after emerging out of Chapter 11 after declaring bankruptcy in 2024. [6],[7]

Airlines are highly capital-intensive businesses that are laser-focused on maximising operational efficiencies, given their very tight margins (IATA’s Airline Profitability Outlook for 2025 assumed an average net profit margin of 3.7%).[8] The largest variable cost by far is fuel. Therefore, airlines themselves are as much about optimising fuel costs as about optimising capital assets: Airlines tend to change their fuel contracting every year at each airport, if possible, and have whole teams dedicated to buying and hedging fuels. Their whole system is built around not taking risk.

As a result, the current market for aviation fuels has been optimised so that airlines can always buy the fuel at the cheapest commodity price possible. The pricing is based on large fuel volumes sold at the Platts market price plus a very small differential.

The SAF industry is currently asking the market to operate drastically differently, with long-term offtake agreements of 10 - 15 years, often on a take-or-pay or cost-plus model. This is driven by their investors’ need for long-term certainty, essentially leading to airlines being asked to underpin the bankability of SAF developers’ debt.

This current risk-reward balance is clearly misaligned, especially given the two to five times cost differential between SAF and conventional fuels. This is why SAF is still struggling to take off. Finding ways to unlock project debt financing and reducing the cost of capital is key to addressing the imbalance and accelerating SAF deployment. This means lenders’ perception of ‘first of a kind’ (FOAK) SAF project risks will have to change.

One of the biggest perceived project risks is revenue uncertainty. The upcoming UK revenue certainty mechanism and similar future measures in the EU can address this, but they must be designed to support decarbonisation without crippling the aviation industry or SAF developers. Compliance has to be cheaper than paying penalties for inaction.

The FOAK nature of many SAF plants and perceived and real associated risks is a further challenge to lenders, blocking debt financing and driving up cost of capital. More work is needed to manage risk and the lender’s understanding and perception of them.

One way to tackle the real development risks typically associated with any FOAK project, is to share them more equitably across stakeholders. This could take the form of direct investments from a broader group of stakeholders, or joint cross-industry ventures, particularly involving those organisations whose business success is closely tied to the aviation industry and who face the greatest exposure if the sector fails to decarbonise.

Bottlenecks in the route to market

Driven by the clear demand signal set by the mandates, the number of new producers is growing rapidly. In the UK alone, 26 unique SAF projects have been awarded funding under the Advanced Fuels Fund Scheme since 2022.[9] The project developers are predominantly start-ups who are new to this space, but oil and gas majors and conglomerates are also represented (e.g. Equinor and Essar). Projects cover a rage of pathways, including gasification, power-to-liquids (PtL), pyrolysis, ethanol-to-jet, and methanol-to-jet. In the EU, SAF is currently dominated by HEFA SAF (produced from oils and fats, such as used cooking oils, animal fats or vegetable oils), but policy and industry plans are explicitly pushing for more diverse pathways (e.g. e-fuels sub-mandate), and therefore this picture is changing fast.

While the technologies, conversion pathways, and developers are highly diverse, the infrastructure they are relying on to get their fuel to market is constricted and often operated by only a handful of large players. Blending points, fuel terminals, pipelines, and the airport fuel infrastructure, are managed and locked down by the existing fuel industry (e.g. single suppliers or small consortia). All routes to market for new SAF currently have to pass through this bottleneck. This creates high entry barriers for SAF producers through restricted access, complex permitting, or inflated fees.

This is why the mandates have been designed to target the companies that own the bottleneck. But there also has to be further disruption to release the stranglehold and break the bottleneck. Joint ventures could allow for new entrants to develop onsite and shared fuel infrastructures to ease restrictions and capture a growing market. This will require both additional investment and a different approach to how fuel farms and other airport infrastructures are operated. Book and claim will also play an important role as it can help bypass the physical infrastructure bottlenecks by allowing SAF to be credited to end users without requiring direct delivery.

First mover advantage

As we have seen, first movers in SAF face a unique set of challenges. They must navigate infrastructure bottlenecks, operate within evolving policy frameworks, and often sit at the higher end of the cost curve. With few operational plants to serve as benchmarks, perceived technology risk remains high. This makes financing more difficult, increasing the cost of capital and likely driving up insurance premiums.

However, there are also significant first mover opportunities that go beyond building brand recognition, getting an early share of the market, and developing know-how and intellectual property. First movers can also turn their challenges into opportunities by controlling key steps in the value chain: strategic locations, feedstocks, and distribution infrastructure.

First movers in SAF have a unique opportunity to secure limited strategic locations with access to low-cost feedstocks, existing jet fuel and export infrastructure, and nearby offtakers. Since feedstock and logistics costs heavily influence the levelised cost of SAF (especially for e-SAF which depends on scarce biogenic CO₂ and affordable renewable electricity) early access to these resources is a major advantage. With infrastructure bottlenecks still a challenge, proximity to fuel infrastructure and demand centres positions early developers to scale more efficiently as the market matures.

Securing and managing the flow of feedstocks is a key opportunity on its own. Building strong relationships with feedstock suppliers through innovative contract development, joint ventures, or direct investment could secure first movers’ market position. This is where oil and gas majors can have an edge over new entrants, as they have decades of experience in managing the flow of molecules. To take advantage of this opportunity, new entrants must learn how to operate as a fuels business, not only as technology developers or plant operators. Developing the right partnerships to unlock and build the relevant know-how will be key.

As discussed in the previous section, fuels infrastructure represents a significant bottleneck restricting access to offtakers for new entrants. First movers can turn this situation into an advantage, forming joint ventures to co-develop onsite or shared infrastructure that break existing bottlenecks and provides some control of the supply chain.

The report, titled “SAF Samarthya – The opportunity of AtJ SAF in India”, marks one of the first industry-backed assertions that India’s role in the global aviation fuel transition may extend beyond consumption to export leadership.

The paper notes that while the government has already set SAF blending targets of 1 percent by 2027 and 5 percent by 2030 for international flights, the abundant feedstock base and developed ethanol ecosystem could enable production volumes well in excess of domestic needs. “After meeting domestic demand, India could position itself as a regional exporter to markets with binding SAF requirements,” the report says.

Surplus feedstock and ethanol ecosystem

India produces over 500 crore litres of ethanol annually and generates more than 400 million tonnes of surplus biomass every year, including agricultural residues, forestry waste, and municipal solid waste. This resource pool, coupled with the country’s low-cost renewable power, gives India a competitive edge in scaling Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) fuel production.

The knowledge paper draws a parallel with the Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), which helped India move from 1.5 percent petrol blending in 2014 to 20 percent in 2025, five years ahead of schedule. The same logistics networks, pricing mechanisms and procurement systems used by oil marketing companies for ethanol can be repurposed to support SAF production and distribution.

First wave of commercial projects

Several companies are already investing in capacity and technology to prepare for this transition. Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery recently became the first domestic player to secure ISCC-CORSIA certification, targeting 35,000 tonnes of SAF by 2025. Praj Industries, in collaboration with LanzaJet, has commissioned a 1 kilolitre per day AtJ demonstration facility in Pune, while TruAlt Bioenergy is planning a 15–20 KTPD commercial plant in Belagavi, Karnataka.

Industry experts see these developments as the foundation for scaling up production not just for India’s aviation sector but also for export markets in the EU, UK and US, where binding SAF mandates are tightening and demand is expected to outstrip local supply.

Policy support and financing

The report also recommends a suite of policy instruments to make exports viable, including Viability Gap Funding of Rs 150 crore per project, production-linked incentives, CAPEX subsidies, concessional finance, and a dedicated SAF fund. It argues that replicating the financial de-risking that enabled India’s ethanol success is critical to building a globally competitive SAF industry.

A strategic pivot

With its fast-growing aviation sector — expected to field 1,600 aircraft by 2030 and 2,200 by 2035 — India is already one of the largest potential SAF markets.

At the roundtable, U.S. corporations brought forward a range of cutting-edge solutions. Representatives from leading planning and design firms emphasized the importance of building human-centered “smart airports.”

Technology giants such as Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Rapiscan presented solutions spanning from cloud computing and data management to advanced security screening and fuel-efficient operations.

Experts from GE Aerospace, Gulfstream, and Honeywell Aerospace further highlighted the global trend toward sustainable aviation, with a strong focus on flight safety, intelligent operations, and the application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Dang Minh Truong, chairman of Sun Group, said: “For Sun Group, aviation is not merely a means of transportation, but a strategic infrastructure to elevate the stature of a destination. We are building a comprehensive aviation ecosystem — from airport infrastructure to commercial airlines and premium services — with the vision of transforming Phu Quoc from a paradise for leisure into a new aviation and tourism hub of the region.

""The presence of leading US corporations today opens up valuable opportunities for collaboration, enabling us to learn from cutting-edge technologies while reaffirming our commitment to sustainable development and global integration.”

US Ambassador Marc Knapper remarked: “The connections forged today between American aviation leaders and Vietnamese innovators like Sun Group create the foundation for transformative collaboration. By combining cutting-edge US technology with Vietnam's dynamic market growth and visionary private sector leadership, we can accelerate progress toward making Vietnam the premier aviation destination in Southeast Asia.”

The innovative solutions presented by leading international corporations, combined with the strong commitment of Sun Group and Sun PhuQuoc Airways, have marked an important milestone in the journey to transform Phu Quoc into a new global hub for aviation and tourism.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/news/2025/09/15/sun-4-215417.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:56:07.037772

The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility proposal forms part of a broader effort to establish Teesside as a hub for low‑carbon aviation fuel manufacture.
Linking production to CCS can reduce emissions further, but CCS projects themselves have drawn scrutiny over cost, capacity and timing.
Alfanar, a diversified Saudi firm with interests in energy and engineering, has not yet published a detailed timetable or financial close date for Lighthouse Green Fuels.
“Developments such as Lighthouse Green Fuels put our region at the forefront of a growing industry which is primed for massive expansion and will deliver thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment in coming years.","The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility is proposed for the North Tees industrial cluster and would convert more than 1.5Mt of sustainably sourced biomass waste into up to 180M litres of SAF a year, according to company figures. That output is equivalent to fuelling roughly 25,000 short‑haul or 2,500 long‑haul flights annually.

Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said he secured the pledge during a visit to Riyadh last week, meeting senior Alfanar executives including vice‑chairman Sabah Al Multaq. The mayor said he would champion the scheme with the UK government as it progresses towards construction.

Alfanar’s plan envisages more than 2,000 jobs during the construction phase and about 240 permanent roles once the plant is operational. Project backers also say the facility will link to carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure being developed off the Teesside coast by the Northern Endurance Partnership, reducing lifecycle emissions. They estimate more than 750,000t of carbon dioxide could be avoided when the plant is coupled with CCS.

The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility proposal forms part of a broader effort to establish Teesside as a hub for low‑carbon aviation fuel manufacture. The Department for Transport has previously awarded almost £40M from its Advanced Fuels Fund to Alfanar and four other Teesside businesses to support SAF development in the region.

The project would represent one of the larger private investments in UK SAF production to date, but it faces the usual hurdles for industrial-scale energy projects: securing final investment decisions, planning consents, feedstock supply chains and long‑term offtake agreements with airlines or fuel distributors.

Critics of biomass‑derived sustainable fuels warn that sustainability depends on feedstock sourcing and land‑use impacts, while supporters point to the potential to decarbonise hard‑to‑electrify sectors such as aviation. Linking production to CCS can reduce emissions further, but CCS projects themselves have drawn scrutiny over cost, capacity and timing.

Local officials have promoted Teesside’s existing industrial infrastructure, port capacity and emerging CCS network as advantages for attracting low‑carbon industry. If completed, the Lighthouse plant would add to a cluster of projects seeking to position the area as a centre for energy transition and green manufacturing.

Alfanar, a diversified Saudi firm with interests in energy and engineering, has not yet published a detailed timetable or financial close date for Lighthouse Green Fuels.

Mayor Houchen said: “It is outstanding news that Alfanar has committed to delivering this project on Teesside and it’s a further example of the transformative global investments we are bringing to Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool.

“Developments such as Lighthouse Green Fuels put our region at the forefront of a growing industry which is primed for massive expansion and will deliver thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment in coming years.

Virgin Australia ordered the new aircraft last year on the back of improving load factors and financial results after emerging from receivership following the pandemic.
The aircraft will be based in Perth and employed on regional routes in Western Australia, replacing the ageing Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Network Aviation on Virgin’s behalf.
Virgin Australia Regional Airlines group executive Nick Rohrlach said the delivery of the new aircraft was a landmark day for aviation in Western Australia.","The first of eight new Embraer regional jets for Virgin Australia made a stopover in Canberra last week on its delivery flight to Perth.

Named ‘’Coral Bay’’, the aircraft completed the 26,000-kilometre ferry flight from São José dos Campos in Brazil via stops in Texas, California, Hawaii and Fiji before stopping in Canberra for a top-up for its final leg to Perth.

The E190-E2 is a substantially upgraded version of the older E-190s operated by Virgin Australia until 2018, when they were retired as part of the fleet consolidation on the Boeing 737. But the E190 offered much lower fuel burn, and was well suited to shorter and ‘’thinner’’ routes to regional centres that don’t require a 180-seat 737.

Upgrades include new-generation engines, a revised wing, and enhanced cabin features and products. The new aircraft will be fitted with 100-seat interiors, comprising 92 economy-class seats in a four-abreast configuration, and eight three-abreast business-class seats. Some of the economy-class seat rows will have ‘’Economy X’’ seats with additional legroom as a cost premium.

Virgin Australia ordered the new aircraft last year on the back of improving load factors and financial results after emerging from receivership following the pandemic.

This was followed earlier this year by the airline being relisted on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) for the first time in five years, the receipt of government approval for Qatar Airways to invest in the airline, and the resumption of international services from Sydney to Doha using Qatar Airways equipment and crews.

The aircraft will be based in Perth and employed on regional routes in Western Australia, replacing the ageing Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Network Aviation on Virgin’s behalf. Compared with the F100, the E190-E2 is much quieter, burns 30 per cent less fuel and produces 30 per cent fewer emissions.

The new aircraft are capable of flying legs up to six hours long, and are powered by new-generation Pratt & Whitney PW1900G geared turbofan engines. These are similar to the larger PW1500Gs installed on Qantas’s new and slightly larger 130-seat Airbus A220s, which are based in Canberra, and the larger-still PW1100G used by Jetstar’s Airbus A321NEO and Qantas’s new A321XLR.

While the E190-E2s’ primary role will be supporting Virgin Australia Regional Airlines’ (VARA) extensive fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) contracts across the state’s vastly dispersed mining communities, the cabin configuration will allow them the flexibility to operate regular passenger services during quieter charter periods.

VARA was formed from Virgin’s 2013 acquisition of Skywest, which had operated in the state for more than 60 years.

VARA currently operates about 250 flights a week, servicing regional centres including Albany, Broome, Busselton, Derby, Esperance, Exmouth, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Kununurra, Newman, Onslow and Port Hedland from its Perth base. These are a mix of revenue passenger and mining fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) services. In addition, VARA links Kalgoorlie with Melbourne, Broome and Kununurra with Darwin, and Port Hedland with Bali.

Virgin Australia Regional Airlines group executive Nick Rohrlach said the delivery of the new aircraft was a landmark day for aviation in Western Australia.

“The E190-E2 is a game-changer,” he said.

“It is more fuel-efficient, quieter and more comfortable than anything else operating in the state’s charter market today. It will significantly improve the travel experience for our charter clients and give us greater flexibility across VARA’s operations.

“When it enters service next month, this aircraft will fly charter routes and also support commercial services primarily within Western Australia to destinations like Darwin, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Port Hedland and Broome.

“As we build scale with the E2 fleet over time, we will be able to explore expanding its use across our national network.

“The E190-E2 is 30 per cent more fuel-efficient than our retiring Fokker 100s and has the lowest noise profile of any aircraft in its segment. It is also future-ready, certified for up to 50 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and capable of operating on 100 per cent SAF.”

Three more E-190E2s are scheduled to join the VARA fleet in Perth by early 2026, with the remainder by the end of 2027.",https://psnews.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/09/Virgin-Australia-Embraer-E190-E2-Csmith-Photography-08-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:56:57.932363

In its recently released Annual Financial Report, GrainGrowers activities during the financial year resulted in a profit after tax of $7.2M, up from the FY24 result of $4.2M.

Total comprehensive income for the year included $8M in unrealised gains on the investment portfolio, up from $4.5M in FY24, alongside realised gains of $3.4M, compared with $2.6M the year before.

GrainGrowers’ expenses for the year were $7.559M, down slightly from $7.691M in FY24.

Most of these costs were employment-related expenses at $4.47M, followed by $1.48M for projects.

The financial report also referenced specific expenses for the year, notably payments to politically-aligned causes and $220,000 for National Farmers Federation membership.

The political-related expenses included $30,000 for annual membership to the Federal Labor Business Forum, which allows for GrainGrowers attendance at various Labor events, and a further payment of $2520 was made to the forum during the year for attendance to other events.

Another $11,000 was paid to the National Party to attend various similar political functions during the year.

In the financial report, the organisation commented that “these expenditures further complement GrainGrowers advocacy and policy agenda”.

Investment portfolio breakdown

Management of GrainGrowers’ investment portfolio continued to bring gains for the organisation during FY25.

Most of these gains came from a $5.238M jump in the value of investments categorised as “units in unlisted Australian Infrastructure fund” to $47.768M.

This is the organisation’s second-largest investment classification, under “units in unlisted Australian managed funds”, which also rose in FY25 from $56.92M to $58.505M.

GrainGrowers credited “proactive management and long-term asset allocation” behind the success of its investment portfolio.

“This strategic approach has effectively positioned GrainGrowers’ portfolio to navigate through financial market volatility in the year and has enabled the portfolio to gain from the financial market recovery in the final quarter of the current fiscal year,” the report said.

In the accompanying Annual Report, GrainGrowers’ chair Rhys Turton said the organisation continued a policy of disciplined financial management.

“GrainGrowers financial position remains strong and together with a disciplined spending policy, we continue to effectively represent and serve over 15,000 members nationally,” Mr Turton said.

“Our grower relations and thought leadership work ensures we provide a robust ideas ecosystem that can solve emerging and future issues while still exploring opportunities for immediate growth and innovation for the industry.

“As examples, projects and initiatives undertaken include our comprehensive and industry wide Grain Sustainability Framework and Inputs of the Future report including the active exploration of biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).”

GrainGrowers’ priorities

The Annual Report identified key areas of focus for GrainGrowers during the financial year.

GrainGrowers chief executive officer Shona Gawel said “one of the biggest issues” was the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority review of paraquat and diquat.

She said there was a “huge amount of resourcing dedicated to this critical issue”.

“Knowing we needed data to underpin our response, the grower survey we ran received over 1120 responses,” Ms Gawel said.

“In addition to the submission response, we also focused on ways to engage with the broader community.

“GrainGrowers ran a community awareness campaign with a fantastic video featuring growers across the country about how they safely and responsibly use tools like paraquat and diquat on their farms.”

Ms Gawel said the organisation had focused its efforts on six key issues for the industry to focus its resources and skillset.

“As a grower representative organisation, there is a desire at times to “be and do all things”.

“We have a committed team who take pride in being of use to our growers.

“However, GrainGrowers has found that we can create the most impact by prioritising and subsequently have focused on six key issues: carbon and climate, farm business, farm inputs, grain freight and supply chains, trade and market access and biosecurity.

“This gives us capacity when emerging issues arise.”",https://www.graincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-105945.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:15.257244

The daa annual report said: ""Total remuneration in respect of Mr Jacobs for 2024 amounted to

€374,830 (2023: €347,457) which included basic salary of €284,235 (2023: €267,837) and pension contributions and other taxable benefits of €90,595 (2023: €79,620).""

The daa board is due to meet in Cork in a pre-scheduled meeting on Friday.

A spokesperson for the daa declined to comment on the negotiations regarding Mr Jacobs' future.

Airport passenger cap will stifle growth - O'Brien

Meanwhile, Minister O'Brien said retaining Dublin Airport's passenger cap will stifle its growth.

The Department of Transport will begin the process of removing the Dublin Airport passenger cap in the coming weeks.

The cap, which stands at 32 million passengers per year, was imposed in 2007 as part of the planning conditions around the development of Terminal 2.

At the time, the airport had about 23 million passengers.

Legal proceedings by airlines have effectively suspended the cap, with questions referred to the European Courts.

Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Mr O’Brien said the airport is a ""critical economic driver for the country, not just for the region, and any stifling of that growth obviously has a direct economic impact"".

""I've had a series of meetings over the course of the last number of months, particularly with our legal advisors, and I'll be coming forward to Cabinet, hopefully before the Budget, with legislative options that is in seeking approval to proceed with drafting Heads of Bill and the general scheme,"" he added.

Mr O’Brien said he was in favour of the removal of the passenger cap, which could see up to 60 million passengers pass through the airport per year, if the growth was managed in a sustainable manner.

""You have obviously got to do that on a phased basis. One is not going to jump from 36 million to 60 million in the course of one, five, ten years,"" he said.

He said a ""couple of very significant planning decisions"" have been made.

""The night flights issue has been addressed in July, which gives clarity to the airport and indeed to residents around the operation of the airport at night,"" he said.

""We're expecting, very, very shortly in the coming weeks, a positive decision on Metrolink, which is a transformative project for the airport, and indeed for the region.""

""The physical infrastructure around the airport that existed back in 2007 when this planning permission was granted and that condition was put in place, has changed greatly and will change further,"" he added.

Mr O’Brien said that there would ""unquestionably"" be an increase in greenhouse gas emissions if the passenger cap is removed, but added that the aviation sector had responsibilities to combat that potential increase.

""What also is in that [planning] application, and which is understood in the aviation sector, is the responsibilities they have to bring forward the use of alternative fuels, such as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel),"" he said.

""Airplanes are far more advanced technologically now and are more efficient in relation to fuel use.

""We have obligations on the climate side and I'm acutely aware of that as Minister with responsibility for that.

""We've seen emissions reduce over the last two years in Ireland, whilst our economy and population continues to grow. So we're making advances in many areas, and this is a balance that we will have to strike.""

Mr O’Brien said he had already met with a number of residents groups to hear and discuss their concerns.

""I have met with the residents group from St Margaret's over the summer,"" he said.

""I'll be meeting with them again. I've met with residents in Portmarnock. I know the area intimately as I've spent my whole life here.

""I also know that there are many residents here who understand we need to grow the airport, and indeed a lot of those residents do, and there are others who have concerns and I continue to engage with them, absolutely.""

'Inevitability' around cap removal

A member of the Oireachtas Transport Committee member says there has been an inevitability about the removal of the cap at Dublin Airport for some time.

Fianna Fáil TD Cathal Crowe, said aviation likes certainty and if an airline doesn't feel it is being properly accomodated it can easily move to another jurisdiction.

Legislation takes time, he said on RTÉ's Today with Claire Byrne, and will probably be passed sometime next year.

Mr Crowe said aviation has come on ""light years"" and there are more efforts underway to make aircrafts more environmentally friendly.

He added that Ireland is an island nation that needs connectivity and economic development.

Opportunity to examine airport activity regulation - O'Gorman

Green Party leader Roderic O'Gorman said if the cap at Dublin airport is changed, it could be an opportunity to examine whether passenger numbers is the right way to regulate activities at Dublin Airport.

Roderic O'Gorman said there could be an opportunity to look at emissions and noise and reward those airlines that are upgrading their fleet and using quieter and more fuel efficient aircrafts.

""We have to understand the scale of what Minister O'Brien is proposing, and we should be regulating Dublin Airport in terms of what is generated by increased passenger numbers,"" he said on RTÉ's Today with Claire Byrne.

""Focusing on the actual emission of the passenger brings a greater degree of fairness into the equation,"" he added.

More aircraft means more noise

A spokesperson for St Margaret's The Ward Residents forum says more aircraft will mean more noise and there are already outstanding issues in relation to noise from Dublin airport.

Niamh Maher said residents find it ""incredulous"" that the Minister for Transport would remove the cap without resolving these issues first.

""The problem extends past St Margaret's The Ward to everywhere a flight path crosses over,"" she said.

""If there's an increase in passenger numbers, which equals increased flights, that is going to get even worse,"" she added.",https://www.rte.ie/images/001df17c-1600.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:18.926662

“We found that information about Canada’s carbon removal sector is scattered all over the place,” Na'im Merchant, executive director of Carbon Removal Canada, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada.
Based in Toronto, Carbon Removal Canada works to accelerate the “responsible scale-up of carbon removal.” The Carbon Console was funded via a partnership with RBC.
A plurality of the current removal capacity is from rock-based carbon removal that involves mineralizing CO2, followed by ocean-, land- and air-based methods.
Canada could lead the world in carbon removal, Carbon Removal Canada said in a 2023 report, noting advantages such as its clean electricity, skilled energy workforce and fostering of companies.","A website made by non-profit Carbon Removal Canada that summarizes the state of the emerging sector and planned capacity across the country is intended to “solve a pretty critical market intelligence problem,” the organization’s head said.

Released today, the Carbon Console tracks the Canadian carbon removal industry, which captures the greenhouse gas from the environment through various means and buries it in different mediums. The non-profit suggests Canada could reap tens of billions of dollars in economic activity from the sector.

“We found that information about Canada’s carbon removal sector is scattered all over the place,” Na'im Merchant, executive director of Carbon Removal Canada, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada. The console is meant to “centralize all that information in one platform in a transparent manner.”

Today, there is enough carbon removal capacity to extract 101,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, with almost 12 million tonnes planned, according to the Console. There are 78 companies in the sector operating in Canada, made up of technology providers, project developers and operators.

Policy makers can take a peek to inform policies, while the private sector can make better-informed decisions such as where to site a project, Merchant said.

Based in Toronto, Carbon Removal Canada works to accelerate the “responsible scale-up of carbon removal.”

The Carbon Console was funded via a partnership with RBC.

Where Canada’s carbon removal industry stands today

The organization collected publicly available data, made direct outreach to carbon removal industry players, and conducted its own research drawing from sources such as media reports and pitches made to local governments to create the Console.

Governments, community groups and local non-governmental organizations were highly interested in the Carbon Console so they could be better informed about the nascent sector, Merchant said.

Not all carbon removal technology is the science-fiction-like direct air capture that filters CO2 from the atmosphere. Nature-based solutions such as converting forestry and agricultural biomass into biochar, a carbon-rich solid material, are popular.

Under 50 projects are currently underway. A plurality of the current removal capacity is from rock-based carbon removal that involves mineralizing CO2, followed by ocean-, land- and air-based methods.

Merchant is “amazed at just the amount of projects that are operating or under development or planned.” The 11.9 million tonnes of planned capacity was “a big shock,” as Carbon Removal Canada expected closer to one million. It is a sign companies are building a diverse scope of projects and carbon removal is no longer a “science experiment,” he said.

The 11.9 million tonnes would represent a sliver of the 708 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted in 2024 across Canada.

One metric that is absent on the Carbon Console is the amount of investment committed into the sector. Carbon Removal Canada plans to add more data points to the website over time, Merchant said, including the dollars put toward the technology.

How Canada could lead in the sector

British Columbia is an innovation leader in the sector, Merchant noted. Companies based in the province include Carbon Engineering, Arca and Svante.

At the project level, carbon removal has high potential in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Alberta particularly stands out because many large-scale projects are planned to be sited in the province, the provincial government has extended generous policy support, and the province has “an entrepreneurial business approach,” Merchant said.

Atlantic provinces could forge ahead in ocean-based carbon removal, he added. Players housed in the region include Aeon Blue, Planetary Technologies and CarbonCure.

Canada could lead the world in carbon removal, Carbon Removal Canada said in a 2023 report, noting advantages such as its clean electricity, skilled energy workforce and fostering of companies. But Merchant warned the country risks falling behind the likes of the U.K. or the European Union because of insufficient government policies.

He laid out three recommendations for the Canadian government to stay ahead in the race:

creating market certainty for companies by helping to secure buyers and funding;

expanding the investment tax credit for all forms of carbon removal, not just direct air capture; and

more targeted research and development funding for carbon removal, such as Natural Resources Canada making a project stream for the technology.

Carbon removal, in the non-profit’s view, is an investment that can be supported using unspent money in funds, Merchant said. The industry is a “critical sector” that should be supported by the federal government, and the carbon removal credits it generates could even be an export opportunity, he added.",https://squall.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/posts/2025091204-carbon-console-800x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:23.189465

The paper pitched Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) SAF, produced from ethanol, as the most strategic pathway for India to cut emissions, reduce crude oil imports and create green jobs.
“India stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainable aviation journey.
With a strategic push, we can decarbonise our skies and become a regional and global SAF hub,” Vijay Nirani, SAFA senior vice president, said in a statement.
ICF has projected that global SAF output will grow tenfold to nearly 20 million tonnes by 2030.","India could emerge as a major global hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the back of its robust ethanol ecosystem, surplus agricultural residues and rapidly expanding aviation market, according to a new report.

The report, SAF Samarthya – The Opportunity of AtJ SAF in India, launched on September 15, 2025 by consultancy ICF in collaboration with the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Association (SAFA), underlined that with aviation contributing 2-3 per cent of global carbon emissions, India faces both a “challenge and opportunity” to decarbonise while sustaining its air travel boom.

The findings come ahead of the government’s planned national SAF policy to meet Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) norms and decarbonise the sector.

The paper pitched Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) SAF, produced from ethanol, as the most strategic pathway for India to cut emissions, reduce crude oil imports and create green jobs.

“India stands at a pivotal juncture in its sustainable aviation journey. We need a roadmap that not only sets the blueprint for SAF production and uptake but makes all stakeholders key custodians of this transition,” said Vasudevan S, Head of Aviation, Travel and Tourism (India & APAC), ICF, in a statement.

India has set indicative SAF blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, rising to 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights, equivalent to around 700 million litres of SAF demand by 2030.

Industry leaders including Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), Praj Industries, TruAlt Bioenergy and Avaada Group are already investing in production capacity and technology.

There has been some early progress. Praj Industries has commissioned a one kilolitre-per-day AtJ demo plant in Pune, while IOCL recently became the first domestic firm to secure ISCC-CORSIA certification at its Panipat refinery. Several second-generation (2G) ethanol plants by IOCL, BPCL and HPCL are also coming online, ensuring a ready feedstock base.

“We believe India has the raw materials, technological know-how and entrepreneurial spirit to build a thriving SAF ecosystem. What is required now is the collective will—commitment, collaboration and bold decision-making,” Rohit Kumar, SAFA secretary general, said in a statement.

India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), which scaled petrol blending from 1.5 per cent in 2014 to 20 per cent by 2025, offers a blueprint for SAF rollout, the paper noted. Ethanol capacity has risen eightfold to 13.8 billion litres in under a decade, creating infrastructure, supply chains and policy experience that can be repurposed for AtJ.

India produces over 500 crore litres of ethanol annually and about 754 million tonnes of agricultural biomass, of which 228 million tonnes is surplus and available for energy use. Surplus feedstocks are concentrated in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, making them prime zones for SAF clusters.

“India has abundant agricultural waste, low-cost renewable energy and a large domestic aviation market. With a strategic push, we can decarbonise our skies and become a regional and global SAF hub,” Vijay Nirani, SAFA senior vice president, said in a statement.

However, high production costs — currently three to five times that of conventional jet fuel — remain the key barrier. Feedstock accounts for 50-70 per cent of costs, followed by capital-intensive conversion infrastructure.

The report called for viability gap funding of Rs 150 crore per project, production-linked incentives, tax breaks, low-interest loans and carbon credit frameworks to de-risk private investment.

It also urged a national-level mapping of feedstocks, upgrades at airports and oil marketing terminals for SAF storage and blending, industry-academia skill programmes and stronger cross-ministerial coordination.

“Government incentives, a dedicated SAF consortium, and sustainable feedstock policies will be essential. With coordinated efforts, India can drive economic growth and innovation while meeting its climate goals,” stressed Jimmy Olsson, President, SAF Association.

ICF has projected that global SAF output will grow tenfold to nearly 20 million tonnes by 2030. After meeting domestic demand, the report argued that India could tap export markets with binding SAF mandates, turning aviation decarbonisation into a major economic opportunity.

“Together, government and industry can transform India’s aviation sector into a model of sustainable growth, innovation and climate leadership,” said Ajay Mathur, Mentor, SAF Association and former DG, International Solar Alliance.

If India replicates its ethanol success in SAF, the report concluded, it could not just participate in the global clean fuel transition but shape it, emerging as a key driver of innovation, investment and leadership in sustainable aviation.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-15%2Fgwynejjx%2FiStock-1202297867.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:39.186524

He pointed out that sugar production in India is much costlier than in Brazil.
Without ethanol, nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced closure, Gadkari noted.
“If farmers start producing fuel, electricity, aviation fuel, bitumen and hydrogen, along with food, villages will prosper,” he said.
He added that boosting irrigation by 65% and increasing milk production could address many challenges faced by farmers in Maharashtra.","Pune: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said that ethanol production has been a lifeline for sugarcane farmers and sugar mills in Maharashtra, reported The Times of India.

Speaking at the tenth anniversary of the Naam Foundation, started by actors Nana Patekar and Makarand Anaspure for watershed management and drought relief, Gadkari said that the sugar industry was under severe strain but survived because of ethanol. He added that work is underway to produce isobutanol as an alternative to diesel, and that plans are being drawn up to create sustainable aviation fuel from biogas.

He pointed out that sugar production in India is much costlier than in Brazil. While the cost in Brazil is about Rs. 27 per kg, in Maharashtra it is around Rs. 32-33. “Brazil can sell sugar internationally at around Rs. 30, but our mills lose Rs. 2-3 per kg,” he said. Without ethanol, nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced closure, Gadkari noted.

He urged farmers to think beyond food crops. “If farmers start producing fuel, electricity, aviation fuel, bitumen and hydrogen, along with food, villages will prosper,” he said.

According to him, the use of corn for ethanol has also given farmers better prices. Rates have risen from Rs. 1,200 per quintal to Rs. 2,800 per quintal, and production has tripled in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra, where farmers take three crops a year.

On broader issues, Gadkari stressed the need for better water management to improve farming and rural life. He said disputes between states on sharing river water had created complications, but most of the 23 conflicts have now been resolved. He added that boosting irrigation by 65% and increasing milk production could address many challenges faced by farmers in Maharashtra.

Later in the day, at another programme organised by Geeta Dharma Mandal, Gadkari was honoured. While addressing the gathering, he suggested using modern tools like videos and reels to share the teachings of the Bhagavad Geeta with the youth. He said this could help them understand the meaning of life and politics. “Politics should focus more on social reforms than on power. The real problem today is not disagreement, but the absence of ideas,” he remarked.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Nitin-Gadkari-6.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:57:16.495408

MARKET DRIVERS

The logistics market growth is majorly driven by the rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce, which demands agile, customer-centric delivery networks. Consumers in emerging and developed markets alike are increasingly purchasing goods from international platforms, necessitating efficient customs clearance, last-mile delivery, and reverse logistics. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, global cross-border e-commerce sales reached $6.3 trillion in 2023, a 9.4% increase from the previous year, with Asia-Pacific leading in outbound and inbound digital trade. This surge places immense pressure on logistics providers to offer transparent tracking, faster transit times, and localized fulfillment. Companies like DHL and FedEx have responded by expanding regional sorting hubs in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.

The shift toward nearshoring and supply chain regionalization in response to geopolitical volatility and pandemic-era disruptions is additionally fuelling the growth of the logistics market. Multinational corporations are relocating production and distribution closer to end markets to reduce lead times and mitigate risks. This trend is particularly evident in the automotive and electronics sectors, where just-in-time manufacturing requires proximity to assembly plants. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported a 14% increase in warehouse construction starts in 2023, which is primarily for distribution centers serving reshored operations.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

The persistent shortage of qualified drivers and warehouse personnel in developed economies is restricting the growth of the logistics market. This labor deficit disrupts service reliability and inflates operational costs. According to the American Trucking Associations, the U.S. faced a shortage of approximately 80,000 truck drivers in 2023, a figure projected to exceed 100,000 by 2026 due to an aging workforce and low entry rates.

The escalating cost and volatility of energy, particularly diesel and aviation fuel, which is also hindering the growth of the logistics market. According to the International Energy Agency, global diesel prices rose by 22% between January 2022 and December 2023. For logistics firms, fuel can account for up to 30% of operating costs in road freight, as noted by the International Road Union. Airlines faced even steeper increases, with jet fuel prices up 28% over the same period, forcing cargo carriers to impose surcharges or reduce capacity. This volatility undermines pricing predictability and profit margins, especially for small and mid-sized logistics providers without hedging capabilities. Additionally, the push for decarbonization adds financial pressure, as companies must invest in alternative-fuel vehicles and infrastructure without guaranteed short-term returns, which is complicating long-term planning and investment decisions.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

According to the analysis, these improvements saved an estimated 187,000 tonnes of CO₂ daily compared to 2019 operational standards.
However such gains were not enough to offset the growth in capacity, which is why total emissions still went up.
The EmeraldSky analysis suggests that new daily emissions records will become routine during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer travel season.

However, the latest report from Cirium’s EmeraldSky platform reveals that, while total daily emissions saw a modest 0.1% increase, airlines achieved a significant 7.4 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency per available seat kilometer (ASK) compared to 2019.

The efficiency gains came despite the average age of aircraft increasing by 17% to 11.6 years, contradicting the common belief that a newer fleet is the only way to improve performance. Instead, airlines focused on operational refinements, including streamlining ground operations, optimizing flight routes, and more efficient network management.

According to the analysis, these improvements saved an estimated 187,000 tonnes of CO₂ daily compared to 2019 operational standards. However such gains were not enough to offset the growth in capacity, which is why total emissions still went up.

The EmeraldSky analysis suggests that new daily emissions records will become routine during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer travel season.

The authors conclude that, while the industry’s recent efficiency improvements have been faster than historical trends, continued growth will require more fundamental changes, with sustainable aviation fuel still making up less than 1% of consumption.

Andrew Doyle, Senior Director – Market Development, Cirium, stressed the importance of fleet modernisation and integrating innovative technologies to mitigate emissions.

“While geopolitical factors present significant challenges, the aviation industry’s commitment to modernising fleets is a testament to our proactive approach to sustainability,” he said.

The company said in a statement on Monday that it plans to unveil ‘the achievement’ at the Dubai Airshow later this year.

Lootah Biofuels said it has adopted a three-phase roadmap for SAF deployment. In the short term, it plans to import SAF to meet immediate market demand.

The medium-term plans are to operate a local production facility in the UAE. In the long-term, the company said in plans to localise full production to “enhance energy security, reduce imports, and create more green jobs,” it said in a statement.

The company said it has already completed engineering and feasibility studies for establishing a dedicated SAF production plant in the UAE.

Established in 2010, Lootah Biofuels was the first commercial biofuel company in the Middle East.

It is partnering with international production facilities to add this fuel to its extensive portfolio of bio-based products. The fuel is produced from Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and waste-derived fats, in accordance with ASTM D7566-24 and ICAO CORSIA standards.

The fuel produced from used cooking oil and waste-derived fats, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. The fuel can be blended with traditional Jet A-1 fuel up to 50 per cent by volume and offers cleaner combustion with very low sulfur content.

""As one of the first local suppliers of SAF, we are proud to launch SAF in the UAE market and showcase it at Dubai Airshow to local and international stakeholders and leading companies in the aviation industry,"" said Yousif Lootah, CEO of Lootah Biofuels.

Most of those capture CO2 from gas facilities and pump it underground to squeeze more oil from reservoirs, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
She added: “Whatever we do in the end needs to make money.” Beumelberg called for more taxpayer support for CCUS.
Only one, Huaneng Yangpu in China, is a gas power station and that is just a demonstration project.
US President Donald Trump, for example, cut subsidies for other green technologies but expanded support for CCUS, while India is preparing CCUS subsidies.","Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) to use or store remains one of the costliest ways to cut emissions. That means the technique – known as CCUS – has yet to scale up, still relies on taxpayer support and should only be pursued after other green solutions, key industry players told a recent conference in London.

Companies and governments that depend heavily on fossil fuel revenues have long promoted CCUS technology as a way to carry on producing and consuming fossil fuels while keeping emissions down.

But over 50 years since the first project began operating, CCUS is still barely used. According to the Global CCS Institute, just 50 facilities were running around the world in 2024, with the capacity to capture about a thousandth of global emissions.

Most of those capture CO2 from gas facilities and pump it underground to squeeze more oil from reservoirs, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

At this month’s Carbon Capture Global Summit 2025 – organised by Leader Associates – business representatives admitted that the technology has failed to expand on a commercial scale despite strong government support. CCUS momentum has even “plateaued a wee bit” in 2025, said Mhairidh Evans, head of CCUS research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Subsidies still needed

Julia Dubinina, a former Shell manager now developing oil and gas firm Harbour Energy’s carbon storage business, was asked if CCUS is entering its “deployment phase”. She replied that it is “too early to talk about scale”, adding “we need to be careful of not trying to fly before we can walk”. “There is still quite a lot of work to be done,” she added.

She remains cautious partly because “public funding is an absolute must for every project, and scaling is kind of limited when you need public funding for every single project,” she explained.

The industry depends on subsidies because capturing and transporting CO2 is among the most expensive climate solutions. In 2021, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists reported that while solar and wind investments usually save money, CCUS costs $50-200 per tonne of CO2 captured.

In a keynote speech at the conference, Katharina Beumelberg, sustainability chief at Heidelberg Materials – which produces cement, aggregates, concrete and asphalt – acknowledged the sector’s reliance on taxpayer support.

Praising the Norwegian government’s funding for one of the company’s CCUS projects, she said: “We need these funding processes to be able to do this pioneering work because, otherwise, from the private sector it would be unrealistic to get there”. She added: “Whatever we do in the end needs to make money.”

Beumelberg called for more taxpayer support for CCUS. Noting that three-fifths of Heidelberg’s products are used in government-funded projects, she said governments should create a market for carbon-free products, “recognising that a carbon-free product in the end does need to come with different pricing because it is carbon-free”.

Because of its high cost, most experts say CCUS should be reserved for sectors that are hard to clean up in other ways like steel, chemicals and particularly cement.

Expensive last resort

Cement-making produces 8% of global emissions, more than any country apart from the US and China, as fossil fuels are burned to heat limestone and the chemical process itself releases CO2.

But Rozemarijn Wesby, vice-president of CCUS at the world’s biggest cement company Holcim, told the conference that even in cement, the high cost of CCUS means it is only the “last piece of the puzzle”.

That’s because Holcim’s decarbonisation goal is more important than its CCUS goal, she said – and CCUS is one of the more expensive ways to cut emissions. For that reason, Holcim is first ensuring that its power is “green”, fuels are “sustainable and renewable” and emissions avoided “wherever possible”.

Evans of Wood Mackenzie echoed this, saying governments and companies should prioritise energy efficiency, then “electrifying everything that we possibly can with renewables, then fuel switching [and] substituting” before “at the last, directly abating or removing carbon dioxide”.

Wesby stressed that using CCUS only as a last step limits costs and prevents oversized “downstream” infrastructure. The CCUS infrastructure discussed at the conference included pipelines and trains to move CO2, terminals to store, compress and load it onto ships, and underground storage sites.

A Nature study published this month, however, found that the world’s CO2 storage potential is far more constrained than previously thought. Lead author Matthew Gidden of the University of Maryland argued in a post on CarbonBrief that governments should prioritise who gets access to storage space.

Carbon capture for gas plants?

Electricity is one of the easiest sectors to decarbonise because renewable power is often cheaper than fossil fuels. As of 2024, only five fossil-fuel power plants had CCUS, all of which used the CO2 for EOR. Only one, Huaneng Yangpu in China, is a gas power station and that is just a demonstration project.

Nonetheless, the UK government financially supports a CCUS project at a gas plant in England’s Northeast and is considering support for another in Wales run by power firm Uniper. Mike Lockett, Uniper’s UK head, said that Germany’s new centre right-led government had also “opened the door for gas-fired CCS”.

Supporters say such plants produce flexible and dispatchable power, unlike solar and wind. Critics argue batteries, demand management, nuclear and cross-border interconnections can provide sufficient backup.

Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus, a UK-based clean energy, electric vehicle services and heat pump company, said recently that – while it’s useful for cement – subsidising CCUS for energy is misguided.

Jackson, who is also an official adviser to the UK government, told the Financial Times Weekend Festival that the technology has “been a gift to the oil and gas industry to carry on what they’re doing and carry on the fiction that somehow enormous amounts of public money should enable them to keep doing it”.

“It’s a boondoggle for oil and gas – and we would be better off in the UK just burning unabated gas, because the cheaper we make electricity, the cheaper our heat pumps and electric cars are going to be and they are the key to emissions reductions,” he said.

Risk of pipeline leaks

Building out CCUS on a large scale will involve vast CO2 pipeline networks. These come with risks: In 2020, a landslide caused a carbon pipeline to leak in the US state of Mississippi, hospitalising at least 45 people. High concentrations of CO2 can cause headaches, drowsiness, elevated heartbeat and blood pressure, and even death.

Climate Home News asked Niko Bosnjak, policy and communications lead at carbon pipeline operator Open Grid Europe (OGE), which is converting German gas pipelines to carry CO2, if similar leaks could happen in Europe.

He said he had heard about the Mississippi incident, although he didn’t “know exactly what happened”. OGE, he added, is working on a security framework and “looking at the thickness of the pipeline in a way that is supposed to provide more security”.

Despite such concerns, CCUS has continued to receive strong political backing. US President Donald Trump, for example, cut subsidies for other green technologies but expanded support for CCUS, while India is preparing CCUS subsidies.

“The need for CCS is broadly recognised at the political level,” said Shell’s CCS general manager Kelly Ripley. Oil and gas giant Shell is launching CCUS projects – especially in North America and northwest Europe – she added, and is “doing a lot of learning from this political and regulatory perspective and also hoping to bring other countries on the same journey with us”.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/Carbon-Capture-Summit-2025-QEII-Centre-London-Photographer-Simon-Callaghan-Photography-1348-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 07:56:14.285582

“One per cent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 per cent of aviation emissions.","Most corporate travel managers are still on their first steps on their sustainability journeys. It is clear that, no matter what the messages are that are emerging from the EU or the White House, that more companies are taking those steps.

Those companies in the early stages of their sustainability journeys will quickly mature thanks to the proliferation of technology and expertise in the market today.

“There is an expectation in the uplift of the quality of sustainability data to finance-level, audited data,” says CTM’s head of sustainability Lauren Hook. “What this means is the need for accurate and timely data will become increasingly important for businesses at both ends of the sustainability maturity spectrum.”

While we have seen that companies are reacting to regulatory pressure more than anything else in their sustainability strategies, peer pressure is also important.

“We are seeing very significant pressure being applied by some of the largest companies in the world, in particular, Microsoft, AstraZeneca, Salesforce, Schneider Electric and Siemens [are] asking their suppliers to report on their emissions and set up their own forward-looking targets,” says Adam Braun, founder and CEO of Clarasight.

“We actually believe that added business pressure is more powerful than just the regulatory pressure. Often, we're hearing from companies who are saying we need to do more than just report on last year's emissions. We now need to set credible targets going forward and then have both a system of record and a system of action to be able to credibly achieve that goal.”

Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Aspen believes we will see more carbon budgets being used by corporates. Indeed, Concur is set to facilitate carbon budgets in its booking tool this quarter.

In May, Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Apsen told BTN Europe that it will be the first organisation to take advantage of the new capability, with “several corporates lined up for the initial rollout, including a mix of Fortune 500s.”

Aspen believes that carbon budgets at the team level will be the most popular. “How can an individual make that decision? If they think their trip is more important than their boss's trip in two months’ time they’re going to book it anyway,” he says. “There are also many places out there where there is only one flight a day. If your carbon budget says you now have to reduce your carbon by 10 per cent then that is useless information – you are going to take that one flight.”

He continues: “When you have budgets at a division level with 10,000 people, it is too impersonal. What does it matter that you are emitting one tonne of CO2 when the division still has thousands of tonnes to emit.” Teams are therefore the sweetspot where a budget is most meaningful and can truly change behaviour and thus impact.

FLYING TOWARDS 2050

Decarbonising aviation in particular will remain crucial to decarbonising business travel by 2050. The figure below shows a range of different pathways that aviation might achieve net zero by 2050. It shows scenarios outlined by IATA, ICAO, the International Council on Clean Transportation and the Air Transport Action Group.

American Express Global Business Travel’s head of sustainability, Nora Lovell Marchant, says the figures reveal that “the low-hanging fruit is basically gone” but that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), shown in green, is a major part of all these scenarios.

Operations (shown in yellow), such as using greener flight paths, and tech (in blue), like more fuel-efficient planes, make up another significant part of the emission reductions.

Carbon removal and market-based measures (light grey), such as carbon pricing in Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme, are also important in many of the scenarios. Other scenarios leave residual emissions (in dark grey) – carbon emissions that cannot be removed by other methods – that need to be offset in some other way.

CONTROLLING DEMAND

Many of the scenarios include a purple bar denoting demand impact or reduction – ie reducing the demand for business travel.

Will fewer business trips part of the solution? Our survey showed that 46 per cent of travel managers are promoting the use of virtual meeting tools instead of face-to-face travel, although few if any companies are mandating this.

Katharina Riederer, co-founder of eco.mio, says: “Obviously it's the best solution not to travel but the difficulty in our industry is that this industry exists because of travel, so reducing travel... no one really wants to push that. Also, when I do my booking, I have already decided that I have to travel and I have already got the approval.”

Nora Lovell Marchant says the pandemic showed that meetings could move to Zoom. “Now aviation traffic is growing because people know the value of business trips and putting people in front of people,” she says. “Are there some business trips that can and should be replaced with Zoom? Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever? Absolutely.”

She continues: “We need to think about how to decarbonise that... because even the most liberal non-profit organisations recognise that other types of solutions besides demand management alone will be needed in order to decarbonise aviation.”

Benjamin Park, head of travel and sustainability at Parexel, expects sustainability in business travel to become more data-driven, with increased transparency and accountability. “Emissions methodologies will evolve, and corporates will need to adopt more granular tracking and reporting,” he says.

Park also believes that employee and customer expectations will increasingly influence corporate travel programmes. “For roles requiring travel, the maturity of a company’s sustainable travel strategy may become a differentiator in talent attraction and retention,” he says.

Park adds: “While cost management remains important, we are seeing a shift toward ‘purposeful travel’ where the value of each trip is weighed against its environmental impact. This mindset helps us reduce unnecessary travel while preserving essential face-to-face patient and customer engagement.”

As Advito’s senior director of sustainability Julien Etchanchu says, in spite of delays to the full roll-out of CSRD, “at some point, we will have to travel less not just because of the environment but because at some point there will be an energy crisis.”

Could unbridled aviation growth be managed through taxes and fees that are reinvested in the industry’s pursuit of net zero? “One per cent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 per cent of aviation emissions. People want to travel. At the moment, someone travelling once every ten years is taxed in the same way as a business traveller travelling 20 times a year.

“The problem is you don’t pay for the pollution you make – that is the ultimate issue. You could imagine a frequent flyer levy where the first trip is free of tax, the second you start to increase it a bit and by trip ten you are highly taxed and ever more highly in business class. The pressure for levies will grow,” warns Etchanchu.

With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry – and wider business travel sector – is running out of time to decarbonise. While plans, policies and ideas are rife, now is the time for action.

Michael Schneider: Usually our jet fuel consumption [annually as an industry] is 300 million tonnes.
Michael Schneider: Everyone has to play its part.
Michael Schneider: I think the crux of the problem is indeed the proliferation of methodologies and calculators.
Michael Schneider: Multimodality is important and could be part of the answer but it is a very European discussion as we have a very well-developed train network.","Michael Schneider is assistant director for aviation environment at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade association for the world's airlines. It represents some 350 airlines – which account for more than 80 per cent of global air traffic – and helps formulate industry policy on critical aviation issues, including sustainability and the environment. BTN Europe's Andy Hoskins spoke to Michael Schneider in early September.

BTN Europe: IATA is committed to net zero by 2050 and you have detailed roadmaps of how the aviation industry can achieve this. But 2050 is not all that far off now – is it still achievable?

Michael Schneider: It is indeed a big challenge and it’s not so far off. If you look at the five roadmaps we have addressing different areas you might think it is very challenging and particularly if you look at SAF [Sustainable aviation fuel]. The development of SAF is absolutely critical – 65 per cent of the industry's decarbonisation will come from SAF.

What we have not seen yet is the ramping up of it [SAF production] as we would have hoped. This is due to a number of different factors – feedstock availability, the large investments that need to be made, and of course governments have to play their part too, putting in place the right environment and mechanisms to allow SAF production to scale up, and it needs to happen rapidly. We need between 5,000 and 7,000 SAF production facilities – it’s a staggering number – and a new plant can cost $1 billion so there has to be the right environment to make it happen.

But SAF is not the only contributing lever. There are technological improvements, operational improvements… every new aircraft can be between 15 and 25 per cent more fuel efficient. Then of course there are other propulsion methods – hydrogen can play a role in short-haul aviation. And then there is a remainder of CO2 emissions that we cannot reduce by deploying SAF and we need to look at CO2 removal tech.

We are still very confident that we can meet net zero 2050 conditional on those things falling into place.

BTN Europe: At 65 per cent of emission reductions, there is a heavy reliance on SAF. There are EU and UK mandates on adoption in place now, but what are the biggest challenges in driving up SAF production?

Michael Schneider: Usually our jet fuel consumption [annually as an industry] is 300 million tonnes. We will have produced 2 million tonnes [of SAF] by the end of this year, so that is not even 1 per cent of what's needed. But this will rapidly grow.

With the mandates, it’s a two-edged sword. In a way it makes those producing SAF really focus because in renewable fuel production not everything is used for SAF. Unfortunately, what we’re seeing in Europe is that compliance costs have increased. SAF has got more expensive because the mandate is on the SAF suppliers not on the airlines and they want to pass on the cost. They see an opportunity to increase the price in this way and they call it a compliance cost so we’re seeing the cost of SAF in Europe being higher than in any other part of the world. It’s concerning and it’s an effect of a mandate.

In that sense we would think maybe incentives work better and we have seen that in the US with the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] and the subsidies that have been offered to those who produce renewable fuel, and that really works well. We see the volumes there increasing rapidly. In Europe the decision was to do it via mandate and that has had a worse effect as we can see happening now. We have stats and charts on this that show how the cost per tonne of SAF has increased since the mandate was introduced.

BTN Europe: What else can governments do? What can IATA do?

Michael Schneider: Everyone has to play its part. Airlines are willing to make an investment – it’s a large investment; SAF is an expensive commodity. The profit margins [for airlines] are razor thin. We used to say it was a cup of coffee per passenger and maybe now it’s two cups of coffee because oil prices are a bit lower. But that is still not much and it does not give much room for extra investment. New aircraft models are being introduced and fleet renewal is already happening.

It is really on governments to create the right environment and the incentives to help make those steep investments in a production plant. But as long as you can make a lot of money with conventional fuels, there is a problem. A lot of subsidies, let’s be honest, don’t go into the renewable areas – it goes into the petroleum industry and fossil fuels. We’d rather see subsidies going into something linked to renewable fuels. And then of course we need governments to make it easier to build those plants by giving planning permissions and cutting the red tape.

On the technological aspect of SAF production, there are ways for established oil companies to repurpose some of their faculties to produce SAF. It is limited in terms of adding capacity but every drop of SAF that can be produced plays its part so it’s also on the oil majors to deliver. Unfortunately over the last two years we have seen some of the major producers row back.

[Editor's note: In the same week that this interview took place, news broke that Shell has cancelled the construction of a major biofuel production plant in the Netherlands due to cost concerns]

BTN Europe: In corporate travel there is sometimes confusion and scepticism around SAF. Deals are announced by airlines for SAF that doesn’t exist or is not actually supplied to or flown by that airline...

Michael Schneider: There are many commitments from airlines and these are important signals for producers. But if you’re an airline based in Kenya you don’t have direct access to SAF. However, there is SAF in the US and maybe San Francisco airport can offer it to them even though they don’t fly there, and it can be used by another airline. So you have SAF ‘book and claim’ where you can detach the environmental attribute from the product and this environmental attribute is certified and linked to proof of sustainability. You can invest in those attributes and account for them via the [IATA] SAF Registry.

It’s a seamless system that allows producers to transfer the attributes to the airline in an immutable way via the system. The airline can then decide how to reduce its offset obligation via CORSIA and put it in front of the state.

At the moment, there are clusters of SAF [production] happening in North America and in Europe, and also starting now in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, but there are still areas where not much is happening so the book and claim approach really helps. It gives everyone access [to SAF]. In the end it doesn’t matter who actually flies with that SAF; what’s important is that it’s not counted twice. The registry takes care of that.

BTN Europe: There are a large number of emissions calculators and methodologies in the market and these can produce very different estimates and cause confusion for corporates. What sets IATA’s CO2 Connect methodology apart from others?

Michael Schneider: I think the crux of the problem is indeed the proliferation of methodologies and calculators. That is certainly confusing for travellers. We realised early on that this is a major issue not just for passengers but for airlines too. If you’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the latest [fuel-efficient] aircraft and it’s not reflected in a model... then it is not fit for purpose and that’s disappointing for airlines. You want your investment reflected.

As a standard-setting organisation, we understood the problem early on. In 2016 we finalised a cargo emissions methodology and that was followed by the standard on the passenger side and here we needed to involve not only the airlines but other organisations too, such as the ISO [International Organization for Standardization]. But the difference here – and is what we strongly advocate for and it’s super important – is the use of primary data.

A lot of calculators out there use data that is based on modelled information that is often outdated and provides a crude look. But when looking at a given flight, the load factor is very important. You can have a very fuel-efficient aircraft but if it is half empty then the CO2 emissions per passenger are very high. So you need good load factor information and you need the fuel burn information, and you need to calculate the fuel consumption in a standardised way.

The idea is to have a global approach so that airlines know exactly what they’re measuring – block off, block on times; do I include the auxiliary power unit?; do we include non-revenue passengers? There’s so much detail so you need to have a very, very good understanding and a standardised approach. We need that primary data and it needs to be independently validated.

We have access to all that information and I think that’s our great strength. We are working with the airlines and they understand that we all need to work together to generate a good industry average but can also distinguish between different airlines. If you’ve invested in fleet or in SAF then that should be reflected in the calculation.

Ideally, you would get the same result [an emissions figure] across all methodologies but that is not the case at the moment. But we feel this one [CO2 Connect] is being developed by the airlines for the airlines, and for their customers, and that this is the right approach because it offers the great advantage of primary data and that is absolutely critical.

BTN Europe: How many member airlines participate currently?

Michael Schneider: Around 70 airlines have contributed fuel burn data and more than 150 have contributed operational data, meaning load factor information. We have a big target this year – we want to hit 100. I think it’s feasible; we have good traction now at alliance level. Given the time spent on this project until now, it’s been a very good result.

BTN Europe: What’s preventing more airlines from participating?

Michael Schneider: In general, airlines have always been reluctant to share sensitive data and this is extremely commercially sensitive data because it’s fuel burn information and it’s about load factor. These tell you exactly how well or how badly an airline is performing. It requires some consideration and persuasion... more and more airlines are ready to take that step.

I think a lot of airlines realise customers want emissions transparency. There is an expectation among people and especially among businesses. They need to understand what the impact of taking a flight is even more so on the corporate side. They have targets and they need to understand if they’re hitting those and how they can maybe reduce some of their impact from flying. Companies are becoming very selective in their choice of airline and they cannot do this unless they have the right data in front of them.

BTN Europe: IATA is pro-aviation expansion and you laud passenger growth and airline performance. How do you balance that with the urgent need decarbonise? That’s a difficult balancing act.

Michael Schneider: Absolutely right. In the big scheme of things we certainly contribute to global emissions – around 2.5 to 2.7 per cent – but if we want a licence to grow we must have concrete plans [to decarbonise]. Those plans are reflected in the roadmaps we have in place about what we think the solutions are.

But we should not lose sight of the benefits of aviation. There are 100 million jobs indirectly linked to the industry – it’s the guy who drives people to the airport or the small shop at the airport. It’s also small island states and countries that rely on tourism. It’s critical for them and it delivers huge value, but of course we must reduce our impact.

I love aviation and fully understand its impact and how in particular the younger generation might be concerned about flying, but they get value [from it] – it allows them to study abroad, to visit other places. No other sector delivers those benefits. It’s easy to say we should just stop flying but that would have such a huge impact on this world. It is a humongous task that we have in front of us but I’m still hopeful we can reach our targets and reduce emissions as planned by 2050.

BTN Europe: You alluded to it earlier, but will the cost of SAF and of sustainability efforts in general, get passed down to passengers in the form of higher fares?

Michael Schneider: Airlines have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – an effort that is expected to cost $4.7 trillion over the period 2024 from 2050. So yes, this is likely to impact airfares. However, this investment will ensure that aviation can deliver its direct contribution of 3.9 per cent of global GDP and 86.5 million jobs globally while addressing its estimated 2.5 per cent share of global carbon emissions.*

BTN Europe: Some governments are clamping down on domestic flights where rail services exist. Do you agree that makes good sense for the environment?

Michael Schneider: Multimodality is important and could be part of the answer but it is a very European discussion as we have a very well-developed train network. In the European context, there are opportunities that could be explored – for anything below 500km I think it makes sense to rely on what’s there [in terms of rail infrastructure]. We all need to work together where it makes sense.

BTN Europe: Every so often we see talk of frequent flyer taxes or, most recently, a premium flyer tax, where funds raised could be invested in sustainability initiatives. What are your thoughts on those?

Michael Schneider: The Global Solidarity Levies Task Force’s (GSLTF) proposal disregards the role of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which was agreed through the International Civil Aviation Organization and is the world’s first globally agreed mechanism to manage carbon emissions from an industrial sector – in this case international aviation.

In addition, the GSLTF has not released any assessment of the impact that such a levy would have on the economies of the very states to which it aims to funnel the funds, or the broader impact it will have on all travellers. It has also not detailed how such funds would be used. *

While Peter is known as a firm individual that displays the outmost professionalism and integrity, he operates on the basis of equity and fairness in all matters relating to staff, clients, passengers and the general public.

Head of Operations, Safety and Emergency

Belo Horizonte International Airport

Robson Freitas has developed and led the BH Airport plan for the resumption of airport operations post-COVID-19, as well as being responsible for leading the group of Directors and Managers at the airport, defining the three main pillars of recovery: Health and Safety of People, Institutional and Integrated Communication and Institutional Partners. These central pillars include ensuring hygiene and health and social distances measures for passengers, users, and the airport community, in addition to participating in strategic committees involving the public sectors to comply with regulatory rules. Freitas developed the COVID guardians programme, who were responsible in monitoring and following up on the measures already implemented for COVID-19 and advising users, employees and other people on compliance with distancing, hygiene and health measures recommended by health authorities. He also developed a COVID booklet with information and guidance for the airport community regarding good hygiene and health practices and led the beginning of the publication of a monthly newsletter with passenger curve information, allowing the planning of reopening and rehiring by commercial stores. Freitas also supported the reduction of OPEX by planning the temporary closure of areas, toilets and equipment in common use and internalising some activities.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

With over three decades at Zurich Airport, Emanuel Fleuti has witnessed the evolution of sustainability from a fringe concern to a core strategic pillar. As the airport’s long-serving environmental lead, he brings continuity, context and conviction to Zurich’s decarbonisation journey. He shares more with Holly Miles.

Zurich Airport’s (ZHR) environmental strategy centres on eliminating unnecessary combustion processes across the airfield. “We have fixed ground power and pre-conditioned air for aircraft, and we have battery-powered GSE and vehicles to reduce the combustion emissions,” says Emmanuel.

One of Zurich’s boldest moves, however, dates back to the mid 1990s, when it introduced an emission-related landing fee. “Aircraft that did not have the latest engine technology had to pay more on a surcharge,” he explains. “That motivated not just the airlines, but also the engine manufacturers to redesign engines and come up with cleaner technologies.”

This was a progressive move back then, as the idea of polluter-pays pricing was not widespread in aviation at the time.

“That was probably the most important initiative we took in addition to mandating the use of our TCA and 400 hertz systems that we have, which meant in return, a restriction on the use of auxiliary power units. “

While in the beginning around 50% of airlines were paying an additional surcharge, now most aircraft meet modern standards, however the principle remains. “Even the most modern aircraft still emit, so they still have to pay a little bit.”

Driving the energy transition

Zurich has committed to a master plan for energy and infrastructure decarbonisation, focusing on both consumption and production. “First, we reduce energy use on the consumer side with appliances, infrastructure, heating and cooling demand. Then we improve production with renewable energy,” says Emmanuel. “We’re switching to geothermal ground heat with heat pumps and photovoltaic plants to produce electricity.”

As of 2025, the airport is purchasing 100% renewable electricity. On the heat side, around 20% is currently sourced from renewables, with plans for continued expansion.

Crucially, Emmanuel says the economics make sense. “The upfront initial costs are going into changing fossil energy production to geothermal or heat pumps. But over time, we’ll save energy on the operational side.”

Backing breakthrough fuels

With long-haul aircraft dominating Zurich’s traffic profile, Emmanuel is realistic about the limitations of electrification and hydrogen at his airport. Instead, Zurich Airport is taking a pioneering role in backing breakthrough technologies such as solar fuels.

“We think that sustainable aviation fuels will be key for the airport’s decarbonisation. Long-haul aircraft can only fly with drop-in fuels such as SAF.”

“We are supporting the new solar-to-liquid technology. It’s a start-up company here in Switzerland,” he says. “In the new plant, Jet A1 aviation kerosene will be produced, but also diesel for trucks and petrol for cars. We’ve gone into an offtake agreement to take some of the diesel.”

Tackling scope 3 emissions

Zurich is taking a multi-pronged approach to Scope 3 emissions, from electrifying handling equipment to influencing staff travel habits.

“We are looking at ground handlers: how can we support them in their electrification process? How can we provide electric charging stations?” Emanuel says. On the staff side, Zurich offers public transport passes and encourages home working where feasible.

“Of course, not all jobs are suitable,” he acknowledges. “But if someone only commutes to work by car four days instead of five, that’s a 20% reduction.”

Electrifying the fleet

At the end of 2024, Zurich put its first electrically powered waste collection vehicle into operation. Zurich has a roadmap to reach net zero for its vehicle fleet by 2040. But it’s not always straightforward.

“We cannot accelerate this too fast because the technology has to evolve first. The main obstacle is the availability of the required vehicle types,” says Emanuel. “We’ve started with electric trucks, but snowploughs, for example, may need much longer endurance than what batteries can hold. So, we can only go as fast as suppliers can provide this technology, as it is not off-the-shelf. That’s why we’re also going into synthetic diesel to power those vehicles that cannot run on battery.”

Designing for the future

The airport is also preparing for the realities of climate change.

“Futureproofing for us is thinking ahead in longer terms, in 15 to 25 years,” says Emanuel. “It is about climate change, biodiversity and energy usage. Do we have enough sunlight? Yes, we do. Do we have enough technology to use it? No, we don’t. We need to bridge that gap.”

Juli 2025 hat die weltweite Passagierluftfahrt einen absoluten Rekordwert beim CO₂-Ausstoß erreicht. Mit 2523 Tonnen Kohlenstoffdioxid lag der Wert knapp über den 2520 Tonnen vom 2. August 2019. Allerdings waren dafür aktuell 103.009 Flüge verantwortlich, während es damals 99.327 waren. Sprich: Im Durchschnitt ist jeder einzelne Flug weniger klimaschädlich, aber es gibt fast vier Prozent mehr Flüge. Das zeigen Daten des Luftfahrt-Analyse-Anbieters Cirium.

Und der hat auch die Airlines unter die Lupe genommen. Er wählte als Einheit den CO₂-Ausstoß geteilt durch die angebotenen Sitzplatzkilometer (im Englischen Available Seat Kilometers, kurz ASK). Der wird berechnet, indem man die Zahl der verfügbaren Sitze mit den zurückgelegten Kilometern multipliziert.

Wizz Air lässt alle anderen Fluggesellschaften hinter sich

Das Ergebnis: Wizz Air erreichte im Jahr 2024 einen Wert von 53,9 Gramm CO₂ pro Sitzplatzkilometer - und ist damit die weltweite Nummer eins mit dem niedrigsten Wert von 100 untersuchten Fluglinien. Das erreichte der ungarische Billigflieger 222 Sitzen pro Flugzeug, einem Flottenalter von 5,1 Jahren und einer Streckenlänge von 1551 Kilometern, alles im Durchschnitt (siehe auch Tabelle).

Den globalen Platz zwei nimmt Frontier Airlines aus den USA ein mit 54,4 Gramm CO₂/ASK, Rang drei sichert sich die türkische Pegasus mit 57,1 Gramm. Auf Platz 20 in der Gesamtwertung liegt Ryanair mit 63,0 Gramm. Unter den zehn größten Airlines der Welt (gemessen nach Sitzplatzkilometer) erzielt die irische Airline damit sogar den besten Wert, gefolgt von Southwest Airlines (68,9) und Delta Air Lines (74,4).

Wichtigster Faktor: dichte Bestuhlung des Flugzeugs

Im regionalen Ranking für Westeuropa platziert sich auf Rang zwei hinter Wizz Air die portugiesische Azores Airlines (61,4). Auf Platz drei folgt die griechische Aegean (61,6).

Die Verwendung von nachhaltigem Flugkraftstoff, im Jargon SAF (die Abkürzung steht für Sustainable Aviation Fuel) genannt, hat Cirium in der Analyse noch nicht berücksichtigt. Das Analyseunternehmen verweist darauf, dass die derzeitige SAF-Produktion erst 0,53 Prozent des weltweiten Kraftstoffbedarfs abdeckt. «Die umweltfreundlichsten Fluggesellschaften sind womöglich diejenigen, die mutig genug sind, die Anzahl der Passagiere in einem Flugzeug zu überdenken», so Mike Malik von Cirium. Neben dem Faktor der dichten Bestuhlung sei das Flottenalter wichtig sowie die Flugplan- und Streckenplanung.

Ein Airbus A330-900 mit 459 Plätzen ist Spitzenreiter

Bei der Betrachtung einzelner Flugzeugmodelle von einzelnen Fluglinien ist auch ein neues Modell mit einer dichten Bestuhlung ganz vorn: der Airbus A330-900 von Cebu Pacific mit einer reinen Economy-Class-Bestuhlung mit 459 Plätzen. Es folgen mit der Boeing 787-8 von Jetstar und der Boeing 787-9 von Scoot zwei weitere neue Modelle. Dahinter platzieren sich aber auch etliche ältere Modelle wie beispielsweise der Airbus A319 von Allegiant Air. Diesen Teil der Untersuchung hat Cirium mit Daten aus der ersten Jahreshälfte 2025 durchgeführt.

Einen Punkt nennt Cirium nicht explizit, obwohl er in einer der Ranglisten eine wichtige Rolle spielt: die geringere Umweltbelastung von Turbopropantrieben gegenüber Jettriebwerken. Denn es gibt auch eine Analyse für einzelne Routen, aufgeteilt in Kurz-, Mittel- und Langstrecken. Dabei geht es um die größten Verbesserungen von 2023 auf 2024.

Austrian Airlines auf Platz eins - dank ATR 72 von Braathens

Und bei den Kurzstrecken auf Platz eins liegt die Austrian-Airlines-Route zwischen Wien und Klagenfurt. Ihr CO₂ pro Sitzplatzkilometer-Wert ist um 29,7 Prozent gesunken. Statt den eigenen Embraer E195 setzt die Lufthansa-Tochter auf der Strecke mittlerweile nämlich die ATR 72 von Braathens ein.

Mit einer Verbesserung von 27,1 Prozent steht auf Platz zwei die Verbindung zwischen Belo Horizonte-Confins und Ilhéus von Azul.

Takeaway:

(CTAS) faces a weak technical outlook amid mixed analyst views and solid fundamentals. Investors are advised to proceed with caution.

News Highlights

Recent news affecting the broader market includes developments in the fuel ethanol industry, where new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology is boosting commercial viability. This could indirectly benefit Cintas if demand for industrial services in energy and logistics grows. Additionally, a report highlights that assets in the ETF industry across Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) have hit a record high of $1.25 trillion. While not directly tied to Cintas, this reflects increased market participation and liquidity that may influence investor sentiment.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The market is divided when it comes to Cintas. The simple average analyst rating is 3.00, while the weighted rating—factoring in historical performance—is 4.30. These scores suggest a generally neutral to optimistic view, though the current price trend is negative (-3.65%), creating a mismatch between analyst expectations and actual price movement.

Return on Assets (ROA): 4.79%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Net Income / Revenue: 55.86%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Return on Equity (ROE): 10.45%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 17.51%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Diluted Earnings Per Share (YoY): 19.67%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

The strong fundamentals suggest Cintas is performing well on operational and earnings metrics, but technical indicators remain bearish. Investors should watch for alignment or divergence between these two signals in the coming weeks.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows into Cintas show a complex picture. While overall inflow ratio is 55.90% (a positive sign), the breakdown reveals that small investors are net sellers (trend: negative). In contrast, large and extra-large investors are net buyers, with block inflow ratio at 56.65% and extra-large inflow ratio at 62.30%. This suggests institutional confidence in the stock despite retail caution.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Cintas is struggling. The technical score is 3.94, indicating a weak signal with a bearish bias. Here’s how the key indicators stack up:

Williams %R (WR) Oversold: Internal diagnostic score 3.73 — suggesting a neutral rise with mixed historical returns.

Bearish Engulfing: Internal diagnostic score 1.47 — a strong bearish signal with a 36.36% win rate.

RSI Oversold: Internal diagnostic score 6.62 — neutral with a better track record than WR.

In the last five days, the Bearish Engulfing and WR Oversold patterns appeared most frequently. These signals confirm a dominant bearish trend (2 bearish vs 0 bullish indicators). Investors should be cautious about short-term volatility and consider avoiding or hedging long positions until a clearer trend emerges.

""We must acknowledge that the country still doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for building a real aviation industry,"" he emphasized.
The call for an aviation industry blueprint Uong Viet Dung, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, noted that Vietnam now has 14 commercial and specialized airlines operating 254 aircraft.
Vietnam’s low labor costs, ongoing shifts in the global aviation supply chain, and the rise of green aviation technology, sustainable fuels, and workforce training offer strategic advantages.
""Vietnam needs to define its aviation industry and short-term development strategies, while forming aviation and logistics centers,"" he said.","At the roundtable conference “From Aspiration to Opportunity in Developing the Aviation Industry” held last week at the National Exhibition Center, Tran Hai Dang, CEO of Aviation Engineering Services Corporation (AESC), said Vietnam possesses significant advantages - strategic location, skilled technical labor, and an attractive investment climate - that position it well for deeper integration into the global aviation supply chain.

Despite this, Dang admitted Vietnam’s role in the aviation industry remains ""modest and unclear."" While a few domestic companies have started manufacturing airframe components and conducting engine testing, their output is minimal and insufficient to build a complete aviation ecosystem.

Currently, only about five Vietnamese companies are producing limited airframe parts. In engine manufacturing, only an initial testing program exists. And in vital sectors such as aviation electronics, materials, rubber, or specialized coatings, Vietnamese firms are nearly absent.

More critically, Dang pointed out that Vietnam lacks a unified national program for aircraft development. Only scattered initiatives exist, without a cohesive strategy. ""We must acknowledge that the country still doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for building a real aviation industry,"" he emphasized.

Lagging in MRO and infrastructure

In aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), Vietnam has only two key facilities - Vietnam Airlines and AESC. Other players remain small-scale, operating without the infrastructure or credentials required for true MRO status. These were market-driven developments rather than the result of national planning.

Dang noted that Vietnam's industry continues to focus heavily on basic manufacturing, neglecting infrastructure and technology investment. Without change, Vietnam will remain stuck in low-value segments and be unable to join the global supply chain.

One stark example: Vietnam cannot yet produce a bolt worth $100 used on commercial aircraft wheels - a component that could feasibly be manufactured with a $3–4 million USD investment in facilities. “It’s not about capability - it’s about commitment,” Dang said.

Certification remains a major barrier

To participate meaningfully in global aviation, Vietnamese companies need certification from major regulatory bodies, including IATA, FAA (US), EASA (Europe), and AS9100. However, Dang cautioned that securing such credentials is costly, time-consuming, and offers uncertain returns on investment.

He proposed a collaborative ecosystem, where domestic aviation businesses pool resources, share certifications, and avoid redundant competition. ""We need a national aircraft development program with a core nucleus and a satellite network of supporting enterprises,"" he urged.

The call for an aviation industry blueprint

Uong Viet Dung, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, noted that Vietnam now has 14 commercial and specialized airlines operating 254 aircraft. This figure is projected to reach 400 modern planes by 2030. Vietnam’s aviation network includes 52 domestic routes and 211 international routes, fueling robust demand and creating opportunities for local manufacturing and supply.

Vietnam’s low labor costs, ongoing shifts in the global aviation supply chain, and the rise of green aviation technology, sustainable fuels, and workforce training offer strategic advantages. According to Dung, these can support Vietnam in becoming a major aviation hub in the region.

""Vietnam needs to define its aviation industry and short-term development strategies, while forming aviation and logistics centers,"" he said. ""We should aim to integrate into global OEMs like Boeing and Airbus, and one day, realize the dream of a 'Made-in-Vietnam' aircraft.""

National innovation agency calls for coordinated action

A representative from the National Innovation Center (NIC) emphasized the need for a comprehensive aerospace industry strategy, including improved coordination between government agencies and businesses, and greater investment in R&D and infrastructure.

Other proposals included:

Deloitte Nederland heeft over het boekjaar 2024/2025 een omzet gerealiseerd van € 1,41 miljard, een groei van 1,2 procent ten opzichte van het voorgaande boekjaar. Door strikter kostenbeheer en operationele efficiëntie kwam het operationeel resultaat ruim 15 procent hoger uit op € 202,1 miljoen, tegenover € 175,3 miljoen in 2023/2024. Het aantal medewerkers daalde tegelijk van 8.200 naar 7.700.

Dat blijkt uit het Integrated Annual Report van Deloitte Nederland. Volgens ceo Hans Honig is ervoor gekozen om ""strikt op kostenreductie te sturen"" en tegelijk te investeren in innovatie, technologie en talent. ""Zo breidden we het gebruik van ons mondiale technologie platformen voor al onze business lines uit en zetten we vol door in gebruik van AI oplossingen in onze dienstverlening."" Deloitte ziet klantvragen steeds meer verschuiven naar ""complete technologisch gedreven business transformaties"".

Examenfraude

Het interne onderzoek naar examenfraude, door Deloitte omschreven als ""het delen van antwoorden voor verplichte leeractiviteiten en de leercultuur"", is afgelopen boekjaar afgesloten met een schikking bij de PCAOB. In juni jl. werd bekend dat Deloitte de Amerikaanse toezichthouder een bedrag heeft betaald van drie miljoen dollar.

""De uitkomsten van het onderzoek naar onze leercultuur waren teleurstellend en weerspiegelen niet wie wij zijn als organisatie en de waarden die wij nastreven."" aldus Honig.

Topic: Interior of the earth

Q1. Plate boundaries are theatres of both catastrophe and creation. How do they simultaneously account for the destructive forces of earthquakes and the constructive potential of volcanic landscapes? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: InsightsIAS

Why the question

To test conceptual clarity on plate tectonics, their paradoxical role in shaping the earth’s surface, and the ability to link hazards like earthquakes with constructive features like fertile soils and volcanic landforms.

Key Demand of the question

The answer must evaluate how plate boundaries embody both destruction and creation, and explain with examples how they account for the dual realities of earthquakes and volcanic landscapes.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Define plate boundaries as dynamic zones of tectonic activity that represent both risk and renewal.

Body

Plate boundaries as paradoxical theatres – explain their dual role with geological processes and settlement patterns.

Destructive forces of earthquakes – highlight mechanisms, impacts, and examples of boundary-linked seismicity.

Constructive potential of volcanic landscapes – show fertility, resources, energy, and socio-economic benefits linked to volcanism.

Conclusion

End with the duality of plate boundaries as both threats and opportunities, stressing disaster resilience and sustainable use.

Introduction

Plate boundaries are the most active zones of lithospheric interaction, where immense tectonic forces unleash catastrophic disasters yet simultaneously build fertile and resource-rich landscapes. They reveal the paradox of nature as both a destroyer and a creator of human opportunities.

Body

Plate boundaries as theatres of both catastrophe and creation

Dynamic tectonic activity: Boundaries are hotspots for mountain building, ocean trench formation, volcanism, and seismicity, combining destructive and creative processes in the same space.

Eg: The Himalayas, created by the collision of Indian and Eurasian plates, exemplify majestic uplift but also host devastating quakes like Nepal 2015.

Redistribution of resources and hazards: Magmatic activity enriches land with minerals, soils, and geothermal energy, even as seismic instability threatens long-term human settlements.

Eg: Pacific Ring of Fire, with its vast gold–copper deposits, is simultaneously the site of 90% of global earthquakes.

Continuous reshaping of landscapes: Divergent and convergent boundaries constantly create new islands, rift valleys, and trenches, but such changes often come with destructive hazards.

Eg: East African Rift Valley is splitting Africa and forming a proto-ocean, yet recurrent tremors displace local communities.

Human–environment paradox: Rich resources and fertile soils attract dense populations to these boundaries despite recurrent natural calamities.

Eg: Java island, Indonesia, sustains over 140 million people due to fertile volcanic soils but also faces eruptions like Mount Merapi in 2010.

Destructive forces of earthquakes

Sudden crustal rupture: Stress accumulation along convergent and transform boundaries results in massive quakes that cause widespread casualties and destruction.

Eg: 2015 Nepal earthquake (M 7.8) killed over 8,000 people and destroyed heritage structures like Kathmandu Durbar Square.

Megathrust subduction events: Oceanic plates diving beneath continental margins generate tsunamigenic earthquakes of unprecedented scale.

Eg: 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake (M 9.1) triggered the Indian Ocean tsunami, killing 230,000 across 14 countries.

Urban vulnerability and poor preparedness: High population density and weak construction norms at plate boundaries magnify disaster impacts.

Eg: 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake caused more than 50,000 deaths largely due to collapsed buildings in urban centres.

Cascading multi-hazards: Earthquakes often trigger landslides, liquefaction, and technological disasters, compounding the destruction.

Eg: 2011 Tōhoku earthquake (M 9.0) not only caused a tsunami but also led to the Fukushima nuclear accident.

Constructive potential of volcanic landscapes

Fertile agricultural soils: Weathering of volcanic rocks releases minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iron, supporting intensive agriculture for centuries.

Eg: Deccan Plateau black soils continue to sustain cotton and soybean cultivation, contributing significantly to India’s farm economy.

Renewable geothermal energy: Heat from magma chambers beneath volcanic zones is harnessed to produce reliable, clean, and low-carbon electricity.

Eg: Iceland generates around 25% of its power from geothermal resources, reducing fossil fuel dependence.

Mineral and ore wealth: Volcanic processes bring up valuable metals and rare earths essential for modern industries and global supply chains.

Eg: Chile’s Andean volcanic belt accounts for nearly 28% of the world’s copper production, vital for renewable technologies.

Tourism and cultural heritage: Volcanic landscapes create iconic sites that draw tourism, sustain economies, and inspire cultural identity.

Eg: Mount Fuji, Japan, a UNESCO World Heritage site, generates billions annually through religious tourism and eco-tourism.

Conclusion

Plate boundaries embody the creative–destructive duality of Earth’s geology: they devastate societies through quakes yet enrich them through fertile soils, minerals, and energy. With disaster-resilient planning and sustainable resource use, humanity can convert these risky frontiers into engines of long-term prosperity.

Himalayan events such as the Joshimath subsidence and South Lhonak GLOF show how internal tectonics, external erosional forces, and climate change combine to shape fragile mountain landscapes.

Key demand of the question

The question asks to differentiate between endogenic and exogenic processes, illustrate their combined role in Himalayan landform development, and analyse the impact of climate change on these geomorphic processes.

Structure of the Answer

Introduction

Start with a brief line on the Himalayas being the youngest fold mountains formed by tectonics, yet constantly reshaped by external denudational forces, now increasingly altered by climate change.

Body

Define and contrast endogenic and exogenic processes, highlighting their forces, nature, and outcomes with suitable Himalayan examples.

Show how their interaction produces distinct Himalayan landforms such as river terraces, gorges, glacial valleys, and sediment transfer to the plains.

Analyse how climate change is intensifying geomorphic processes through glacial retreat, extreme rainfall, GLOFs, and permafrost thaw, using updated recent events.

Conclusion

Conclude with a crisp futuristic note on integrating geomorphic risk mapping and climate-adaptive planning into Himalayan development policies.

Introduction

The Himalayas stand as the most vivid testimony to the interaction of internal tectonic forces and external denudational forces. This makes them not just the tallest mountains but also the most fragile, where climate change has begun to accelerate geomorphic instability.

Body

Endogenic and exogenic processes

Aspect Endogenic processes Exogenic processes 1. Driving force Operate through internal heat and tectonic dynamics, causing mountain uplift, folding and volcanism.

Eg: The 2015 Nepal earthquake uplifted land surfaces, proving ongoing tectonic collision Operate through external agents like water, wind, and ice, wearing down relief and redistributing sediments.

Eg: The 2022 Alaknanda floods eroded slopes rapidly as reported by IIT Roorkee 2. Key landforms Create large-scale features such as fold mountains, faults, and volcanic arcs, altering earth’s crust.

Eg: USGS (2023) noted Himalayan uplift of 5 mm/yr due to Indian–Eurasian plate convergence Produce erosional and depositional landforms such as gorges, terraces, moraines, dunes.

Eg: The Bhagirathi gorge was carved by river incision over thousands of years 3. Timescale Work on long geological time spans, shaping continents and ocean basins.

Eg: Himalayan orogeny has continued for ~50 million years since the Eocene Function on shorter timescales, even seasonal, reshaping landforms more visibly.

Eg: Cloudburst-induced landslides in Himachal Pradesh in 2023 reshaped valleys overnight 4. Nature of impact Primarily constructive, adding elevation, creating relief, and forming new crust.

Eg: Ongoing crustal thickening beneath Nepal Himalaya adds height Primarily destructive, wearing down elevated surfaces and transporting debris.

Eg: Brahmaputra river floods erode banks and shift channels annually (CWC 2021) 5. Methods of study Studied via seismology, geodesy, paleomagnetism, and mantle modelling.

Eg: GPS monitoring in Uttarakhand (WIHG 2022) mapped tectonic strain zones Studied via hydrology, geomorphology, satellite imagery, and climate data.

Eg: ISRO (2021) tracked Himalayan glacier retreat using remote sensing

Combined impact in shaping Himalayan landforms

Steep slopes and slope failure: Continuous tectonic uplift combined with intense erosion produces fragile, over-steepened slopes highly prone to mass wasting.

Eg: Joshimath land subsidence in 2023 demonstrated how uplift plus unregulated drainage destabilised hill slopes.

River terraces and valley incision: Uplifted blocks are cut by Himalayan rivers into stepped terraces, marking interaction of endogenics and fluvial incision.

Eg: Teesta valley terraces in Sikkim show alternating phases of uplift and incision.

Glacio-fluvial landscapes: Endogenic elevation sustains high snowlines while glaciers and rivers carve cirques, moraines, and outwash plains.

Eg: Retreating Gangotri glacier has left morainic ridges and expanding pro-glacial lakes.

Sediment flux to plains: High uplift accelerates erosion, delivering enormous sediment to the Indo-Gangetic plain, enriching soils but also causing instability.

Eg: Brahmaputra’s sediment load ~735 million tonnes annually (CWC 2021) sustains fertile Assam plains but raises flood risks.

Drainage anomalies: Structural control due to uplift forces rivers to cut through ranges, while exogenics modify flow regimes.

Eg: Indus river cutting gorges across Ladakh ranges reflects tectonic uplift modified by glacial-melt erosion.

Impact of climate change on geomorphic processes

Accelerated glacier retreat: Warming reduces glacier mass balance, enhancing moraine collapse and destabilising slopes.

Eg: IPCC AR6 (2021) warned Himalayan glaciers could lose up to 80% volume by 2100, amplifying hazards.

Extreme monsoon erosion: Intensified rainfall increases soil stripping, landslides, and river channel migration.

Eg: 2023 Himachal floods triggered hundreds of landslides, destroying roads and altering river courses.

Permafrost degradation: High-altitude warming thaws frozen ground, releasing rock and debris flows.

Eg: WIHG 2022 study linked Karakoram slope failures to permafrost thawing.

Glacial lake outburst floods: Retreating glaciers create unstable moraine-dammed lakes prone to catastrophic bursts.

Eg: South Lhonak lake GLOF in Sikkim (2023) devastated Teesta valley infrastructure.

Human-climate interaction: Infrastructure projects in fragile terrain amplify climate impacts on geomorphic stability.

Eg: Char Dham highway expansion deepened cracks and landslides during the 2021–22 monsoon season in Uttarakhand.

Conclusion

The Himalayas are shaped by the push of tectonics, the pull of erosion, and the pressure of climate change. A sustainable way forward lies in geomorphic risk mapping, climate-adaptive planning, and resilient infrastructure, balancing development with mountain stability.

Q3. “Extending Sixth Schedule to Ladakh may set a precedent for other regions demanding special autonomy”. Do you agree? Substantiate with examples from other tribal autonomy experiments in India. (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: NIE

Why the question

The issue of Ladakh’s demand for Sixth Schedule status has revived debates on asymmetric federalism and its ripple effect on other regions. It links to ongoing questions of tribal autonomy, constitutional design, and Centre–State dynamics.

Key Demand of the question

The question asks you to critically analyse whether granting Sixth Schedule status to Ladakh could become a precedent for other regions, and to substantiate both sides using examples from other tribal autonomy experiments in India.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Start with the idea of India’s asymmetric federalism and how Sixth Schedule was crafted to protect tribal autonomy in the North-East. Mention its relevance to Ladakh.

Body

Arguments why Ladakh extension may set precedent – reference to doctrinal spillover, political bargaining, and examples from Bodoland, Tripura, Meghalaya.

Counter-arguments why precedent fears are overstated – uniqueness of Sixth Schedule, availability of alternatives like PESA/Article 371, and case studies such as Darjeeling Bill withdrawal.

Conclusion

End with a balanced note: while it may become a political reference point, extension will remain selective, contextual, and criteria-based to preserve unity in diversity.

Introduction

India’s federal system embodies asymmetrical arrangements to accommodate diversity, from the Sixth Schedule for the North-East to Article 371 special provisions for frontier states. Any extension of such status to Ladakh is bound to influence debates on autonomy in other regions.

Body

Why it may set a precedent

Doctrinal spillover under Article 244(2): Extending the Sixth Schedule to Ladakh could legitimise demands by other regions seeking legislative and judicial autonomy through Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).

Eg: The Bodoland Territorial Region (2020 Accord) expanded Sixth Schedule powers, setting a precedent for other tribal belts.

Frontier governance template: Success in Ladakh may push other sensitive border regions to claim similar cultural-ecological autonomy.

Eg: Khasi, Garo and Jaintia ADCs (Meghalaya) protect land and forests; tribal groups in Himachal and Uttarakhand may cite this precedent.

Electoral bargaining benchmark: Political parties may cite Ladakh as proof that persistent agitation yields autonomy gains, fuelling fresh movements.

Eg: Tripura’s TTAADC elections repeatedly invoke the powers enjoyed by BTC/BTR to demand enhanced status.

Judicial reinforcement of tribal rights: Supreme Court rulings have favoured stronger protection for tribal land and culture, making Sixth Schedule extension attractive elsewhere.

Eg: Samatha case (1997) and Niyamgiri judgment (2013) upheld tribal land rights and Gram Sabha consent, emboldening autonomy demands.

Financial empowerment of ADCs: Sixth Schedule recognition ensures Finance Commission grants and special Union transfers, incentivising replication.

Eg: 15th Finance Commission allocated funds directly to ADCs in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura.

Why precedent fears are overstated

Sixth Schedule’s unique design: It was crafted specifically for North-Eastern tribes with codified customary laws, not easily replicable elsewhere.

Eg: Mizoram’s Lai, Mara, Chakma ADCs evolved from entrenched tribal institutions; most other regions lack such traditions.

Alternative autonomy mechanisms: Fifth Schedule, PESA 1996, and Article 371 provisions offer tailored protections without invoking the Sixth Schedule.

Eg: Gorkhaland GTA (West Bengal) and Manipur Hill Areas Committee function outside Sixth Schedule.

Parliamentary and political gatekeeping: Any extension requires constitutional amendment and consensus, preventing mechanical replication.

Eg: The 2007 Darjeeling Sixth Schedule Bill was withdrawn due to stakeholder opposition.

Judicial scrutiny of proportionality: Courts ensure autonomy does not dilute the basic structure of federalism, limiting overextension.

Eg: S.R. Bommai (1994) upheld balanced federalism, warning against structural overreach.

Security–governance calibration: The Union tailors autonomy to specific contexts like insurgency, demography, or ecology.

Eg: Nagaland (Art 371A) and Mizoram (Art 371G) safeguard tribal customs without Sixth Schedule expansion.

Conclusion

While Ladakh’s inclusion could serve as a political precedent, constitutional design, parliamentary scrutiny, and available graded alternatives ensure that diffusion remains selective, contextual, and criteria-driven. The challenge is to balance autonomy with national cohesion, ensuring asymmetry strengthens, not fragments, Indian federalism.

Q5. “Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms.” Examine the challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system. Discuss how farmer cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) can strengthen the value chain. (15 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: TH

Why the question

Horticulture now surpasses food grain production in India, yet post-harvest losses and weak marketing reduce farmer gains. Current policy shifts emphasise value chain development, making marketing reforms.

Key Demand of the question

The question requires you to establish the importance of marketing reforms vis-à-vis production, identify the challenges in horticultural marketing, and then highlight how farmer cooperatives and FPOs can provide systemic solutions.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Begin with India’s horticultural achievements and the paradox of high output but low farmer income due to marketing inefficiencies.

Body –

Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms: Link to farmer income stability, price discovery, and global competitiveness.

Challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system: Infrastructure gaps, fragmented value chains, regulatory hurdles, grading/quality issues, and financial constraints.

Role of cooperatives and FPOs: Aggregation for bargaining power, collective infrastructure management, direct linkages to markets and exports, branding, and access to institutional finance.

Conclusion

End with the need for a holistic horticulture policy where production, post-harvest management, and marketing move in tandem to ensure inclusive farmer prosperity.

Introduction

India is the world’s second-largest producer of fruits and vegetables, yet post-harvest losses are estimated at ₹50,000 crore annually (NITI Aayog 2023) due to weak marketing and storage. Without robust marketing reforms, production growth cannot translate into farmer income security or consumer affordability.

Body

Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms

Linking surplus to demand: Production gains are futile without channels to reach markets efficiently.

Eg: National Horticulture Board data (2023) shows 25–30% losses in perishables due to marketing bottlenecks.

Price discovery and fair returns: Marketing reforms ensure transparent markets through digital platforms, reducing distress sales.

Eg: e-NAM (2016) integrated over 1,300 mandis for horticultural produce.

Stability against volatility: Reforms like contract farming and futures trading help hedge risks in price-sensitive horticultural crops.

Eg: Model APMC Act (2017) recommended direct marketing and electronic trading.

Export competitiveness: Global markets demand quality and supply consistency, which requires integrated logistics and certification systems.

Eg: India’s mango exports rose after adoption of irradiation and cold-chain compliance (APEDA report, 2022).

Reducing middlemen exploitation: Strengthening marketing reforms reduces farmer dependence on commission agents.

Eg: Swaminathan Commission (2006) emphasised linking farmers directly to consumers.

Challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system

Infrastructure deficit: Lack of packhouses, cold chains, and reefer vans increases wastage and reduces quality.

Eg: ICAR (2022) notes only 10% of perishables use cold chain facilities.

Fragmented value chains: Smallholders face high transaction costs and weak bargaining power.

Eg: Dalwai Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (2018) flagged market fragmentation as a key hurdle.

APMC restrictions: State-level regulations often limit farmers’ ability to sell directly outside mandis.

Eg: Punjab’s horticulture farmers face restrictions in accessing markets beyond APMC yards.

Quality and grading gaps: Lack of standardisation reduces competitiveness in both domestic and export markets.

Eg: FAO (2021) highlighted poor adoption of AGMARK standards in fruits and vegetables.

Limited access to credit and insurance: Marketing investments require credit support, which many farmers lack.

Eg: RBI Report (2023) shows only 16% of horticulture farmers accessed formal credit for marketing infrastructure.

Role of farmer cooperatives and FPOs in strengthening the value chain

Collective bargaining power: Aggregation helps farmers negotiate better prices and reduce exploitation by intermediaries.

Eg: AMUL dairy cooperative model shows how aggregation can transform farmer incomes.

Efficient post-harvest management: FPOs can manage packhouses, grading, cold storage, and logistics collectively.

Eg: Sahyadri FPC in Maharashtra runs India’s largest farmer-led grape export operation.

Market linkages and branding: Cooperatives can establish direct retail chains and export contracts.

Eg: HOPCOMS in Karnataka supplies fresh produce directly to consumers in urban areas.

Capacity building and training: FPOs provide extension services and training in quality, grading, and packaging.

Eg: SFAC-supported FPOs have trained farmers in residue-free vegetable cultivation.

Financial inclusion and investment mobilisation: Cooperatives and FPOs enable access to institutional credit and attract private partnerships.

Eg: 10,000 FPO Scheme (2020) launched by GoI to provide equity grants and credit guarantee.

Conclusion

Without marketing reforms, horticultural growth risks being a surplus trap rather than a prosperity engine. Empowered cooperatives and FPOs can bridge the missing link by integrating farmers into value chains, reducing losses, and enhancing global competitiveness, making Indian horticulture both profitable and sustainable.

Topic: Conservation, environmental pollution

Q6. What are the pollution challenges associated with India’s expanding aviation sector? How effective can sustainable aviation fuel policy be in addressing them? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: DTE

Why the question

Aviation emissions are rising sharply in India, and a national SAF policy is being framed to address both climate and pollution concerns.

Key demand of the question

The candidate must identify the pollution challenges of the aviation sector and then critically evaluate the effectiveness of SAF policy in addressing them.

Structure of the Answer

Introduction

Give a brief context on India’s aviation growth and its link to rising emissions, with reference to Net Zero 2070.

Body

Pollution challenges: Mention carbon emissions, non-CO₂ pollutants, contrails, local air quality concerns, and health impacts.

Effectiveness of SAF policy: Highlight its emission reduction potential, alignment with CORSIA, energy diversification, policy synergies, and trade/export prospects.

Conclusion

Close with a forward-looking line on SAF being a transitional but crucial pathway to green aviation leadership for India.

Introduction

Aviation, though a fast-growing sector in India, contributes disproportionately to GHG emissions and local air pollution, making it a critical area for climate policy intervention.

Body

Pollution challenges of aviation sector

Carbon emissions: Aviation is responsible for around 2-3% of India’s total CO₂ emissions and growing rapidly with passenger demand.

Eg: DGCA report 2023 shows India’s aviation emissions grew by nearly 30% over five years.

Non-CO₂ pollutants: Aircraft release NOx, SOx, and particulate matter, worsening air quality around airports.

Eg: IIT Kanpur 2022 study found elevated PM2.5 levels around Delhi airport due to aviation activity.

High climate forcing: Contrails and water vapour increase radiative forcing, amplifying aviation’s climate impact beyond CO₂.

Eg: IPCC AR6 (2021) highlights non-CO₂ impacts as nearly double the warming effect of CO₂ alone.

Rising fuel dependence: Heavy reliance on fossil-based ATF aggravates energy insecurity and locks in polluting infrastructure.

Eg: India imported 85% of crude oil in 2024 (MoPNG data).

Urban health risks: Expansion of aviation hubs adds to urban air pollution load, increasing health risks for local populations.

Eg: WHO 2023 report flagged higher respiratory illness among communities near large airports globally.

Effectiveness of sustainable aviation fuel policy

Emission reduction potential: SAF can cut 65–80% lifecycle CO₂ emissions compared to ATF if sustainably sourced.

Eg: Deloitte India 2024 report estimated 20–25 MT CO₂ reduction annually by FY40 with SAF.

Compliance with global standards: Supports India’s obligations under CORSIA (mandatory after 2027) and enhances global aviation competitiveness.

Eg: ICAO CORSIA framework requires carbon-neutral growth from 2027.

Energy diversification: SAF reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels and supports domestic ethanol and biomass value chains.

Eg: India’s 18.25 billion litre ethanol capacity (Food Ministry 2025) can partly support SAF blending.

Policy synergy: Alignment with National Biofuel Policy 2018 and incentives under schemes like Gobardhan can boost investment.

Eg: NITI Aayog 2025 consultations proposed SAF reclassification under bioenergy to access subsidies.

Export and trade potential: SAF adoption positions India as a supplier in global markets, aiding energy diplomacy and green trade.

Eg: Brazil and US already benchmarked sugarcane/corn-based SAF under CORSIA, India’s LCA study (TERI 2025) is in progress.

Conclusion

India’s aviation sector risks becoming a significant pollution hotspot, but a comprehensive SAF policy backed by strong incentives and global alignment can transform this challenge into an opportunity for green leadership by 2030.

Q7. Public life demands a higher threshold of accountability than private life. In light of criminal charges against elected representatives, critically examine this statement. How should democratic institutions uphold ethical conduct in politics? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: TH

Why the question

The case of criminal charges against elected representatives raises the issue of higher ethical accountability in politics and the role of institutions in safeguarding democratic values.

Key Demand of the question

The question asks you to critically examine why public life requires greater ethical accountability compared to private life, and to suggest how democratic institutions can uphold ethical conduct in politics.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Briefly highlight why public office carries greater moral responsibility, linking it with trust and legitimacy.

Body –

Explain why public life demands higher ethical standards using ethics frameworks (duty, virtue, social contract, public trust).

Suggest how institutions like judiciary, ECI, political parties, and citizens can strengthen ethical conduct in politics through reforms and transparency.

Conclusion

End with a futuristic note on transforming democracy from legal compliance to moral governance.

Introduction

When entrusted with public office, individuals are not only decision-makers but also moral exemplars. The ethical threshold is higher in public life because lapses here affect not just personal reputation but the collective conscience and democratic trust of society.

Body

Higher threshold of accountability in public life

Deontological ethics: Leaders have a duty-bound responsibility to act rightly irrespective of consequences, as per Kantian principles.

Eg: Mahatma Gandhi’s insistence on moral leadership highlighted politics as an extension of ethics.

Virtue ethics: Citizens expect qualities like integrity, courage, and prudence in their representatives, making private–public standards inherently different.

Eg: Plato’s philosopher-king ideal illustrates that rulers must embody higher virtues.

Public trust doctrine: Holding office creates a fiduciary obligation; betrayal through criminal conduct amounts to moral harm to citizens.

Eg: Justice Krishna Iyer often stressed that public life is a “sacred trust.”

Consequentialist reasoning: The ripple effect of unethical acts in public life is far greater, influencing governance quality and societal morality.

Eg: Nirbhaya case protests (2012) showed how failures of political leadership erode faith in justice.

Social contract ethics: By entering politics, individuals tacitly agree to uphold higher standards as part of the social contract with citizens.

Eg: Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s contract theory highlights that authority rests on moral legitimacy.

Upholding ethical conduct through institutions

Institutional integrity: Election Commission, judiciary, and Parliament must operate with impartiality to safeguard probity in politics.

Eg: SC in Public Interest Foundation (2018) pressed parties to disclose candidates’ criminal backgrounds.

Ethical codes and training: Developing codes of conduct and value-based training for legislators rooted in ethics, not just legal compliance.

Eg: Nolan Committee (UK, 1995) articulated “Seven Principles of Public Life” (integrity, accountability, selflessness).

Transparency and openness: Embedding accountability through RTI and citizen charters aligns with ethical governance values like honesty and openness.

Eg: RTI exposures of MPLADS misuse (2021) demonstrated citizen-driven ethical oversight.

Role of civic virtue: Citizens and civil society must demand ethical politics to create bottom-up pressure on parties and institutions.

Eg: ADR’s electoral awareness campaigns empower voters to reject tainted candidates.

Restorative justice approaches: Ethics in politics must also encourage atonement, remorse, and correction, not only punitive justice.

Eg: Practices like truth and reconciliation commissions globally highlight ethical accountability alongside legal measures.

Conclusion

Ethics in public life is not about avoiding crime but embodying values of integrity, fairness, and justice. Only when institutions and citizens demand higher ethical standards will democracy progress from legal compliance to moral governance.

„Tai svarbus žingsnis aviacijos sektoriaus dekarbonizacijos link. Įtraukdami SAF į komercinį pasiūlymą, suteikiame oro bendrovėms ir keleiviams galimybę rinktis tvaresnes keliones bei kartu prisidėti prie Europos Sąjungos klimato tikslų įgyvendinimo. Tai reiškia, kad nuo rugsėjo vidurio iš Baltijos šalių oro uostų pakilę orlaiviai bus varomi degalais su tvarios kilmės komponentu“, – sako „ORLEN Lietuva“ Vidaus didmeninės prekybos direktorius Tomas Abromavičius.

SAF gaminamas iš atsinaujinančių ar atliekinių žaliavų, tokių kaip naudotas kepimo aliejus, pramonės bei žemės ūkio atliekos. Maišomas su tradiciniais reaktyviniais degalais, jis yra visiškai suderinamas su esamais orlaivių varikliais, todėl oro bendrovės gali jį naudoti iš karto, be papildomų technologinių pokyčių. Naudojant SAF, per visą gyvavimo ciklą CO₂ emisijas galima sumažinti iki 94 proc., palyginti su įprastais aviaciniais degalais.

Šiuo metu ORLEN importuoja SAF komponentus – dalis jų pagaminta Roterdame (Nyderlanduose), kita dalis – Singapūre. 2025 m. yra pirmieji metai, kai SAF Europoje plačiai naudojamas komerciniais tikslais, nebe vien eksperimentinėse programose. Degalais galės naudotis visos oro bendrovės, skraidančios iš Vilniaus, Rygos ir Talino oro uostų.

Pradėjusi tiekti SAF, ORLEN taip pat įgyvendina ES reglamento „ReFuelEU Aviation“ reikalavimus. Pagal jį nuo 2025 m. tvarūs aviaciniai degalai turi sudaryti mažiausiai 2 proc. visų parduodamų aviacinių degalų. Reglamentas taikomas tiems Europos Sąjungos oro uostams, kurie per ankstesnius metus aptarnavo daugiau kaip 800 tūkst. keleivių arba 100 tūkst. tonų krovinių. Ši iniciatyva padeda ruoštis ir tolesniems tikslams – iki 2030 m. SAF dalis turi siekti 6 proc., o iki 2050 m. – net 70 proc.

ORLEN grupė SAF tiekimą pradėjo dar šių metų liepą Varšuvos, Krokuvos ir Katovicų oro uostuose. Tuo pat metu grupė plečia gamybos pajėgumus – Plocko gamykloje, Lenkijoje, statomas hidrintų augalinių aliejų (HVO) įrenginys.

SAF tiekimas yra tik viena iš iniciatyvų, kuriomis ORLEN siekia mažinti aviacijos sektoriaus poveikį aplinkai. Įgyvendindama projektą „HySPARK“ (Hydrogen Solutions for euroPean Airports & Regional Kinetics), bendrovė taip pat planuoja įrengti vandenilio degalinę Varšuvos Šopeno oro uoste. Ji aprūpins vandeniliu nulinių emisijų antžemines transporto priemones, kurios šiame oro uoste bus naudojamos kaip „HySPARK“ projekto dalis.

„ORLEN Lietuva“ jau daugelį metų išlieka didžiausia mokesčių mokėtoja šalyje ir svarbi Lietuvos ekonomikos dalyvė. Nuo 2006 m. ORLEN į Mažeikių gamyklos įsigijimą ir modernizavimą investavo beveik 4,5 mlrd. eurų. Be to, bendrovė valdo svarbiausią žaliavų tiekimo uostą – Būtingės terminalą – bei Mockavos geležinkelio terminalą, užtikrinantį sklandų naftos produktų eksportą.

ORLEN grupė – tai integruota, diversifikuota energetikos bendrovė, įtraukta į prestižinius „Fortune Global 500“ ir „Platts TOP250“ sąrašus. Tai pirmoji bendrovė regione, paskelbusi apie tikslą iki 2050 metų pasiekti klimato neutralumą.

Intimiti Australia, developer of Celys—the world's first certified compostable polyester—has won the Innovate P2X 2025 grant from NSW's Decarbonisation Hub. In partnership with Macquarie University, it will transform end-of-life clothing into Sustainable Aviation Fuel, tackling Australia's low 2 per cent textile recycling rate and advancing circularity in textiles and clean energy.

Australia’s textile footprint highlights the urgency of intervention: 373,000 tonnes of new clothes are imported annually, while 200,000 tonnes of clothing still end up in landfill every year. Despite well-meaning donations, 210,000 tonnes of garments sent to charities or bins often cannot be resold or recycled, leaving the nation with a recycling rate of just 2 percent.

Through Innovate P2X funding and in collaboration with Macquarie University, Intimiti will help reshape the textile value chain by proving that end of life clothing can be reengineered into high value energy solutions. By bridging material innovation with clean energy, the company seeks to demonstrate a scalable model for true circularity where fashion waste is transformed into fuel for a decarbonised future. This breakthrough not only diverts valuable fibres from landfill and reduces microplastic pollution, but also delivers renewable fuel to the aviation sector, one of the hardest industries to decarbonise.

“This initiative is more than innovation, it’s reimagining waste as opportunity,” says Jason, Project Lead at Intimiti Australia. “By valorising waste streams, we’re creating high-impact circularity in textiles and energy industries.”

With Innovate P2X support, Intimiti aims to show that fashion waste can find a second life as clean energy, helping both people and the planet move toward a sustainable future.

Tidak banyak orang yang menduga bahwa minyak jelantah, sisa gorengan dari dapur rumah tangga yang selama ini dianggap limbah, suatu hari bisa mengangkat pesawat komersial melintas langit Nusantara.

ADVERTISEMENT

Pada 20 Agustus 2025, penerbangan rute Jakarta–Bali mencatat sejarah untuk pertama kalinya di Asia Tenggara, pesawat komersial mengudara menggunakan campuran bahan bakar avtur terbarukan berbasis minyak jelantah, atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), yang diproduksi di kilang Pertamina Cilacap.

Pencapaian ini tentu patut diapresiasi karena menunjukkan bahwa inovasi teknologi energi terbarukan telah sampai pada tahap nyata, bukan sekadar wacana di atas kertas atau slogan kampanye hijau.

Namun, di balik euforia keberhasilan itu, ada pertanyaan yang jauh lebih besar dan mendesak untuk dijawab bersama: apakah minyak jelantah benar-benar akan menjadi energi rakyat yang inklusif, atau justru berubah menjadi bisnis eksklusif yang hanya menguntungkan segelintir elite migas?

Salah satu daya tarik utama dari kisah penerbangan perdana dengan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah adalah kesederhanaan simbol yang terkandung di dalamnya.

ADVERTISEMENT

Minyak jelantah, yang sehari-hari hanya kita kenal sebagai sisa penggorengan yang berbau tengik kerap dibuang begitu saja ke selokan atau dijual murah ke pengepul ternyata dapat menjelma menjadi energi bersih yang mendorong mesin jet melintasi udara.

Simbol ini penting karena menunjukkan bahwa transisi energi bukan hanya soal teknologi canggih yang jauh dari keseharian, melainkan dapat berangkat dari ruang-ruang sederhana yang akrab dengan masyarakat kecil yang ada di dapur rumah tangga dan usaha mikro.

Dengan demikian, keberhasilan penerbangan ini sebenarnya lebih dari sekadar tonggak teknologi, ia juga sebuah ajakan untuk melihat kembali nilai strategis dari limbah yang selama ini terabaikan.

Secara teknis, keunggulan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah memang sulit dibantah. Berbagai penelitian internasional membuktikan bahwa bahan bakar ini mampu menurunkan emisi gas rumah kaca hingga 60–80 persen dibandingkan avtur fosil, dan yang lebih penting, ia dapat digunakan langsung tanpa perlu memodifikasi mesin pesawat atau infrastruktur penerbangan yang sudah ada.

ADVERTISEMENT

Artinya, teknologi sudah siap untuk dipakai, tidak perlu menunggu terobosan baru yang mahal dan memakan waktu lama. Namun, dibalik kesiapan teknologi, pertanyaan fundamental tetap mengemuka di benak penulis siapa yang benar-benar akan menikmati manfaat dari energi baru ini? Apakah rakyat yang dapurnya menyumbangkan jelantah atau justru korporasi besar yang menguasai rantai pasok, kilang, dan pasar penerbangan?

Data Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan (KLHK) pada 2023 menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia menghasilkan lebih dari 3 juta kiloliter minyak jelantah per tahun. Angka ini menunjukkan potensi luar biasa untuk dijadikan bahan baku energi terbarukan. Tetapi kenyataannya, mayoritas minyak jelantah itu tidak masuk dalam rantai pasok resmi, melainkan bocor ke pasar gelap atau bahkan diekspor secara ilegal.

ADVERTISEMENT

Di sinilah persoalan mendasar dapat dilihat bersama, tanpa tata kelola yang transparan dan insentif yang adil, minyak jelantah berisiko besar hanya menjadi komoditas baru yang diperebutkan kelompok-kelompok pebisnis rente, sementara rakyat sebagai penghasil limbah tetap berada di pinggir cerita. Padahal, jika dikelola dengan baik, potensi ini bisa menjadi fondasi energi rakyat yang menghubungkan transisi energi dengan keadilan sosial.

Bayangkan dengan menggunakan sebuah skema sederhana, apabila setiap tetes minyak jelantah yang disetor oleh ibu rumah tangga atau pedagang gorengan ke rantai pasok resmi akan mendapatkan poin digital atau kupon yang bisa ditukar dengan akses makanan bergizi di dapur komunitas.

Dengan demikian, pengumpulan jelantah tidak hanya menghasilkan energi bersih yang mengangkat pesawat, tetapi juga memperkuat hak atas pangan rakyat kecil. Transisi energi pun tidak lagi menjadi isu teknokratis, melainkan hadir sebagai praktik keadilan sosial yang nyata di tingkat akar rumput.

Dari Pasar Gelap hingga Risiko Greenwashing

Walaupun terlihat sederhana, perjalanan mewujudkan rantai pasok minyak jelantah yang sehat penuh tantangan. Di atas kertas, jumlah jelantah memang melimpah. Namun dalam praktik, rantai pasoknya bisa dikatakan sangat berantakan.

Minyak bekas dapur rumah tangga tersebar dalam volume kecil, cenderung sulit dikumpulkan dan lebih mudah dijual murah kepada pengepul ilegal yang kemudian mengalirkannya ke pasar gelap atau mengekspornya keluar negeri.

Pemerintah memang sudah melarang ekspor minyak jelantah sejak awal 2025, tetapi larangan semata tanpa skema insentif bagi rakyat hanya akan menciptakan pasar gelap baru yang lebih berisiko. Dengan kata lain, kebijakan yang hanya bersifat membatasi tanpa memberikan keuntungan nyata bagi masyarakat berpotensi gagal sejak awal.

ADVERTISEMENT

Di sinilah pentingnya menetapkan harga acuan nasional serta menciptakan insentif langsung bagi rumah tangga dan UMKM. Rakyat harus mendapatkan manfaat ekonomi yang jelas dari menyerahkan minyak jelantah ke rantai pasok resmi. Jika tidak, maka tidak ada alasan rasional bagi masyarakat kecil untuk berpartisipasi, dan rantai pasok SAF akan selalu kalah dari mekanisme pasar gelap.

Selain persoalan bahan baku, ada pula tantangan biaya produksi. Fakta di lapangan menunjukkan bahwa harga SAF saat ini masih dua hingga tiga kali lipat lebih mahal dibandingkan avtur fosil. Tanpa dukungan fiskal berupa pembebasan pajak, subsidi silang hingga integrasi dengan pasar karbon, maskapai penerbangan tentu tidak akan sanggup menanggung beban biaya tersebut.

ADVERTISEMENT

Pertanyaannya kemudian kepada siapa yang akan diuntungkan dari mekanisme insentif ini? Apakah masyarakat kecil sebagai penyetor jelantah akan ikut merasakan manfaat atau insentif hanya akan berputar di lingkaran bisnis besar migas dan maskapai? Pengalaman program biodiesel B30 memberi pelajaran penting bahwa tanpa tata kelola yang ketat, program energi terbarukan bisa dengan mudah tersandera oleh kepentingan korporasi.

Tantangan lain yang tidak kalah penting adalah risiko greenwashing. Transisi energi tidak boleh berhenti pada label “hijau” semata. Ada risiko serius jika bahan baku SAF bergeser dari limbah menuju minyak primer misalnya crude palm oil yang dalam praktiknya bisa memicu deforestasi dan konflik lahan.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lebih jauh lagi, sistem pelacakan digital yang transparan harus dibangun agar setiap tetes jelantah bisa ditelusuri asal-usulnya. Tanpa mekanisme itu, SAF akan rentan disalahgunakan sebagai alat legitimasi hijau yang sesungguhnya abu-abu.

Regulasi, Partisipasi, dan Keberanian Politik

Jika melihat praktik terbaik negara lain, kita bisa menemukan pelajaran berharga. Belanda, misalnya, melalui Bandara Schiphol, mewajibkan pencampuran SAF pada penerbangan internasional sambil memberi insentif pajak untuk produsen.

ADVERTISEMENT

Amerika Serikat bahkan lebih jauh, meluncurkan program Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge dengan target 11 miliar liter SAF pada 2030 lengkap dengan kredit pajak per galon.

Kedua contoh ini menunjukkan hal yang sama yakni keberhasilan tidak hanya bergantung pada kesiapan teknologi, tetapi juga pada konsistensi regulasi, mandat pasar yang jelas dan insentif yang tepat sasaran.

Indonesia bisa mengambil inspirasi dari sana, tetapi yang lebih penting adalah menyesuaikannya dengan konteks kearifan lokal memastikan bahwa manfaat minyak jelantah benar-benar kembali kepada rakyat, bukan hanya ke perusahaan besar yang sudah mapan.

Jika dikelola dengan berani, SAF berbasis minyak jelantah bisa menjadi lebih dari sekadar bahan bakar pesawat. Proses pengolahannya juga menghasilkan diesel terbarukan yang dapat digunakan untuk bus kota, kapal penyeberangan, dan truk logistik.

ADVERTISEMENT

Dengan demikian, minyak jelantah sebenarnya punya potensi untuk menggerakkan seluruh moda transportasi darat, laut, dan udara sekaligus membangun ekonomi sirkular yang sehat. Namun semua itu hanya mungkin jika ada partisipasi kolektif.

Tanpa rakyat sebagai aktor utama, SAF hanya akan berhenti sebagai seremoni elite: sekali terbang untuk kepentingan liputan, lalu menguap tanpa jejak dalam kehidupan sehari-hari.

Penerbangan perdana SAF dari minyak jelantah seharusnya dipahami bukan sekadar sebagai demonstrasi teknologi, melainkan sebagai ujian serius bagi tata kelola energi Indonesia.

Pertanyaannya apakah minyak jelantah akan benar-benar menjadi energi rakyat yang menyehatkan dapur dan menggerakkan transportasi rendah karbon atau ia hanya akan berubah menjadi bisnis elite yang dibungkus jargon hijau? Jawaban dari pertanyaan itu sangat bergantung pada keberanian politik kita.

ADVERTISEMENT

Apakah kita berani menata regulasi secara tegas, memberi insentif langsung kepada rakyat dan memastikan setiap tetes jelantah yang dihasilkan dapur rumah tangga kembali sebagai energi berkeadilan?

Pada akhirnya, transisi energi bukanlah soal teknologi tinggi semata, melainkan soal keberanian untuk menempatkan rakyat sebagai pemilik utama masa depan energi.","https://blue.kumparan.com/image/upload/fl_progressive,fl_lossy,f_jpg,q_auto,w_600,h_315,c_lpad,b_white/g_south,l_og_user_zprw89/co_rgb:ffffff,g_south_west,l_text:Heebo_20_bold:Konten%20dari%20Pengguna%0DRifqi%20Nuril%20Huda,x_140,y_26/01hdb519fsh4acw1j6y4qg6nq1.jpg",N,,2025-09-15 05:58:29.157012

Indonesia dengan kekayaan sumber daya nabati memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) atau bioavtur. Beberapa bahan baku (feedstock) yang potensial untuk produksi SAF seperti minyak sawit, PFAD, POME, minyak jelantah, hingga tandan kosong kelapa sawit.

PASPI Monitor (2025) dalam jurnal berjudul Pengembangan SAF Sawit untuk Langit yang Lebih Hijau mengatakan bahwa Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tetapi juga berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional dengan memanfaatkan keberlimpahan sumber daya lokal. Salah satunya adalah kelapa sawit, termasuk minyak, produk samping (by-product), dan limbah. Berikut ini ulasan mengenai potensi bahan baku SAF yang tersedia di Indonesia.

Minyak Sawit. Minyak sawit menjadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF. Secara kimiawi, asam lemak dari minyak sawit sangat mirip dengan susunan hidrokarbon pada bahan bakar fosil. Asam laurat pada minyak inti sawit dapat diubah menjadi undekana atau bioavtur (PASPI Monitor, 2020; 2025a). Dengan menggunakan teknologi hydro-processed esters and fatty acid (HEFA), asam lemak pada minyak inti sawit dapat diolah menjadi SAF.

Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan (BPDP) melalui program Grant Riset Sawit (GRS) telah memfasilitasi riset inovasi pengembangan bioavtur berbasis minyak sawit (PASPI Monitor, 2025a). Salah satunya riset Reksowardojo et.al. (2022) yang menghasilkan bioavtur sawit dengan blending rate sebesar 2,4 persen (J2.4) yang dapat digunakan untuk bahan bakar pesawat. Program GRS juga melahirkan inovasi teknologi Katalis Merah Putih untuk memproduksi biofuel termasuk untuk avtur (Subagjo et.al., 2021; 2022).

Hasil riset inovasi GRS tersebut kemudian dikembangkan lebih lanjut dengan skala yang lebih besar. Pada tahun 2021, Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI) Cilacap berhasil memproduksi bioavtur dengan menggunakan feedstock minyak inti sawit atau refined bleached deodorized palm kernel oil (RBDPKO) dengan teknologi co-processing dan menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih (KPI, 2025). Tingkat pencampuran (blending rate) antara bioavtur tersebut dengan avtur fosil sebesar 2,4 persen atau J2.4.",https://sawitindonesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Pabrik-kelapa-sawit.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 23:56:15.870696

Australia’s domestic hydrogen market sits at 500,000 tonnes annually, valued at around $5 billion

Innovators are advancing tech to cut electricity use, removing one of the key barriers for green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel alternatives

Green hydrogen plays have dropped off investors’ ‘what’s hot’ lists this year, but the global demand for hydrogen still holds tonne-loads of potential. A market worth more than US$200 billion exists in heavy but hard to abate industries – and Australian innovators are finding new ways to make the numbers work.

Under the radar of many investors is an existing hydrogen market worth at least US$200 (A$306) billion globally. Most of the demand for the ~100 million tonnes consumed annually comes from essential but infamously hard to abate industries.

Australia has a 500,000-tonne-a-year hydrogen market - worth up to approximately $5 billion - which fuels the key sectors of steelmaking, fertiliser and chemical production, and refining.

While a lot of people think of all hydrogen as clean and green, the vast majority used by industry is grey or black – produced from gas or coal – and those varieties release millions of tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere each year.

Replacing fossil-fuel hydrogen with zero-emissions green hydrogen - produced using wind or solar power - could deliver some of the most immediate and bankable emissions cuts for corporations and governments scrambling to reach emissions targets.

Bankable market

For investors, the real hydrogen play is not just about futuristic cars or headline-grabbing export projects, it’s the massive and stable market for clean industrial feedstock.

More than 60 governments worldwide have adopted hydrogen strategies, and the focus, especially in Europe and Asia, is on low-emissions hydrogen. Billions of euros, yen and Korean won are being invested in R&D, subsidy programs and demonstration plants.

The climate solution green hydrogen offers may be clear, but its cost has been a major challenge. That’s because producing green hydrogen via the standard electrolysis method still requires substantial amounts of clean electricity.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that low-emissions hydrogen currently plays only a marginal role, with production of less than 1 million tonnes per annum - or one per cent of the global market. But, unlocking more cost-effective green hydrogen would lead to an exponential increase in its use.

Australian innovation can shift balance

Eyeing the huge opportunities for game-changing technology, Australian innovators are advancing projects across key sectors including alumina refining and steel production; shipping, aviation and other fuels; and fertiliser production via green ammonia.

Made by combining green hydrogen with nitrogen, green ammonia offers an immediate and high-impact opportunity to decarbonise the fertiliser industry. Additionally, green ammonia can be used as a zero-carbon fuel in the shipping industry - with potential uses as an export fuel.

The green ammonia market is projected to grow from US$407 million in 2024 to US$44,299 million by 2032, an eye-popping compound average growth rate of almost 80 per cent. Australia’s neighbours and close trading partners in Asia and the Pacific dominate the global market with a share of almost 66 per cent, according to Fortune Business Insights.

Green hydrogen projects in Australia are targeting our key sectors including fertiliser production for agriculture, plus steel and fuel.

One company that’s a frontrunner in cracking this industrial-scale market is Hadean Energy, a start-up spun out of CSIRO research. Its tubular Solid Oxide Electrolyser (tSOE) technology uses up to 30 per cent less electricity than conventional proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers.

This efficiency edge, combined with the use of industrial waste heat and avoidance of rare and expensive metals, means Hadean’s system can produce hydrogen – and syngas for e-fuels – at significantly lower costs than incumbent green hydrogen technologies.

Additionally, amid the well-publicised gas price rises, grey hydrogen is becoming more expensive, shifting the viability dial towards the green alternative.

Adding to the benefits of its transformative tech, Hadean’s modular units can be made ready for easy integration at industrial sites.

The company has already successfully completed a 1,000-hour industrial trial at BlueScope Steel’s Port Kembla plant, demonstrating it can take the heat of real-world applications.

It’s also earned a spot as a Shell-backed New Energy Challenge 2025 finalist, which puts it on the radar of major energy players.

Another boost for Hadean is its support from advisory firm RFC Ambrian, which has previously helped guide Chrysos (ASX:C79) and FPR Energy from R&D projects to commercialisation.

Looking to leverage overseas interest, Hadean is collaborating with startup NGV Earth on a pilot-scale plant advancing technology to deliver sustainable aviation fuel that doesn't have the environmental baggage of what’s used today.

Further positioning Hadean’s technology for domestic and international impact, the company will soon deploy a multi-kilowatt demonstration unit as part of the Australia-UK Renewable Hydrogen Innovation Partnerships program.

This program, with high-level government support in both countries, is sharply focused on the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries.

It’s these existing high-emissions yet essential for modern life industries - not the cool cars and shiny new projects - that will propel us towards a decarbonised future.

By growing in these proven and large-scale markets the green hydrogen sector can set itself up for broader adoption and unlock the capital set to flow into one of the energy transition’s key growth opportunities.

Gadkari was speaking at the tenth anniversary of Naam Foundation, an organisation started by actors Makarand Anaspure and Nana Patekar for watershed management and drought mitigation. At the event, he said, ""It will be tough for the farmers to survive only by cultivating pulses or grains. The sugar industry could survive because of ethanol. Now, an alternative to diesel called isobutanol will be produced. We are also planning to develop sustainable aviation fuel using biogas."" The minister also said that sugar is in surplus in the country. Nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced liquidation had there been no ethanol, he said. The production cost of sugar in Brazil is around Rs27 per kg, while the same in Maharashtra is around Rs32-33. Brazil introduces sugar at around Rs30 per kg in the international market, making it more difficult for us to sell our stock, incurring a loss of Rs2-3 per kg. ""So, farmers will have to ensure that they become producers of not only food but also fuel, electricity, aviation, bitumen, and hydrogen. That will make villages rich,"" said Gadkari. Use of corn for ethanol production, according to him, has helped give a better price to corn — up from Rs1,200 per quintal to Rs2,800 per quintal. Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra have benefited from the increased production, said the minister, adding that production has also gone up by three times. This yield is taken thrice a year. Commenting on other issues, Gadkari said, better water supply management is needed in the country to improve the agricultural sector and lives of farmers. ""Politics over usage of river water and river water distribution has created complications. There were around 23 disputes between states about river water distribution. The majority have been resolved,"" he assured. Gadkari also said that if Maharashtra's milk production goes up and irrigation increases by 65%, many agricultural issues will be resolved. In another programme on the same day, Gadkari was awarded by the Geeta Dharma Mandal organisation. While speaking here, he said new-age methods like videos or reels should be used to spread the message of life given by the Bhagavad Geeta. ""It will help youngsters define the real meaning of life as well as politics and its purpose. We need to redefine politics. Instead of the politics of power, it should be more centred around social reforms. The issue in today's political circles is not the difference of opinions, but the lack of opinions,"" he said.

Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.
Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.
""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said.
The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.","Canola producers are entering harvest season with significant uncertainty in the wake of China's latest tariff on Canadian canola.

China, which slapped a 75.8 per cent duty on Canadian canola seed last month, is Canada's largest canola seed importer, with seed exports making up the vast majority — $4 billion — of Canada's $4.9 billion in canola product exports to China in 2024.

This tariff on canola seed, coupled with 100 per cent tariffs on Canadian canola oil and canola meal imposed by China in March, is the cause of much concern among producers across Western Canada.

According to the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, the province is home to 14,000 canola farmers who grow the oilseed crop over 6.6 million acres of farmland, creating a lucrative industry that employs over 40,000 Albertans.

Canola market 'spiraling down'

Alberta Canola director and farmer Christine McKee said she's feeling ""a little bit of panic"" and ""a lot of frustration"" due to the new tariff.

""Just so much uncertainty,"" said McKee. ""Exporting to China is essential to the canola industry in Canada.""

""There isn't a lot farmers can do. Plans are usually set by now for what we're doing next year. We grow our crops on a rotation basis, and it's not easy to make changes.""

Part of the problem is that uncertainty around the trade situation with China has left producers worried about what they are going to grow for next year, and who they are going to sell it to.

""We need a verbal commitment of financial support in response to these politically-based tariffs,"" McKee said.

Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.

""We're not in a good situation right now,"" he said. ""We've taken a huge hit already, but we don't know how big that hit is going to be.""

Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.

""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said. ""We have a good crop coming, but at the same time … we do depend on these export sales, for places to move it to.""

With approximately 40,000 canola farms nationwide, canola is a major driver of the Canadian economy. The industry contributes an average of $43.7 billion to the national economy annually, and supports over 200,000 jobs across the country, according to the Canola Council of Canada.

The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.

""We have a significant amount of canola supply chain, value chain activity that happens in the Lethbridge region,"" said Trevor Lewington, CEO of Economic Development Lethbridge. ""Those tariffs are likely to slow down access to [the Chinese] market and will force us to think about either new markets, who else can we sell to, or what else can we do.""

Diversifying the market

One possible solution could be to look to the sky to diversify, said Lewington.

""There's growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel,"" he said. ""And so that's something that might not have been considered before, because of course, the focus should be growing food and supplying food to a hungry world.""

""But if that market is no longer interested in our product for food, then perhaps we can shift it to other uses, like aviation.""

As research continues into the use of canola to fuel planes, Lewington said diversification can also come in the form of increasing trade with other markets.

""China certainly is a big market. It's not the only market. We're not entirely dependent on that,"" said Lewington. ""So there is an opportunity, I think, for the canola commissions to do more marketing, to extend the reach into other markets or grow our share in the existing markets that we have.""

In 2024, Canada's total canola exports were valued at $14.5 billion. The United States is the largest customer of canola as a whole, with exports valued at $7.7 billion, followed by China, which is the largest buyer of raw canola seed.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7633730.1757878423!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/fea-canola-20250718.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-14 17:56:09.965274

“Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe”. Voici le titre d’un texte du scientifique David Ho et l’économiste Gernot Wagner que nous traduisons ici avec leur accord.

Ce texte permet de voir le changement climatique sous un autre angle, une autre perspective.

Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe.

Les événements ponctuels comme Deepwater Horizon laissent une impression durable, mais la combustion normale des énergies fossiles a un impact encore plus grave.

La marée noire provoquée par la plateforme Deepwater Horizon dans le golfe du Mexique il y a une douzaine d’années a été une tragédie humaine et environnementale. Elle a coûté la vie à 11 personnes, déversé des millions de barils de pétrole dans le golfe et coûté à BP Plc plus de 65 milliards de dollars en frais de nettoyage et en indemnités.

Mais si tout ce pétrole avait été vendu et utilisé, il aurait été encore plus mortel et dévastateur pour l’environnement.

C’est ce qu’a récemment affirmé le co-auteur de la newsletter d’aujourd’hui, le climatologue David Ho, dans un tweet qui a été largement partagé :

Parfois, je pense au fait que Deepwater Horizon a été une catastrophe environnementale majeure qui a coûté la vie à 11 personnes et plus de 65 milliards de dollars à BP, mais si ce pétrole avait été récupéré, vendu et utilisé, cela aurait été pire pour l’environnement, aurait tué plus de personnes et BP aurait gagné de l’argent.

— David Ho (@david_ho) 28 janvier 2022

Au début, j’étais sceptique (Gernot). Mais le calcul de base est correct, et c’est même probablement sous-estimé.

La marée noire a provoqué le déversement d’environ 200 millions de gallons de pétrole dans le golfe du Mexique. Brûler autant de gallons de pétrole et de diesel dans des moteurs à combustion aurait émis plus de 1,4 million de tonnes de CO₂, sans compter, par exemple, les émissions liées au raffinage et au transport du pétrole. Traduit en nombre moyen de vies perdues en raison du changement climatique qui en résulte, cela implique environ 325 décès au cours du siècle, liés uniquement à la hausse des températures. Cela n’inclut pas les décès dus aux particules fines générées par la combustion de ce carburant, qui pourraient représenter 350 décès prématurés supplémentaires par an.

Twitter étant Twitter, les réponses ont nécessité une réponse de David : « Je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. » Nous ne devrions pas. Il existe de nombreux autres coûts environnementaux qui ne sont pas pris en compte dans les 11 décès et les 65 milliards de dollars. L’impact dévastateur sur la faune sauvage ne peut être que partiellement reflété dans les chiffres des dommages financiers. Une partie du pétrole déversé a brûlé de manière incontrôlable, libérant à nouveau du CO₂. Le pétrole qui n’est pas brûlé mais qui finit par s’évaporer cause également de nombreux dommages environnementaux.

Hélas, il existe une grande différence entre un calcul statistique basé sur des estimations globales des dégâts et la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès, comme dans le cas de la plate-forme pétrolière Deepwater Horizon. Onze décès constituent une tragédie, tandis que 325 décès estimés statistiquement ne sont que cela, une statistique.

Il existe une autre différence, ce que l’on appelle en termes juridiques la “cause immédiate”. Cary Coglianese, professeur de droit et de sciences politiques à la Carey Law School de l’université de Pennsylvanie, décrit cela comme « une version juridique de la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès ». Tout tribunal raisonnable conviendrait que les 11 décès survenus sur Deepwater Horizon étaient directement liés à l’explosion et à l’incendie de la plate-forme.

Grâce aux progrès rapides réalisés dans le nouveau domaine de la science de l’attribution, les décès liés au climat et autres dommages peuvent désormais être liés plus directement aux tonnes de CO₂ émises. En effet, un nombre croissant de poursuites judiciaires visent à établir un lien de causalité direct entre les dommages climatiques et les décès, mais aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients.

Il existe une autre raison, trop humaine, pour laquelle 11 décès lors d’un événement ponctuel pèsent plus lourd que 325 décès futurs. M. Coglianese, de l’université de Pennsylvanie, compare la différence entre le changement climatique et la marée noire de BP à celle entre la pandémie de Covid-19 et les attentats terroristes du 11 septembre 2001 : « Le 11 septembre a tué environ 3 000 personnes », dit-il. « Nous avons eu environ autant de décès liés au Covid rien qu’hier aux États-Unis. » Plus de 900 000 Américains sont morts du Covid au cours des deux dernières années, et bien plus de 5,5 millions dans le monde, et ce ne sont là que les décès directement attribués à la maladie. « Nous semblons devenir insensibles à cette catastrophe quotidienne », ajoute M. Coglianese.

Nous ne devons bien sûr pas devenir insensibles aux milliers de décès quotidiens liés au Covid, ni aux centaines de décès liés, selon des estimations prudentes, à la quantité de pétrole brûlée, équivalente à celle déversée lors de la marée noire de BP. Les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité.

Compléments d’informations

Vous pourriez être surpris en lisant ce texte. Vous dire “attendez, il dit qu’une marée noire c’est moins pire qu’autre chose ?”. David Ho a été attaqué sur les réseaux sociaux après avoir publié ce texte, et a tout de suite précisé le fond de sa pensée :

“je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. Je souligne simplement l’ironie du fait que la combustion des énergies fossiles nuit beaucoup plus à l’environnement et tue beaucoup plus de personnes, mais comme il s’agit d’émissions de scope 3, les entreprises comme BP ne sont pas tenues responsables et engrangent au contraire des milliards de dollars.”

Il est prévisible que certaines personnes répondent que les énergies fossiles sont géniales. Vous savez ce qui est génial aussi ? Une planète habitable.”

Le coeur du texte est bien dans le titre : il y a des morts quotidiennes du changement climatique dans le monde sans que cela choque outre mesure. C’est un fait : les morts du changement climatique sont des morts silencieuses. Même s’il peut y en avoir 100 fois plus de morts à cause du changement climatique, cela n’aura jamais l’impact médiatique d’un crash d’avion ou d’une marée noire. Dernier exemple en date, la canicule de juin 2025 a fait environ 500 morts en France selon Santé Publique France. Avez-vous vu un seul responsable politique en parler ? Un journaliste interroger un membre du gouvernement ?

Cet article appelle à juste titre à changer d’angle, à aller plus loin dans la réflexion sur le changement climatique. The Onion (une sorte de Gorafi américain) a parfaitement compris l’ironie de la situation avec ce titre : “des millions de barils de pétrole arrivent à bon port malgré une catastrophe environnementale majeure“.

“Ouf”, on a évité la marée noire, qui aurait été une catastrophe. La réalité, c’est qu’on aurait évité une catastrophe si le pétrole avait été remis sous terre, là où il devrait rester.

Autre point important, les progrès réalisés dans le domaine de la science de l’attribution, dont nous avons dédié un article entier sur Bon Pote. Si “aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients”, cela pourrait bientôt ne plus être le cas.

La science a permis de clarifier le lien sans équivoque entre les activités humaines et le réchauffement climatique et c’est désormais un argument clef dans les procès. La Cour Internationale de Justice a par ailleurs récemment publié un avis notamment basé sur le dernier rapport du GIEC. Grâce à cet avis, il est à prévoir que les procès vont se multiplier contre les Etats et les entreprises qui savent que leurs activités tuent et ne font rien ou pas assez pour arrêter ce phénomène.

Comme le rappelle David Ho, “les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité“.",https://bonpote.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deepwater_Horizon_offshore_drilling_unit_on_fire_2010.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 21:56:53.887164

Shubhangi Mathur New Delhi

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India’s largest oil refiner, is working on an expansion plan in line with the country’s growing fuel requirements. In an exclusive interaction with Shubhangi Mathur, Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney talks of the company’s growth plan and also sets the record straight on the E20 controversy. Edited excerpts.

How do you look at the controversy over ethanol-blended petrol? Do you plan to offer consumers the choice of buying non-blended petrol too? And is E20 (20 per cent ethanol blending) as efficient as petrol?

As of now, we do not have any plans to offer non-blended petrol. We will see how it pans out and take a call accordingly. There is no controversy on E20 petrol. All the equipment manufacturers, labs, and agencies have certified that there is no problem with E20. We have a good example of Brazil, where petrol with 27-32 per cent ethanol blending is being sold. The efficiency of E20 is more or less on a par with that of petrol.

India aims to become a refining hub. How would IOC contribute to that?

Given the need for India’s increasing demand for fuel, IOC started expanding brownfield refineries three-four years ago. These projects are set to increase the group’s refining capacity from 80.4 million tonnes to 98 million tonnes per annum. They are scheduled to be commissioned next year. The increased capacity will take care of a large part of the increased demand for petroleum products. In the same timeframe, other refinery projects will also come up, including the expansion of the Rajasthan and Numaligarh (Assam) refineries.

The Indian market is expanding at a moderate pace, with diesel consumption growing at 2–3% and petrol at 5–7%. The industry will also actively pursue exporting surplus petroleum products once production begins following the completion of planned refinery expansions.

Which markets do you plan to target for export?

Petroleum products will go primarily to the African subcontinent and South American continent. Certain refineries are closing in the European Union. They will need products that meet Euro VI standards. Our products meet those quality standards. So, Europe is another geography. For IOC, export accounts for 5-8 per cent of its volumes. This is going to increase.

What are the timelines involved in these expansion projects?

We are aiming to complete the expansion of the Panipat refinery by March. Those in Gujarat and Bihar (Barauni) too will see completion by next year. Much of our refinery expansion will be commissioned by 2026.

Are you planning to set up greenfield refineries?

Not at present. We are focused on executing brownfield expansion while addressing the energy transition. With the rise of electric vehicles, green hydrogen, ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and other alternative fuels, the growth of petroleum products will be moderate. However, as the country’s leading energy provider, we may consider setting up a greenfield refinery, depending on the evolving demand-supply scenario.

Indian Oil has an upcoming greenfield refinery with Chennai Petroleum in Tamil Nadu.

We are working out the configuration, which will be more suitable for petrochemicals and less for refineries. We want to convert it into a petrochemical-oriented project. The detailed feasibility report is being prepared for the project.

Saudi Arabia is looking to increase its share in the global oil market. Are you in talks with the people there?

We are not in any kind of talks. We know some newer (Indian) refineries are in talks but we are keeping our crude oil portfolio in an open manner because we want to process as many type of crude oil as possible. We have flexibility of 10 refineries which can process almost all kinds of crude oil. That is our strength.

On IOC’s green-hydrogen plant in Panipat?

We are putting up India’s largest green hydrogen plant at Panipat, with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum. It will be commissioned by December 2027 and will be utilised for mobility purposes if enough hydrogen-fuelled buses, trucks or cars are available in the market. Otherwise, we will use it in our refineries and replace the conventional grey hydrogen with green hydrogen. The cost of production will be less than $4 per kg.

IOC is also foraying into new energy such as nuclear and critical minerals.

Nuclear energy, critical minerals, and ship building are on our drawing board. It is premature to talk about these things.

What is your outlook on crude oil prices?

Prices now are $66-67 a barrel in spite of all the disturbances happening across the world. My assessment is that if these disturbances ease then prices will further come down by $5-10, reaching $55-60.

At RepAir, he leads business development, international partnerships, and commercial scaling of its electrochemical carbon capture technology.

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions – nearly a gigaton annually – and is growing faster than rail, road or shipping. This sector represents one of the most challenging to decarbonise.

As the International Energy Agency notes, reaching net-zero will require “revolutionary” designs, including alternative propulsion technologies such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft.

However, battery electric propulsion is currently limited to very small aircraft and short ranges. Using hydrogen poses significant challenges: innovative fuel storage and delivery methods, low-cost lightweight cryogenic tanks, and redesigned airframes to accommodate them. Questions about hydrogen’s impact on contrails remain unanswered, with dedicated studies still underway.

This technological reality makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) critical to decarbonising aviation now. Yet here too, there’s a fundamental constraint that needs to be addressed – and urgently.

SAF from biogenic feedstocks has fundamental limits

While the EU has set ambitious SAF blending targets – 2% this year, rising to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 with a synthetic fuel sub-mandate of 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 – the industry’s current approach relies heavily on biogenic CO2 from crops, agricultural waste and other biological sources. And biogenic feedstocks have inherent limitations that make these targets mathematically impossible.

The EU’s RefuelEU regulation excludes SAFs produced from food and feed crops due to sustainability concerns. While biojet kerosene from animal fat and waste oil feedstocks are included, their growth potential is limited by supply.

More abundant feedstocks could come from agricultural residues, dedicated energy crops and municipal solid waste – but even these face constraints.

First, cultivating crops for fuel creates direct land use competition with food production or requires land conversion. Second, and more critically, biogenic sources are finite.

Meeting the EU’s 2050 SAF targets through biogenic sources alone would require between 7% and 18% of today’s EU agricultural land, depending on the feedstock. It’s both impractical and impossible at the scale needed.

Even if we maximised every available biogenic source globally, we’d fall short of the gigatons of CO2 needed for aviation fuel production by 2050.

This is where atmospheric CO2 becomes essential.

Direct Air Capture: Sustainable aviation fuel from the sky

Direct Air Capture (DAC) allows us to capture CO2 needed to produce e-SAF – synthetic fuels made by combining atmospheric CO2 with green hydrogen produced by electrolysers run on low-emissions electricity through processes like Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-jet conversion.

The key advantage is unlimited feedstock: the atmosphere contains all the CO2 we need. We’re not talking about offsetting here – this is about recycling; creating a circular carbon economy where aviation’s emissions become tomorrow’s fuel.

RefuelEU Aviation regulation already recognises this distinction, segregating between biogenic SAF and e-SAF from direct air capture. This is an acknowledgement that atmospheric carbon represents a fundamentally different resource with fundamentally different potential.

What makes this pathway particularly promising is also infrastructure compatibility. Airports in Rome and Paris are already preparing for e-fuel supply chains. Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives that would require complete infrastructure overhauls, e-SAF uses existing fuel systems.

That’s a massive advantage for an industry that needs solutions now, not in ten years.

Cutting the cost of carbon capture through electrochemical innovation

The cost challenge is real but not insurmountable. Traditional DAC technologies have struggled with high energy requirements – often consuming 2,500 kWh or more per tonne of CO2 captured.

But innovation is rapidly changing this equation. New electrochemical approaches can achieve up to 70% lower energy consumption compared to conventional thermal-based systems.

By eliminating the need for high-temperature processes and chemical solvents, these technologies can reduce both operational costs and capital requirements. When you factor in mass manufacturing potential using standard materials rather than exotic components, the path to cost-competitive atmospheric CO2 becomes clear.

The same innovation curve that brought battery costs down by 90% over the past decade is beginning to transform DAC.

But we need to be honest about the challenge: the entire e-SAF value chain – from DAC to hydrogen production to fuel synthesis – requires substantial energy inputs. Current e-SAF costs five to six times more than conventional jet fuel.

Building a SAF production plant takes 10 to 20 years to reach full operational scale. This is why it’s a day-one challenge. The plants we need operational in 2040 must break ground today.

Aviation’s sustainable future must include atmospheric carbon

The truth is that from a pure energy efficiency standpoint, the numbers might favour simply capturing CO2 and storing it underground.

But Europe – and other countries such as the UK, Brazil and Japan – have chosen a different path, for better or for worse: pushing the industry to innovate beyond the World War II-era Fischer-Tropsch process, to find new pathways that make recycled carbon economically viable.

For this to happen, I believe three critical developments must happen:

First: Reinforce supply-side and demand-side policies to scale up e-SAF production and offtake

Second: Tax aviation fuels according to their climate impact, acknowledging that only a minority of the world flies

Third: Position aviation as a lead market to bring nascent decarbonisation options to commercial scale. Actions from leading airlines and airports that serve as key international and domestic hubs can generate the market pull needed to catalyse the adoption of efficient operations and best-in-class technologies

E-SAF from atmospheric CO2 doesn’t compete with biogenic SAF – we need every sustainable fuel source available, but only atmospheric carbon offers the unlimited scale required for aviation’s future.

It’s time we acknowledge that aviation’s sustainable future depends on turning the sky itself into our fuel source.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jean-Philippe-Hiegel-RepAir-Carbon-opinion-piece.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 11:56:14.083662

During the meeting, Karim Badawi, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, emphasized the role of petrochemicals as a key foundation for maximizing value-added from natural resources and strengthening Egypt’s position as a regional hub for energy and downstream industries.

He pointed out that new ongoing projects will create a qualitative leap in the petrochemicals sector, a feat that will be further supported by an expected increase in the supply of natural gas, which is the primary feedstock for the petrochemical industry.

The government is adopting a multi-track plan to secure the supply of natural gas to meet the increasing summer demand, especially in light of the decline in production in Zohr, Egypt’s largest gas field. The plan includes increasing production through finalizing new exploration deals, providing foreign investors with incentives, on top of which is gradually repaying their arrears, as well as renting and operating three Floating Storage and Regasification Units(FSRU) with the regasified gas being pumped into the national grid.

During the meeting, Mekki reviewed the progress of some petrochemical projects, including the Suez Methanol Derivatives Company (SMD), a three-plant complex stretching over an area of 45,000 square meters; the petrochemicals complex in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, with massive investments and a refining capacity of about 4 mt/y; and the ethane supply chain project to secure feedstock for factories and push exports to $4 billion annually by 2030

katakabar.com - Penerapan Bioavtur atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) di Indonesia, selain digunakan sektor penerbangan juga untuk ekspansi atau pengembangan industri SAF nasional.

Indonesia dengan kekayaan sumber daya nabati memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan SAF atau bioavtur. Beberapa bahan baku (feedstock) yang potensial untuk produksi SAF, seperti minyak sawit, PFAD, POME, minyak jelantah, hingga tandan kosong kelapa sawit.

Jurnal PASPI Monitor (2025) berjudul Pengembangan SAF Sawit untuk Langit yang Lebih Hijau menyebutkan, Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan atau menerapkan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tapi berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional dengan memanfaatkan keberlimpahan sumber daya lokal. Di antarsnya, yakni kelapa sawit, termasuk minyak, produk samping (by-product), dan limbah. Berikut ini ulasan mengenai potensi bahan baku SAF yang tersedia di Indonesia.

Minyak Sawit: Minyak sawit jadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF. Secara kimiawi, asam lemak dari minyak sawit sangat mirip dengan susunan hidrokarbon pada bahan bakar fosil. Asam laurat pada minyak inti sawit dapat diubah menjadi undekana atau bioavtur (PASPI Monitor, 2020; 2025a). Dengan menggunakan teknologi hydro-processed esters and fatty acid (HEFA), asam lemak pada minyak inti sawit dapat diolah menjadi SAF.

Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan atau BPDP lewat program Grant Riset Sawit atau GRS telah fasilitasi riset inovasi pengembangan bioavtur berbasis minyak sawit (PASPI Monitor, 2025a). Di antaranya riset Reksowardojo et.al. (2022) yang menghasilkan bioavtur sawit dengan blending rate sebesar 2,4 persen (J2.4) yang dapat digunakan untuk bahan bakar pesawat. Program GRS juga melahirkan inovasi teknologi Katalis Merah Putih untuk memproduksi biofuel termasuk untuk avtur (Subagjo et.al., 2021; 2022).

Hasil riset inovasi GRS tersebut kemudian dikembangkan lebih lanjut dengan skala yang lebih besar. Pada tahun 2021, Kilang Pertamina Internasional atau KPI Cilacap berhasil memproduksi bioavtur dengan menggunakan feedstock minyak inti sawit atau refined bleached deodorized palm kernel oil atau RBDPKO dengan teknologi co-processing dan menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih (KPI, 2025). Tingkat pencampuran (blending rate) antara bioavtur tersebut dengan avtur fosil sebesar 2,4 persen atau J2.4.

Terus dilakukan uji penerbangan bioavtur J2.4 dengan menggunakan pesawat CN-235 milik PT Dirgantara Indonesia pada Oktober 2021 dan Garuda Indonesia dengan rute penerbangan Jakarta-Solo pada Oktober 2023. Hasil uji terbang tersebut menunjukkan kinerja mesin stabil tanpa perbedaan signifikan dibandingkan avtur konvensional.

Keberhasilan itu otomatis picu optimistik dalam pengembangan bioavtur/SAF di Indonesia. Pengembangan bioavtur/SAF berbasis minyak inti sawit (J2.4) di Indonesia siap untuk masuk ke tahap komersialisasi. Faktor yang mendukung kesiapan tersebut adalah ketersediaan bahan baku dan teknologi HEFA serta kapabilitas eksisting kilang produksi coprocessing milik KPI sebesar 347 juta kiloliter per tahun (KPI, 2025). Produksi bioavtur/SAF J2.4 juga telah memenuhi sertifikasi teknis untuk aplikasi pada pesawat komersial dan telah lulus uji terbang.

Minyak Jelantah dan PFAD: Selain minyak sawit, terdapat produk olahan sawit yang berpotensi menjadi bahan baku SAF di Indonesia yakni minyak jelantah (used cooking oil/UCO) dan palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). Minyak jelantah dianggap sebagai limbah dari penggunaan minyak goreng sawit, sedangkan PFAD dianggap sebagai by-product. Dengan status tersebut, pengurangan emisi siklus hidup dari SAF berbasis minyak jelantah atau PFAD lebih signifikan dibandingkan avtur fosil sehingga menjadikan kedua feedstock tersebut termasuk dalam positive list sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel dan mendapatkan sertifikasi keberlanjutan.

Sebagai bahan bakar pesawat yang berkelanjutan, SAF harus memenuhi kriteria berkelanjutan CORSIA sehingga dapat tergolong sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel (ICOA, 2025a; DGCA, 2025). Dalam publikasi ICAO (2025b), feedstock yang memenuhi kriteria sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel jika nilai life cycle assessment (default core LCA value) rendah dan tidak terkait secara langsung dengan konversi lahan (indirect land use change/ILUC) setelah 1 Januari 2008.

Penggunaan limbah seperti minyak jelantah sebagai bahan baku SAF memberikan keuntungan karena nilai default ILUC dianggap nol sehingga dapat mengurangi emisi lebih besar dibandingkan produk primer seperti minyak nabati atau lemak hewani (IATA, 2025).

Tidak cuma itu, SAF yang diproduksi dari minyak jelantah akan menghasilkan penghematan emisi karbon (carbon intensity) yang paling rendah dibandingkan SAF berbasis feedstock lain. Kemampuan reduksi emisi karbon dari penggunaan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah relatif tinggi yakni sekitar 84 persen dibandingkan avtur fosil (ICAO, 2021; Kemenko Marves, 2024).

Pemanfaatan limbah minyak jelantah ini dukung ekonomi sirkuler sehingga nilai keberlanjutannya semakin tinggi. Hal tersebut yang melatarbelakangi upaya pemerintah untuk mengembangkan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah (UCO) di Indonesia.

Dengan potensi minyak jelantah yang berhasil dikumpulkan sebanyak tiga juta kiloliter (TNP2K, 2020; Prasetiawan, 2022) atau sekitar 3,9 juta ton per tahun pada tahun 2023 (Kemenko Marves, 2024) diharapkan mampu mendukung pengembangan SAF yang memenuhi kriteria berkelanjutan CORSIA.

Keunggulan lainnya adalah penggunaan teknologi jalur HEFA untuk mengolah minyak jelantah (maupun RBDPKO) menjadi SAF tergolong sebagai teknologi yang relatif matang, aman, dan sudah dikembangkan di Indonesia.

Selain minyak inti sawit, PFAD, dan minyak jelantah, produk sampingan (joint product) dari tanaman sawit juga masih menyimpan potensi sebagai alternatif feedstock SAF. Produk yang dimaksud adalah POME dan TKKS.

Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) dan Tandan Kosong Kelapa Sawit (TKKS): Kedua feedstock tersebut tergolong sebagai kelompok limbah yang berpotensi memenuhi kriteria CORSIA eligible fuel dan mendapatkan sertifikasi keberlanjutan. Dengan menggunakan teknologi jalur HEFA, limbah POME yang kaya senyawa organik dan fraksi lipid berpotensi untuk diolah menjadi SAF.

Dengan menggunakan jalur teknologi fischer tropsch atau alcohol-to-jet, biomassa TKKS yang mengandung selulosa, hemiselulosa, dan lignin potensial untuk dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan baku SAF pada masa mendatang (PASPI, 2025).

With the evolution of tomorrow’s aircraft gathering pace, paired with alternative fuel sources and new powerplant types, several companies are seeking to take full advantage of the opportunities that may arise.

One such company is the European start-up MAEVE, which is busy designing its 80-seat regional jet, to be called the Maeve Jet MJ500. Maeve’s vision is to make aviation sustainable for millions of travellers and to reduce more than 50 metric tons of carbon dioxide from commercial airline routes by 2040.

Maeve’s strategy is to “develop a globally competitive aircraft family compatible with existing infrastructure, setting new standards in energy efficiency and economics.”

With its hybrid electric engines and sleek design, MAEVE’s latest Maeve Jet aircraft is being lined up to revolutionise the regional airline industry. But who exactly is MAEVE Aerospace, and what role will its aircraft have in the future of regional passenger aviation?

The MAEVE Aerospace story so far

MAEVE Aerospace is a European start-up in the development of sustainable and economic aircraft designs. With offices in Delft, The Netherlands, and Munich, Germany, the company was founded in 2021 to revolutionise the regional aircraft industry.

MAEVE is supported by private investors, the Government of the Netherlands, and the European Investment Council (EIC)

The company initially began designing a 44 to 52-seat regional aircraft in 2023. Called the Maeve 01, the early design was a high-wing monoplane with all-electric propulsion, including eight electric motors placed on the leading edge of the wings.

Initially expected to enter service in 2029, the model was initially marketed as offering a range of 288 miles (or 460km) on a single charge.

MAEVE Aerospace was positioning the Maeve01 as a zero-emissions aircraft to replace older ATR42s and DHC-8s and promised that it would be possible to fully recharge the aircraft in just 35 minutes.

Then, in late 2023, with the further development of hybrid electric propulsion systems, the company revealed its plans had morphed into developing an 80-seat hybrid-electric regional aircraft.

MAEVE said its new ‘M80’ aircraft had the potential to replace both turboprops and regional jets in the short-haul commercial airline arena. Images portrayed the M80 as a high-wing aircraft with a pair of wing-mounted hybrid turboprop engines and featuring a T-tail style design.

With the switch to hybrid-electric technology with the M80, the company said that the move would push the expected entry into service of its flagship aircraft back by two years to 2031.

But in return, the new aircraft would offer almost double the capacity of its predecessor, the Maeve01, and would also offer additional capability by increasing the range of the aircraft to around 800 nautical miles (1,482 km).

According to MAEVE’s website about the M80 model, “the M80 offers the performance of a jet and the efficiency of a turboprop, a game-changing combination.

“The M80 is a clean-sheet design with a newly integrated hybrid propulsion system, resulting in a significant reduction of mission energy and fuel consumption. This makes the Maeve Jet the perfect replacement for both the regional jets and turboprops.”

“To my knowledge, there are currently no alternatives in development that are equally sustainable, cost-effective, and match the operational needs of airlines and airports,” adds Martin Nuesseler, Chief Technology Officer at Maeve Aerospace in 2023.

“If there are, I would applaud them, because we need more of these realistic solutions to become sustainable”.

The M80 transforms into the Maeve Jet MJ500

In June 2025, MAEVE issued a new statement revealing that, following advice and guidance from its partners, it had completely resigned the M80, which had now become the Maeve Jet MJ500.

The aircraft was by this stage had now become a low-wing aircraft with two aft-mounted open-rotor/stator engines with a two-propeller style design.

According to the company, the new design of the Maeve Jet features reduced cabin noise, achieved by mounting small-diameter propulsors at the rear fuselage and a low wing to compensate for weight distribution.

While hybrid designs are not entirely emission-free, MAEVE claims that its Maeve Jet will consume 40% less energy than a traditional airliner of a similar size, such as the Bombardier CRJ900.

The company added that the Maeve Jet’s clean-sheet design and engine thermal optimization when operating at high altitude are also expected to contribute towards its overall energy efficiency.

Specifications for the Maeve Jet hybrid-electric regional aircraft

According to the company’s own published figures, the Maeve Jet has a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 34,000 kg (74,956 lbs) and offers a maximum payload of 9,700 kg (21,385 lbs)

Operators of the Maeve Jet will have the capability of flying sectors up to 1,450 nautical miles (2,685 km) with a load of 76 passengers in a three-class configuration, which decreases to 950 nautical miles (1,759 km) operating with 90 passengers in a two-class layout.

The Maeve Jet is being designed to cruise at a maximum speed of 0.78 Mach, although normal operations will see the aircraft travel at 0.75 Mach. The Maximum Operating Altitude of the Maeve Jet will be 37,000 ft (11,277m).

In terms of runway performance, a Maeve Jet at MTOW will have a take-off run distance of 4,921 ft (1,500 meters) and a landing field length of 1,759 km (1,400meters).

While the aircraft is marketed as an 80-seater in a mixed configuration, the aircraft can accommodate up to 100 passengers in a single-class configuration.

More details about the hybrid-electric engines

At the Farnborough Air Show in July 2024, Maeve announced a major tie-up with RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada to collaborate on the design of the powerplants for Maeve Jet’s predecessor, the M80.

“As a clean sheet design, the performance and efficiency of the M80 will be a game changer for the regional aviation market, combining advanced aerodynamics and a disruptive propulsion technology,” said Martin Nuesseler in July 2024.

“Working together with Pratt & Whitney Canada at this stage of the programme will enable us to validate and optimise the design of the aircraft and hybrid-electric propulsion system, tapping into the full potential of this promising new technology.”

“Reaching the ambitious goals of reducing emissions and making aviation more sustainable will depend on combined efforts to accelerate technology innovation and drive collaboration across our industry,” responded Anthony Rossi, vice president, global sales and marketing, Pratt & Whitney Canada.

“It’s in this spirit that we will collaborate with Maeve, leveraging our growing expertise in sustainable propulsion technologies, as well as our unrivalled experience powering the regional aviation market for four decades.”

MAEVE states in its own publicity that the newly-launched Maeve Jet will feature two hybrid-electric powerplants with ’rotor swirl recovery vanes’ and continues to develop these engines in conjunction with Pratt & Whitney Canada.

Recent developments for MAEVE Aerospace

Following the announcement with Pratt & Whitney Canada on powerplant development, MAEVE revealed in November 2024 that it had entered into an agreement with Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Regional Jet Aviation Group (MHIRJ), where the companies agreed to cooperate with respect to the development of the Maeve Jet.

Under the agreement, MHIRJ will provide collaborative guidance in engineering and advisory services from MHIRJ’s team of regional aviation specialists.

More recently still, in June 2025, Japan Airlines (JAL) became the first major airline to come on board with the Maeve Jet project. With MAEVE, JAL Engineering signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the development of the Maeve Jet.

The partnership aims to “play a key role in optimising the aircraft’s specification and ensuring that it meets the economic and operational requirements essential for supporting the Japanese regional network,” said a MAEVE statement.

JAL is expected to contribute its expertise in areas such as aircraft design, operations, and the establishment of a customer support framework for the Maeve Jet program.

JAL is also to collaborate in developing a new aircraft design system focused on maintaining and enhancing the airworthiness and reliability of the Maeve Jet.

The long-term view is that the Maeve Jet, with its lower emissions, could play a key role in making regional airline operations throughout Japan cleaner and quieter.

“This partnership aligns with the JAL Group’s continuous commitment to revitalizing local communities while maintaining and expanding its network,” said a JAL statement.

“We are honoured to be working with Japan Airlines on this project, with whom we share the vision to develop solutions that can generate an early impact without relying only on decarbonised fuels and further investments in new infrastructure,” added MAEVE’s Martin Nuesseler.

Future aviation growth opens up potential for the Maeve Jet

The regional aircraft market is forecasted to grow well into the next two decades. This growth, according to MAEVE, will be driven by the need for larger aircraft passenger capacities in the 70-90 seat range, where incumbent aircraft are aging and there has not been a new aircraft in this range for many years.

Meanwhile, increasing globalisation, industrial growth, and rising volumes of air traffic are continuing to drive record levels of carbon dioxide and non-carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.

Along with its green credentials and lower operating costs than a conventional jet, MAEVE’s strategy is to access this market with a clean sheet aircraft design “that sets new standards in sustainability and economics.”

MAEVE is targeting the Maeve Jet’s first flight for late 2029, followed by an entry-into-service for late 2032 or early 2033. This will follow an integrated product development plan based on the company’s experience and certification process.

“At MAEVE, we believe efficiency is the most powerful lever for sustainable aviation. Our next-generation aircraft reduces fuel consumption and emissions by 40% using conventional fuel, and by up to 95% when operating with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).”

“The energy efficiency not only cuts environmental impact but also lowers operating costs, making SAF-powered operations economically viable for airlines and accessible for passengers,” concludes the company.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MV2-32.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 11:56:26.722737

Sustainable Flight

A New Era in Aviation

At Otto Aerospace, we’re not just building an aircraft — we’re redefining the physics of flight. Our revolutionary laminar flow design isn’t an incremental improvement; it’s a complete rethinking of aerodynamic efficiency. By minimizing drag at a level never before achieved in commercial aviation, Otto’s aircraft represents an entirely new category — one engineered for the future of sustainable air travel.

The Sustainability Revolution in Aviation

Laminar Flow

Aerospace has long been constrained by the inefficiencies of traditional aircraft design. Our full laminar flow technology is a game-changer, drastically reducing fuel burn while maintaining high performance. This isn’t just about making aviation more efficient — it’s about transforming it into a cleaner, more innovative industry.

Slashing Carbon Emissions at the Source

Reducing fuel consumption is the most effective way to reduce carbon emissions in aviation. Our aerodynamic breakthroughs deliver an unprecedented 35% reduction in drag, slashing fuel requirements by up to 60%. When combined with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Otto aircraft reduces carbon emissions by more than 90%. That means significantly lower CO₂ output per passenger-mile, setting a new benchmark for clean aviation.

The Phantom flies at 500 mph on laminar flow airfoils with similar carbon emissions to EVs at 50 mph on wheels.

Reducing Contrails for a Clearer Sky

Contrails are a byproduct of jet engines and contribute significantly to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere. By enabling more efficient cruising at optimized altitudes with lower fuel burn, our laminar flow aircraft eliminates contrail formation, helping to further mitigate aviation’s environmental impact.",https://ottoaerospace.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Otto-Aerospace-Web-Thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 14:56:09.254968

During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency.
Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.
The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III.","Aircraft designs serve specific purposes, and the C-17 Globemaster is no different. Let's examine its tail, for example. Basically, to make room for its rear loading operations, McDonnell Douglas built the C-17 Globemaster with a T-tail. This allowed it to transport large loads of equipment at airfields quickly with ease thanks to the clearance. Another benefit of the horizontal stabilizer positioned high on the vertical fin and the airflow is stability during mid-air drops when the open cargo doors disrupt the air stream. Keeping the elevator away from engine exhaust and turbulent airflow, it also ensures a cleaner flow over the tail surfaces, which makes it easier to fly.

T-tail designs were common in early jet aircraft, but the C-17 Globemaster's T-tail design adds to its stability. Its simplified design reduces considerations for aerodynamic interferences and offers greater short-field performance. The iconic jet was ground-breaking when it was announced in the 1980s. Its reliability, flexibility, and performance were game changers.

Multi-Mission By Design

The C-17’s exceptional capacity for both military and humanitarian missions transformed strategic airlift not only for the US Air Force but allied powers as well. Despite a handful of early design flaws and a challenging manufacturing spool up, the aircraft first went into service in 1993. The T-tail and high wing offer greater clearance at the rear for cargo loading, unloading, and airdrops.

The C-17's speed and payload for supporting forward operations, even on improvised and short fields, solidified its role as a powerful tool for projecting global power. The C-17's primary features are its high speed, ability to land on austere runways, its global range (with aerial refueling), and high reliability. Its versatility has proven highly valuable in carrying out missions beyond airlift, like humanitarian relief, aeromedical evacuation, and special operations.

Steady, predictable handling during complex flight maneuvers and expeditiously performing ground operations are crucial to the C-17’s missions. The high-wing configuration is also beneficial to the same two ends, as is the robust landing gear. McDonnell Douglas' earlier experimental aircraft, the YC-15, is the origin of the T-tail on the C-17. The prototype demonstrated short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities for operating in austere environments, becoming the model for the C-17.

The Best Handling At Any Altitude

The T-tail design of the C-17 offers benefits like improved stall condition management, maneuverability, and consistent elevator response under all conditions. Pitch and roll stability is optimized by the C-17 Globemaster's anhedral (downward sloping) high-wing design, especially when carrying a heavy payload. The wing aspect ratio and configuration aid in lowering lift-induced drag during flight, and performs well going “low and slow” at high angles of attack.

During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency. The aerodynamics of the wing minimize the effect of wingtip vortices to reduce drag and improve the big jet’s performance. Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.

Global Airlift Without Limits

Because the elevator’s airflow is less affected in the event of a stall, recovery is considerably easier to handle. A versatile and effective military transport aircraft, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster excels at handling large, heavy cargo and ensuring a steady elevator response.

Optimized For Short Fields

The C-17 can take off and land on runways as short as 3,500 feet (1,064 meters) and only 90 feet wide (27.4 meters). The plane can make a 180-degree star turn within 80 feet while on the ground, according to Air Force Technology. It is also capable of backing itself up with reverse thrust when on the ground. The directed flow thrust reversers can be used to go up a 2% gradient slope with a fully loaded aircraft.

The T-tail is designed to perform well both at low altitude during expeditionary missions and at cruise when the C-17 is transiting between air bases. Four 40,440-lb thrust Pratt & Whitney PW2040 turbofan engines, with engine thrust reversers and speed brakes, power the big jet. Its cruise speed is between Mach 0.74 and 0.77, and the range without in-flight refuelling is 2,400 nautical miles.

Aerial refuelling provides an intercontinental non-stop range that is virtually unlimited. The Globemaster III is capable of carrying payloads up to 77 tons. The aircraft has the capacity to carry 134 passengers, 102 paratroopers, six high-dependency medical patients or 36 stretcher patients, one CH-47F Chinook helicopter, or 18 military pallets.

Inside The Globemaster III

A variety of vehicles, palletized cargo, paratroopers, airdrop loads, and aeromedical evacuees can all be transported by the C-17 thanks to its cargo compartment. Three Black Hawk helicopters, four Bushmaster vehicles, and an Abrams tank are among the items that can be loaded into the cargo bay.

The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III. Four Honeywell multifunction cathode-ray tube displays, two full-capability HUDs, and cargo systems are all part of the digital avionics system.

There is also a mechanically operated backup system for the electronic flight control system, which is quadruple redundant. The Northrop Grumman large aircraft infra-red countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is equipped with 56 USAF C-17 aircraft, with 25 upgraded aircraft entering service in 2007.

Over Three Decades Of Service

Boeing was a part of the program from the beginning of the C-17 aircraft's development and manufacturing in 2006. McDonnell Douglas eventually merged with Boeing in 1997, which saw the program fall under its widened umbrella. Currently, there are 275 aircraft in the global C-17 fleet serving the USAF and allied nations, including the UK, Canada, Australia, India, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and the 12-nation Strategic Airlift Capability.

Despite Boeing's announcement that C-17 production would end in 2009 once existing orders were completed, the USAF was authorized to purchase 15 more aircraft in 2008. In July 2008, Qatar ordered two C-17s, and in February 2009, the UAE declared that it would purchase four C-17s in January 2010. Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense awarded a follow-on contract worth up to $2.26 billion to Boeing for the sustainment of the C-17 fleet.

The Indian Ministry of Defence signed a $4.1bn agreement with Boeing in June 2011 to acquire ten more C-1s. The C-17 met all the IAF's requirements during rigorous field evaluation trials held in India in June 2010. Kuwait purchased two C-17s in 2014, along with equipment and training support. The final Globemaster III left the company’s production facility in Long Beach, California, in November 2015, marking the end of the production after more than two decades.

Boeing, in partnership with Mahindra Defence Systems, opened a C-17 training centre in 2016 to serve the Indian Air Force (IAF), and signed an $8m contract to train C-17 aircrews at its international training centre (ITC) in the UK under the NATO Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) programme. It also trains Emirati C-17 students. Royal Air Force (RAF) C-17 engineers and aircrew are trained by Boeing at the C-17 International Training Centre (ITC) in Farnborough, United Kingdom.

The C-17 Goes Green

In 2021, Boeing told its defense customers that its military aircraft can run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) up to a 50% blend with conventional fuel. There are no technical problems with Boeing defense aircraft using synthetic aviation turbine fuels. All defense aircraft manufactured by Boeing and their derivatives were covered by the study as well. So on top of the smooth, steady, efficient flying that its T-tail and high wing deliver, it can run on eco-friendly fuel too.

When compared to conventional jet fuel, unblended, or ""neat"" SAF, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 84%. It also presents the industry's biggest opportunity to cut carbon over the next 30 years across all aviation segments. At the moment, a 50/50 blend with traditional fossil fuels is the highest amount of SAF that can be used in the C-17 and other Boeing military aircraft.

Brigadier General Darren Cole, Air Mobility Command (AMC) director of Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection, commented on the SAF program:

""The C-17 continues to serve as the strategic airlift workhorse for the nation, as evidenced by its impressive performance in the recent airlift of more than 124,000 evacuees from Afghanistan in an around-the-clock operation. As the command responsible for operating the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet, AMC looks forward to the continued partnership with our Boeing teammates as we work to keep the Globemaster fleet healthy for years to come.""

Boeing has been a pioneer in making SAF a reality and has a long track record of advancing alternative fuels. In 2010, the company collaborated with the US Air Force on an in-depth fuel study as part of their efforts to certify the C-17 Globemaster to use SAF blends. The same year, Boeing also helped make possible the supersonic flight of a US Navy F/A-18F ""Green Hornet"" on a 50/50 SAF blend.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/why-did-mcdonnell-douglas-build-the-c-17-globemaster-with-a-t-tail.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-14 01:56:08.269599

The Bleisure Trend: Business Meets Leisure A notable trend in MENA’s business travel market is the rise of “bleisure” — a blend of business and leisure travel.
Sustainable Growth and Innovation As MENA’s business travel sector continues to grow, sustainability efforts are being prioritised.
This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.","Business travel is expanding significantly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which is already well on its way to becoming a global centre for corporate mobility. MENA is establishing itself as a top corporate travel destination as companies continue to turn their attention to emerging markets. The industry is growing faster than the global average, which is paving the way for a significant shift in the travel industry in the area.

Steady Growth and Investment Surge

In 2024, the MENA corporate travel sector was expected to reach a value of $18.1 billion, with a projected 6.1% year-on-year growth in 2025. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are increasingly aware of the region’s immense potential, pouring capital into its rapidly developing infrastructure. In fact, MENA’s business travel bookings saw a significant 40% surge in early 2025 compared to the last quarter of 2024, with the months of April and May marking peak travel periods post-Ramadan.

As global business increasingly turns its attention to the Middle East, projections suggest that the broader market will reach $270.8 billion by 2030. This growth will be propelled by continued infrastructure development, digital innovation, and strengthened economic ties with Europe and Asia, creating a fertile environment for both business and leisure travel.

Key Drivers of Growth

A major contributor to MENA’s expanding business travel market is the economic momentum seen in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. These economies are projected to grow by 4.2% in 2025-2026, compared to around 1.5% in Europe. A significant portion of this growth is being driven by diversification and expansion beyond oil and gas, particularly in sectors like technology, finance, and tourism.

One of the key drivers of the corporate travel boom is the massive infrastructure projects taking place in Saudi Arabia. Projects like Neom, Qiddiya, and the Red Sea development are attracting global talent, particularly consultants, engineers, and project managers. As these initiatives continue to unfold, they are expected to further bolster the demand for business travel in the region.

The Bleisure Trend: Business Meets Leisure

A notable trend in MENA’s business travel market is the rise of “bleisure” — a blend of business and leisure travel. In fact, 25% of business travellers are now extending their trips to incorporate leisure activities, particularly younger generations who prioritise work-life balance. This shift has prompted airlines such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Etihad, and Saudia to enhance their in-flight and ground services, offering more flexible and comfortable travel options to cater to this growing segment.

In response to the increased demand for bleisure travel, regional airlines have introduced new features such as lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible dining and entertainment options. This has made it easier for business travellers to balance work commitments with relaxation and exploration during their trips.

Sustainable Growth and Innovation

As MENA’s business travel sector continues to grow, sustainability efforts are being prioritised. The region is increasingly balancing expansion with environmental responsibility, incorporating carbon dioxide (CO₂) tracking and AI-powered cost optimisation tools into corporate travel operations. Platforms like Tumodo are now offering businesses the ability to forecast spending, track emissions, and ensure eco-friendly travel routes. This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.

In line with regional goals to achieve net-zero emissions, several countries within MENA — including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar — have set ambitious sustainability targets. The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel, along with the use of green-certified hotels and infrastructure, is becoming a key part of corporate travel strategies in these countries.

Tech and Infrastructure: Key to Success

Alongside sustainability efforts, the role of technology in enhancing business travel experiences cannot be overstated. MENA is seeing a rise in digital platforms that support business mobility, such as travel booking services and logistics management systems, which help streamline corporate travel operations. The region’s investment in technology is paving the way for greater efficiency, transparency, and convenience in business travel.

Simultaneously, the physical infrastructure required to meet growing demand for corporate travel is being developed at a rapid pace. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is investing heavily in airport expansions, new rail projects, and hotel developments. This has created a robust pipeline of infrastructure projects, attracting both local and international investors.

Challenges and Investment Opportunities

While MENA’s business travel sector presents significant investment opportunities, investors are being cautioned to assess potential risks carefully. The massive scale of ongoing mega-projects presents a risk of market imbalance, especially if demand growth fails to keep up with infrastructure development. Furthermore, potential regulatory shifts related to visas, taxation, and ownership laws could affect the returns on investment.

For businesses seeking to capitalise on the region’s growth, there is a clear opportunity to invest in both physical infrastructure — including hotels, event spaces, and transportation hubs — as well as digital solutions that support business travel operations. However, investors must also consider the possibility of overcapacity in one area and shortages in another if infrastructure development does not keep pace with demand.

Future Outlook: A Global Leader in Business Travel

With its combination of economic diversification, cutting-edge technology, and sustainability initiatives, MENA is solidifying its position as a global leader in the business travel industry as it continues to expand. Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to spearhead this change with its Vision 2030 initiative and a strong emphasis on logistics, infrastructure, and tourism.

How well the area can serve the needs of both business and leisure travellers in the years to come will depend on its capacity to strike a balance between rapid growth, environmental responsibility, and technological innovation. As of right now, MENA continues to be a vibrant and alluring travel, business, and investment destination.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MENA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 01:56:11.747259

Conclusion: A Sustainable and More Efficient Future of Travel Air passengers anticipating long-distance trips will appreciate the service entry of the Airbus A350F for more than just its technological marvels.","Long-haul fliers wanting flights that are more economical and environmentally friendly might be interested in the latest innovation now being tested in Toulouse, France, home to the latest development of Airbus. The aerospace-friendly city in France is currently constructing the new Airbus A350F freighter, the first of its kind in the new generation of freighter aircraft. Designed and built with a focus on sustainability and operational efficiency, Toulouse officials state it might have a major impact on both cargo and passenger travel in the next decade.

Toulouse has currently become the central hub of aircraft construction in France. The A350F, a derivation of the passenger A350-1000 model, is modified to satisfy the increasing requirement for sustainable aircraft. Major sections of the fuselage from construction plants all over France and Germany are now being assembled in Toulouse. Their architectural design, set out by the government’s aviation authorities, is built around emissions and fuel efficiency on a global scale.

Sustainable Aviation in the Center of Aviation

According to company officials, the A350F is likely the only choice an airline is likely to make when upgrading its fleet. This is due to its compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 2027 CO2 emission. It is, however, designed with cutting-edge features that let it remain far more efficient than its predecessors. Beyond the Rolls-Royce Trent, the A350F offers 2a 0% reduction in consumption, while the other freighters remain unchanged. More than that, with these planes in service, it offers passengers way more options.

In addition, government reports claim that the reduction in cost due to the A350F will indirectly cater to the needs of the consumers. Citizens, especially those living close to the airports, will benefit more than those boarding the flights. The quieter features of the aircraft can reduce pollution levels. Consumers newly introduced to airplanes, who have been disturbed by loud airplanes, will appreciate this feature. It is a huge step in improving aviation.

Elevating Passenger and Cargo Experiences

Even though the A350F is designed for the features that enhance the cargo operations, the design also aids in the passenger logistics by making air freight faster and more dependable. The aircraft is equipped with the class’s largest main deck cargo doors, which afford the airline the ability to carry goods along with passenger services. Transport analysts opine that smoother cargo operations could translate to essential goods such as e-commerce parcels and time-sensitive items being delivered faster to travelers, thus assisting the travelers indirectly.

The Aircraft can carry 111 tonnes and travel 4,700 nautical miles, which is suitable for long-haul to destinations such as Tokyo, Singapore, and Europe. The more recent governmental transport reports indicate that the development and incorporation of innovative flights into the airline fleets results in more accurate schedules and fewer delays overall. This enhances the overall passenger travel experience.

More Environmentally Friendly Routes and Worldwide Communique

With the support of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program, the A350F is certified to use up to 50% of SAF and plans to reach 100% use by 2030. Aviation authorities believe this is vital for cutting the carbon footprint of aviation. Passengers of long-haul flights may enjoy some positive environmental impacts of this aircraft, especially on transcontinental flights between Europe, Asia, and North America.

The government says Toulouse’s aerospace center has become a hub for cutting-edge innovation, with projects like the A350F and other aircraft technologies helping boost the country’s green transport objectives. Officials believe the A350F’s cockpit and cabin could provide seamless improvements to the environmental and operational aspects of the flights and services offered for the served cities.

Reducing Workload and Improving Well-Being for Users

Airbus has partnered with some cargo and airlines operating the A350F to ensure the aircraft is designed for operational efficiency and versatility. These include optimal fuselage volume, floor reinforcements for heavy loads, and variable configuration loading systems that improve indirect passenger travel by flight. These examples of sustainable infrastructure, in addition to making airline travel easier, also contribute to the center of travel systems that encourage new mindsets and systems.

Based on reports from authorities, the A350 passenger family has already logged millions of flight hours and the cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and maintenance practices lessens the cost of training for the airline and streamlines the service offered to the users of the airlines. The airline’s ability to stick to the timetable offers passengers on routes served by the A350F improved reliability and comfort, with airlines better able to maintain timetables and minimize disruptions.

Impact on Travel and Logistics in the World

Airbus A350F is a construction milestone for the airline’s modernization because of the ability to combine flexible freighter and eco-sustainability. The more advanced the fleet, the better equipped the airline will be to provide its passengers with global connectivity through safe, reliable, and eco-friendly travel in response to the global trade and e-commerce boom, coupled with heightened environmental policies.

While airlines are adopting such freighters to respond to the growing global trade, e-commerce boom, and stricter environmental policies, travelers can expect comfort alongside lesser emissions as the assembled A350F, with test flights scheduled for 2026, will be ready, thanks to airlines. The airline’s industry in Toulouse regards the A350F as an indication of the aviation streamline of the future, merging the technological advancements in travel with the benefits brought to its passengers.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target Net Zero Emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).

Seluruh upaya tersebut sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.

Sebelumnya, semester pertama 2025, PT Pertamina (Persero) mampu meningkatkan kinerja operasional dan menjaga kinerja keuangan tetap positif. Penguatan kinerja operasional Pertamina dilakukan dalam rangka mendorong tercapainya swasembada energi untuk mencapai pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia, sesuai target Asta Cita Pemerintah Indonesia.

Hal tersebut disampaikan Direktur Utama PT Pertamina (Persero) Simon Aloysius Mantiri bersama seluruh jajaran direksi Holding dan Subholding Pertamina, pada Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP) dengan Komisi VI DPR RI, di Jakarta, Kamis 11 September 2025.

Hingga Juli 2025, Simon mengungkapkan, Pertamina berhasil menjaga produksi migas di atas 1 juta barrel setara minyak per hari (BOEPD). Pertamina juga berhasil meningkatkan cadangan migas baru untuk mendukung ketahanan energi secara berkelanjutan.

“Pertamina mencatat beberapa capaian, di antaranya temuan cadangan migas baru sebesar 724 juta barrel setara minyak (MMBOE) di wilayah kerja Rokan,” ujar Simon.

Simon menegaskan, pada periode paruh pertama tahun 2025, Pertamina telah berhasil menjalankan berbagai program strategis seperti memproduksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pertama di Asia Tenggara dengan kapasitas produksi 9,000 Barrel per Day, pengoperasian Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Panas Bumi (PLTP) Lumut Balai dengan kapasitas 800 GWh serta revitalisasi tangki Arun dengan kapasitas 127.200 m³ yang ditargetkan selesai pada akhir 2025.

“Pertamina SAF merupakan bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan yang dihasilkan melalui teknologi co-processing antara Kerosene (minyak tanah) dan Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah. Ekosistem bisnis UCO SAF bukan hanya mendukung swasembada energi nasional namun juga mampu mendorong perekonomian mikro dan ekonomi sirkuler,” ujar Simon.

Program strategis lainnya adalah menjalankan proyek Palawan di Filipina dengan kapasitas 285 MW serta meluncurkan Pertamax Green 95 di 160 outlet dengan volume penjualan 4,83 ribu KL sampai dengan bulan Juli 2025.

Pertamina juga berhasil menjaga kinerja keuangan tetap positif meskipun menghadapi penurunan parameter yang signifikan pada harga minyak mentah, solar, dan kurs Dolar AS dibandingkan dengan periode 2024.

Simon mengungkapkan, hingga Juli 2025, Pertamina mencatat pendapatan USD 40,9 miliar atau setara Rp 672 Triliun, dengan EBITDA USD 6,2 miliar (setara Rp 102,8 Triliun).

“Pertamina mampu mempertahankan kinerja keuangan dan operasional yang handal melalui berbagai upaya dan respon strategis,” tambahnya.

As from 2028, the Company will be able to produce more than half a million tons of SAF a year to cover the increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030.

TotalEnergies will be able to supply SAF more than 10% of the jet fuel volumes it will market in Europe, ahead of the European mandate set at 6% in 2030.

“TotalEnergies is taking action to meet the strong demand from the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuels are essential to bring the air industry’s CO2 emissions down immediately. Their development is fully aligned with our approach to get to net zero, together with society,” said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies. “For ten years, we have been pioneering and investing in biorefineries and developing coprocessing in our refineries.”

TotalEnergies, pioneering SAF production

The Grandpuits biorefinery: Thanks to a €500 million investment, TotalEnergies transforms its site into a zero-crude platform, including a biorefinery with a production capacity of 230,000 tons a year of SAF in 2026. TotalEnergies has joined force with SARIA, the European leader in the collection and recovery of organic materials, which will supply the majority of the feedstock supply.

The La Mède biorefinery: This year, La Mède will produce 15,000 tons of SAF for distribution to airports in the south of France.

The Normandy refinery: TotalEnergies has begun coprocessing SAF at its Normandy platform. Coprocessing involves the treatment of both fossil jet fuel and biomass in a standard refining unit. The site’s annual production capacity is 160,000 tons.

The Antwerp refinery in Belgium: An initial project to co-process 50,000 tons a year of SAF was launched this year. Annual production capacity will subsequently be increased to 80,000 tons a year.

The Leuna refinery in Germany: A coprocessing project for 50,000 tons a year is planned for 2026.

Total Energies, supplying SAF to customers in the air industry

TotalEnergies supplies aviation fuels including SAF, in line with blending mandates and the needs of its customers. Those customers include several airlines:Air France-KLM, with whom the Company has signed a major deal to deliver up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over ten years. This is one of the Group’s largest SAF supply contracts.

Volotea, which has also signed to buy SAF from TotalEnergies until 2029, in order to reduce the emissions of its flights out of several French airports

TotalEnergies also supplies SAF-blended aviation fuel to several French airports, including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris-Le Bourget, Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Nazaire.

TotalEnergies, a partner committed to SAF research

TotalEnergies is also forging partnerships with aerospace groups to accelerate the sector’s decarbonization. Those partnerships are playing a critical role in understanding the impact of sustainable aviation fuel composition on aircraft, especially for blends of over 50%. They include:

A partnership with Airbus, signed in 2024, to supply over half the company’s needs in Europe, and conduct a shared R&D program to develop fully sustainable fuels.

A partnership with Safran, begun in 2021, that led to the formulation of a SAF that was completely compatible with current aircraft and was used to power a flight by a military helicopter in February 2023.

TotalEnergies is also stepping up its R&D effort, especially in feedstock, which remains one of the challenges to increasing SAF production. The Solaize research center in Lyon has specialist teams coordinating this work.",,N,,2025-09-14 10:56:10.268541

Los países que producen biodiésel principalmente a partir de aceite de soja son Estados Unidos, Argentina, Brasil y algunos de la UE.
Uno de los grandes retos para que colza, carinata y camelina despeguen en Argentina es la articulación de la cadena de valor.
En ese contexto, cultivos como colza, carinata y camelina pueden convertirse en piezas clave.
La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar.","Queridos lectores de LT9, hoy con Marcelo Kusznierz los invitamos a conocer un grupo de cultivos que en los últimos años se están abriendo camino en nuestros campos y también en las discusiones sobre el futuro de la agricultura. Se trata de la colza (Brassica napus var. oleifera), la carinata (Brassica carinata) y la camelina (Camelina sativa). Tres especies oleaginosas que, aunque emparentadas en algunos casos y con historias distintas, comparten un denominador común: su capacidad de diversificar las rotaciones, aportar sustentabilidad y generar productos de alto valor, desde aceites alimenticios hasta biocombustibles de última generación.

La colza tiene un largo recorrido en Europa y Canadá. Allí se la conoce más por su versión mejorada: la canola, que fue seleccionada en los años 70 para reducir el ácido erúcico y los glucosinolatos, lo que permitió su uso masivo en alimentación humana.

En los últimos 10 años las materias primas más utilizadas en la producción de biodiésel fueron los aceites vegetales, entre los cuales se destacan el de palma, el de soja y el de canola. Los países que producen biodiésel principalmente a partir de aceite de soja son Estados Unidos, Argentina, Brasil y algunos de la UE.

El aceite de canola, como insumo para su elaboración, se encuentra muy difundido en la UE, mientras que el de palma es muy utilizado en Colombia, Indonesia y el resto del sudeste asiático.

En la actualidad aproximadamente el 20% de la producción mundial de aceite de canola, así como el 19 % del de aceite de soja y el 18% del de aceite de palma se destinó a la producción de biodiésel, marcando la importancia de la plantación de colza a nivel global para los biocombustibles.

En Argentina, la colza comenzó a sembrarse tímidamente en los años 90 y tuvo un fuerte impulso en la última década, especialmente en la región pampeana, como alternativa de invierno frente al trigo.

La carinata, por su parte, es menos conocida. Se trata de una especie originaria de Etiopía, emparentada con la colza pero adaptada a climas más cálidos y secos. En nuestro país se la está probando en varias provincias con muy buenos resultados, sobre todo porque presenta tolerancia a altas temperaturas y genera un aceite ideal para la producción de biocombustibles de aviación (SAF: Sustainable Aviation Fuel), un sector con gran potencial de crecimiento.

Los combustibles sostenibles para aviación se definen como combustibles derivados de materias primas biológicas o no fósiles, que pueden sustituir o complementar a los combustibles para aviación derivados del petróleo, reduciendo las emisiones de GEI a lo largo del ciclo de vida del producto.

Según la AIE (Agencia Internacional de la Energía), mezclar biocombustibles sostenibles para la aviación de bajo contenido de carbono con combustible fósil para aviones será esencial para alcanzar el objetivo de descarbonización. Esto se refleja en su Escenario de Desarrollo Sostenible, donde se prevé que en 2030 los biocombustibles suplirán alrededor del 10 % de la demanda de combustible de aviación y, en 2040, cerca del 20 %. Asimismo, la IRENA (2020), en su “Transforming Energy Scenario”, estima que en 2050 el consumo de biojet llegará a los 100.000.000 m3, siendo los biocombustibles la única opción disponible para reducir significativamente las emisiones de dicho sector.

La camelina, finalmente, es una vieja conocida de la agricultura europea. Hay registros de su cultivo desde hace más de 3.000 años en zonas como Escandinavia y el Mediterráneo. Durante mucho tiempo quedó relegada, pero en la última década resurgió por sus notables ventajas: ciclo corto, rusticidad, bajo requerimiento de insumos y un aceite rico en ácidos grasos omega-3. Al igual que carinata tiene como destino principal el biocombustible.

Tanto la camelina como la carinata son materias primas utilizables para la producción de SAF, de acuerdo al proceso productivo de este combustible podemos detallar su correspondiente porcentaje de mezcla, procesos tecnológicos aprobados a través de la norma ASTM para la fabricación, su año de aprobación, las posibles materias primas por utilizar y el volumen máximo de mezcla con combustibles fósiles.

Aspectos agronómicos

Colza

Ciclo: 120 a 150 días.

Siembra: otoño, compitiendo directamente con trigo.

Requerimientos: necesita suelos bien drenados y buena fertilización nitrogenada y sulfatada.

Ventajas: excelente antecesor para soja de segunda, alta producción de biomasa que mejora la estructura del suelo.

Rindes: en Argentina varían entre 1.5 y 3 toneladas por hectárea, con picos superiores en condiciones óptimas.

Carinata

Ciclo: similar a la colza, aunque con mayor rusticidad.

Siembra: otoño-invierno, con adaptabilidad a ambientes más marginales.

Requerimientos: menos exigente que la colza en agua y fertilidad.

Ventajas: tolera altas temperaturas y sequía, genera un aceite con gran estabilidad oxidativa.

Rindes: entre 1 y 2.5 toneladas por hectárea en experiencias locales.

Camelina

Ciclo: muy corto, 85 a 100 días.

Siembra: puede implantarse a fines de invierno o principios de primavera.

Requerimientos: se adapta a suelos pobres y ambientes semiáridos.

Ventajas: bajo costo de implantación, rusticidad, posibilidad de entrar en nichos de rotación poco aprovechados.

Rindes: de 800 a 1.800 kg/ha, aunque con gran variabilidad.

Más allá de los mercados, estos cultivos aportan beneficios en el sistema que me parecen indispensables para una agricultura que piensa en un todo:

Diversifican las rotaciones y reducen la presión de malezas resistentes.

Son aliados frente a la huella de carbono: fijan CO₂ y, al destinarse a biocombustibles, reducen las emisiones netas del transporte.

Generan un uso más eficiente de la tierra, al ocupar ventanas de barbecho invernal.

En países como Canadá y Alemania, la colza ya forma parte estable del esquema agrícola. En Argentina, aunque todavía son cultivos de nicho, representan una oportunidad para productores que buscan diversificación y nuevas fuentes de ingreso.

Uno de los grandes retos para que colza, carinata y camelina despeguen en Argentina es la articulación de la cadena de valor. Se necesitan más acopios que reciban estas oleaginosas, más industrias dispuestas a procesarlas y, sobre todo, reglas claras de fomento a los biocombustibles avanzados.

En este sentido las Cámaras de Biocombustibles de Argentina están haciendo enormes esfuerzos para lograr un nuevo marco normativo, una nueva ley que potencie la producción de “combustibles del futuro” como pudo lograr nuestro principal socio comercial del Mercosur, Brasil, con potencialidades muy similares a las locales.

En la provincia de Santa Fe, por ejemplo, existen proyectos piloto con estos tres cultivos vinculados a universidades y empresas que trabajan en bioenergía. Estos ensayos muestran que hay potencial, pero que sin políticas activas y mercados garantizados es difícil que el productor se arriesgue a cambiar parte de su esquema productivo.

La agricultura global se enfrenta a un doble desafío: producir más alimentos y energía, y hacerlo con menos impacto ambiental. En ese contexto, cultivos como colza, carinata y camelina pueden convertirse en piezas clave. No reemplazarán a la soja ni al maíz, pero sí pueden ser complementos estratégicos.

En un mundo que avanza hacia la descarbonización, la demanda de biocombustibles de aviación crecerá de manera exponencial, y allí Argentina tiene la chance de posicionarse. Lo mismo con la camelina, cuyo aceite puede conquistar mercados premium de alimentos y cosmética.

Queridos lectores, la agricultura es movimiento constante, y quienes estamos en el sector sabemos que el futuro se construye sumando alternativas. La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar. Son cultivos con historia, con presente y, sobre todo, con un futuro prometedor si logramos integrarlos en nuestros sistemas productivos.

La pregunta que queda abierta es: ¿seremos capaces, como país, de darles el espacio y el impulso que necesitan?",https://www.lt9.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/camelina_corza_carinata.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 20:56:26.841238

Airbus redesigned the A350 program as the clean-sheet Airbus A350XWB, and US Airways actually elected to expand the deal to 22 Airbus A350 XWBs between 2007 and 2008.
In July 2016, American Airlines pushed the Airbus A350 stream to late 2018 through 2022, with deferrals averaging 26 months.
Namely, the model delivered the highest satisfaction scores of any jet within the American Airlines fleet.
For starters, the Boeing 777X seems to be a far more natural replacement for the older-generation Boeing 777s already in the American Airlines fleet.","The Airbus A350 has long been identified as one of the widebody jets most likely to have an impact on airline fleet development for decades to come. The model, built in an industry-leading manner from unique composite materials, is capable of delivering a combination of range and capacity simply unmatched by any other model on the market today.

It is with these factors in mind that most major international carriers have worked the Airbus A350 into their long-term fleet development plans. Even long-time holdouts, such as Chicago-based United Airlines, have eventually shifted their mindset towards operating the twin-engine aircraft. American Airlines, however, has been a noteworthy exception.

We analyze the principal factors driving American's decision not to operate the Airbus A350, stemming primarily from the fact that other aircraft meet the jet's needs better. American Airlines had an Airbus A350 order in the past, but an interesting set of factors pushed the carrier to cancel this commitment. There are currently no plans to acquire A350 jets in the future, and the airline views its future exclusively in the hands of the manufacturer, Boeing, when it comes to widebody fleet development.

A Brief Overview Of The A350's Role In The Market

We view the Airbus A350 as the long-haul workhorse of choice for most major airlines, as it pairs an impressive range with lower trip and per-seat costs. An aircraft largely built from carbon-fiber composites and powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, the aircraft burns significantly less fuel than most previous-generation widebody jets, helping carriers hit their margin targets while also lowering emissions output with a relatively large aircraft.

The Airbus A350-900 serves long-and-thin routes while the larger Airbus A350-1000 targets large trunk markets in need of additional seats. This gives airlines a capable two-sized aircraft family that offers shared training and maintenance capabilities. We also see the aircraft's elevated level of passenger comfort through providing cabin pressurization and humidity improvement, as a key catalyst supporting the aircraft's generation of premium yields. From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A350 slots between the Boeing 787 and the larger Boeing 777/777X family, allowing airlines to find a right-sized aircraft that suits their capacity needs at a particular moment in time.

The aircraft also has an ultra-long range variant, one which is currently used exclusively by Singapore Airlines, that helps airlines link far-flung destinations which would have otherwise required stopovers. This helps support network differentiation and premium schedule capacity growth. The upcoming Airbus A350F extends the platform into the cargo market, helping replace older-generation freighters facing environmental restrictions. With sustainable aviation fuel compatibility and continued tweaks to its performance capabilities in the works, we see the A350 as a credible long-haul backbone that can be used by carriers to balance the needs of hub-to-hub and point-to-point missions. Lessors see the aircraft as an incredibly valuable asset for roughly the same reasons.

An A350 Order Inherited From US Airways

US Airways first committed to purchasing the Airbus A350 in 2005, penning an order for 20 aircraft in order to support an anticipated long-haul network expansion that would begin following its emergence from a restructuring process. Airbus redesigned the A350 program as the clean-sheet Airbus A350XWB, and US Airways actually elected to expand the deal to 22 Airbus A350 XWBs between 2007 and 2008. This included a Trent XWB engine selection with Rolls-Royce. In 2013, American Airlines merged with US Airways, transferring the order to the newly united carrier, according to reports from Reuters.

Initially, American Airlines planned the first deliveries of its A350 models between 2017 and 2018, with management electing twice to defer the schedule in order to manage capital spending and better preserve network flexibility with an international demand picture increasingly softening. In July 2016, American Airlines pushed the Airbus A350 stream to late 2018 through 2022, with deferrals averaging 26 months. The airline was looking for capital expense relief of around $500 million in 2017, which grew to $700 million in 2018.

Starting in April 2017, American Airlines began to move its first deliveries even further back to 2020, effectively turning this year-old commitment into essentially a perpetually unactivated option that the airline continued to avoid actually exercising. During this period, American Airlines was introducing Boeing 787s into its fleet, as well as refreshing its legacy widebody jets. The Airbus A350 was still a credible pathway for the airline's long-term fleet development, but it was becoming increasingly deprioritized.

Pulling The Plug In 2018

On April 6, 2018, American Airlines elected to terminate its order for 22 Airbus A350-900 jets, instead placing a new order for 47 Boeing 787s, including 22 787-8s, which arrived starting in 2020 and 25 787–9 models, which began arriving in 2023, according to Boeing. An additional 28 options were also secured by the carrier. We see this move as a calculated play taken by American Airlines to simplify its overall fleet strategy, including the shrinkage of the number of widebody types that American would be operating. The carrier quickly moved to retire the Boeing 767-300, the Airbus A330-300, and the aging Boeing 777-200ER, all in an attempt to simplify the carrier's fleet and reduce operating costs.

The American Airlines management team highlighted the Boeing 787's fuel-burning and maintenance advantages over the aircraft it was replacing, and that the aircraft's range was an ideal fit for American's network. We see another factor as a crucial element of American's decision-making process here. Namely, the model delivered the highest satisfaction scores of any jet within the American Airlines fleet. From a financial perspective, this decision was already locked in as a replacement order, which helped the airline limit capital expenses, after several rounds of Airbus A350 deferrals shifted cash towards where it was needed most.

American Airlines publicly thanked both manufacturers for aggressively marketing its jets, including the Airbus A330neo. However, the management team ultimately settled on the Dreamliner as the model that optimized operational and economic benefits while also establishing a growing Boeing 787 subfleet. This fleet standardization choice was, in our eyes, no technical indictment of the Airbus A350 as a model but rather a move that helped the airline better align its strategic and financial priorities.

What Is The Longer-Term Picture?

While we see American's decision in 2018 to cancel its original purchase of the Airbus A350 as driven by the need to reprioritize medium-term cash flows, we do believe that there were multiple long-term reasons why the decision was beneficial for the airline. For starters, the simplification of the airline's fleet offered a number of benefits which management was keen to realize. Specifically, operating fewer widebody jets allowed the airline to train employees on fewer different types of jets, keep fewer spare parts in store, and easily swap jets in its network. Expanding the airline's Boeing 787 fleet also delivered a number of scale-based benefits, with a small A350 subfleet mostly being a large cost burden on the airline.

A second factor we see as important in this decision is not just short-term cash flow reallocation but also long-term balance sheet discipline. The 2016–2017 deferrals of these orders demonstrated the airline's interest in lowering capital expenses, but in doing so, it also preserved the airline's long-term financial flexibility. The decision to focus on just one manufacturer and retire older, expensive aircraft helped the airline rebalance its assets and liabilities.

Beyond this, we do see the Boeing 787 as the ideal fit for American's transpacific and transatlantic networks, where the vast majority of long-haul revenue is generated. The aircraft is liked by customers, and it provides the optimal combination of range and risk that American Airlines was looking for. Through this introduction, the carrier also avoided the risks associated with introducing a new type of aircraft to its increasingly complex fleet.

Could This Have Been A Mistake?

While we do believe that the Airbus A350 would have been a weaker choice for American's broader network expansion plans, we see some benefits which could have eventually been realized had American Airlines elected to push forward with A350 fleet development. The aircraft is the most efficient large widebody in service today, with the Boeing 777X still sitting at least a year away.

The A350's exceptional reputation for passenger comfort could have been very useful for American today. The carrier is broadly lagging behind United and Delta in terms of premium network capacity and reputation for passenger comfort.

The jet itself is also exceptionally suited to certain kinds of high-density ultra-long-haul routes, which would be more effectively served by an A350 than the Boeing 787. The airline still lags its competitors in many ultra-long-haul markets.

Could American Order The A350 In The Future?

Just because American Airlines canceled its A350 orders in the past does not mean it could not order the jet again in the future. However, this seems relatively unlikely.

For starters, the Boeing 777X seems to be a far more natural replacement for the older-generation Boeing 777s already in the American Airlines fleet. The carrier also has a strong relationship with manufacturer Boeing, which it clearly is not thinking about changing.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bpeing-787-at-mia.jpeg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-13 16:56:13.164989

The sector is expanding faster than the global average — reaching $18.1 billion in 2024 and projected to grow 6.1 percent year on year in 2025, according to a report by UAE-based travel platform Tumodo. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are already taking note of the region’s transformative potential.

MENA’s business travel bookings surged 40 percent in early 2025 compared with late 2024, with April and May marking the busiest months post-Ramadan.

The broader market is expected to hit $270.8 billion by 2030, fueled by infrastructure development, digital innovation, and deepening economic ties with Europe and Asia.

“The impressive 50 percent year-on-year growth we’ve seen this year signals a shift from recovery to reinvention,” said Stan Klyuy, chief commercial officer of Tumodo, in the report, noting that average airfares are down by 12 percent and hotel bookings up by 2 percent.

Rita Raad, senior principal of strategy and transformation of the public sector at FTI Consulting, explained in an interview with Arab News: “The 40 percent surge in business travel bookings to MENA in the first half of 2025 reflects a powerful mix of regional momentum and shifting global priorities.”

She added: “Much of this growth is driven by the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), where the economy is projected to grow 4.2 percent in 2025-26 compared to about 1.5 percent in Europe, fueled by 3.7 percent non-oil sector expansion and diversification efforts.”

Oil and gas, technology, and finance remain the biggest corporate travel drivers, according to Raad, while Saudi Arabia’s giga-projects continue to draw waves of consultants, engineers, and operators.

Hassan Malik, tourism and sport consulting leader and partner at Deloitte Middle East, told Arab News that the region is indeed “witnessing a remarkable rebound and reinvention in corporate travel.”

A key catalyst of business travel growth, according to Malik, is “the influx of mega-projects and infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, like Qiddiya, Neom, and the Red Sea project, drawing global business and investment interest.”

Meshal Al-Faras, head of Middle East, Africa and Central Asia at Janus Henderson, told Arab News: “We are seeing a sustained shift in how international companies and investors view this region, and Saudi Arabia is a clear driver of that momentum.”

He added: “The objectives of Vision 2030 are being implemented at scale across infrastructure, logistics, finance and tourism. That level of clarity and execution attracts interest from global organizations that want to grow in a stable and high-potential market.”

Travel trends

According to Tumodo’s report, Saudi Arabia led as the top destination for users of the platform, accounting for 20 percent of all travel, followed by the UK at 15 percent, and France and India each at 10 percent.

Regional airlines Emirates, Turkish Airlines, and Qatar Airways dominated preferences, while India emerged as the most affordable route and the UK as the premium choice.

Regarding the trend for bleisure — trips that blend business with leisure — Raad noted: “The concept of bleisure continues to shape corporate mobility in MENA, with 25 percent of business travelers now extending their stays for leisure, especially among younger generations prioritizing work-life balance.”

She mentioned that airlines such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, Emirates, and Saudia were responding by enhancing their in-flight and ground services to cater to bleisure travelers.

These upgrades included features such as fully lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible entertainment and dining options, enabling passengers to work comfortably and relax during flights and transit.

Malik said that bleisure has now become mainstream, with many travelers extending work trips for personal time or combining them with relaxation. He noted that business travelers are increasingly staying longer to explore local destinations.

“Airlines are responding by introducing premium economy offerings, enhanced Wi-Fi, and flexible stopover packages, and Emirates and Etihad also now routinely promote wellness and sightseeing add-ons,” added Malik.

Al-Faras commented that the idea of business travel being limited to boardrooms no longer reflects how people operate, adding that executives want both flexibility and quality when they travel.

He added: “In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, we are seeing that expectation being met with strong investment in premium hospitality, high service standards, and facilities that allow people to work and relax in the same setting.”

Sustainability and tech

On sustainability efforts, Raad explained that MENA’s business travel sector is increasingly balancing growth with sustainability by embedding CO2 tracking and AI-driven cost optimization into corporate travel operations.

“Platforms like Tumodo now let companies forecast spending, measure emissions, and enforce eco-friendly routing — optimizing for shorter flights, sustainable hotels, and consolidated itineraries — and delivering emissions reductions of up to 20 percent,” she added.

Malik added that sustainability is becoming central to corporate travel strategy in MENA, noting that national targets in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar all aim for net-zero emissions in the coming decades through Vision 2030 and national energy strategies. He emphasized that “sustainability is increasingly core to corporate travel strategy in MENA.”

Malik noted that businesses are aligning procurement, travel, and logistics with green standards, prioritizing local suppliers and offset schemes via platforms like MENA’s Global Carbon Council, the region’s first voluntary carbon offsetting program.

Investor takeaways

Looking at investment opportunities, Al-Faras stated: “I believe the $270 billion projection is realistic as this growth is supported by what we are seeing across the GCC.”

He added that there is strong demand for physical infrastructure — ranging from airports and rail to hotels and event spaces — as well as for digital platforms that support business travel and mobility. Al-Faras noted that Saudi Arabia has developed a pipeline of projects in these areas and has shown “a clear willingness to partner with private capital.”

Raad cautioned that investors needed to carefully assess risks, as the massive scale of ongoing mega-developments could disrupt market balance if demand growth slowed.

She also highlighted potential regulatory shifts in visas, ownership, and taxation that might impact investment returns, along with increasing environmental, social, and governance pressures.

Companies are increasingly demanding low-carbon travel, which would require the timely adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and green-certified infrastructure.

Malik concluded: “Risks are very real, too. The biggest challenge will be timing and coordination. If infrastructure growth — number of flights, hotel rooms, venue capacity — doesn’t align across the board, there’s a risk of overcapacity in one area and bottlenecks in another.”

He added: “Regulatory complexity across countries and cities may slow seamless integration. Delivering not just on time, but to international quality standards, will be crucial to sustaining momentum.”

As MENA’s business travel sector surges, the region’s blend of innovation, sustainability, and economic diversification cements its status as a global leader — with no signs of slowing down.",,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:12.200137

The facility will transform forest byproducts, such as sustainably sourced wood waste and thinnings, into low-carbon fuels like renewable naphtha and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Governor Greg Abbott announced the project in 2022 with an initial $1.7 billion investment, which is expected to create over 140 permanent jobs. USA BioEnergy has secured more than 1,600 acres in Bon Wier for the refinery, aiming to turn an idle property into a clean energy hub by 2025.

The refinery has entered a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines for up to 680 million gallons of SAF. The facility plans to produce between 34 million and 65 million gallons of renewable fuels annually, contingent on the final design. USA BioEnergy confirmed the implementation of Honeywell’s Experion PKS control system at the Bon Wier plant, with Johnson Matthey also joining as a technology collaborator.

""By utilizing forest thinnings for bioenergy production with carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our integration with technology providers like Honeywell will help us create a fully integrated, alternative fuels solution,"" said Nick Andrews, CEO of USA BioEnergy.

The project is benefiting from approximately $150 million in state, county, and federal credits and tax incentives. Local support includes organizations such as the Texas Forest Country Partnership, Texas Forestry Association, and the City of Newton.

""This advanced-fuels facility development milestone underscores USA BioEnergy’s commitment to the future of aviation and energy security,"" Andrews said in a February statement. ""We also appreciate the opportunity to create good-paying jobs in Newton County, Texas, which has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the state. We are proud this project is a win-win-win for the area, the industry, and our business objectives.""

Once operational, the plant is expected to employ roughly 200 people full-time, alongside several hundred construction jobs during the build-out phase. The facility will also provide a new market for East Texas forestry byproducts, abundant in Newton and surrounding counties.

Despite the land purchase and new technology partnerships, construction has not yet begun. USA BioEnergy says engineering and design work is ongoing, with construction expected to take about two years once it starts. Full operations are projected for 2028 or 2029.

Menurut Vice President Corporate Communication Pertamina, Fadjar Djoko Santoso, pembangunan Pilot Plant Green Hydrogen Ulubelu dikabarkan melibatkan investasi signifikan dan menyerap tenaga kerja lintas bidang.

“Pilot Plant ini merupakan wujud bagaimana energi bersih membuka peluang baru. Selain mendukung target Net Zero Emission 2060, proyek ini juga menghadirkan multiplier effect berupa penciptaan lapangan kerja bagi masyarakat sekitar,” ujar Fadjar dalam keteranagn resmi yang dikutip, Sabtu 13 September 2025.

Sepanjang tahap pembangunan, proyek Pilot Plant Green Hydrogen Ulubelu membuka kesempatan karir bagi ratusan pekerja di wilayah sekitar.

“Keterlibatan tenaga kerja lokal menjadi bagian dari strategi Pertamina untuk memberikan dampak langsung bagi masyarakat sekitar wilayah operasi,” kata Fadjar.

Di samping itu, Green Hydrogen Ulubelu menjadi langkah penting dalam dekarbonisasi sektor energi nasional. Apabila dibandingkan dengan produksi grey hydrogen berbasis Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) yang menghasilkan emisi 12–14 kg (kilogram) CO₂ (Karbon dioksida) per kg H₂ (dihidrogen), maka green hydrogen berbasis PLTP (Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Panas Bumi) hanya menghasilkan sekitar 2 kg CO₂ per kg H₂.

“Pertamina tidak hanya fokus pada penyediaan energi bersih, tetapi juga memastikan setiap langkah transisi energi berdampak pada masyarakat, membuka lapangan kerja baru, dan mengurangi emisi karbon. Green Hydrogen Ulubelu adalah tonggak penting menuju Indonesia hijau dan berkelanjutan,” ujar Fadjar.

Dari sisi investasi, total belanja modal (CAPEX) untuk pembangunan Pilot Plant Green Hydrogen Ulubelu mencapai USD3 juta atau sekitar Rp49,2 miliar (kurs Rp16.416 per USD).

Kini investasi ini diarahkan untuk pengadaan teknologi electrolyzer berbasis Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM), pembangunan infrastruktur pendukung, serta kolaborasi dengan berbagai vendor teknologi energi hijau.

Diketahui, peletakan batu pertama proyek Pilot Plant Green Hydrogen diresmikan pada 9 September 2025 di Ulubelu. Lebih dari sekadar proyek energi, Green Hydrogen Ulubelu tetap menghadirkan peluang kerja, meningkatkan keterampilan masyarakat, dan membuka jalan bagi ekosistem ekonomi baru yang ramah lingkungan.

Pertamina kini optimis, keberhasilan transisi energi dapat tercapai dengan melibatkan masyarakat sebagai bagian dari perubahan.

Direktur Utama PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk, Julfi Hadi menekankan Pilot Project Green Hydrogen (Hidrogen Hijau) ini merupakan langkah strategis PGE menuju beyond electricity.

“Proyek ini menjadi bagian penting dari upaya PGE membangun ekosistem green hydrogen secara end-to-end, mulai dari produksi, distribusi, hingga pemanfaatannya untuk mendukung transisi menuju industri rendah karbon,"" jelas Julfi.

""Fasilitas ini tidak hanya sebagai pusat inovasi, tetapi juga model yang bisa direplikasi di wilayah kerja panas bumi lainnya, sekaligus membuka peluang percepatan off-grid solution untuk transportasi dan industri rendah karbon. Ke depan, peta jalan pengembangan PGE juga mencakup hilirisasi green ammonia dan green methanol sebagai solusi energi masa depan,” tambahnya.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi di Indonesia, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Seluruh komitmen tersebut dinyatakan sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.

Pertamina Catat Produksi Migas Tembus 1 Juta BOEPD, Pendapatan Tembus Rp672 Triliun

PT Pertamina (Persero) berhasil menjaga kinerja operasional dan mencatat performa keuangan positif sepanjang semester pertama 2025 atau Januari hingga Juli tahun ini.

Langkah strategis Pertamina ini, dinilai sejalan dengan target pemerintah melalui Asta Cita untuk mewujudkan swasembada energi dan mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi nasional.

Direktur Utama Pertamina, Simon Aloysius Mantiri mengungkapkan capaian tersebut dalam Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP) bersama Komisi VI DPR RI di Jakarta, Kamis 11 September 2025.

“Pertamina mencatat beberapa capaian, di antaranya temuan cadangan migas baru sebesar 724 juta barrel setara minyak (MMBOE) di wilayah kerja Rokan,” ujarnya dalam rilis resmi yang dikutip, Jumat 12 September 2025.

Produksi Migas Stabil, Temuan Cadangan Baru

Lebih lanjut, Pertamina hingga Juli 2025, mengungkapkan bahwa pihaknya mampu menjaga produksi migas (minyak dan gas) tetap di atas 1 juta barrel setara minyak per hari (BOEPD). Selain itu, penemuan cadangan migas baru ini bakal memperkuat ketahanan energi jangka panjang di dalam negeri.

Simon mengatakan, paruh pertama tahun ini menjadi momentum penting karena Pertamina berhasil menjalankan sejumlah program strategis, mulai dari produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pertama di Asia Tenggara dengan kapasitas 9.000 barrel per hari, hingga pengoperasian PLTP (Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Panas Bumi) Lumut Balai berkapasitas 800 GWh (Gigawatt-hour) dan revitalisasi tangki Arun berkapasitas 127.200 meter kubik yang ditargetkan rampung pada akhir 2025.

“Pertamina SAF merupakan bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan yang dihasilkan melalui teknologi co-processing antara Kerosene (minyak tanah) dan Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah. Ekosistem bisnis UCO SAF bukan hanya mendukung swasembada energi nasional namun juga mampu mendorong perekonomian mikro dan ekonomi sirkuler,” terang Simon.

Proyek Energi dan Produk Hijau

Pertamina juga memperluas langkahnya melalui proyek Palawan di Filipina dengan kapasitas 285 MW (MegaWatt) serta meluncurkan Pertamax Green 95 di 160 SPBU dengan volume penjualan mencapai 4,83 ribu KL (Kiloliter) hingga Juli 2025.

Langkah ini menunjukkan keseriusan Pertamina sebagai perusahaan milik negara dalam mempercepat transisi energi, memperkuat ketahanan energi, sekaligus mendukung implementasi energi bersih.

Kinerja Keuangan Pertamina

Meski menghadapi tekanan dari penurunan harga minyak mentah, solar, hingga kurs dolar AS (Amerika Serikat) dibandingkan periode 2024, Pertamina tetap mampu menjaga kinerja keuangan.

Hingga Juli 2025, perusahaan energi pelat merah ini membukukan pendapatan USD40,9 miliar atau sekitar Rp672 triliun dengan EBITDA USD6,2 miliar atau sebesar Rp102,8 triliun.

“Pertamina mampu mempertahankan kinerja keuangan dan operasional yang handal melalui berbagai upaya dan respon strategis,” kata Simon. (info-bks/*)",https://www.kabarbursa.com/uploads/covers/1757737756-68c4f31c597f6.webp,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:24.236769

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The recent analyst activity for Cintas is limited but tells a story. The simple average rating is 3.00, while the weighted rating (adjusted for performance history) stands at 4.30. This suggests a slightly more optimistic outlook when accounting for the track record of the analysts involved. The lone analyst, Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital, has an 80% historical winning rate but has rated the stock as Neutral recently.

However, the current price trend is negative (-3.65%), which is at odds with the generally optimistic weighted analyst expectations. This divergence could signal market uncertainty or underperformance in the near term.

Looking at the fundamentals, Cintas scores well in several key areas:

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 16.13%, with a model score of 7.54 (internal diagnostic score). This is a strong indicator of profitability.

Basic earnings per share (YoY growth rate): 19.35%, scoring 7.54.

ROA (Return on Assets): 4.79%, with a score of 7.54.

ROE (Return on Equity): 10.45%, scoring 7.54.

These fundamentals suggest a company that is growing and efficiently using its assets, even if the stock price is currently falling.

Money-Flow Trends

Despite the weak technical outlook, money-flow patterns show positive momentum. The overall inflow ratio is 55.90%, indicating substantial institutional and large-cap investor interest. The Extra-large inflow ratio is 62.30%, which is a strong signal from big-money players. This suggests that while the retail sentiment might be cautious, institutional investors are showing confidence.

The fund flow score is 7.91 (internal diagnostic score), labeled as good, and the overall trend is positive, even as the Small and Medium trends are negative. This points to a mixed retail investor sentiment, while the larger market participants are leaning bullish.

Key Technical Signals

The technical analysis for Cintas is bearish. The stock has 0 bullish indicators and 2 bearish indicators, with 1 neutral indicator. The overall technical score is 3.94 (internal diagnostic score), and the trend is summarized as weak, with a suggestion to avoid the stock.

Key technical indicators:

WR Oversold: Score of 3.73 (internal diagnostic score), indicating a neutral to slightly bullish signal historically, but not strong enough to override the bearish trend.

Bearish Engulfing: Score of 1.47 (internal diagnostic score), a strong bearish signal with a historical average return of -0.23% and a win rate of 36.36%.

RSI Oversold: Score of 6.62 (internal diagnostic score), suggesting moderate potential for a rebound, but not enough to tilt the overall trend.

Recent chart patterns show that WR Oversold was active on multiple dates (September 10, 9, 5, 8), and Bearish Engulfing appeared on September 5. This indicates a recent bearish consolidation phase. The key insight from the technicals is that the direction is unclear and bearish signals are dominant.

Conclusion

Cintas presents a mixed outlook. While the fundamentals are strong and money flows remain positive, the technical indicators are bearish, with no clear reversal signals. Given the internal diagnostic score of 3.94 (technical) and 7.54 (fundamental), the stock is a candidate for cautious observers but not for immediate buyers.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd30b25e4bc001.png,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:37.982358
