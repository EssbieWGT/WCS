We are thrilled to be part of the BioTJet project, which is strategic for Axens and our longtime partner thyssenkrupp Uhde.
The BioTJet project underscores thyssenkrupp Uhde's commitment to advancing clean energy technologies and supporting the global transition to sustainable sources.","BioTfueL technology has been selected for the BioTJet project by Elyse Energy and its partners (Axens, Avril, IFPEN). This project will produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from end-of-life wood waste & local forestry residues with the addition of green hydrogen. By 2029, BioTJet will supply sustainable aviation fuel to reduce carbon intensity in air transport, and e-bio-naphtha for road transport and bio-sourced chemistry. Axens signed a license agreement for BioTfueL technology in 2024, which includes a PRENFLO gasification technology from thyssenkrupp Uhde, a GASEL technology from Axens (Fischer-Tropsch and Upgrading) with a basic engineering completed in November 2024 and currently being within the detail engineering phase.

The aviation industry is considered as one of the hard-to-abate sectors in the green transformation, and sustainable aviation fuels are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2% quota in 2025 and aiming for 70% SAF in all EU airports from 2050. The BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels (RED EU definition), and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RED EU Definition, also called e-fuels). The technology brings proven process building blocks which have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium consisting of Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Total Energies and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

The PRENFLO gasification technology is part of thyssenkrupp's Decarbon Technologies portfolio and will contribute to the sustainable production of biomass-based synthetic products, including methanol, hydrogen, and SAF. With its origins in the Koppers-Totzek process, the PRENFLO technology has been continuously refined to meet evolving industry needs. It is known for its robustness and flexibility, capable of handling a wide range of feedstocks.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy: “After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change.”

Nadja Håkansson, CEO of thyssenkrupp Uhde: “We are proud to see how the E-BioTfueL concept – which includes our advanced PRENFLO technology – has now turned into a first commercial Biomass-to-SAF application in the European Community. The collaboration with our French partners underscores our commitment to driving the green transformation and delivering sustainable value to our customers and stakeholders.”

Quentin Debuisschert, CEO of Axens: “Axens, along with our parent company IFP Energies Nouvelles, has invested significant capital in demonstrating technologies at semi commercial scale and advancing the energy transition, particularly in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) processes. We are thrilled to be part of the BioTJet project, which is strategic for Axens and our longtime partner thyssenkrupp Uhde. The BioTJet project leverages a breakthrough technology, BioTfueL,"" underscoring our commitment to innovative solutions in the energy sector.”

Advanced Biofuels from Sustainable Feedstocks

PRENFLO is a pressurized, entrained-flow gasification technology developed and first demonstrated by thyssenkrupp Uhde in the late 1980s. It has been implemented in various large-scale projects, including the world's largest single-train, solid feedstock-based IGCC (integrated gasification combined-cycle) power plant, owned and operated by ELCOGAS, located in Puertollano, Spain, and continuously developed further to the application of 100% biomass. Thetechnology uses so-called second-generation biogenic feedstocks such as waste wood, wood chips, straw, forest residues and agricultural waste. The BioTJet project underscores thyssenkrupp Uhde's commitment to advancing clean energy technologies and supporting the global transition to sustainable sources.

He points to the Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest as a good example of balancing timber production and other natural resources.
The Chequamegon Nicolet is regularly one of the top timber producing National Forests in the Forest Service System selling roughly 120 million board feet of timber annually.
Eckstein also says while timber is a big product of the National Forest System, so is wildlife habitat, water quality, and recreation.
“These are all elements of the National Forest.","Called the “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production”, President Trump’s Executive Order calls for reducing the impact of what he calls “heavy-handed Federal policies” so that the U.S. can increase timber production and reduce wildfire risk.

The order directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to look at how to increase timber harvest and cut down on delivery time and supply uncertainty on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land.

This includes taking a look at how things like the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act can impact the process.

Henry Schienebeck is the Executive Director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.

He doesn’t know that the order will have a huge impact in this region, because it’s already one of the top timber producing regions within the Forest Service, but he does believe there’s room for improvement.

Schienebeck says the Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest has made a lot of progress towards its harvest goals because of the Good Neighbor Authority that’s allowed it to partner with the Wisconsin DNR to setup timber sales.

“We've been able to catch up on a lot of that forest management, those have been excellent tools with forest stewardship and Good Neighbor Authority to get caught up on some of the work that we're behind,” he said.

Schienebeck says there are a lot of opportunities to use natural wood in products like sustainable aviation fuel, biochar, and mass timber.

“People are starting to see the value of using wood more, real wood, for building their homes and that type of thing. I think from that aspect, we have some huge opportunity here,” said Schienebeck.

Schienebeck does think the order could be a positive thing for western states where wildfires are more common and destructive.

“We've been able to avoid that in the lake states to a great degree, and it is because we've got highly trained loggers that are out there managing the forest,” said Schienebeck. “We've got mills to absorb the wood, and we've got certification systems that are really a check and balance to make sure that we're doing the job right.”

Schienebeck stressed he doesn’t believe this will lead to mass clear cutting for forests like the state saw in the late 1800s. He says that sustainable timber harvest is good for both healthy forests and a healthy forest products industry.

“Our main focus is to make sure that we always have trees and that we always have access to them,” said Schienebeck. “It wouldn't be in our best interest to just go cut the forest and not have any trees left.”

More than timber production

Environmental groups like the Center for Biological Diversity believe speeding up the timber process will hurt critical wildlife habitat, impact water quality, and actually increase wildfire risk.

“Trump’s order will unleash the chainsaws and bulldozers on our beautiful, irreplaceable federal forests,” public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity Randi Spivak in a statement. “Clearcutting these amazing national treasures will increase fire risk, drive imperiled wildlife to extinction, pollute our rivers and streams, and destroy world-class recreation sites.”

Wisconsin’s Green Fire is a conservation group which focuses on a science-based approached to managing natural resources. Ron Eckstein is part of the organization’s Public Lands and Forestry Work group.

He doesn’t believe you have to change or lessen environmental protections to harvest timber. He points to the Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest as a good example of balancing timber production and other natural resources.

The Chequamegon Nicolet is regularly one of the top timber producing National Forests in the Forest Service System selling roughly 120 million board feet of timber annually.

“They really are harvesting a lot of timber, and they've done that by following all the rules, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the forest plan,” said Eckstein.

Eckstein also says while timber is a big product of the National Forest System, so is wildlife habitat, water quality, and recreation.

“These are all elements of the National Forest. Timber just being one of them,” said Eckstein. “If you just say, okay, timber and forget about everything else that really, really doesn't work very well.”

Eckstein also called it “inconsistent” to order an increase in timber production while cutting thousands of Forest Service staff that manage the land.

Wisconsin’s Forest Products Industry

Late last year, Wisconsin’s Green Fire published a report that looked at the health of all forests in the state, of which federal forest land makes up less than 10%.

The report details how a declining forest products industry, invasive species, and climate change are among the threats to healthy forests.

“We have a lot of timber in Wisconsin, and it can be harvested sustainably using our own information. Most of the timber is on private land, some is on public land, and landowners, whether it's private or public, landowners need a way to get the timber to market and have a market for the timber,” said Eckstein.

Schienebeck says the timber industry in the Great Lakes is “a mixed bag” right now.

The region lost some key mills in 2020/2021 that the industry is still feeling the impacts of, but there are still a lot of resources.

He says more infrastructure, both locally and across the U.S., will be needed to support the kind of timber demand the Trump administration has been calling for, but mills need guarantees that demand will last beyond this administration.

“I don't see any mill that's going to want to invest a lot of money in increasing their production without having some guarantees that the volume is going to be there into the future,” said Schienebeck.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d31afd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2587+0+338/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwxpr%2Ffiles%2F202010%2Fmft_3.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 19:56:27.571278

Bristol Airport’s future development plans are certainly not welcomed by our local B&NES councillors who have voted to continue their opposition – sending a clear message that airport expansion is incompatible with Net Zero goals and is strongly rejected by local communities.

This follows the announcement of a new airport ‘masterplan’, covering the period to 2040, which highlighted Bristol Airport’s ambition to expand capacity to 15 million passengers per year, with over 14,000 extra flights, including a thousand more night flights.

By agreeing to this updated position, councillors intend that B&NES should

object to any future planning application, as the council will be a statutory consultee. In addition, B&NES will call on the government to reconsider their position on airport expansion in line with scientific advice.

Cabinet Member for Climate Emergency and Sustainable Travel, Councillor Sarah Warren, said:

“The most recent – very clear – recommendation of the independent Climate Change Committee, is to stop any further airport expansion and adopt a UK-wide capacity management framework. Without this, the UK cannot hope to achieve Net Zero goals and help prevent the worst impacts of climate change.

“We are sending a strong, message to the airport, and to the government, just as we have done before in Bath and North East Somerset: Bristol Airport is big enough.”

Chew Valley Councillor David Harding highlighted the horrendous problems the airport causes for communities in the area. He said:

“Bristol Airport is not a good neighbour. The impact is felt everywhere in the Chew Valley and across the whole area. Aside from pollution and noise, we see speeding cars, traffic jams at village pinch points, and unofficial and illegal parking in fields and outside people’s houses.

“This will only get worse as the airport’s expansion is dependent upon ever-increasing car use. The site is served by a single-track A road – the A38 – and country lanes. Mass transit is treated as an afterthought. The expansion is predicted to increase passenger journeys to 24 million per year. The majority will reach the airport by car.

“It’s not unfair to say the site at Lulsgate Bottom is a massive car park with an airport attached.”

Publow with Whitchurch Councillor, Paul May, who is also Cabinet Member for Children’s Services, added:

“Our future rests with our children. We have a duty to protect them from the long-term impacts of climate change and the immediate damage from air pollution and traffic danger.

“Communities across the district are strongly opposed to further expansion of Bristol Airport.”

The Liberal Democrat motion to full Council on Opposing Bristol Airport Expansion was adopted by 44 votes in favour to 0 against and 2 abstentions. This is a refreshed position from B&NES Councillors, who have consistently spoken out against the airport expansion – including previous motions in 2019 and 2022.

Please see below the text of the motion as adopted this evening.

Council:

Reaffirms its opposition to the expansion of Bristol Airport as previously expressed in March 2019 as part of the Climate Emergency Declaration and again in July 2022.

Notes that communities in Bath and North East Somerset, local campaign organisations and communities in neighbouring authorities also oppose the expansion of Bristol Airport.

Regrets that Bristol Airport controversially won permission to expand from 10 million to 12 million passengers a year in the face of overwhelming opposition expressed by local communities, organisations and elected politicians, and are now consulting on a further expansion to 15 million passengers a year, of which they estimate that 12 million will reach the airport by private transport, including up to 1000 increased night flights each year, and an extended runway to enable services by larger aircraft types.

Notes the government has expressed support for airport expansion (both the Chancellor and Prime Minister have expressed support for a third runway at Heathrow and the Transport Secretary has “set out a path” for the expansion of Gatwick airport) in conflict with the advice given to the government by the Climate Change Committee, who have repeatedly cautioned against airport expansion without a framework in place to manage overall national capacity.

Council believes that:

Airport expansion is incompatible with the action being taken by West of England Councils to tackle the Climate Emergency, the UK Government’s legally binding climate targets, and advice from the Government’s own Climate Change Committee.

The health and wellbeing of B&NES residents will be adversely affected, through increased air, noise and light pollution and through congestion, rogue parking and rat running through our rural villages and narrow country lanes.

“Sustainable aviation” is a meaningless phrase, regularly used as greenwash by the airport and fossil fuel industries. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is an unproven technology with no clear feedstocks which would permit deployment at a meaningful scale.

2f) is accompanied by the loss of activity in PP hydrocracking, as demonstrated by the weight-balanced post-reaction solid residue (Supplementary Fig.
The integrated intensity of NH3 desorption peak for Ru1-ZrO2 is 11 times higher than that for Ru1-ZrO2_500 (Supplementary Fig.
Synthesis of Ru1-ZrO2 and Ru1-ZrO2_500 Ru1-ZrO2 was prepared by the hard-template method.
The same method was concurrently used for qualitative analysis using GC-MS. (A typical GC-MS result is shown in Supplementary Fig.","Hydrocracking polyolefins

In a typical hydrocracking process involving 4 grams of PE or PP, a conversion of over 98% can be achieved using Ru1-ZrO2 at 250 °C under 3 MPa H2 for 8 hours, yielding approximately 2.8 grams of liquid and 1.1 grams of gas, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The products are in gas and liquid phases mainly ranging from C3 to C20, and remain consistent regardless of the substrate as PE or PP (Supplementary Fig. 1). The liquid consists of approximately 70% jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons (C8-C16), while the gas primarily comprises C3-C6 LPG-range hydrocarbons (liquified-petroleum-gas, C3-C4 > 70%), and is almost free of methane and ethane (<0.007% and <0.068% mass yields, respectively, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). Notably, for the gaseous C4-C6 fraction, iso-alkanes dominate with a 93% weight fraction (Supplementary Fig. 3), even when the substrate is the less branched PE. This result implies that significant isomerization occurs over Ru1-ZrO2 during hydrocracking.

High temperatures enhance the thermodynamic driving force toward terminal C−C bond cleavage, leading to increased methane production26,37. However, they also shorten the required reaction time, which is often practical in industrial settings. Low H2 pressure is also highly desirable in real practice due to the lower equipment requirements, but it reduces competitive hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst resulting in higher methane formation rates27,28,38. Prolonged reaction times are often required for cracking the heavy hydrocarbons to get the liquid product, but it increases the likelihood of over-cracking lighter hydrocarbon products to methane. PP, which contains more methyl groups, tends to produce more methane than PE, due to terminal C−C bond cleavage33,39. To examine the product preference for jet-fuel-ranged hydrocarbons and resistance to methane formation, a proof test over Ru1-ZrO2 was conducted under conditions favorable for methane formation, i.e., PP as the substrate at 300 °C under H2 of 1–4 MPa for 8 hours (note: 2 hours is sufficient to achieve 98% PP conversion under these conditions, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4).

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, increasing the H2 pressure from 1 MPa to 2 MPa enhances the PP conversion from 92% to nearly 100% and increases the liquid yield from 65 wt% to 72 wt%. Further increasing H2 pressure from 2 MPa to 4 MPa hardly affects the conversion of PP or the yield of liquid. Nonetheless, higher H2 pressure results in greater H2 consumption (Supplementary Fig. 6), indicating that more C-C bonds are cleaved, producing short-chain hydrocarbons but they remain in the liquid phase. This is evidenced by the narrower carbon number distribution of the liquid as the H2 pressure increases (Fig. 1b). Notably, although the carbon number distribution narrows to C3-C18 with increased H2 pressure, it remains centered around C8, leading to an increased selectivity of jet-fuel-ranged hydrocarbons (C8-C16) up to 77% in the liquid, while maintaining liquid and gas yields at 75 wt% and 25 wt%, respectively. These results suggest that the over-cracking of lighter liquid hydrocarbons is suppressed, while the heavier hydrocarbons larger than C8 are selectively deconstructed. As previously reported26,27,28,37,38, the low H2 pressure and high reaction temperatures favor the formation of methane and ethane. This trend holds true in this proof test (Supplementary Table 1 lists C1-C2 values from Fig. 1b). However, Ru1-ZrO2 still keeps the methane yield below 0.2 wt% while maintaining liquid fuels (C5-C20) around 70 wt%, even under the reaction condition most greatly favoring methane formation.

The influence of H2 pressure on the composition of the liquid product is more pronounced than that on the gas product, as visually indicated by the color change of the liquid from orange to yellow to colorless with the increase of H2 pressure from 1 MPa to 4 MPa (Fig. 1c). This observation motivated us to prioritized Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy characterization for these liquid products. The absorption at 210–320 nm is present for all liquid products (Fig. 1d) but its intensity significantly decreases as the color of the liquid changes from orange to colorless. This adsorption can be attributed to the π-π* transition of aromatics40. To further confirm the formation of aromatics, the 13C−1H HSQC NMR was employed. Besides the correlation peaks assigned to -CH3, -CH2, and -CH groups (as marked in Fig. 1e), the correlation peaks at (1H: 2.0–2.5 ppm, 13C: 15–20 ppm) are observed and resulted from CHx- directly connected with aromatic rings. The presence of the signals at (1H: 6.7–8.0 ppm, 13C: 115–135 ppm)8 attributed to aromatic rings also confirmed the presence of aromatics in the liquid product (Supplementary Fig. 7). The relative concentration of aromatics in the liquid product decreases as the H2 pressure increases (Fig. 1f, plotted based on the calculation from Supplementary Fig. 8), which is consistent with the UV-Vis spectra results, indicating lower H2 pressure facilitates the formation of aromatics. These findings not only reaffirm the absence of methane even under reaction conditions favoring terminal C-C bond cleavage but also indicate the occurrence of dehydrogenation and isomerization during the hydrocracking reactions.

Identification of active site

This as-prepared Ru1-ZrO2 with 1.3 wt% Ru loading exhibits a tetragonal phase of ZrO2 with no diffraction peaks attributed to Ru in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Fig. 9). The particle size of Ru1-ZrO2 is around 5 nm (Fig. 2a), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element mappings confirm that the absence of Ru clusters in the catalyst (Fig. 2b). The HAADF-STEM image shows bright atoms randomly doped in the lattice of ZrO2 (Fig. 2c), presumed to be Ru. Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra display a major peak corresponding to the Ru-O scattering path at ~1.5 Å in the first coordination sphere (Fig. 2d). The first-shell Ru-O coordination number (CN) is determined to be four based on EXAFS fitting (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). These results confirm that the Ru species in Ru1-ZrO2 is atomic Ru coordinated with four O atoms in the ZrO2 lattice. This is further supported by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that the Ru species in Ru1-ZrO2 are in an oxidized state rather than a metallic state.

Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) was conducted to understand the impact of the interaction between ZrO2 and Ru on the reduction of the Ru and ZrO2 components in the catalyst. Supported 1.5 wt% Ru/ZrO2, 1.6 wt% Ru/SiO2 and as-prepared bare ZrO2 were used as references. To obtain the full TPR profiles in the range of 100–800 °C, none of these samples were pretreated in H2, ensuring that Ru remained in the oxidized state at the start of the H2-TPR measurement. A peak at 180 °C is observed for supported Ru/SiO2 and Ru/ZrO2 (Fig. 2f) and attributed to the reduction of RuO2 clusters39 to metallic Ru (confirmed by HRTEM in Supplementary Fig. 12). For as-prepared bare ZrO2, a peak around 600 °C is observed and attributed to the reduction of ZrO241. Unlike these two peaks, a significant peak around 500 °C is observed for Ru1-ZrO2. The peak is much closer in temperature to the ZrO2 reduction peak than to the RuO2 reduction peak, but its integration intensity is much higher than that of ZrO2 reduction peak. Quantitative analysis of these peaks indicates that the amount of H2 consumed by Ru1-ZrO2 is around 12 times higher than that consumed by supported Ru/SiO2, Ru/ZrO2, and ZrO2 (Supplementary Fig. 13). This result confirms the observation of HRTEM and EXAFS that no Ru clusters or nanoparticles are present in Ru1-ZrO2, and further indicates that the atomic Ru dopants render more O atoms in Ru1-ZrO2 reducible compared to as-prepared bare ZrO2. Therefore, it is confirmed that all Ru atoms were doped into the crystal of ZrO2, forming the moieties of Ru-O-Zr, where the O atoms were activated due to the doping of Ru.

None of the supported Ru/SiO2, Ru/ZrO2, and bare ZrO2 references show activity in the hydrocracking of PP (Supplementary Fig. 14). The significant difference between the active Ru1-ZrO2 and the inert references, as reflected in TPR profiles, is the prominent peak at 500 °C. We speculated that this peak-related structure, i.e., Ru-O-Zr, is relevant to the catalytic performance of Ru1-ZrO2. To verify this correlation, the Ru-O-Zr species were intentionally demolished by treating the Ru1-ZrO2 at 500 °C in a 20% H2/Ar flow of 50 mL/min for 0.5 hours (denoted as Ru1-ZrO2_500). We found that in Ru1-ZrO2_500, the disappearance of the Ru-O-Zr reduction signal in the H2-TPR profile (Fig. 2f) is accompanied by the loss of activity in PP hydrocracking, as demonstrated by the weight-balanced post-reaction solid residue (Supplementary Fig. 15) and the unchanged pressure during the reaction (Supplementary Fig. 16).

We further pursued which atomic site within the Ru-O-Zr moiety governs the internal C-C bond cleavage, so the changes in the Ru1-ZrO2 after H2 treatment at 500 °C were studied. It was found that Ru1-ZrO2_500 maintains the tetragonal phase of ZrO2 (XRD in Supplementary Fig. 17), and Ru remains atomic dopant within the ZrO2 crystal, as depicted by HRTEM (Supplementary Fig. 18) and EXAFS (Supplementary Fig. 19). However, XANES (Supplementary Fig. 20) and XPS (Supplementary Fig. 21) indicate that the oxidation states of both Ru and Zr shift toward their reduced states after H2 treatment. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and XPS analyses suggest no loss of Ru after this H2 treatment (Supplementary Table 3). The capability of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation involving H2 dissociation of the catalysts was further examined using an H2/D2 switch experiment. As shown in Fig. 2g, the integrated intensity of the HD peak on Ru1-ZrO2_500 is slightly higher than that on Ru1-ZrO2, but both of them are more than 8 times higher than that on supported Ru/SiO2 and Ru/ZrO2. This observation demonstrates that the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation capability of Ru1-ZrO2_500 is enhanced or at least maintained compared to Ru1-ZrO2. During this H2 treatment, the significant change in the Ru-O-Zr moiety is the removal of its O atom, as evidenced by the formation of H2O (H2-TPR-MS in Supplementary Fig. 22) and the decreased intensity of hydroxylic O in O 1 s XPS spectra42,43 (Fig. 2h). Therefore, we conclude that within the Ru-O-Zr moiety, it is the O atom, rather than Ru, that is the key site governing C-C bond cleavage in polyolefin hydrocracking.

Given the observation of isomerization during the hydrocracking PO, the acid sites were further studied. Pyridine-FTIR spectra (Fig. 2i) show only Lewis acid sites with a feature peak at 1444 cm−1 on the inert ZrO216. Upon doping with atomic Ru, another peak at 1540 cm−1, attributed to Brønsted acid sites16, is observed on Ru1-ZrO2. After in situ treatment of Ru1-ZrO2 at 500 °C in 20% H2/Ar (equivalent to Ru1-ZrO2_500), a significant decrease in the intensities of the FTIR peaks is observed, particularly for the peak attributed to Brønsted acid sites, indicating a dramatic decrease in the amount of acid sites. This result is further confirmed by the temperature-programmed NH3 desorption (NH3-TPD). The integrated intensity of NH3 desorption peak for Ru1-ZrO2 is 11 times higher than that for Ru1-ZrO2_500 (Supplementary Fig. 23). Moreover, the temperature for the complete NH3 desorption is observed up to 450 °C on Ru1-ZrO2, while it is only around 260 °C for Ru1-ZrO2_500. These results reveal a dramatic decrease in both the population and strength of the acid sites on Ru1-ZrO2 after H2 treatment at 500 °C. Given that both the activated atom after atomic Ru doping and the removed atom after the H2 treatment at 500 °C are the O atom of the Ru-O-Zr moiety, it is concluded that the O atom of the Ru-O-Zr moiety has a dangling H, which acts as the Brønsted acid site.

We further performed charge and chemical bonding analysis for Ru-O-Zr moiety with a dangling H on the Ru-doped ZrO2. Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis (Supplementary Fig. 24) revealed that, compared to ZrOHZr (assuming it exists), the bonding and antibonding O-H interactions in RuOHZr shifted to higher energy levels. This indicates that the O-H interaction in RuOHZr is relatively weaker, suggesting higher acidity of the OH group. Moreover, the integrated COHP values (Supplementary Table 5) show that the O-H bond distance in the RuOHZr moiety is longer than ZrOHZr and is closer to the Fermi level, further suggesting a weaker O-H interaction, i.e. a stonger acidity, in RuOHZr, which is in line with the results of NH3-TPD.

Mechanism of selective internal C-C bond cleavage

We performed the hydrocracking of n-octane, aiming to get a preliminary understanding of the way of PO hydrocracking on Ru1-ZrO2. The products from n-octane are also free of methane and ethane, predominated by iso-butane with a selectivity of 60% in the gas products (Supplementary Fig. 25a). This product distribution indicates that the isomerization followed by β-scission of the carbonium ion regime is the primary pathway in the hydrocracking of n-octane (details in Supplementary Fig. 25b). The methane-free branched products from the hydrocracking of longer-chain hydrocarbons (Supplementary Fig. 26), such as n-dodecane (C12) and squalane (C30), further verified this conclusion. With this understanding, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore why the products are free of methane and dominated by isomerized hydrocarbons during PP hydrocracking over Ru1-ZrO2.

During PP deconstruction, the formation of the more stable tertiary carbonium ion is favored over, primary and secondary carbonium ions44,45,46. For the production of lighter hydrocarbons, the tertiary carbonium ion forms at the terminal of the carbon chain either initially or as a result of precedent β-scission of an internal C-C bond (Fig. 3a). The β-scission triggered by the terminal tertiary carbonium ion (scissors-marked molecule in the left panel), forms one i-C4 molecule and a long-chain hydrocarbon with a secondary carbonium ion. Subsequent depolymerization from the resulting secondary carbonium ion of the residue long-chain hydrocarbon can proceed through three options: 1) isomerization (blue route), 2) direct β-scission (green route), or 3) rearrangement to form a tertiary carbonium ion (orange route). Regarding route 1), after isomerization there are two plausible C-C bond cleavage sites (marked with grey and red scissors) via β-scission, forming methane and i-C5, respectively. DFT calculations indicate that the reaction forming methane is energetically less favorable (∆E = −0.28 eV, Ea = 2.84 eV) than the other one forming i-C5 (∆E= −1.18 eV, Ea = 1.69 eV). Similarly, route 3) also has two C-C cleavage options (marked with grey and red scissors) via β-scission, and the one leading to ethane formation is less dominant than the other one forming i-C6. The reaction energy of β-scission to form propane is −0.82 eV in route 2), while it is an endothermic process to produce methane with a reaction energy of 1.20 eV.

Furthermore, reaction energy and transition state calculations (details in Supplementary Figs. 27, 28) demonstrated that route 1) isomerization (blue route) is kinetically and thermodynamically the most favorable pathway (primary pathway) among the three routes assessed. The prevalence of i-C4 and i-C5 as preferred gaseous products, stemming from route 1) indicated by DFT calculation, aligns well with the distribution of the gaseous species obtained from hydrocracking PP (Supplementary Fig. 3). In all pathways, the carbonium ion either succeeds and circularizes the hydrocracking loop to produce shorter-chain hydrocarbons or is terminated by a hydrogenation reaction.

The catalytic cycle of PO (PE or PP) hydrocracking on Ru1-ZrO2 is depicted in Fig. 3b. The PO is dehydrogenated on the atomic Ru site of the Ru-O-Zr moiety and then transferred to the Ru-neighboring O site, which is topped with a dangling H and functionalized as the C-C bond breaking site upon the doping of atomic Ru into ZrO2. On the O site, a carbonium ion forms, followed by isomerization or rearrangement and subsequent β-scission of the internal C-C bond, which is the rate-determining step. This process forms two shorter-chain hydrocarbons, one of which contains a new carbonium ion. The in situ-generated carbonium ion either undergoes a hydrogenation reaction to desorb or repeats the cycle of isomerization and β-scission. H2 dissociation competes with PO dehydrogenation over Ru and supplies surface H species for hydrogenation reaction or spillover to the Ru-neighboring O site for hydrocracking. This mechanism explains why PO dehydrogenation-induced aromatics formation is suppressed as H2 pressure increases. The atomic metal (Ru) and acid site (O) in close proximity substantially reduce mass transfer between them, resulting in high efficiency and inhibition of the side reaction of hydrogenolysis to methane.

Practice

The robustness of Ru1-ZrO2 was assessed by the cycling experiment. No decrease in liquid yield, which is maintained at around 70 wt%, was observed after 6 cycles (Fig. 4a). HRTEM and EDS mapping (Supplementary Fig. 29) revealed Ru species do not undergo aggregation after the reaction. Furthermore, EXAFS and XANES (Supplementary Fig. 30) confirmed the catalyst’s exceptional stability, with Ru remaining embedded as single atoms within the ZrO2 lattice after the reaction. In real practice, the one-pot upcycling of 100 grams of mixed post-consumer PP and PE wastes, such as lunch boxes, soft drink cups, masks, bags, pipets, packing films, over Ru1-ZrO2 at 300 °C under 3 MPa yields 85 mL of centrifuge-collected liquid (Fig. 4b). The hydrocarbon distribution (Supplementary Fig. 31) is identical to that derived from virgin polyolefins (Fig. 1b), consisting of 70% jet-, 80% gasoline- and 45% diesel-ranged fuels in the liquid (Fig. 4c), and 100% LPG in gas product (containing more than 70% C3-C4 hydrocarbons) without forming methane and ethane.

Driven by global initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and stringent environmental regulations, the demand for sustainable aviation fuel is on a rapid rise over the coming years, starting from 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45%47. The use of centrifugation to obtain 85 mL of liquid containing 70% jet-fuel-ranged hydrocarbons significantly lowers the cost of post-reaction product separation. It demonstrates the potential for scaling up the production of waste plastic-derived sustainable jet fuel. Furthermore, the absence of methane and ethane in the gas products (LPG) allows them to be directly liquified at ambient pressure, making them suitable for use in heating appliances, cooking equipment, and vehicles.

Synthesis of Ru1-ZrO2 and Ru1-ZrO2_500

Ru1-ZrO2 was prepared by the hard-template method. Typically, Zr(NO3)4•5H2O and Ru(NO)(NO3)x(OH)y were added to deionized water to form a solution. This solution was added to Carbon black powder which was used as the hard-template. The obtained mixture was dried at 80 °C for 12 hours, and then calcined in air at 500 °C for 6 hours to remove the Carbon black template. Before the hydrocracking reaction, the sample was pretreated in 20% H2/Ar with a flow rate of 50 mL/min at 275 °C (300 °C was used for pretreatment when the hydrocracking reaction temperature was 300 °C) to obtain Ru1-ZrO2. The loading of Ru in Ru1-ZrO2 used in this work was determined by ICP (Supplementary Table 3) at 1.3 wt%. The Ru1-ZrO2 catalyst was treated in 20% H2/Ar with a flow rate of 50 ml/min at 500 °C for 0.5 hours to obtain Ru1-ZrO2_500. The bare ZrO2 as the reference was prepared using the same method without loading Ru.

Hydrocracking reaction

In a typical hydrocracking reaction, PP, or PE, normal alkane (C8 and C12), or squalane (4 g), and the Ru1-ZrO2 catalyst (0.4 g) were loaded into a stainless steel autoclave batch reactor (25 mL). The reactor was then flushed with Ar under 0.4 MPa for 8 cycles, followed by 5 cycles of H2 flush with 0.5 MPa pressure above the target reaction pressure. Afterward, the reactor was pressurized with H2 to the target pressure (1–4 MPa) at room temperature. Then, the reactor was placed in its associated heater with a temperature controller and heated to target temperatures (250 °C or 300 °C) at a rate of 7.5 °C/min and maintained for target durations (2, 8 hours). Stirring with a rate of 600 rpm was engaged after the temperature reached 160 ± 5 °C. The temperature and pressure were automatically recorded once per minute during the entire reaction. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was cooled to and maintained at 10 °C for 15 minutes to equilibrate the gas and liquid product transformation before the product collection.

The hydrocracking of 100 g of post-consumer PP and PE plastic wastes with 10 g of catalysts was performed in a batch stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 1 L. The post-consumer products, such as lunch boxes, soft drink cups, masks, shopping bags, pipets, and packing films, were picked up from the trash bin and washed before the hydrocracking reaction. The procedure was the same as the mentioned above.

Product collection and analysis

Product collection and calculation

The products were collected and analyzed according to the method depicted in Supplementary Fig. 32. Gas product was charged to a gas sampling bag via the valve-connected tube on the cap of the reactor. The liquid products and insoluble solids, including the catalyst were then collected in a weighted centrifuge tube (\({M}_{T}\)), and then weighed and denoted as \({M}_{P}\). The liquid product was collected by centrifuging and stored in a vial for GC analysis later. The separated insoluble solids were kept in the centrifuge tube and then washed with n-hexane after drying at 80 °C for 24 hours (the products solved in the wash solution of n-hexane were mainly under C22 which was identical to that of centrifuging collected liquid. Only trace amounts of hydrocarbons C22-C25 was observed). The centrifuge tube with post-washed solids was dried at 80 °C in an oven for 24 hours, aiming to vaporize all the liquid, and then weighed as \({M}_{1}\).

The masses of products in different phases were calculated using the following formulas:

$${M}_{L}=\, {M}_{P}-{M}_{1}$$

(1)

$${M}_{S}=\, {M}_{1}-{M}_{T}-{M}_{C}$$

(2)

$${M}_{G}=\, {M}_{{Plastic}}-{M}_{L}-{M}_{S}$$

(3)

where \({M}_{L}\), \({M}_{S}\), \({M}_{G}\) and\(\,{M}_{{Plastic}}\) are the mass of liquid product, solid residue, gas product, and plastic substrate, respectively. The \({M}_{C}\) is the mass of the catalyst, in most cases in this study it is 0.4 g.

The yield of products (\({Y}_{i}\)) and conversion were calculated as follows:

$${Y}_{i}=\frac{{M}_{i}}{{M}_{{Plastic}}}\times 100\%$$

(4)

$${Conversion}=\left(1-\frac{{M}_{S}}{{M}_{{Plastic}}}\right)\times 100\%$$

(5)

where \(i\) is \(L\), \(S\), \(G\), representing liquid product, solid residue, and gas product, respectively. Given the mass of the H2 input and consumption was much less than that of plastic substrates, it was ignored when calculating the conversion of plastics.

Gas product analysis

The gas product collected in the gas bag was analyzed using a GC (Agilent 8890 Series) with a FID detector and a HP-PlOT-Q column. The method was established and calibrated by using a standard gas reference which involved methane of 0.1 mol%, ethane of 0.1 mol%, propane of 0.1 mol%, isobutane of 0.1 mol%, butane of 0.1 mol%, neopentane of 0.1 mol%, isopentane of 0.1 mol% and pentane of 0.1 mol%. A gastight syringe was used to inject 0.3 mL gas sample to quantify the relative ratio of C1-C6 hydrocarbons. A typical chromatogram showing the separation of species with retention time is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

The mass yield of each component of the gas product can be calculated according to Eq. 6:

$${Y}_{{G}_{i}}=\frac{{A}_{i}}{{\sum }_{1}^{6}{A}_{i}}\times {Y}_{G}$$

(6)

where \({Y}_{{G}_{i}}\) is the yield of the gas hydrocarbon with the carbon number \(i\); \({A}_{i}\) is the chromatographic area of gas hydrocarbon with the carbon number as \(i\); \(i\) represents carbon number of 1-6; \({Y}_{G}\) is the yield of gas product obtained in equation (4).

Liquid products analysis

They were quantitatively analyzed on an Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent HP-5 capillary column and FID. The inlet and detector temperatures were 300 °C, respectively. Typically, 1 μL of liquid product was injected into the chromatogram using a syringe. The standard n-alkanes C7-C40 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was used to establish the GC method and perform a quantitative analysis. A typical chromatogram for the liquid product and the standard mixture of n-alkanes (C7-C40) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich is shown in Supplementary Fig. 33. The same method was concurrently used for qualitative analysis using GC-MS. (A typical GC-MS result is shown in Supplementary Fig. 34).

The products for hydrocarbons based on carbon number can be calculated according to the following formula:

$${Y}_{{L}_{i}}=\frac{{A}_{i}}{{\sum }_{5}^{25}{A}_{i}}\times {Y}_{L}$$

(7)

where \({Y}_{{L}_{i}}\) is the yield of the liquid hydrocarbon with the carbon number \(i\); \({A}_{i}\) is the chromatographic area of liquid hydrocarbon with the carbon number as \(i\); \(i\) represents carbon number of 5-25; \({Y}_{L}\) is the yield of liquid product obtained in equation (4).

Mass balance examination

To calculate the mass balance, the mass yield of gas was measured independently by using the volume of the gas product combined with GC analysis as follows:

The pressure as a function of the gas volume in the reactor at 10 °C was established using a measuring bubbler. Therefore, the post-reaction gas volume can be calculated by using the pressure at the end of the reaction. Combined with the ratio of gaseous species mentioned above, the mass of each species can be calculated independently by using the formula below:

$${M}_{{G}_{i}}=\frac{\frac{{A}_{i}}{{k}_{i}}\times {W}_{i}\times {V}_{G}}{22.4}$$

(8)

Where \({A}_{i}\) is the chromatographic area of different carbon numbers; \({k}_{i}\) represents the correction factor for the respective component, which is established using 0.3 mL injection of standard gas reference mentioned above and shown in Supplementary Fig. 2; \({W}_{i}\) is the corresponding relative molecular weight; \({V}_{G}\) is the volume of the gas at the end of the reaction.

The mass balance was examined by:

$${mass\; balance}=\frac{{\sum }_{1}^{6}{M}_{{G}_{i}}+{M}_{L}+{M}_{S}}{\begin{array}{c}{M}_{{Plastic}}\\ \,\end{array}}\times 100\%$$

(9)

Where \({M}_{{G}_{i}}\), \({M}_{L}\) and \({M}_{S}\) are the mass of gas, liquid and solid residue. They are all measured independently based on the above methods. Given that the mass of the H2 input and consumption is much less than that of plastic substrates, it is ignored when calculating the mass balance.

Due to the mass loss of products during the independent collection of gas and liquid products and the error of measurements, particularly for the gas volume, the mass balance cannot meet 100% but all still keep the mismatch within 10%. The result of mass balance is shown in Supplementary Fig. 35.

In situ Pyridine-FTIR characterization

In situ Pyridine-FTIR was conducted in a vacuum cell with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer ThermoFisher iS50r equipped with an MCT detector. Ru1-ZrO2 sample was pressed to a wafer and loaded into the sample holder. Before pyridine adsorption, the Ru1-ZrO2 wafer was degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 20 min and then cooled to room temperature. The background spectra of the samples were acquired in the vacuum before introducing pyridine vapor. The pyridine vapor was introduced into the cell by using a vacuum pump and kept until the intensity of the IR peaks did not increase. Subsequently, the cell was evacuated to remove gas-phase pyridine until the IR peak did not decrease at room temperature and then the wafer was heated to 450 °C to desorb pyridine. After the desorption, the Ru1-ZrO2 wafer was reduced at 500 °C for 30 min in 20% H2/Ar, aiming to in situ obtain Ru1-ZrO2_500. After this reduction, the wafer was cooled to room temperature, and the above procedure was repeated for pyridine adsorption/desorption. The ZrO2 was pressed to the wafer for Py-FTIR characterization as a reference. Due to the difference in transmittance and the weight of ZrO2 and Ru1-ZrO2 wafers in ex-situ measurements, the intensity of the peak at 1444 cm−1 was normalized to the spectra of ZrO2 and Ru1-ZrO2 in Fig. 2i.

H2/D2 exchange experiment

H2/D2 exchange experiment was performed at 250 °C and mass spectrometry was used to record the signal intensities. Typically, 50 mg catalyst was loaded into the reactor and 10% H2/Ar was introduced with a flow rate of 20 ml/min at 250 °C. After the stabilization of the mass spectrometry signal, the flow of 10% H2/Ar was switched to the flow of D2/Ar with a rate of 20 mL/min. The signal of M/Z = 3 (HD) was recorded throughout the process. After the testing of Ru1-ZrO2 was completed, the reactor was gradually heated to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under the atmosphere of 20 ml/min 20% H2/Ar for in situ reduction for 0.5 hours, aiming to obtain the sample of Ru1-ZrO2_500 in situ. Subsequently, the reactor was cooled down to 250 °C to conduct the H2-D2 exchange experiment again for Ru1-ZrO2_500 catalyst.

Computational details

All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation package (VASP 5.4.4)48,49. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE exchange and correlation functional was used to account for the exchange-correlation energy49,50. The kinetic energy cutoff of the plane wave basis set was set to 400 eV. The threshold for energy convergence for each iteration was set to 10−5 eV. Geometries were assumed to be converged when forces on each atom were less than 0.05 eV/Å. Gaussian smearing of the population of partial occupancies with a width of 0.05 eV was used during iterative diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian.

The bulky ZrO2 unit cell in the tetragonal phase was first fully optimized. The optimized lattice vectors of a = b = 3.612 Å and c = 5.212 Å have a good agreement with the experiment parameters51. The most stable (101) surface of ZrO2 tetragonal phase was simulated by a 3×4×1 supercell slab model including three ZrO2 sub-layers (each includes two oxygen atomic layers and one Zr atomic layer) separated by a vacuum layer with a thickness of 15 Å along the surface normal direction to avoid spurious interactions between periodic slab models. The bottom two layers of ZrO2 were fixed, while the rest was allowed to relax during the geometry optimization. One Zr atom on the surface was replaced by Ru to create a Ru-O-Zr moiety. The lattice parameters were fixed throughout the surface calculations. Corrections for on-site Coulomb interactions by use of the DFT + U procedure were done with effective U = 4 eV for Zr. The Brillouin zone integration and k‐point sampling were restricted to the gamma point. The nudged-elastic band method with the improved tangent estimate (CI-NEB) was used to determine the minimum energy path and to locate the transition state structure for each elementary reaction step52. The transition state was confirmed by observing only one imaginary frequency corresponding to each reaction coordinate.

The alkane of C11 with the branched methyl groups was used as a model compound. The adsorption energy of the reaction intermediate was calculated as \({E}_{{ads}}\,=\,{E}_{{adsorbate}+{surface}}-\,{E}_{{adsorbate}}-\,{E}_{{clean}-{surface}}\). The activation energy (\({E}_{a}\)) of a chemical reaction was defined as the energy difference between the initial and transition states, while the reaction energy (ΔE) was defined as the energy difference between the initial and final states.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-57998-x/MediaObjects/41467_2025_57998_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-03-21 17:57:11.077852

The Heathrow outage is ""putting a spotlight on the need to make sure that the entire network of energy supply for any ... airport around the world has sufficient capability to address a crisis,"" Mendiratta told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday. ""All of this is a very dramatic learning curve.""

A back-up generator was also affected by the blaze, raising questions over the resilience of the supporting energy infrastructure, according to U.K. energy minister Ed Miliband, while Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) described Heathrow's reliance on a ""single"" power source as a ""clear planning failure"" by the airport.

In an emailed statement, Heathrow said it has multiple sources of energy. ""Our back up systems are safety systems which allow us to land aircraft and evacuate passengers safely, but they are not designed to allow us to run a full operation,"" Heathrow said.

Mendiratta said the Heathrow incident would have have a ripple effect for aviation that goes far beyond flight cancelations. She described the implications of the Heathrow incident as ""very wide,"" as the growth of aviation is outpacing the increase in supporting infrastructure, she said.

Mendiratta described the growth of aviation globally as ""massive.""

""It is extreme in terms of how it has grown far beyond even 2019 rates,"" she said. This raises questions over the industry's resilience to unplanned weather or geopolitical events and whether the surrounding infrastructure can support it.

Globally, both domestic and international air passenger traffic surpassed pre-Covid-19 levels in early 2024, according to IATA, and passenger numbers are expected to increase by an average of 3.8% annually to 2043, compared to 2023.

""Even though much of the focus of the story is very much on Heathrow and passengers, what we also need to take into account is over and above passenger traffic, over 4,000 tons of cargo go through Heathrow every single day,"" Mendiratta added.

Heathrow Airport handled a record 83.9 million passengers in 2024 — up nearly 6% on the year prior — while its cargo transportation increased by 10%.

Whether passengers can get compensation for canceled flights depends on their airlines' terms, Mendiratta said. As the Heathrow fire appears to be outside of airlines' control, such reimbursement may not be payable, according to a note issued by Citi on Friday.

Investors will consider short-term costs such as food and beverage, accommodation, alternative flights or land transport for passengers affected by cancelations, Mendiratta flagged, as well as looking at how airlines manage customer care in the long term.

""That, ultimately, is going to be the basis of customer retention, which from an investor point of view is going to be very important ... it's a significant calculation,"" she said.

A third runway at Heathrow Airport has long been mooted, with its CEO putting pressure on the U.K. government to make a decision on the controversial expansion by the end of the year. British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said the extra runway was ""badly needed"" in a January speech.

Meanwhile the aviation industry is pushing forward with sustainable aviation fuel deals to help meet decarbonization targets.

""As we shift into the future and look at sustainable aviation, this is where infrastructure can now look at green technologies, which are vital to enable aviation to continue to grow, but grow in a healthy way,"" Mendiratta said.

The airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the corporate aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended fuel since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates earlier this year, domestic sales of sustainable fuel are increasingly under threat from a lack of UK production and investment.

The UK and EU have legislative obligations on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025, and how this fuel must be produced in the future. This is to ensure that over time advanced fuels can be developed to support the required growth in the production of this type of propellant, without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing feedstock SAF, which today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids); however Hydrogen Refinery’s innovative technology can produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill.

Simon Geere, CEO of Farnborough Airport, commented: “The patented technology from e-fuel developer Hydrogen Refinery has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with sufficient proprietary supplies of SAF to become the first and only airport in the world to offer 20% blended fuel across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s target of 10% by 2030. Furthermore, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a key commercial enabler to kick-start domestic refining of SAF at scale, right here in the UK"".

He continued: “The transition to new refuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours that can support the higher upfront investment costs needed to make things happen. Farnborough Airport is uniquely positioned to advance this technology, given the smaller, more modern aircraft we operate and the significant economic value of the flights we support. As a local business, Hydrogen Refinery exemplifies the deep-rooted technological capabilities of companies that are part of Farnborough Airport’s aviation research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership that will generate significant local inbound investment and reinforce our ambitions to become a global sustainability showcase for airports around the world"".

The announcement follows a series of milestones achieved by the airport in recent years. In 2024, it achieved Level 4+ carbon accreditation from Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA), a distinction reserved for few airports in the UK, and one of the largest light-duty solar installations in the South East was completed, allowing it to self-produce 25% of its energy. Already in 2022, during a trial in preparation for the Farnborough International Airshow, the airport offered SAF at the same price as the traditional Jet A1, thus anticipating the adoption of the sustainable fuel by customers and setting the goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030.",https://www.avionews.it/resources/originals/b2e917af1ec0af306e5c4114117f1022.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 12:57:18.188169

“On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel,” Airbus Canada CEO Benoît Schultz said in a news release.
Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with conventional aviation fuel (CAF), also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm.
Like all Airbus aircraft, the A220 already can operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel.","The first sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) delivery recently took place at the Airbus Canada’s A220 site, enabling teams in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada—home of Montréal–Mirabel International Airport—to use SAF for production, customer acceptance, and test flights.

Now, all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are using sustainable aviation fuel for internal operations. Additionally, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights this year, Airbus reported. The company expects to use 600,000 liters (158,503 gallons) of SAF with a 30% blend this year at the Airbus Mirabel site, resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 400 metric tons.

“On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel,” Airbus Canada CEO Benoît Schultz said in a news release. “This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress toward decarbonization by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites.

“It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF, too.”

In 2024, 18% of Airbus global fuel mix for the year was SAF, the company said. That’s more than 16 million liters of neat SAF. Alongside this, 75% of Airbus aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, representing the high priority customers are placing on decarbonization.

Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with conventional aviation fuel (CAF), also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping. Airbus Canada has the ambition to deliver SAF proof of sustainability to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025. SAF has been used in A220 aircraft delivered from the company’s A220 mobile final assembly line since 2016.

Like all Airbus aircraft, the A220 already can operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel. Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.","https://img.bulktransporter.com/files/base/ebm/bulktransporter/image/2025/03/67dd7942be972796c5f78a39-saf_truck_at_airbus_canada.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-21 12:57:24.579976

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) that more than doubles the airport’s available EV chargers.
The additional chargers help meet growing demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure at Port Authority facilities, which support the agency’s industry-leading sustainability initiatives.
“More access to electric vehicle charging equipment helps advance our sustainability goals and reaffirms our agency’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.” With the new Revel charging station at the FHV lot adjacent to JFK Building 141, JFK now hosts a total of 46 EV fast charging ports that are operational at all times, helping to reduce charging wait times and improving traffic flow.
JFK’s 46 EV fast chargers for airport users will benefit both customers and FHV drivers seeking more fast-charging solutions.
In addition to supporting public access of EV charging infrastructure, the Port Authority and its operational partners have collaborated to incorporate more electric vehicles within airport operations as well.","The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey and Revel today announced the opening of an electric vehicle (EV) charging station at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) that more than doubles the airport’s available EV chargers. The 24 new chargers were funded and installed by Revel and Con Edison through its PowerReady program for electric vehicle infrastructure incentives helped. The new charging station is located within the airport’s for-hire vehicle (FHV) hold lot and is accessible via the Van Wyck Expressway or Belt Parkway.

The additional chargers help meet growing demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure at Port Authority facilities, which support the agency’s industry-leading sustainability initiatives. The agency has specified plans to reach its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 through its comprehensive net-zero roadmap. That goal encompasses both the agency’s own emissions as well as those originating through the wide transportation ecosystem supporting its facilities. Traditional fast chargers will enable the transition of gas-powered to electric vehicles and contribute towards a reduction of approximately 3,720 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.

“As we work toward a cleaner, more sustainable future, expanding access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure is a crucial step in reducing emissions,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “These fast chargers at JFK are a significant step forward in our broader efforts to support a greener transportation network.”

“The Port Authority and its private partners like Revel are leading the charge in building a net-zero future, and this latest expansion of two dozen more fast chargers at JFK is a major boost in that work,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “More access to electric vehicle charging equipment helps advance our sustainability goals and reaffirms our agency’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.”

With the new Revel charging station at the FHV lot adjacent to JFK Building 141, JFK now hosts a total of 46 EV fast charging ports that are operational at all times, helping to reduce charging wait times and improving traffic flow. Widely available, easily accessible charging infrastructure is crucial in facilitating the shift to electric vehicles. JFK’s 46 EV fast chargers for airport users will benefit both customers and FHV drivers seeking more fast-charging solutions.

In addition to working with the Port Authority at the JFK lot, Revel will install the largest public fast-charging lot near an airport in the nation, with 48 fast charging ports outside LaGuardia Airport to support airport users, FHV drivers and the surrounding community. That lot will be located at 90-10 Ditmars Boulevard in East Elmhurst, Queens, where it is expected to open later this year.

“Reliable fast charging at New York’s airports, where rideshare drivers start and end their most valuable trips, will make or break our city’s electrification mandate,” said Frank Reig, co-founder & CEO of Revel. “We’re proud to partner with the Port Authority to bring the city’s fastest chargers directly to those drivers, first at JFK and later this year at LGA.”

“With these fast chargers and the ones coming to LaGuardia later this year, we’re taking great strides down the path towards a more sustainable and affordable city,” said NYC Taxi & Limousine Commissioner David Do. “Our airports are by far the biggest trip generators for hardworking TLC drivers. By prioritizing development of these charging hubs, the Port Authority and Revel are not only making life easier for thousands of EV drivers who need them right now, but also for the tens of thousands who will be converting to zero-emission vehicles in the coming years.”

“At Kempower, we are committed to accelerating the transition to electric mobility with our reliable and user-friendly DC fast charging solutions,” said Monil Malhotra, president of Kempower Inc., which manufactured the chargers installed by Revel. “We are proud to support the expansion of EV infrastructure at JFK Airport, ensuring that for-hire vehicle drivers and travelers have access to fast, efficient charging whenever they need it.”

“We’re proud that our PowerReady incentive program is enabling the expansion of JFK International Airport’s public fast charging network, helping to make the transition to electric vehicles more accessible for New Yorkers as well as visitors to our dynamic region,” said Raghu Sudhakara, vice president of distributed resource integration at Con Edison. “Additionally, we’re building a new substation complex in eastern Queens that will support the Port Authority’s broader electrification of the airport, helping the state meet its climate goals, as we maintain our nation-leading reliable electric service.”

Con Edison’s PowerReady incentive program supports the expansion of EV charging access by incentivizing buildout of a widespread EV charging network.

In addition to supporting public access of EV charging infrastructure, the Port Authority and its operational partners have collaborated to incorporate more electric vehicles within airport operations as well. Across the agency’s three major airports, 1,400 electric ground service vehicles and 775 electric ground service chargers are currently in use for equipment such as baggage tractors and airplane tows. Beyond EV infrastructure, the Port Authority has undertaken several other ambitious sustainability initiatives at its airports, including New York State’s largest rooftop solar array at JFK’s New Terminal One, the nation’s largest airport solar rooftop at Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal A parking garage, a solar array on JFK’s long-term parking Lot 9, and a solar rooftop at LaGuardia Airport. The agency is also committed to electrifying its light duty fleet by 2028 and nearly all of its ground service equipment at airports converted to electric by 2035.",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/54397773055_81dc9540cd_k.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 11:56:52.874194

Both the UK and the European Union have established mandates that require a specific amount of SAF to be used starting from January 2025, along with regulations on how SAF should be produced in the future.

SAF is currently almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids). However, Hydrogen Refinery’s technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

“Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF,” Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery explained. “This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill.”

In 2024, Farnborough Airport received Level 4+carbon accreditation status from the Airport Carbon Accreditation. The airport also announced the completion of one of the largest lightweight solar installations in the Southeast of England, allowing it to produce 25% of its own energy.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/03/740ooglu-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 10:56:48.636372

As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem.
Looking forward, Airbus plans to continue to increase the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of at least 30% SAF in its global fuel mix by 2030.","What do Toulouse, Hamburg, Mobile, Tianjin and Mirabel have in common? All of these Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

Thanks to this development, by the end of 2025, all Airbus customers, regardless of where they are taking delivery of their aircraft, can do so with SAF on board, free of charge. In 2024, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend, and this is expected to increase soon, once aircraft deliveries using SAF begin at Mirabel later this year.

SAF remains a key lever for the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals. SAF is anticipated to provide the bulk of the emissions reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimating that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions required.

In recent years, Airbus has been increasing the percentage of SAF used in its own operations to 16%, which includes business travel, delivery flights (where a plane is delivered to the home base of the purchasing airline following the transfer of title), and transportation of aircraft parts between different production sites.

To achieve this, Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Thanks to a partnership signed in 2024, TotalEnergies supplies more than half the SAF to meet Airbus’ needs in Europe. We have also joined forces with airlines. Volotea, which operates a Hamburg-Toulouse flight for Airbus employees as part of our internal shuttle service, has been using a 34% SAF blend on this route since 2022. And following a successful pilot in 2023, since 2024 Air France-KLM and Airbus have had a “SAF fares agreement”, with Airbus purchasing SAF options for employee business travel connecting Paris with five locations: Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich and Toulouse.

Partnerships and pilots

Looking further afield, in 2024, Airbus launched a pilot scheme with easyJet, who operate flights on the Toulouse-Bristol route, a popular route for business travel due to the proximity to Airbus’ Toulouse and Filton sites. Running between November 2024 and January 2025, the scheme saw Airbus finance 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the period.

In January 2025, Airbus, Wizz Air and Moeve and Charleroi Airport completed a SAF operational trial. Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise during the trial, which saw Wizz Air operate more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel. A survey was also completed during this period, which shone a light on passenger awareness of, and attitudes towards, low-carbon aviation including SAF.

Scaling the SAF ecosystem

Even though the quantity of SAF available has increased in recent years, demand remains suppressed due to the higher cost of SAF compared to kerosene – 2.8x according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. The industry has to address this disparity and reduce the price gap with traditional fuel.

Although Airbus is not a SAF producer, there is a role it can play. As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem. In 2024, Airbus invested in SAFFA, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund. SAFFA focuses on SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification, although the investments can take place across different production pathways and regions. SAFFA’s first investment, in US-based Crysalis Biosciences, will help the company produce low-carbon intensity SAF and biochemicals.

In 2024, Airbus also made an investment in sustainable aviation fuels producer and technology company LanzaJet. Airbus’ investment supports LanzaJet in scaling its SAF production process which uses ethanol, known as the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway. LanzaJet recently opened a new SAF plant in Soperton, Georgia, with the capacity to produce 9 million gallons of SAF each year.

Looking forward, Airbus plans to continue to increase the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of at least 30% SAF in its global fuel mix by 2030.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102255/676756-ingyp0p5hx-preview.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 10:57:17.536811

-

The first sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) delivery recently took place at the Airbus Canada’s A220 site, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for production, customer acceptance and test flights. This now means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

During the course of 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This year alone, in 2025, over 600,000 litres of SAF with a 30% blend are expected to be used at the Airbus Mirabel site resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 400 metric tons.

Benoît Schultz, CEO Airbus Canada said, “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

In 2024, 18% of Airbus global fuel mix for the year was SAF. That’s more than 16 million litres of neat SAF. Alongside this, 75% of our aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, representing also the importance our customers are placing on decarbonisation.

Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping. Airbus Canada has the ambition to deliver SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025. SAF has been used in A220 aircraft delivered from our A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is over 1.5 million square feet and includes, among others, a pre-final assembly line (pre-FAL), two final assembly lines (FAL), a customer response centre (CRC), a flight and integration test centre (FITC), and a brand new delivery centre.

A Shift Toward Accountability and Precision

As aviation embraces decarbonization, the question on many minds—corporate and individual alike—is simple: how much difference does sustainable aviation fuel really make? For years, this answer was vague. But now, a quiet leap forward is offering greater clarity.

IATA has upgraded its CO2 Connect calculator, integrating a new methodology to reflect emissions reductions made possible by sustainable aviation fuel. This move brings transparency and accuracy to the forefront—two factors crucial for stakeholders seeking verified climate impact data.

More Than a Calculator

CO2 Connect is not just a digital tool. It represents a significant cultural shift in how the industry views emissions data. Unlike many carbon calculators that rely on generalized assumptions, CO2 Connect is built on actual operational data shared by more than 60 participating airlines.

This direct data stream means that carbon figures are no longer approximations—they are reflections of real activity, from departure gate to cruising altitude. The enhanced system now considers sustainable aviation fuel use across an airline’s network and applies proportional reductions to passenger emissions.

Shared Reductions Now, Precision Later

Currently, the calculator spreads the benefit of SAF evenly across all flights in an airline’s network. This equal distribution simplifies reporting and ensures that all passengers benefit from the operator’s SAF commitment.

However, what makes this development especially compelling is what comes next. IATA plans to introduce route-specific reductions in future updates. This means emission calculations will eventually reflect the precise volume of SAF used on particular flights, giving travelers more relevant, route-level climate data.

Empowering Passengers and Companies

Travelers today are more climate-aware than ever. Corporations are making pledges aligned with science-based targets. But ambition alone is not enough—proof is essential. With CO2 Connect’s SAF integration, both individual flyers and corporate travel managers gain a clearer picture of emissions reductions.

This level of insight helps corporations evaluate the climate benefit of their SAF investments. It allows passengers to choose itineraries that align with their values. In essence, it translates intention into impact, and investment into measurable benefit.

A Standardized Method With Global Buy-In

At the core of the upgrade is the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology. This document defines how sustainable fuel usage should be calculated and reported per passenger. It brings alignment across airlines and encourages consistency across borders.

Standardization matters. Without it, data cannot be compared, scaled, or integrated into broader ESG strategies. By creating and deploying this methodology through CO2 Connect, IATA is offering more than numbers—it is offering a shared language for sustainability.

The Value of Collective Accuracy

The recent inclusion of airlines such as Air India, Air Astana, and Oman Air has brought the total number of CO2 Connect contributors to around sixty. Each airline adds a new layer of accuracy to the system. As participation grows, so does the precision of emission estimates.

This collaborative model turns a calculator into a living, evolving emissions index. It reflects the operational reality of global aviation, one data point at a time. And it does so in a way that grows more insightful with every new contributor.

Building Momentum for Broader Change

While CO2 Connect does not reduce emissions directly, it plays a catalytic role. By making emissions data more granular, traceable, and responsive to SAF usage, it encourages behavioral shifts across the industry.

For airlines, it creates an incentive to invest in SAF and declare it transparently. For consumers, it builds trust in sustainability claims. And for policymakers, it provides a robust example of voluntary alignment with best-practice reporting.

The journey to decarbonize aviation is long. But tools like this bring waypoints of progress. They make the invisible visible. And they help ensure that every drop of SAF, every operational improvement, every commitment made—counts.

Conclusion: Transparency is Taking Off

The upgraded CO2 Connect tool may seem technical, even niche. But its impact is expansive. It turns carbon math into climate meaning. It gives airlines the ability to demonstrate reductions, and travelers the ability to understand them.

In an era when sustainability risks being lost in a fog of vague metrics and overused promises, CO2 Connect stands out. It is grounded in real data, aligned with global standards, and designed for evolution. As the aviation sector climbs toward net zero, this is one tool that will help keep the path clear.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-03-21 10:58:03.692142

Contrails are the streaks of cloud that trail behind high-flying aircraft. While they appear harmless, research now confirms their significant role in trapping heat in the atmosphere. These high-altitude clouds, formed in ice-supersaturated regions, reflect solar radiation but also retain Earth’s heat. This warming impact is comparable to that of aviation carbon dioxide emissions.

Unlike greenhouse gases that persist for centuries, contrails have a short lifespan. Yet their contribution to climate forcing is powerful and immediate. The urgency to act is clear. Reducing contrails offers a near-term opportunity to lower aviation’s climate impact while cleaner fuels and propulsion systems are still scaling up.

Why Contrails Matter in the Climate Equation

Aircraft engines emit not just carbon dioxide but also soot and water vapor. When these emissions enter cold, humid areas of the upper troposphere, the soot particles serve as a nucleus for ice crystal formation. These crystals develop into visible contrails. Some disperse within minutes, but others linger, creating contrail cirrus that resembles natural cirrus clouds.

The problem lies in their heat-trapping potential. Contrail cirrus behaves like insulation. It reflects some sunlight but blocks a greater amount of heat from escaping back into space. The net result is surface warming. Even though they dissipate quickly, their cumulative effect, especially on flight-intensive routes, can rival carbon emissions in warming impact.

Smart Solutions to a High-Altitude Challenge

To address contrails, the aviation sector is exploring three strategic pathways. Each presents its own mix of feasibility, effectiveness, and long-term value.

Treating Conventional Jet Fuel

Reducing the aromatic content in jet fuel lowers soot emissions. Less soot means fewer ice crystals and fewer persistent contrails. Hydrotreating fuels is a proven process, but it is energy intensive and carbon heavy. While it offers immediate contrail mitigation, it may not be a sustainable long-term solution due to its carbon cost.

Using Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is both low-carbon and low-soot. When SAF burns, it releases fewer particulates, significantly cutting contrail formation. But supply remains limited. To maximize impact, researchers suggest blending higher concentrations—up to 50 percent—and reserving this fuel for flights that are most likely to produce warming contrails. This targeted approach can be up to fifteen times more effective than uniform low-percentage blends across all flights.

Adjusting Flight Paths

Contrails form only in specific atmospheric zones. With better forecasting and AI-supported satellite data, pilots can avoid these regions by making small altitude adjustments. Early trials show promise. However, real-time implementation requires coordination with air traffic control and is most practical on low-traffic night flights across the Atlantic, where contrails tend to form and persist most frequently.

Making Policy Work for the Climate

Contrails present a different challenge than carbon dioxide. They are unpredictable, harder to track, and variable in effect. For this reason, integrating non-carbon aviation effects into policy requires bespoke frameworks. A blanket focus on carbon reduction may miss the opportunity to address contrails with high-impact, near-term action.

Policymakers could consider contrail-specific mitigation as a separate pillar. This could include incentives for targeted SAF use, funding for atmospheric modeling, and air traffic protocols that support altitude adjustments for climate optimization.

Looking at the Bigger Picture

Addressing contrails is not a distraction from carbon goals. Rather, it complements them. Both need attention. Sustainable aviation must include measures for both long-lived and short-lived climate pollutants. While carbon neutrality may take decades, reducing contrails can yield benefits in years.

Moreover, tackling contrails builds operational experience in climate-smart flying. It opens doors to intelligent routing, improved weather analytics, and strategic fuel deployment—foundations for the net-zero aviation future.

Conclusion: A Clearer Path to Climate-Friendly Skies

Contrails are no longer just a curiosity of high-altitude travel. They are a key part of aviation’s warming footprint and represent an underutilized opportunity for impact. With a blend of sustainable fuels, smarter routing, and refined policy, the aviation industry can start reducing its skyprint now.

Momentum is building. Research continues to refine the tools and models needed for contrail mitigation. As global climate goals tighten, practical and effective strategies like these deserve a place at the decision table.

By acting on contrails today, the aviation sector can offer not just lower emissions tomorrow but cooler skies right now.

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38 per cent blended SAF since 2021.

With SAF mandates taking effect in 2025, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly threatened by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates for SAF usage starting in January 2025. These regulations aim to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support growth in SAF production without encouraging the diversion of agricultural land from food production.

SAF is currently almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), but Hydrogen Refinery's technology can produce carbon-negative SAF from mixed waste products sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, chief executive at Farnborough Airport, said: ""We are excited to be forging an alliance with Hydrogen Refinery. Their technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF to become the first airport to offer a 20 per cent blend across its entire supply by 2028, ahead of the UK Government's target of 10 per cent by 2030. This aligns with our ambitions to be an incubator for sustainable technologies and support domestic SAF refining at scale.

""Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller, modern aircraft we handle and the economic value of the flights we support.

The facility is part of a $140 million planned investment by W2V and will process 200 tons of organic waste daily, such as food scraps and processing byproducts, to convert them into renewable natural gas. This will help minimize costs and waste, as more than 40% of food produced in the U.S. (nearly 915 pounds per person) is discarded, costing Americans an average of $1,500 per person annually to collect and landfill. By diverting this waste from landfills, the facility will significantly reduce this inefficiency, create American-made energy and jobs, and contribute to a more sustainable waste management ecosystem.

“We are pleased to see growth in the energy sector and opportunities for jobs and development at Kingsbury Industrial Park,” said local resident and La Porte County Council President Adam Koronka.

The Kingsbury Bioenergy Complex will be a major economic engine for Northwest Indiana. At peak construction, it will generate 50-60 well-paying jobs, followed by dozens of long-term positions once operations begin. By investing in local talent and infrastructure, Nexus W2V aims to actively contribute to the region economically while creating a more efficient solution for organic waste in and around the area.

“The Kingsbury Bioenergy Complex represents an incredible opportunity to make a lasting impact on the environment and create a more circular economy. We’re thrilled to partner with Indiana on this landmark project,” said Roshan Vani, CEO of Nexus W2V. “This is a decisive step toward a future where waste is transformed into a valuable resource.”

The project is projected to avoid 4 million tons of carbon over 20 years—and its natural gas production will be equivalent to powering 45,700 homes. The site will process approximately 2 million tons of organic waste in its lifetime, increasing the lifespan of existing landfills and producing sustainable soil products to support agricultural and environmental health. The facility also addresses today’s critical environmental challenges of providing an alternative to traditional waste disposal methods for large cities in the region and generating multiple revenue streams for the local community from waste transformation.

The project's strategic location capitalizes on the region's unique advantages. The complex is well positioned to serve local and regional waste management needs across multiple interstates, has access to the rail network, and is in close proximity to Chicago's robust food production industry, giving waste haulers an environmentally responsible alternative to traditional landfill disposal.

“Indiana continues to lead the nation in attracting forward-thinking investments in energy and waste management solutions,” said State Rep. Jim Pressel (R-Rolling Prairie). “With our strong infrastructure, skilled workforce, and commitment to business-friendly policies, we are the perfect location for projects like the Kingsbury Bioenergy Complex. As a bonus, Indiana is setting an example for the rest of the country on how to balance economic growth with efficiency.”

The facility recently broke ground and is scheduled for completion in late 2026.

This rollout will enable the Mirabel teams to utilize SAF for production, customer acceptance, and test flight operations.

This now means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

All Airbus Facilities Now on SAF

This achievement means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites worldwide are now operating with SAF for internal operations.

This global integration of SAF underscores Airbus’ dedication to embedding sustainable practices throughout its manufacturing processes.

Furthermore, the manufacturer has announced that by 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This will significantly expand the accessibility of greener fuel options.

Mirabel SAF Consumption

The impact of this shift is already tangible. In 2025 alone, the Airbus Mirabel site anticipates using over 600,000 liters of a 30 percent SAF blend. This substantial volume is projected to result in a reduction of approximately 400 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada, highlighted the significance of this milestone. “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.”

“It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

The numbers speak for themselves. In 2024, 18 percent of Airbus’s global fuel mix was SAF, translating to over 16 million liters of neat SAF. Additionally, 75 percent of Airbus aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, demonstrating the growing importance of decarbonization to customers.

Blended SAF

The management of SAF at the Mirabel site adheres to the mass balance principle. Once delivered, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (CAF), also known as Jet-A1, within the site’s fuel farm.

This dilution process is conducted according to established standards and auditable bookkeeping, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Airbus Canada is aiming to provide SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025, further solidifying their commitment to sustainable practices.

Notably, the A220 has been operating with SAF from the A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is currently certified to operate with up to 50 percent SAF.

Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, Airbus has set an ambitious goal for all its aircraft to be capable of running on 100 percent SAF by 2030, marking a significant step towards a fully sustainable aviation future.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is a sprawling facility spanning over 1.5 million square feet. It encompasses a pre-final assembly line, two final assembly lines, a customer response center, a flight and integration test center, and a brand-new delivery center.

This state-of-the-art facility is home to over 3,500 Airbus employees, all contributing to the company’s mission of innovation and sustainability.

By embracing SAF and implementing sustainable practices across its operations, Airbus is setting a new standard for the aviation industry.

The recent SAF delivery at the Mirabel site furthers the manufacturer’s commitment to a greener future for air travel.

Produced through the electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable energy sources like solar and wind, renewable hydrogen offers a clean alternative to fossil fuels and is a crucial component in the clean energy transition.

Renewable hydrogen is also critical to decarbonise certain industries where electricity from renewables won’t be enough. These areas are typically defined as hard-to-abate sectors and include things like aviation, maritime, steel and alumina industries.

Take aeroplanes for example. If you want to power an aeroplane with electricity, the sheer amount and size of the batteries that would be required for a long-distance flight would add so much weight to the plane it would be commercially unviable and a safety hazard.

Renewable hydrogen can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a solution to the aviation decarbonisation challenge. Down the road, the hope is it will be a lynch pin to create electrofuels (e-fuels). E-fuels are synthetic fuels in gas or liquid form made from renewable energy sources.

The issue is renewable hydrogen is currently expensive to produce, and the cost is one factor that is stalling projects and wide-spread market adoption in Australia.

With current technology, it costs $6-$9 to make 1 kilogram (kg) of renewable hydrogen. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) knows the cost needs to be brought down for hydrogen to be sold at a competitive price. A drop in the cost to produce renewable hydrogen is one method of accelerating the clean energy source to be widely adopted across the market and drive down emissions.

There are also other opportunities to improve project economics and therefore lower the potential sales price of renewable hydrogen as technology moves forward. One of these potential revenue streams is pure oxygen.

In certain projects, the use of pure oxygen could help to make renewable hydrogen more commercially viable in the years to come.

Pure oxygen

Electrolysis is a process that makes renewable hydrogen. This is a process where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen through an electrolyser with the use of electricity from renewable energy sources. It’s completely emissions free.

Oxygen is a byproduct of this process. For every 1kg of renewable hydrogen there is 8kg of oxygen left behind.

Many industries can use the byproduct such as the medical field or to help in other emissions reductions through applications such as wastewater treatment.

ARENA is supporting projects to explore ways to use pure oxygen as a byproduct to help drive renewable hydrogen’s commercial viability. The oxygen can also help meet emissions reduction targets through its application in other industries. It’s a win-win for industryand the Australian public as we move forward to a net zero future.

Pure Oxygen and use for wastewater treatment

Last year, ARENA committed $3 million in funding to Barwon Water for the Green Oxygen for Wastewater Treatment project.

The project aims to use pure oxygen from Viva Energy’s renewable hydrogen production plant in Geelong in the treatment of wastewater at Barwon Water’s Northern Water Plant.

ARENA supplied $34 million to Viva Energy to build ‘Australia’s first commercially scaled and publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling station.’

A circular economy will result from the collaboration where pure, clean oxygen is fed to Barwon Water’s treatment plant and wastewater is treated through oxygenation. The clean water will then be available for Viva Energy to use in the production of renewable hydrogen for its fuelling station.

Australia has over 1200 wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which contribute more than 2.95 million tonnes of CO2 in Australia. The project seeks to not only make renewable hydrogen more commercially viable through use of its byproduct, but it also serves a further emissions reduction opportunity.

Wastewater treatment remains one of the largest and most challenging sources of emissions in the water utilities sector, according to the Australian Water Association (AWA).

Science behind oxygenation and wastewater treatment

Wastewater treatment is a critical process to remove contaminants from water to make it safe for discharge or reuse. Oxygenation is a key step in this treatment.

When added into water, oxygen supports the growth of beneficial microorganisms. These microorganisms break down organic matter and other pollutants, effectively cleaning the water.

Traditionally, wastewater treatment plants use air, which is only about 20% oxygen. To pump the air through the wastewater, it requires energy. According to Barwon Water, this process takes up 50-70% of the energy used in the process.

Oxygen has a 90% purity and would enhance the activity of the microorganisms, allowing them to break down pollutants faster and more efficiently. This process would drastically reduce energy use and lower emissions for wastewater treatment.

Oxygen use at Barwon Water will not only improve the efficiency of the treatment but also provide a valuable use for the oxygen that would otherwise go to waste.

Real world impact

The project will be in two stages.

In the first stage, Barwon Water will complete a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study to determine the technical and economic feasibility of the concept.

If successful, the project will move to the second stage, which involves a two-year demonstration of the use of oxygen sourced from Viva Energy’s electrolyser, at the Northern Water Plant.

The collaboration between ARENA and Barwon Water is a shining example of how innovative thinking and collaboration can drive positive change. By harnessing the power of renewable hydrogen and improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment, this project is paving the way for a more sustainable future.

As technology continues to advance, the potential for similar projects to be implemented across Australia and beyond is substantial.

The lessons learned from the project could inspire other regions to adopt similar approaches, furthering the global transition to a cleaner, greener future.

Expanding the vision

Integration of renewable hydrogen production with other industrial processes, can create a more interconnected and efficient energy system.

Industries that require large amounts of oxygen, such as steel manufacturing or chemical production, could benefit from the surplus oxygen generated during electrolysis. This would not only improve the efficiency of these industries but also reduce their environmental impact and commercial viability.

The success of the Barwon Water and Viva Energy project could serve as a model for other regions and countries looking to enhance their sustainability efforts.",https://arena.gov.au/assets/2025/03/AdobeStock_215987645-scaled-e1742522489398.jpeg,N,,2025-03-20 22:57:16.523836

Advocates say the ban would protect the aquifer from possible leaks that could lead to contamination of a major water source for much of Central Illinois.
Much of Republican State Sen. Sally Turner's district is served by the Mahomet Aquifer.
Rehn said polluting the aquifer is not worth the risk, citing carbon capture leaks at ADM last year.
The measure unanimously passed out of an Illinois Senate committee on Thursday.","After months of community engagement, the Illinois House and Senate are endorsing a bill that would ban carbon sequestration near the Mahomet Aquifer.

This comes after the Senate put a proposed ban on hold last fall to better study the technology and its environmental risks. Carbon capture technology involves injecting climate warming CO2 deep underground.

Advocates say the ban would protect the aquifer from possible leaks that could lead to contamination of a major water source for much of Central Illinois.

A year ago, Illinois placed a two-year pause on carbon sequestration.

Much of Republican State Sen. Sally Turner's district is served by the Mahomet Aquifer. She's said she's open to carbon capture, but not near the aquifer.

“The biggest thing for me is it's a sole sourced aquifer. It's the water for over a million people. I think that it's really important that we make sure and safeguard that area,” said Turner, adding that protecting the aquifer, so far, has been bipartisan effort.

""Everybody has a source of drinking water wherever they are throughout the state,"" Turner said. ""How would this affect me if it happened to me in my area? So, I think that's how they all look at it. And don't get me wrong, we all want jobs. We all want economic development. We just need to put this process in the right place.”

Even with the bipartisan support, Turner said she and chief sponsor Sen. Paul Faraci, D-Champaign, are ready for further discussion with opponents.

“If there's something that needs to be tweaked to assist in another avenue that would help all the way around, I think Sen. Fauci is willing to look at that,” Turner said. “But we haven't heard what those things are they're looking for. So, we're waiting to see what those things are.”

Andrew Rehn is director of climate policy at the Prairie Rivers Network, a Champaign-based environmental group. Rehn said polluting the aquifer is not worth the risk, citing carbon capture leaks at ADM last year.

“While policy decisions often involve how much risk do we want to take for said economic benefit, for the Mahomet Aquifer, the tolerance has got to be zero,” Rehn said. “And that means that any number you come up with on how much risk you want to take is not appropriate in the Mahomet Aquifer.”

Rehn isn’t opposed to carbon sequestration as a practice, but thinks it should be done someplace else.

“We're taking our aquifer, our sole source of drinking water, and we're proposing to do an experiment under that aquifer doesn't make sense,” Rehn said. “Let's do this somewhere else. Let's not do it under the aquifer. Let's not induce those risks, whatever those risks might be. Let's make sure the risk is zero for a sole source of drinking water.”

Republican State Sen. Chris Balkema who represents parts of Bloomington-Normal is not a sponsor of the bill, but said the issue deeply affects those he represents.

Balkema said he, too, is worried about the possible leaks, but also acknowledges the technology's potential. In his district, companies are working to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

“We have to grow jobs in Illinois,” Balkema said. “We have to find ways for these companies to produce sustainable aviation fuel, and we gotta do all of the above, protecting the environment and the water source, while not losing out to companies outside of Illinois.”

Brazil central bank raises target rate to 14.25pc

Sao Paulo, 20 March (Argus) — Brazil's central bank raised its target interest rate by 1 percentage point to 14.25pc amid accelerating inflation in a decelerating — but still heated — economy. The hike in the target rate, announced Wednesday, was the fifth in a row from a cyclical low of 10.5pc at the end of September last year, partly prompted by accelerating depreciation of the currency, the real, to the US dollar. Brazil's annualized inflation hit 5.06pc in February and is poised to keep accelerating. The bank's Focus economic report increased its inflation forecast to 5.7pc for the end-of-year 2025 from 5.5pc in January, when the bank's policy-making committee last met. Brazil's current government has an inflation ceiling goal of 3pc with tolerance of 1.5 percentage point above or below. The bank has recently changed the way it tracks the inflation goal. Instead of tracking inflation on a calendar year basis, it now monitors the goal on a rolling 12-month basis. The bank cited heated economic activity and a strong labor market as factors that have contributed to rising inflation. But the bank forecasts ""modest GDP growth"" for Brazil of almost 2pc in 2025, down from 3.4pc growth last year. Further tightening will also be linked to global economic uncertainty prompted by US president Donald Trump's aggressive trade and other policies and the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve , according to the bank. Brazil's target interest rate is expected to keep rising at the bank's next meeting in 6-7 May, albeit to ""a lesser extent"" as the contributing factors are set to moderate, according to the committee.

TotalEnergies delays, cuts size of Grandpuits HVO

Barcelona, 20 March (Argus) — TotalEnergies is delaying the start up of its Grandpuits hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) plant, and is planning to reduce the plant's proposed capacity. TotalEnergies confirmed the planned 400,000 t/yr HVO and HVO jet fuel (SAF) plant, near Paris, will not start in 2025 as previously outlined. Instead, a first phase of 210,000t of SAF output is slated to begin operations ""early in 2026."" TotalEnergies said there will then be a second phase of 75,000t, which will start at an unspecified point in 2027, giving 285,000 t/yr. If all production is SAF this would be equivalent to around 6,155 b/d. The CGT union said its members at Grandpuits downed tools for 24 hours yesterday, 19 March, as a result of the company's announcement. Workers say they have been promised a meeting with management in mid-April, and there does not appear to be industrial action at the site today. TotalEnergies halted crude distillation at the 93,000 b/d Grandpuits four years ago . The transformation includes a 10,000 t/yr plastics recycling unit. It said 1,200 workers are on site to undertake the conversion and this will result in 250 full time posts on completion. This is consistent with previous plans . The delay and reduction in size at Grandpuits does appear to confound targets for TotalEnergies' HVO and SAF output previously laid out by chief executive Patrick Pouyanne .

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

LowLands signs biomethanol deals with shipping firms

London, 18 March (Argus) — Dutch renewable methanol producer LowLands has signed several bio- and low carbon-methanol supply agreements with shipping firms, its chief executive Gijs Bakker said. The value of these agreements surpasses €1bn and is ""rising fast"", Bakker said. The supply will come from LowLands' 120,000 t/yr biomethanol facility in Moerdijk, Netherlands, which will use waste wood and municipal waste as feedstock. Bakker highlighted that the location at Moerdijk will offer ""logistical advantages"" to clients in Rotterdam and Antwerp. He said that the product price is very competitive compared with e-methanol, with a discount rate of 40-50pc. Production at the plant was initially scheduled to begin in 2024, but has been delayed until end of 2027 or early 2028, because of ""war and its consequences on utility pricing"", LowLands told Argus . ""[Northwest Europe] has excellent infrastructure for collecting bio-wastes"", Bakker said. ""This makes [it] a preferred location for biomethanol production units."" He noted that the slower-than-expected development of green hydrogen capacity means biomethanol from biogenic carbon will remain competitive for longer. International offtake agreements for renewable methanol are on the rise with the January rollout of the FuelEU maritime regulation, which could increase demand for biomethanol in shipping. Ship operators traveling to, out of, and within EU territorial waters must reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity on a lifecycle basis by 2pc. The cuts will reach 6pc from 2030 and gradually reach 80pc by 2050. Shipping firm Maersk has signed several letters of intent for procurement of biomethanol and e-methanol from producers including Norway's Equinor , Switzerland's Proman and Dutch-based chemical company OCI Global , and has an agreement with Chinese wind turbine manufacturer Goldwind for 500,000 t/yr from 2024. Maersk sees biomethanol and e-methanol as likely the most competitive and scalable pathways to decarbonisation this decade. While relatively small, Maersk's ""green marine"" fuel consumption, which includes biomethanol, increased by 38pc in 2024 to 3,034 GWh.

Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.
""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""","Fuels like kerosene can be produced in a climate-friendly way from CO2, water and green electricity using power-to-liquid processes. Researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have already demonstrated this with systems in actual operation.

Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling—at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale—the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis.

In order to achieve its climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that do not easily lend themselves to electrification. ""The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,"" says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from KIT's Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT).

""Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.""

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project and heads the corresponding research activities at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: For the first time in the world, the innovative, highly efficient water vapor/CO2 co-electrolysis technology from industrial partner Sunfire was coupled directly with a synthesis process at an industry-relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis output).

Co-electrolysis makes power-to-liquid more efficient

For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT's Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used. First, syngas—a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide—is produced from CO2 and water.

In principle, there are several ways to generate syngas. The new configuration uses a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire, which simplifies this process step and, above all, boosts its efficiency.

""Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step. Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.

""In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,"" says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire.

""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the syngas needs to be brought to reaction pressure. This job is done by a compressor with safety devices the researchers added to the process chain. In a microstructured reactor, the syngas is then converted to long-chain hydrocarbons—known as syncrude—using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These hydrocarbons can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products.

Scientists at KIT developed this reactor technology, which is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a KIT spin-off. In the future, it is planned to use the heat released as vapor during synthesis for the co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy demand of the entire process and demonstrate that the product preparation to finally obtain kerosene is feasible at this scale.

By combining these process steps, it is possible to fully utilize the carbon dioxide provided and achieve the highest possible energy conversion efficiency, as this process chain allows efficient recycling of material flows in addition to the energy flows.

The next step: A ton of kerosene per day

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to 100 liters of syncrude per day. Coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus P2X project. The facility is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters syncrude per day.

In the third and final funding phase, the research team has INERATEC additionally build a larger Fischer-Tropsch production facility in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. ""For the first time, ton-scale production will be realized there,"" says Dittmeyer.

The product, which will eventually be processed into kerosene, will be used by aircraft engine manufacturers and research partners for testing. Accompanying analyses will ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/boosting-the-efficienc.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 18:00:27.934027

This move aligns with the release of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which provides specific rules for calculating carbon emissions reductions associated with SAF usage. The enhancement aims to give airlines, corporations, and individual travelers a clearer understanding of the impact of SAF on their carbon footprint.

Improving Transparency with SAF Emissions Data

The newly enhanced CO2 Connect calculator will initially apply uniform per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. This approach is part of IATA’s commitment to transparency and providing accurate emissions data to travelers and businesses alike. The future version of CO2 Connect will allow airlines to allocate SAF-related emissions reductions on a more granular level, assigning specific reductions to individual routes, further increasing the accuracy and relevance of the data.

Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Commercial Products and Services, emphasized that travelers and corporations alike are increasingly seeking to understand the sustainability of their flights. “By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Leger.

A Growing Number of Airlines Participating in CO2 Connect

IATA’s CO2 Connect is already benefiting from contributions by a growing number of airlines. The platform uses real operational data, including aircraft-specific fuel consumption, which is directly provided by participating airlines. This method sets CO2 Connect apart from other calculators, which tend to rely on modeled averages rather than real-world data.

With the recent inclusion of airlines such as Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas, and Royal Air Maroc, the total number of contributing airlines has now reached 60. This expansion further improves the accuracy and transparency of CO2 Connect’s calculations, making it a more powerful tool for individual travelers and businesses seeking to reduce their carbon footprints.

Strengthening Aviation’s Commitment to Decarbonization

IATA’s CO2 Connect is designed to support the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts. By incorporating the SAF accounting methodology, the platform provides a more accurate picture of the environmental impact of air travel, helping to foster more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. According to Leger, the enhanced CO2 Connect is “going from strength to strength” and is poised to play a pivotal role in the aviation industry’s journey toward carbon neutrality.

The tool is not only a step forward for the aviation industry but also provides valuable data for businesses aiming to align with sustainability goals and for travelers looking to make more eco-conscious decisions. The integration of SAF into emissions calculations demonstrates the growing importance of sustainable aviation practices as airlines work toward decarbonization.

As IATA continues to build on this foundation, the platform’s ability to track and report SAF-related emissions reductions will only grow in importance, helping to drive the global aviation industry toward a more sustainable future.

Conclusion

IATA’s latest upgrade to its CO2 Connect emissions calculator represents a significant leap forward in transparency and accuracy in emissions reporting for the aviation industry. With the incorporation of SAF accounting, airlines, corporations, and travelers now have a more precise tool to track and reduce their carbon emissions. As the aviation industry continues its path toward decarbonization, innovations like CO2 Connect will play a crucial role in supporting sustainability goals and ensuring the industry’s long-term environmental viability.

In 2022, Farnborough trialled selling SAF at the same price as Jet A1 fuel for two weeks. However, new UK and EU mandates are putting pressure on domestic SAF sales.

“Hydrogen Refinery’s patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20 per cent blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030,” said Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport. “What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.”

Geere explains how the financial position of Farnborough Airport is a crucial factor when it comes to supporting the development of SAF fuelling technologies, and how its frequent traffic of small modern aircraft is ideal.

“We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling,” commented Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery. “Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill. We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.

Alongside this new agreement, Farnborough Airport has a history of sustainability initiatives, achieving Level 4+ Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) status in 2024, and installing enough light-weight solar panels to generate 25 per cent of its own power.

The project, located in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques region of France, aims to establish the nation's first commercial e-biofuel plant, capable of producing 110,000 tonnes of e-fuels annually from 2029.

The BioTJet facility will leverage wood waste and forestry residues as feedstock, converting them into cleaner jet fuel through a process enhanced by clean hydrogen. This innovative approach addresses the pressing need for sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.

The core technology selected by Elyse Energy, BioTfueL, has undergone rigorous testing at a semi-industrial plant between 2010 and 2021, validated by the Bionext consortium, a collaboration of industry leaders including Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies Nouvelles, Total Energies, and thyssenkrupp Uhde. In 2024, Axens secured a license agreement for the BioTfueL technology, which incorporates thyssenkrupp Uhde's PRENFLO gasification and Axens' GASEL technologies.

A key feature of the BioTJet process is the integration of clean hydrogen, which significantly improves efficiency and reduces emissions. The wood waste is initially subjected to high temperatures to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The addition of clean hydrogen enhances the syngas quality, making it more suitable for subsequent fuel synthesis.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy, emphasized the strategic importance of this technology in providing “cost-competitive” e-fuels. The BioTJet plant is projected to produce 75,000 tonnes of SAF and 35,000 tonnes of naphtha, which will serve both road transport and chemical sectors, diversifying its impact on reducing carbon footprints.

The project has already achieved a significant milestone with the completion of basic engineering in November 2024. Currently, the BioTJet project is progressing through the detailed engineering phase, demonstrating a commitment to timely execution and operational readiness.

This development aligns with the European Union's ambitious ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which mandates a progressive increase in SAF usage within the aviation sector. The regulation requires that SAF constitute 2% of European aviation fuel supplies by 2025, escalating to 70% by 2050.

Despite SAF's potential to significantly reduce aviation emissions, its current adoption remains limited. As of 2024, SAF production accounts for only 0.53% of global jet fuel consumption, primarily due to high production costs and feedstock constraints. The BioTJet project, with its focus on utilizing readily available wood waste and integrating clean hydrogen, aims to address these challenges and accelerate the commercial viability of SAF.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-20 14:58:03.940289

Because of that, customers of commercial airlines will still have residual Scope 3 emissions and will need a way to address them.
• SAF is more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel, and airlines alone cannot bear the cost.
• The refining capacity of sustainable aviation fuel is currently limited, due in part to the up-front capital investment required to expand or build new facilities.
Even so, their investments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry.","SBTi’s recently published Corporate Net-zero Standard v2.0 is a positive step forward for “insets,” which are emission reductions within a company’s value chain. World Energy applauds this development because it provides “hard-to-abate” sectors like aviation, steel, and chemicals with a way to mitigate emissions when they can’t be avoided. With the draft guidance, SBTi recognizes that companies in these industries, and companies whose supply chains include these industries, may have no other option to address their emissions because “direct traceability is not possible or because persistent barriers prevent mitigation at the source.”

They specifically cite sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) and the use of book & claim as an example of a valid option for companies to address their value-chain emissions. With SAFc, the fuel’s environmental attributes are separated from the fuel itself and are tracked using a book & claim chain of custody model. This allows aviation customers to claim the environmental attributes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without purchasing physical fuel.

For example, a SAFc inset purchase enables an airline (Scope 1) and an aviation customer (Scope 3) to claim the environmental benefits of the SAF against their direct (airlines) and indirect (customers) emissions, regardless of where the fuel is being combusted. Ideally, the physical fuel is delivered to an airport as close to the production facility as possible, which helps minimize both logistical costs and emissions.

One point in the draft is concerning, however. It suggests SBTi’s recognition of insets may be “time-limited,” without citing a rationale. We believe insets will have an important role to play for a long time to come for these reasons:

• Individual airlines will not achieve 100% decarbonization by 2050 according to EIA, ATAG and other credible sources, though some might. Because of that, customers of commercial airlines will still have residual Scope 3 emissions and will need a way to address them. With SAFc, corporates can still address these emissions through voluntary actions.

• SAF is more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel, and airlines alone cannot bear the cost. However, Scope 3 customers have the motivation and the means to help. This cost collaboration allows airlines to purchase the fuel itself more affordably while also enabling corporates to achieve their net-zero goals through voluntary actions.

• The refining capacity of sustainable aviation fuel is currently limited, due in part to the up-front capital investment required to expand or build new facilities. Long-term SAFc contracts bring companies with high credit ratings into the financial mix and signal long-term demand. This gives investors confidence that a SAF refinery can count on customers for its product well into the future. And, in the long run, the price of SAF will drop as supply increases.

Corporations with ambitious emissions reduction goals have been using insets like SAFc as indirect mitigation tools, but they haven’t had a standardized way for those reductions to be recognized. Even so, their investments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. If finalized in this form, companies will have added confidence that their Scope 3 emissions reductions will be viable and recognized, which will encourage a new wave of corporations to become involved in the market.

Moving towards physical procurement as soon as practical is a good thing, but an arbitrary expiration date for indirect mitigation it will eliminate a tool for corporates to decarbonize “hard-to-abate” sectors and will also signal to investors that voluntary offtake agreements aren’t bankable.

The comment period on this draft guidance runs until June 1 and World Energy looks forward to constructive engagement with SBTi to build out pragmatic mitigation solutions.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-03-20 18:01:09.297120

Turkish lira at all-time low against dollar

London, 19 March (Argus) — Turkey's lira currency fell to record lows against the US dollar today, after the arrest of Istanbul's mayor provoked concern about instability. The depreciation could cause imports of dollar-denominated commodities to become more expensive, although reaction was mixed across markets. The lira went as low at 40/$1 in early trading, from below 37/$1 on Tuesday 18 March, before easing to around 38/$1 later in the day. The lira has been slowly depreciating against the dollar for many years, but the sharp fall today came after Ekrem Imamoglu, one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rivals, was held on suspicion of corruption and aiding a terrorist organisation. Turkey is a significant importer of natural gas, crude and LPG, as well as coal and petcoke, although demand for many commodities will be muted currently because of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. Early indications from the coal and petcoke markets were that all import trades had halted as the lira hit the record low. In polymers markets the focus is on whether demand recovers after Ramadan ends on 30 March. But a trading source in Turkey said the fall is not enough for ""massive changes"" to imports of oil products. The OECD forecasts headline inflation in Turkey at 31.4pc this year, the highest among its members, easing to 17.3pc in 2026. The IMF has forecast Turkey's economy will grow by 2.6pc this year, after an expansion of 2.7pc in 2024.

English and Welsh roads hit by lack of spending: Survey

London, 19 March (Argus) — More than half of the local road network in England and Wales has less than 15 years of structural life left because of insufficient allocation of government funding to local authorities, according to the latest Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey. The survey, compiled annually by UK industry body Asphalt Industry Association (AIA), found that 52pc, or around 106,000 miles, of the English and Welsh road network managed by local authorities had just 15 years life remaining, and that nearly a third of these roads — around 34,600 miles — may only have up to five years life left. The survey found that in the next 12 months, 24,400 miles, or 12pc, of the network is likely to need some form of maintenance and that just 1.5pc of the local road network was resurfaced over the last year. Although there has been over £20bn ($26bn) spent on carriageway maintenance in England and Wales over the last decade, ""due to the short-term nature of the allocation of funding, it has resulted in no quantifiable uplift to the condition and resilience of the network,"" AIA Chair David Giles said. He added there needs to be a complete change in mindset away from short-term to longer term funding commitments, and he asked the UK government to set a minimum five-year funding horizon and substantially increase investments for local roads maintenance work. UK bitumen consumption has been steadily falling in recent years, with another 10.5 decline registered in 2024, hitting its lowest levels since 2016, according to UK government's department for energy security and net zero (DESNZ) data. The consumption drop coincided with a 20.3pc jump to 449,000t in UK production of the heavy oil product used mainly in road paving as well as general construction, combining to sharply reduce the country's bitumen import requirements. The ALARM survey also found that there had been no improvements in as much as 94pc of the England and Wales local network over the last year. To maintain their network, the survey showed that in England and Wales, local authorities would have needed an extra £7.4m each in 2024 and £16.81bn in total, as a one-off cash injection, to bring their networks up to their ""ideal"" conditions.

Danish firm to set up Kalundborg bitumen terminal

London, 19 March (Argus) — Danish firm Bitumen Danmark will build a new bitumen terminal at Kalundborg, Denmark, with an initial capacity of 10,000-15,000t. The storage facility is scheduled for completion by late 2026 when it could start receiving winter-fill cargoes during the 2026/27 winter ahead of supply into local truck markets when the next paving and general construction season starts in spring 2027. The secured terminal, which could be expanded at a later point, will have deep water access that will enable the firm to take delivery of cargoes carried in bitumen tankers from a wide variety of locations across the Nordics, northwest Europe and the Mediterranean. In 2024, Denmark received around 123,000t of bitumen in cargo shipments, according to Vortexa, with the majority of the tankers delivering into Danish terminals at Aarhus, Nyborg and Koge. Sweden was the biggest single source last year, supplying just over half the total, with just over a third from the Netherlands. Bitumen Danmark supplies bitumen products into the road asphalt and roofing felt sectors in the Nordic region. It is majority owned by German firm BVH Group, a leading bitumen buyer and asphalt products supplier in Germany and parts of central Europe.

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

The report comes after the UK government promised a £200m investment for Project Willow last month.
The capital investment required for each of the nine projects varies significantly, from as little as £15m for the anaerobic digestion project, to up to £2.1bn for the hydrogen-powered methanol production project.
Wait for jobs to go on EY estimates that Project Willow could create up to 1,100 long-term jobs at Grangemouth by 2040.
Unite’s Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said: “The options for the future of the Grangemouth refinery need to be fast-tracked to preserve jobs and skills on the site.","GRANGEMOUTH could host recycling and bio-feedstock production facilities after the site’s oil refinery closes this year, according to proposals published in a report yesterday.

Consultancy EY’s report, commissioned by the Scottish and UK governments for £1.5m (US$1.95m), is the first to provide a detailed picture of Project Willow, the transition plan for the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland, which will close later this year with the loss of at least 400 jobs.

EY’s report made nine project proposals, including: hydrothermal recycling to break down hard-to-recycle plastics; dissolution plastic recycling to return plastics to virgin-like status; converting used cooking oil and other waste into alcohols; timber-to-ethanol production; anaerobic digestion for fuel production from animal waste and sewage; SAF production from hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) cover crops; hydrogen production to power industrial plants, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and ammonia factories.

The report was produced for the Grangemouth refinery’s owner Petroineos, who announced last year that the refinery would close in the second quarter of 2025 due to ongoing losses from their refining operation.

The report comes after the UK government promised a £200m investment for Project Willow last month.

UK government energy minister Michael Shanks said: “We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.

“We will build on Grangemouth’s expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors [and] secure a long-term clean energy future.”

The UK and Scottish governments are now trying to attract private sector investment. Prime minister Keir Starmer previously said he aims to attract £600m from the private sector.

Time and money

EY’s proposals are dependent on the government accepting the report’s recommendations, including energy market reform to reduce renewable energy costs, and an exemption to the cap on SAF feedstocks derived from HEFA, which was included in the government’s SAF mandate last year.

The capital investment required for each of the nine projects varies significantly, from as little as £15m for the anaerobic digestion project, to up to £2.1bn for the hydrogen-powered methanol production project. The anaerobic digestion project would have the earliest start date of all nine, becoming operational by 2028. The methanol plant would not be operational until 2035.

EY estimates all projects would contribute to total UK emissions reductions of just 0.4% compared to 1990 levels. However, individual sectors could benefit from more significant carbon savings, such as shipping emissions which could be reduced by more than 5% with low-carbon ammonia produced at Grangemouth.

Wait for jobs to go on

EY estimates that Project Willow could create up to 1,100 long-term jobs at Grangemouth by 2040. However, it will be years before most of the expected operational jobs arrive, with most of the first construction jobs not expected until 2027.

According to the report, the number of jobs on the site would only exceed 400 – the number of jobs that will be lost when the refinery closes this year – by 2032, and this assumes all nine projects get the go-ahead. Unite the Union has argued that Petroineos’s existing refinery facilities could be converted to a SAF factory and bring operation much nearer. Unite’s Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said: “The options for the future of the Grangemouth refinery need to be fast-tracked to preserve jobs and skills on the site.

“The workers need to see that the political will exists for a decent future for Grangemouth.”

The Scottish government set aside £25m (US$32.4m) last month to expedite the projects identified in yesterday’s report from EY. The UK government has also promised a “training guarantee” for all refinery staff who want skills training at a local college to help them move into new jobs with local employers.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/18934/grangemouth-credit-treasuregalore-shutterstock_1250322649-16-9.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-03-20 12:57:29.198983

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks.

SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented: “We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030.

“What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.”

He added: “The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen. Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support.

“As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented: “We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The airport ranks among the largest single-site suppliers of SAF, selling over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. However, the lack of investment and production in the UK threatens SAF sales. This decrease in production comes after the introduction of SAF mandates at the start of 2025.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented:

We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuel developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s target of 10% by 2030.

The UK and EU have mandated legislation requiring compliance from January 2025, also outlining how SAF will be produced in the future. These mandates are in place to support the development of advanced fuels to support the required growth in SAF.

Waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids) produces almost all SAF. However, Hydrogen Refinery’s technology focuses on producing carbon-negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, said:

We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.

Farnborough’s sustainable stance

The deal with Hydrogen Refinery follows a series of successful milestones achieved by Farnborough Airport. In 2024, the Airport Carbon Accreditation Scheme awarded the airport a Level 4+ carbon accreditation status. This makes it one of five UK airports, and the only business aviation airport, to achieve such recognition. The airport also completed one of the largest lightweight solar installations, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its power.

In 2022, before the Farnborough Airshow, the airport became the first to price SAF equal to Jet A1, promoting its adoption. In the same year, Farnborough Airport committed to achieving Net Zero by 2030 or sooner, setting a leading aviation target.

This new deal adds to the list of partnerships Farnborough has made in 2025.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1024px-Farnborough_Airport_-_Red_Arrows_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1982981.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&ssl=1,N,,2025-03-20 12:57:42.303557

Announcing the green milestone on March 20, 2025, Airbus said its Mirabel A220 site recently welcomed the first tanker truck filled with SAF to power internal operations.

Joining their colleagues around the world, the Airbus A220 teams in Canada will now be able to use SAF for production, customer acceptance and test flights.

“On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too,” Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada said.

According to Airbus, 75% of the planemaker’s aircraft were delivered with SAF in 2024, representing the importance that its customers are also placing on decarbonisation.

While in 2025, Airbus plans that all commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights.

“Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping,” a spokesperson for Airbus explained.

“SAF represents the critical long-term opportunity in commercial aviation’s pursuit of its 2050 net zero emissions ambition,” Virgin Australia Chief Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer, Christian Bennett said in a statement.","Virgin Australia has partnered with Australian energy company Viva Australia to explore sourcing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for selected flights out of Proserpine Airport (PPP) in Queensland between March to July 2025.

Under the agreement, Viva Energy will provide Virgin Australia with SAF consisting of Jet A1 and a 30-40% synthetic blend component made from waste and residue feedstocks.

Jet A1 is a kerosene type of fuel consisting of hydrocarbons and tetraethyl lead. It has a high octane number, designed for high-compression, high-performance engines, a popular choice for propeller aircraft.

According to Virgin Australia, the blend is fully compatible with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure, and all regulatory and safety requirements.

The collaboration will allow Viva Energy to continue to expand its ability to supply SAF-blended jet fuel across Australia using its infrastructure assets, while exploring regional SAF delivery, storage and handling, and direct into-wing dispensing.

According to the Queensland State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, the state is internationally recognized as one of the best locations to establish an Australasian SAF supply chain. This is mainly due to the state already producing significant SAF feedstock such as, tallow, biomass and agricultural residues and has the potential to grow alternative feedstocks such as pongamia and carinata.

“SAF represents the critical long-term opportunity in commercial aviation’s pursuit of its 2050 net zero emissions ambition,” Virgin Australia Chief Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer, Christian Bennett said in a statement.

“Partnership, focused policy development, and collaborations such as this with Viva Energy will be essential if we are to successfully adopt SAF’s broader use in Australia over the years and decades ahead,” Bennett added.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/03/Untitled-design-20.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 10:56:30.668321

Eddy Liegeois, Head of Aviation Policy at the Commission, presented a comprehensive overview of the EU’s strategic direction, emphasizing a commitment to sustainability, competitiveness, and connectivity.

Liegeois detailed upcoming regulatory changes, including a planned review of the Air Service Regulation in 2026, aimed at streamlining ownership rules and facilitating access to finance. He also outlined plans to revisit airport slot allocation and charges, with a focus on ensuring fairness and promoting green investments.

The Commission’s commitment to the “Destination 2050” initiative, a collaborative effort to achieve net-zero emissions, was highlighted as a cornerstone of its strategy.

However, the session was dominated by a vocal critique of the Commission’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, particularly the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative.

Nadia Giordimaina of KLM Malta Airlines delivered a pointed assessment, saying that the current regulations “do not work” and are negatively impacting the industry’s sustainability, competitiveness, and connectivity.

Giordimaina raised concerns about the perceived failure of the fuel suppliers’ flexibility mechanism, the disproportionate cost burden placed on airlines without adequate SAF supply, and the detrimental effects on regional routes.

She also highlighted the administrative challenges of justifying conventional fuel uplift for safety reasons, and the cumulative impact of multiple regulatory deadlines.

“Waiting until 2027 to rectify these issues is not an option,” she asserted, calling for urgent action.

Her views were greeted by loud applause from the audience of ERA members.

Liegeois acknowledged the industry’s concerns, emphasizing the early stage of SAF implementation and the need to allow new regulations time to mature. He pointed to existing funding mechanisms designed to support SAF uptake and reiterated the Commission’s commitment to addressing the price gap between conventional and synthetic fuels.

Looking ahead, the Commission plans to unveil a sustainable transport investment plan later this year, outlining an industrial strategy to bolster SAF production and facilitate offtake agreements. While a market for SAF certificates is not currently planned, further consultation remains a possibility. The Commission also reiterated the importance of global solutions for aviation emissions and ongoing work on non-CO2 emissions monitoring.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250320_105310-1-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 10:57:08.099779

“Nevertheless, we need hydrogen,” Brunini said.
We should not stop because of a 5-10 years delay.” Brunini is also the CEO of airport operator SEA Milan Airports.

His comments come at a time when industry is reviewing its decarbonization goals. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is ramping up too slowly, battery performance is stagnating and Airbus has postponed its ZEROe project, citing a lack of readiness of the hydrogen ecosystem. While the feeling is growing that 2050 targets will be missed, Brunini’s remarks signal a need for renewed stability in the goals aviation is pursuing.

“Let’s not give up on hydrogen,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the Clean Aviation Annual Forum held March 18-19 here in Brussels. The latest version of the Destination 2050 roadmap devised by industry—including ACI—takes into account Airbus’ delay, he noted. The roadmap’s reliance on hydrogen as a contributor to aviation’s sustainability in the next two decades has thus decreased.

SAF thus has a strengthened leading role in Destination 2050. “Nevertheless, we need hydrogen,” Brunini said. “SAF will not do it alone. We also need new-technology aircraft to reach net zero. We should not stop because of a 5-10 years delay.”

Brunini is also the CEO of airport operator SEA Milan Airports. At Milan Malpensa airport, hydrogen needs would total 100-300 metric tons per day, and the top 10 airports in Europe would need to invest a combined €16 billion ($17.4 billion), he said. For safety reasons, trucks cannot carry hydrogen to airports so pipelines, storage facilities and liquefiers will be required, he said.

“We must work on the first bricks now, let’s not relax, otherwise we will fall into a vicious circle and airframers will blame a lagging infrastructure again,” he said. “Hydrogen will be for short- to medium-range aircraft only, yet it is part of the solution.” As a first step, airports should encourage ground vehicles to use hydrogen so they contribute to creating a critical mass in hydrogen needs, he added.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-03-20 06:56:32.588000

Founded in 1995 by Bob and Kelly King on Maui, Pacific Biodiesel created the first retail biodiesel pump in the U.S. and remains the longest-operating biodiesel producer in the country. Today, it is Hawaiʻi’s only commercial producer of liquid biofuels, generating nearly 6 million gallons of biodiesel annually at its Hawaiʻi Island refinery—all of which is used within the state.

Many energy transition projects in infancy; expected completion closer to 2030

India to be big exporter of green ammonia to South Korea, Japan, northwest Europe

Vopak to continue pursuing joint ventures to develop value chains

Initiatives include green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, expanding value chains, and repurposing existing infrastructure to support sustainable feedstocks, according to Vopak president of Asia and Middle East Chris Robblee.

ACCELERATING ENERGY TRANSITION

Vopak is focusing on several key areas to support the global shift toward sustainable energy.

Recently, the company completed its first bio-bunker fuel supply operation in Fujairah in the UAE, the fruits of its infrastructure development for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“For us, new energy is about ensuring we have assets ready for sustainable feedstocks and future products like biofuels and SAF,” Robblee said.

Furthermore, Vopak views ammonia as the most efficient hydrogen transport solution and is actively investing in related projects.

Ammonia is liquid that is a carrier for hydrogen (which is gas), and is easier to store and transport than hydrogen.

“Hydrogen can move in different ways, but ammonia is the most efficient in our view,” said Robblee.

The company is also leveraging its experience in handling hazardous products to expand its carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives, seeing it as a crucial decarbonization pathway.

Recognizing the shift from molecules to electrons, Vopak is entering the battery storage sector to support the changing energy landscape.

INVESTMENT PROGRESS

While Vopak has committed $1 billion to energy transition projects by 2030, only a fraction has been spent so far, as many projects are still in early development stages.

The company has spent a little less than $100 million on projects since it made the pledge in 2022, Vopak CEO Dick Richelle was quoted by newswire agency Reuters in November 2024.

Robblee emphasized the development of energy transition projects will be completed closer to 2030, with the pace of implementation much slower compared with its industrial and gas terminal projects.

Vopak has a capex target of €2 billion for industrial and gas terminals by 2030.

“The thought always was, it’s going to come closer to the 2030 date than our growth spending on industrial and gas terminals. And it’s just because a lot of the projects were in their infancy.

“The big infrastructure projects that we work on take years to develop and then years to get going.”

Ongoing projects include working through Vopak’s Tokyo office to import ammonia for co-firing with coal for power generation.

Japan and South Korea are becoming leading importers of green ammonia as they work to decarbonize newer coal facilities or thermal power plants, Robblee said.

“They have the proven technology that you’re able to co-combust ammonia with … coal,” he added.

“There are a lot of exciting projects in India and the Middle East that we see that flow coming to the East [northeast Asia], as well as the US.”

India is a particular focus for storage and export of green hydrogen and ammonia.

In November 2023, India’s Odisha state approved several green hydrogen and ammonia projects, including an ammonia storage tank project at Gopalpur operated by Aegis Vopak (AVTL), Vopak’s joint venture with India’s Aegis. This facility is designed to store 80,000 tonnes of liquid ammonia.

AVTL, in November 2024, announced it has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) worth Indian rupees (Rs) 35 billion ($405 million) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

A final decision for the IPO is expected in the first half of 2025.

Vopak is also repurposing existing infrastructure in Asia to support sustainable feedstocks.

In 2024, the company repurposed part of its Sebarok terminal in Singapore, commissioning 40,000 tonnes of capacity for blending biofuels into marine fuels.

The Sebarok terminal is earmarked as a sustainable multi-fuels hub, reinforcing Singapore’s status as a leading bunkering center.

VALUE CHAINS STILL IN INFANCY

A major challenge for Vopak in new energy markets is that value chains are still new.

“I think what you’ll see, which is quite normal, is a lot of these value chains aren’t built yet,” he said.

However, Robblee said the company is confident it can safely handle the products of the future.

“We have the capabilities to contribute, to ensure that we give our people our best knowledge to build the assets in a safe and secure manner, in an efficient and [sustainable] manner.”

Vopak also aims to continue working with different partners to develop its energy transition projects.

“We are very accustomed to joint ventures. Across Asia and the Middle East, almost all our business is structured this way.”

For example, Vopak and France’s Air Liquide, in March 2024, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the development and operation of infrastructure for ammonia import, cracking, and hydrogen distribution in Singapore.

“I think the only difference is, and we’re quite open to it. Maybe the partners that we had in the past aren’t the same partners that we [will have] in the future. And so, we’re looking at that today,” Robblee added.

As of 19 March, Swedavia’s Annual and Sustainability Report for 2024 is available on the company’s website. The past year saw increased international travel, new airline routes at Arlanda, and a stronger operating profit, alongside continued investments in the transition to fossil-free aviation. Passenger volume rose by over one per cent compared to 2023, driven by sustained demand for international travel.

Details on Swedavia’s sustainable efforts in 2024

The growth in travel and higher commercial revenues enabled Swedavia to report a positive operating income for the first time since the pandemic, marking a key milestone in the company’s recovery. The net revenue increased by SEK 462 million compared to the previous year, while operating income improved by SEK 344 million. Cash flow from operating activities also grew by SEK 305 million, strengthening Swedavia’s financial position.

At Stockholm Arlanda Airport, the final stage of the new Marketplace will be completed in the first quarter of 2025, with the last tenants moving in. This, along with the new security control, finalises the modernisation of Terminal 5, which began just before the pandemic. The modernisation significantly improves passenger flows and satisfaction. The new Marketplace also allows for increased profit margins in commercial operations, which will help maintain competitive airport charges.

In 2024, around 40 new routes were added, including 18 entirely new destinations. Notable new services included Air Canada’s direct routes to Toronto and Montreal, and ANA’s new service between Arlanda and Tokyo Haneda, launching in early 2025. Swedavia continues to strengthen its international connectivity.

Domestic air traffic faced challenges, notably with BRA’s closure of its domestic traffic at Bromma Stockholm Airport. Instead, BRA signed a cooperation agreement with SAS, consolidating domestic traffic at Arlanda. This move is crucial for maintaining connectivity across Sweden.

Swedavia also achieved a major milestone, with four of its airports now certified at the highest level by the Airport Carbon Accreditation system.

Wright, speaking in an interview in Louisiana, stated that the aim is to bring the reserve holdings “just close to the top” for optimal operation.
During Biden’s term, approximately 290mbbl were sold from the reserve, including emergency drawdowns and sales mandated by Congress for unrelated expenditures such as infrastructure repairs.
So certainly some of the money we are going to spend is going to be maintenance,” Wright stated.

The SPR, established in response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo, can hold up to 700 million barrels (mbbl) of crude oil, serving as a critical safeguard against supply disruptions.

Wright, speaking in an interview in Louisiana, stated that the aim is to bring the reserve holdings “just close to the top” for optimal operation.

Following the announcement, US crude futures experienced a momentary surge, peaking at US$67.68 a barrel in New York.

The SPR’s stockpile was significantly reduced under the previous administration of President Joe Biden in response to soaring gasoline prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Current levels stand at 395mbbl, according to Energy Department data.

During Biden’s term, approximately 290mbbl were sold from the reserve, including emergency drawdowns and sales mandated by Congress for unrelated expenditures such as infrastructure repairs.

Wright indicated that these rapid drawdowns might have caused infrastructure issues due to the reserve’s age.

“Was there some damage from the rapid drawdowns? It appears that there was. So certainly some of the money we are going to spend is going to be maintenance,” Wright stated.

The replenishment plan hinges on Congressional approval of the necessary funding, which remains uncertain.

The Energy Department’s budget for purchases was exhausted after the Biden administration acquired approximately 60mbbl.

Wright disclosed that a specific funding request to Congress has not yet been made.

President Trump has consistently emphasised reinforcing conventional energy sources since his inaugural address in January, which includes enhancing domestic oil production and easing regulations.

Wright emphasised the importance of the SPR in ensuring energy security for the American people.

“Ultimately, that is what it was built for — to have the maximum security for the American people,” Wright stated.

In response, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has released its Corporate Net-Zero Standard Version 2.0 Consultation Draft, introducing a comprehensive framework to elevate corporate accountability, ensure measurable progress, and align climate strategies with the latest scientific benchmarks.

Revised Standard Drives Full-Cycle Accountability

SBTi’s Version 2.0 represents a shift from a target-centric approach to an end-to-end model that emphasizes implementation and continuous improvement. The new framework introduces a validation model that spans the full emissions reduction lifecycle: initial ambition, performance assessment, progress reporting, and target renewal. This model aims to close the accountability gap by requiring companies to demonstrate real-world progress, not just commitments.

Companies must now assess and communicate progress at the end of each five-year cycle, setting new targets that address any performance gaps. This process reinforces accountability and provides a structured pathway to reach—and maintain—a net-zero-aligned state. Importantly, the standard retains 1.5°C as its central ambition, underscoring the need for accelerated action as the window to limit global warming narrows.

Tailored Criteria for Diverse Business Needs

Version 2.0 introduces a differentiated approach based on company size and geographic location. Category A companies—large and medium-sized entities in high-income countries—are subject to comprehensive criteria, while Category B companies—SMEs in lower-income nations—are granted flexibility, with optional criteria in recognition of resource constraints. This structure broadens accessibility while preserving rigor for entities with greater climate impact.

Enhanced Scope 3 Target Framework

Recognizing both the criticality and complexity of value chain emissions, the revised standard abandons the fixed-percentage approach of previous versions. Instead, it prioritizes action on the most relevant emission sources and introduces non-emissions metrics such as procurement from net-zero-aligned suppliers and revenue from low-carbon products and services. This allows companies to substantiate progress even when primary emissions data are limited, aligning with real-world data challenges.

Beyond Value Chain Mitigation Gains Traction

Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM) is given greater emphasis, rewarding companies that proactively address emissions beyond their operations. By recognizing investments in mitigation activities—such as sustainable aviation fuel or clean energy finance—SBTi encourages companies to take broader responsibility for emissions released during their net-zero transition. These measures are framed as critical to accelerating decarbonization across sectors and geographies.

Business Implications: Strategic Risk and Opportunity

For companies operating in an increasingly regulated and disclosure-driven environment, aligning with Version 2.0 is both a risk mitigation strategy and a competitive advantage. The new requirements for climate transition plans, third-party assurance of emissions inventories, and transparent reporting align closely with evolving mandates such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and recommendations from the UN High-Level Expert Group.

Adopting the revised standard enables businesses to attract sustainable capital, manage reputational and regulatory risks, and demonstrate leadership in climate governance.

In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added.

“Corporations and individual travelers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

“By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand.”

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data directly contributed by airlines, which contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modeled averages.

With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana and Oman Air among others, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect and each new airline participant helps improve the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations for all.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

In 2024, wind and solar power provided 17% of the electricity in the US.
Ember says that in 2018, just six years ago, coal produced three times as much electricity as wind and solar power combined.
Though solar is growing much faster, wind energy is still bigger than solar, providing about 10% of the country’s electricity.
But Ember’s report suggests that as more large-scale battery stations are added to the grid, solar power will be available around the clock, too.","Last year, the US got more of its electricity from wind and solar power than from coal. It’s the first time that’s ever happened, and it shows how quickly the US is moving toward cleaner energy sources. Because renewable energy is so cheap, it will probably continue to grow, despite President Donald Trump’s push to increase fossil fuel use.

The US gets its electricity from many different sources. In 2024, around 58% of the country’s electricity came from fossil fuels like natural gas, oil, and coal.

But Ember, a company that studies energy use, says renewable energy is growing rapidly. In 2024, wind and solar power provided 17% of the electricity in the US. For the first time ever, these renewables beat coal, which provided just 15% of the US’s electricity.

That’s a huge change. Ember says that in 2018, just six years ago, coal produced three times as much electricity as wind and solar power combined.

Wind and solar energy are growing because they’ve gotten cheaper and cheaper. That’s especially true for solar power, which produced 81% of the extra electricity added to the grid last year. Though solar is growing much faster, wind energy is still bigger than solar, providing about 10% of the country’s electricity.

Under Ex-President Joe Biden, the US government worked hard to promote renewable energy. That changed when Mr. Trump took office in January. Mr. Trump is pushing hard to promote polluting fossil fuels.

Even so, experts say renewable energy will probably continue to grow. The main reason is that renewable energy sources are cheaper. The US added 50 gigawatts of solar power in a single year last year. That’s enough to supply the electricity required by more than 37 million average US homes. And solar energy is expected to grow even more in the future.

Natural gas is still a major source of energy in the US. It produced about 42.5% of the country’s electricity last year. Natural gas is cleaner than coal, but it’s still a fossil fuel, and makes the climate crisis worse.

Fuels like natural gas have one big advantage – they can supply power even at night. Solar electricity is only produced when the sun is shining. But Ember’s report suggests that as more large-scale battery stations are added to the grid, solar power will be available around the clock, too.

For years, the demand for electricity in the US has remained about the same. But now, demand is rising, and it’s expected to keep going up. There are several reasons, including more large computer centers providing Artificial Intelligence (AI) services, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and an increase in the number of electric cars.

To reduce pollution and fight climate change, the US will need to continue to grow its renewable energy sources. Another report released last week says that by 2040, the country will need 900 more gigawatts of renewable energy and battery storage.

Dave Jones, who led the study for Ember, believes that with battery storage, solar will grow faster and remain cheaper than natural gas. “Solar is winning,” he says.",https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/us-2024-energy-production-1200.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 17:57:24.470869

Frédéric Ollivier, CTO at Global Bioenergies, says:” The various simulations carried out by the CERTAM demonstrator have enabled us to test the behavior of our fuel under various conditions representative of an aircraft engine. Injecting Global Bioenergies’ SAF, without blending it with kerosene, produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, very similar to the spray from Jet A-1, the standard fossil kerosene. These tests are feeding into the data that enable a better match between engine and fuel.”

ONERA, the French aerospace research center, has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of Global Bioenergies' SAF.

Emission levels were measured using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies, Jet A-1 as a control, and a blend of 50% SAF and 50% Jet A-1 (the maximum proportion currently authorized by ASTM when certifying Global Bioenergies’ process). These three batches of fuel were injected into the laboratory burner in order to quantify and characterize the non-volatile particles emitted during combustion, i.e. soot. Several representative conditions were tested to simulate soot emission levels, both on the ground and in flight.

The results obtained using neat SAF from Global Bioenergies show a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared with Jet A-1 fuel, depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory. The results obtained from the 50-50 blend show a reduction in particulate matter that is globally proportional to the SAF incorporation rate.

Louise Ganeau, research engineer at ONERA, explains:” Soot emitted during fuel combustion has an impact on air quality in airport areas. Incorporating SAFs such as Global Bioenergies’ into the fossil fuel landscape would help reduce soot emissions locally, and cut particulate pollution. Furthermore, from an environmental standpoint, SAF have a role to play in reducing net CO₂ emissions thanks to the way they are manufactured.”

Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies, concludes:” The properties of our fuel had already been validated when it obtained ASTM certification. The tests carried out today in the best French laboratories go even further in characterizing our product. These validations strengthen the attractiveness of our offer.”

More information More about the KIT Energy Center","Fuels like kerosene can be produced in a climate-friendly way from CO2, water and green electricity using Power-to-Liquid processes. Researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have already demonstrated this with systems in actual operation. Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling – at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale – the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

In order to achieve its climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that do not easily lend themselves to electrification. “The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from KIT’s Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT). “Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.” Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project and heads the corresponding research activities at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: For the first time in the world, the innovative, highly efficient water vapor/CO2 co-electrolysis technology from industrial partner Sunfire was coupled directly with a synthesis process at an industry-relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis output).

Co-electrolysis Makes Power-to-Liquid More Efficient

For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT’s Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used. First, syngas – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide – is produced from CO2 and water. In principle, there are several ways to generate syngas. The new configuration uses a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire, which simplifies this process step and, above all, boosts its efficiency. “Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step. Up to 85 percent of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas. In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,” says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire. “This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.”

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the syngas needs to be brought to reaction pressure. This job is done by a compressor with safety devices the researchers added to the process chain. In a microstructured reactor, the syngas is then converted to long-chain hydrocarbons – known as syncrude – using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These hydrocarbons can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products. Scientists at KIT developed this reactor technology, which is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a KIT spin-off. For the future, it is planned to use the heat released as vapor during synthesis for the co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy demand of the entire process and demonstrate that the product preparation to finally obtain kerosene is feasible at this scale. By combining these process steps, it is possible to fully utilize the carbon dioxide provided and achieve the highest possible energy conversion efficiency, as this process chain allows efficient recycling of material flows in addition to the energy flows.

The Next Step: A Tonne of Kerosene per Day

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to one hundred liters of syncrude per day. Coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus P2X project. The facility is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters syncrude per day. In the third and final funding phase, the research team has INERATEC additionally build a larger Fischer-Tropsch production facility in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. “For the first time, tonne-scale production will be realized there,” says Dittmeyer. The product, which will eventually be processed into kerosene, will be used by aircraft engine manufacturers and research partners for testing. Accompanying analyses ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.

About the Kopernikus P2X Project

In the Kopernikus P2X project, partners Climeworks, Sunfire, INERATEC, and the Institute for Micro Process Engineering are establishing and operating an integrated process chain at KIT’s Energy Lab. Based on the “Power-to-Fuel” concept, carbon-neutral fuels, known as e-fuels, can be produced in this way. The project, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), involves 18 partners from industry and science as well as civil-society organizations.

This fuel is crucial for reducing the aviation sector's carbon footprint and addressing global warming. Collaborating with industry leaders like Safran Aircraft Engines and ONERA, Global Bioenergies has conducted extensive injection and combustion tests that underline the capabilities of their innovative SAF.

Collaboration with Industry Leaders

Global Bioenergies has partnered with Safran, the second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer in the world, to explore the unique properties of their SAF during the fuel injection phase. This phase is essential for ensuring high efficiency and reducing fuel consumption in engines. Testing took place at CERTAM, a center dedicated to technological innovation in aerothermal systems and engine technologies, where several simulations were conducted.

Understanding the Injection Phase

According to Frédéric Ollivier, the Chief Technology Officer at Global Bioenergies, “The simulations allowed us to evaluate our fuel's behavior under various engine conditions. The results indicated that when injected without blending, our SAF produces a spray of fine, homogeneous droplets, closely resembling that of Jet A-1, a conventional kerosene. This is a promising outcome for matching engine performance with fuel properties.”

Combustion Tests and Emission Analysis

In tandem with the injection tests, ONERA has been analyzing the combustion performance of Global Bioenergies' SAF. This aspect is vital since it impacts not only the efficiency of the fuel but also the air quality in regions surrounding airports. During these combustion tests, emissions from the SAF were measured against standard Jet A-1 and a 50-50 blend of SAF and Jet A-1. The aim was to quantify the non-volatile particles emitted, which are a crucial factor in determining the environmental impact of emissions.

Results that Matter

The findings have been encouraging. Tests showed that using neat SAF resulted in a remarkable 40-99% reduction in soot emissions compared to traditional Jet A-1, which varies depending on specific test conditions. Similarly, the 50-50 blend demonstrated a proportional reduction in particulate emissions, illustrating the effectiveness of integrating SAF into conventional fuel systems.

Environmental Impact and Future Directions

Louise Ganeau, a research engineer at ONERA, highlighted the implications of these results for air quality and pollution control. “Soot emissions from combustion fuel significantly impact air quality, especially around airports. By introducing SAFs like those developed by Global Bioenergies, we can considerably lower local soot levels and mitigate particulate pollution. This innovation also supports a broader reduction in net CO? emissions due to the sustainable manufacturing process behind SAF,” she explained.

Strengthening Market Position

Marc Delcourt, co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies, reiterated the significance of their SAF achievements. He stated, “The validation of our fuel properties through ASTM certification confirmed our position in the market. Now, with further testing in reputed French laboratories, we can better characterize our product. These developments enhance our market attractiveness.”

As part of the initiative, JAL will work to establish domestic biofuel supply chains, while Airbus will support efforts to secure international certification for the biomass-derived fuel to qualify as SAF.

The project was initially proposed in February 2023 by Nippon Paper Industries, trading company Sumitomo Corp., and bio-refining specialist Green Earth Institute. In February 2025, the firms agreed to form a joint venture, Morisora Bio Refinery, to advance development of a domestic SAF production network.

Morisora is due to be formally launched in March, with plans to start bioethanol production in 2027 at Nippon Paper’s Iwanuma Mill in Miyagi prefecture, northeastern Japan. Commercial-scale operations are anticipated to begin around 2030.

The bioethanol will be primarily used as feedstock for SAF, though it may also be utilised in other applications, including blending with petrol, fuel cells, cosmetics, and as a raw material in chemical production.

​Japan is actively advancing SAF initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.​ But so far no commercial production has started. However, Cosmo Energy Holdings is due to start supplying 30,000 kg of the fuel annually from its Sakai refinery in Osaka this April, utilising used cooking oil as feedstock.

The government plans to produce 1.7mn kg of SAF annually by 2030. To support this goal, it has allocated approximately JPY340bn (around $2.2bn) over five years, starting from fiscal year 2025, to bolster SAF manufacturing and supply chain development.

Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is proposing stricter regulations for SAF producers. These regulations aim for a minimum 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Additionally, METI plans to establish obligations to develop and promote new raw materials and production technologies for SAF.",,N,,2025-03-19 16:57:45.183733

Grangemouth oil refinery, which is being shut down by its UK and Chinese owners PetroIneos this year with the loss of 400 jobs, could become a world leader in low carbon chemicals and green fuels, John Swinney told media on Wednesday.

The refinery’s closure, after 100 years of production, is expected to hit up to 2,000 jobs in the east of Scotland. Trade union leaders and policymakers see Grangemouth as a casestudy in ensuring the transition from oil and gas is fair and just.

Swinney said workers and local businesses faced “enormous difficulties”.

“What we have to make sure is that we manage the transition from the dependence on fossil fuels to an approach that delivers net zero,” he said. “I think it can be done at scale [and] I’m confident we can deliver those new prospects for these communities.”

He was speaking after the UK and Scottish governments published a report from the consultancy EY that said up to 1,200 jobs could be created by attracting low-carbon businesses to Grangemouth. However, that would be too late for workers being laid off this year.

EY identified nine industries including plastics recycling; biorefining of chemicals from organic waste; bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel production; biomethane production from organic waste; and low-carbon hydrogen from renewable sources and ammonia.

Those industries would require substantial investment, the report said. About £3.5bn would be needed to create about 800 jobs over the next decade. As much as £7.5bn could be spent if those businesses expanded, to create 1,200 jobs by 2040.

Earlier in March Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced £200m in UK government funding to help support five green businesses at Grangemouth; the Scottish government has put up £25m for a just transition fund.

Michael Shanks, the UK government’s energy minister, chaired a local taskforce meeting with Gillian Martin, the Scottish government’s net zero secretary, on Wednesday morning. “We are committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth,” he said.

Energy analysts and environment campaigners are sceptical about some of these technologies, in particular mass production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, because they believe the costs and energy involved greatly outweigh the gains.

But Mark Simmers, chief executive of Celtic Renewables, a Grangemouth-based firm where Swinney launched the report, which is already making green chemicals, said he believed the plans were realistic.

His firm, which makes acetone, butanol and ethanol by fermenting whisky byproducts, waste potatoes and molasses, hopes to build a plant eight to 10 times larger than its current factory at the refinery site. Its products help make nail varnish, paints, medicines and household cleaning products, replacing crude oil-based chemicals.

“We’ve got this great facility with a range of utilities, land and a lot of resources from a feed stocks perspective, but also from a people perspective,” Simmers said. “So repurposing that for a low carbon manufacturing complex, I think is a great and a realisable plan.”

The investment agency Scottish Enterprise would oversee possible investments, Swinney said. “This is going to take time. It’s going to take investment, and it’s going to take commitment, but the Scottish government is here for the long haul,” he said.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4374b178d95babe673725eebe312258f148b4ca7/0_194_5808_3485/master/5808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3930b4e46621ef62cb8ec9ae75535b99,N,,2025-03-19 12:57:28.225603

AMERICAS

Renewable rollback – US President Donald Trump revoked several executive orders (EOs) issued by former President Biden on Mar. 14, including EOs that supported domestic production of solar panels and electric heat pumps, reversing policies that facilitated their manufacturing under the Defence Production Act. President Trump also ordered reductions to multiple federal entities, including the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars at the Smithsonian, a nonpartisan think tank which focuses on climate change and Arctic research.

Regulation rebellion – A coalition of 137 energy, agriculture, and transportation industry groups urged Congress on Monday to block California’s vehicle regulations, which include mandates for electric vehicle adoption and a ban on new gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicle sales by 2035. In a letter to congressional leaders, the organisations argued that these policies, adopted by multiple states, restrict consumer choice, increase reliance on foreign supply chains, and pose risks to national security. They supported US EPA’s decision to submit the regulations for congressional review, contending that such sweeping rules should be determined at the federal level rather than dictated by California.

Offsets optimised – Northern Trust, a US-based financial services company, has been selected by Bayer, a multinational company focused on pharmaceuticals and agriculture, to provide digital lifecycle management for its voluntary carbon credits programme. Bayer will use The Northern Trust Carbon Ecosystem, a digital platform, to record, track, and facilitate transactions of verified carbon credits, linking them to their US state of origin and vintage year. The initiative aims to support Bayer’s Crop Science division, which promotes regenerative agriculture through its ForGround platform, offering incentives for farmers adopting sustainable practices.

Forest plan partnership – The Brazilian Forestry Service (FSB) has signed a cooperation agreement with PlanaFlor – an initiative of non-profit Environmental Exchange of Rio de Janeiro (BVRio) and the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (FBDS) for strategic implementation of the Forest Code – to drive environmental regularisation and enhance economic incentives for the conservation of native vegetation in Brazil. This partnership seeks to develop strategic actions within PlanaFlor, and through the agreement, the institutions commit to jointly formulate strategies to promote the environmental regularisation of rural properties and encourage mechanisms for “Legal Reserve” compensation, such as Environmental Reserve Credits (CRAs). Furthermore, the cooperation includes activities aimed at improving regulations and instruments related to Environmental Regularisation Programmes (PRAs) and Degraded Area Recovery Projects (PRADAs), including enhancing procedures and public policies.

Carbon-free cargo – California and Shanghai transportation leaders convened Wednesday at the Port of Long Beach to advance efforts to decarbonise maritime trade through the development of a Green Shipping Corridor. The forum brought together representatives from California state agencies, the ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Shanghai, as well as industry and environmental stakeholders to discuss infrastructure investments and policies necessary to support low- and zero-carbon shipping. The collaboration builds on previous agreements between California and Shanghai to promote clean transportation.

Advancing exemptions – An amended House Bill 1912 (HB 1912) passed its chamber of origin in Washington on Mar. 12 with a 93–4 vote. In its latest iteration, HB 1912 directed the state’s Department of Ecology (ECY) to publish guidelines by Oct. 1 for potentially eligible users of exempt agricultural fuel to receive compensation under the cap-and-trade programme. The substitute bill also mandated the ECY to maintain this exemption until Dec. 31, 2029. A previous version of this bill established reporting requirements for the sale of exempt fuels used for agricultural purposes under the Climate Commitment Act (CCA), but the latest text scraps such provisions. HB 1912 is now being considered in the Senate Environment, Energy, and Technology Committee.

Let’s party – The Dutch political parties GroenLinks and PvdA have announced plans to consult their members on strengthening their cooperation and potentially forming a new party. A joint congress on June 21 will allow members to vote on the proposal. GroenLinks President Katinka Eikelenboom highlighted widespread concern among progressive voters, while GroenLinks International Secretary Gebke van Gaal emphasised their commitment to green and left-wing politics in Europe. The European Green Party welcomed the move, with co-chair Ciaran Cuffe praising the alliance’s role in opposing the far-right Dutch government and defending democracy, human rights, and climate action. Co-chair Vula Tsetsi reiterated the importance of progressive alliances at all levels of governance. GroenLinks and PvdA formed an electoral alliance in 2023, finishing second to the far-right PVV. They also led in the 2024 European Parliament elections in the Netherlands, securing 21% of the vote. As the largest opposition force, they continue to challenge the Dutch governing coalition of PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB.

Green claims clarity, please – Trade association IETA is asking EU policymakers for clarity on the future use of emission reduction and removal credits, ahead of technical negotiations on the bloc’s Green Claims Directive. The proposed law would establish rules for substantiating business-to-consumer corporate environmental claims in the EU, including in the use of carbon credits. Members of the European Parliament are pushing to limit the use of carbon credits in corporate claims, and to set conditions on how credits can be used, going beyond disclosure requirements. In a statement on Tuesday, IETA argued that companies should be able to use emission reduction and removal credits for compensation claims that drive climate efforts. The claims should not be limited to the residual emissions at the point a company has reached net zero – as was proposed in the negotiations – because it would deter companies from acting, said IETA Managing Director Andrea Abrahams.

Renewable liquid gas – Europe could produce up to 27.4 mln tonnes (350 TWh) of renewable liquid gas (rLG) annually by 2050 – or enough to meet most of Europe’s current LPG demand, found a new report from Liquid Gas Europe on Tuesday. rLGs can reduce GHG emissions by more than 80% compared to traditional LPG, positioning them as a vital solution to decarbonise off-grid heating, industrial processes, and transport – particularly in rural areas and in industries where electrification is challenging. This makes rLGs critical in achieving Europe’s 2040 and 2050 climate targets, the trade association said. Feedstocks for production are primarily waste-based, such as agricultural residues, animals fats, and used cooking oils. The rLG supply prognosis is premised on “strong policy support and technological advancements”. (Liquid Gas Europe)

Target delay – UBS has pushed back its target to cut GHG emissions to net zero from 2025 to 2035, blaming its acquisition of crosstown rival Credit Suisse for the delay. The move, announced in UBS’s latest sustainability report published this week, reflected its “enlarged corporate real estate portfolio” following the state-orchestrated takeover of Credit Suisse in 2023. It follows HSBC’s decision to push back its net zero timeline to 2050, while banks and other large companies have been reassessing their climate commitments following the election of US Donald Trump in November. UBS remains a member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance however, despite withdrawals by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup. Members of the group are set to vote in coming weeks on whether to ditch the pledge to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, and instead settle for warming of 2C. (FT)

Carbon project template – The Russian registry of carbon units RSPP Committee on Climate Policy and Carbon Regulation has developed a unified template for the design and technical documentation of climate projects. The template is intended to simplify and cut the cost of project registration, making it more accessible to companies. To date, 50 climate projects have already been registered in the Russian registry, more than 32 mln carbon units have been issued, of which more than 20,000 have already been used to offset the carbon footprint, according to the statement on the registry website. The template minimises potential errors and complies with national carbon standards. It was developed with the support of the Russian operator of the carbon unit registry — JSC Kontur.

Scottish trees – Extensive work is underway in Scotland to plant more than half a million trees on university land to absorb 1 mln tonnes of carbon and create a natural haven. The planting project will take place across land in Stirlingshire and the Pentland Hills Regional Park owned by the University of Edinburgh. Some 570,000 saplings are being planted across about 5,600 ha of land, of which 4,800 ha is owned by partners, with aims to combat climate change by restoring peatland and expanding forest. However, recent studies from other Scottish institutions, have shown that tree planting, especially in certain ecosystems like heather moorland, might not always lead to net carbon sequestration, as soil carbon losses can outweigh the carbon stored in the trees, particularly in the first few decades. In one Scottish study over a period of 39 years, planting native trees on heather moorlands, with large soil carbon stores, found no evidence of net carbon sequestration. The University of Edinburgh project has been approved by Scottish Forestry. (the Scotsman)

Risk assessment – South Korean banks and other financial institutions may lose nearly 46 trillion won ($31.83 bln) by around 2100 if the country fails to properly address climate change, the central bank said Tuesday, according to Yonhap. If the government belatedly pushes for net-zero policies after 2030, their losses would amount to around 40 tln won, according to a climate stress test conducted by the Bank of Korea (BOK). However, the losses would be as low as 27 tln won if the government achieves its zero emission targets by 2050 or reduces carbon emissions by half by that time, the test showed.

House of cards – Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is planning to exit the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), following a Wall Street-led exodus that has gone global, according to a Bloomberg report. A spokesperson for MUFJ told the news agency that the bank has yet to come to a decision. Meanwhile, NZBA is considering rolling back its mitigation target to just above 2C, from 1.5C at present, a former member said at an event in New York on Monday. Sumitomo and Nomura Holdings exited the alliance recently, leaving Mizuho as the only Japanese megabank in the group.

Rice project – Japanese agricultural firm Suzunari has teamed up with Tsuda Bussan to implement initiatives targeting the creation of J-Credits as part of their sustainable agricultural activities, the companies announced Tuesday. Suzunari will help farmers reduce GHG emissions by extending the length of paddy field drainage, according to the statement. The Norinchukin Bank supported the matching of the two companies in this collaboration.

Aussie rules – Australian project developer Wilderlands has sold over 100,000 voluntary biodiversity credits in less than four months through its partnership with Tasman Environmental Markets (TEM), it said in a post on LinkedIn. The figure follows Wilderlands saying it had sold 70,000 biodiversity credits in the three months up to Dec. 2024 under the same mechanism. In Sep. 2024 it launched an ‘Extended Impact’ solution, selling Wilderlands’ Biological Diversity Units alongside an equal number of carbon units on the TEM online marketplace.

Sweet credits – US-based soil carbon developer Boomitra has partnered with EID Parry, an Indian sugar producer, to advance sustainable sugarcane farming practices in the South Asian nation by equipping farmers with regenerative agricultural tools, improving soil health, and unlocking access to carbon finance. The partnership will leverage cutting-edge technology to quantify and certify soil carbon sequestration, enabling farmers to earn income through verified carbon credits while playing a critical role in reducing global GHG emissions, the developer said in a statement.

Mates rates – A forestry programme financed by Norway is attracting criticism for appointing to key positions personnel with little climate experience. Mongabay reports that Forestry Minister Raja Juli Antoni has appointed several members of his own party to key positions. The FOLU Net Sink 2030 initiative which is designed to reduce forestry emissions from the sector and forests to absorb more carbon than they release. The paper also reports the salaries, up to $3,000 a month, are considered much too high for the relative positions.

INVESTMENT

Leaving the table – Sarasin & Partners has divested from Equinor, citing the oil major’s failure to align its strategy with global climate goals. The British asset manager first invested in the company in 2021 and played a major role in the Climate Action 100+ initiative, as well as leading investor talks with Equinor over its emissions concerns. The decision by Sarasin highlights its frustration with the board’s resistance to align Equinor with the 1.5C Paris aligned pathway. In February, Equinor cut its clean energy targets, lowering its projected clean energy capacity to 10-12 GW by 2030, down from the previous target of 12-16 GW.

UNDP upgrade – Countries using the National Carbon Registry of the United National Development Programme (UNDP) now have the option of using Hedera Guardian, which provides auditable, traceable, and reproducible records that document the process and lifecycle of environmental assets. The Guardian enables Digital Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (dMRV) and enforces on-chain methodologies, ensuring that credit issuance and transfers are immutable and tamper-proof. The UNDG has partnered with Xeptagon to leverage the Hedera public distributed ledger network.

AVIATION

Account for your SAF – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has improved its IATA CO2 Connect emissions calculator to account for carbon emissions reductions related to the usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. But in future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added, the organisation wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday. The news follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which includes specific accounting rules and practices on how to include SAF in per-passenger CO2 data. IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data contrasting with other calculators that primarily rely on modeled averages. Some 60 airlines now contribute data to CO2 Connect.

The Grangemouth industrial complex is one of Scotland's major manufacturing facilities - but the imminent closure of Scotland's only oil refinery threatens 400 jobs.

Project Willow, a £1.5m feasibility study funded by the UK and Scottish governments, looks at potential low-carbon alternative uses for the wider site.

Consultants EY evaluated 300 technologies - and came up with nine ideas that could be developed with private sector investment.

1. Hydrothermal plastics recycling

This involves breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics such as clingfilm-type products to produce naptha and pyrolysis oil vapour.

Currently these plastics are usually incinerated or go to landfill.

They could instead be reused in plastics production or refined as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

It would require about £150m-£250m of capital investment, create 35-60 jobs and operations could start before the end of 2028

2. Dissolution plastics recycling

This uses chemicals to dissolve waste plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene.

The material can then be reused to create new plastic products or packaging.

Between 35 and 45 jobs could be created, with operations commencing late in 2028.

A relatively low amount of capital investment of £25m-£30m would be required.

Such technology could make use of plastic derived from bottle deposit return schemes when they are introduced across the UK.

3. Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol biorefining

Waste and by-products from sectors like food, drink, packaging and agriculture could be fermented using bacteria.

This could produce low-carbon chemical products such as acetone, butanol or ethanol.

Raw materials are plentiful - the amount of paper and cardboard waste currently produced in the UK is about 50 times the capacity of the plant being proposed for Grangemouth.

EY believes 80-100 jobs could be created through £215m-£265m of capital investment, with operations starting in 2030.

4. Second generation bioethanol

Sustainably-sourced Scottish timber and timber waste could be broken down and fermented to produce bioethanol.

This is used in fuel blending, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

This option would compliment plans to scale up the amount of softwood production through forestry in Scotland.

Between 50 and 60 jobs would be created from £350m-£430m of investment with production starting in 2032.

5. Anaerobic digestion

Anaerobic digestion is already carried out at dozens of small-scale plants across Scotland.

The process takes animal waste and sewage sludge and ferments it into biomethane.

The gas can then be used by local industry or injected into the gas grid.

Although burning it releases carbon dioxide, it is considered carbon neutral because the carbon originates from the atmosphere rather than underground.

The report says an investment of £15m-£25m would create 5 -10 jobs by 2028.

6. Hydrogenated esters and fatty acids

Fats, oils and certain crops potentially grown in Scotland can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

The process would require hydrogen - but that could be produced sustainably.

China is currently investing heavily in this kind of fat and oil conversion technology, so an adequate supply of raw materials from Scotland would have to be secured.

This would come in part from used cooking oil, tallow and fish oil but would need to be supplemented by oil seed crop production.

It would require hefty investment, from £740m-£900m, but would also save a lot of carbon emissions and support 90-120 jobs. Production could start by 2032.

7. Hydrogen fuel switching

Hydrogen can be produced from water using a process called electrolysis. It requires electricity but this could come from renewable sources provided it is cheap enough.

Low-carbon hydrogen could then be used as a replacement for natural gas in industrial processes.

The reports says the UK government should reform the energy market to reduce the cost of renewable electricity to industrial consumers, making green hydrogen production more commercially attractive.

About 25-30 jobs would be created by late 2030 with £210m-£250m of investment required.

8. E-methanol for aviation fuel

If enough low-carbon hydrogen is produced at a reasonable cost, this could in turn be used to make methanol - which can be converted to aviation fuel.

Grangemouth is already a supplier of far less environmentally-friendly jet fuels to Scottish airports.

Such manufacturing facilities could create between 240 and 270 jobs but it would be 2036 before production gets under way.

This option would also require around £2bn of new investment in the site.

9. E-ammonia

Another potential use of low-carbon hydrogen is to turn it into ammonia.

This could be used to decarbonise shipping, as ammonia-powered engine technology develops, and it is also used by the chemicals industry.

As with e-methanol production, it requires electricity to be cheap enough to make the large-scale production of green hydrogen more commercially viable.

The amount of hydrogen required is so large that so-called ""blue hydrogen"" could also be necessary, produced from natural gas with the carbon dioxide by-product piped to north-east Scotland to be buried underground.

The proposed Project Acorn carbon capture scheme at Peterhead missed out on a first round of UK funding but an update on support is expected this summer.

EY estimates it would take a decade or more before e-ammonia production would start but between 180 and 210 jobs would eventually be created and there would be significant emissions benefits.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4eb6/live/d61b1130-04c2-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 12:57:35.784618

English and Welsh roads hit by lack of spending: Survey

London, 19 March (Argus) — More than half of the local road network in England and Wales has less than 15 years of structural life left because of insufficient allocation of government funding to local authorities, according to the latest Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey. The survey, compiled annually by UK industry body Asphalt Industry Association (AIA), found that 52pc, or around 106,000 miles, of the English and Welsh road network managed by local authorities had just 15 years life remaining, and that nearly a third of these roads — around 34,600 miles — may only have up to five years life left. The survey found that in the next 12 months, 24,400 miles, or 12pc, of the network is likely to need some form of maintenance and that just 1.5pc of the local road network was resurfaced over the last year. Although there has been over £20bn ($26bn) spent on carriageway maintenance in England and Wales over the last decade, ""due to the short-term nature of the allocation of funding, it has resulted in no quantifiable uplift to the condition and resilience of the network,"" AIA Chair David Giles said. He added there needs to be a complete change in mindset away from short-term to longer term funding commitments, and he asked the UK government to set a minimum five-year funding horizon and substantially increase investments for local roads maintenance work. UK bitumen consumption has been steadily falling in recent years, with another 10.5 decline registered in 2024, hitting its lowest levels since 2016, according to UK government's department for energy security and net zero (DESNZ) data. The consumption drop coincided with a 20.3pc jump to 449,000t in UK production of the heavy oil product used mainly in road paving as well as general construction, combining to sharply reduce the country's bitumen import requirements. The ALARM survey also found that there had been no improvements in as much as 94pc of the England and Wales local network over the last year. To maintain their network, the survey showed that in England and Wales, local authorities would have needed an extra £7.4m each in 2024 and £16.81bn in total, as a one-off cash injection, to bring their networks up to their ""ideal"" conditions.

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

Vitol's Malaysian storage to take third bitumen cargo

Mumbai, 19 March (Argus) — Global energy trading firm Vitol will take a third bitumen shipment from Singapore for its recently built 50,000-70,000t storage facility in Malaysia's Tanjung Bin, vessel tracking data showed. The cargo aboard the 5,869 deadweight tonne (dwt) Erica 10 vessel was loaded from Singapore Refining's terminal in Jurong, Singapore over 16-17 March and is scheduled to discharge in Tanjung Bin over 20-21 March, Kpler and Vortexa data showed. The same vessel carried the firm's second cargo the previous week, while the first shipment was loaded aboard the 4,020dwt Sidra Qatar vessel at the end of January from ExxonMobil's terminal in Singapore and was discharged into Tanjung Bin in early February, the data showed. The trading firm is likely importing cargoes into its storage facility to stock up, but it cannot be determined if it would start exporting from Tanjung Bin in the near term.

Paul Huijts was visiting Saxon Air in Norwich when he learned about the county's aspirations around the development of Advanced Air Mobility small, sustainable and highly efficient air vehicles for short and medium-range travel which can offer on-demand services and take-off and land in smaller, decentralised zones.

The vision is for Norfolk and Suffolk to lead the way in its development and become the UK's first Aviation Development Zone.

The Ambassador also visited institutes at Norwich Research Park to meet with scientists at the leading edge of research into the role of the gut microbiome in pregnancy, decreasing the risk of urinary tract infections in Type 2 Diabetes patients, and heart disease and bioactive compounds.

Mr Huijts was also told about research being carried out by the University of East Anglia into how AI can be used to evaluate whether EU regulations actually support its citizens and the potential threats posed by technological developments in non-democratic states. AI4POL will bring together researchers from the fields of technology development, ethics, law, economics and political sciences, and partners include Tilburg University in the Netherlands.

Andrew Wood, Hon Dutch Consul for East Anglia, spearheaded the official visit from 13-14 March with support from Norfolk County Council's Inward Investment Team. It began at Felixstowe Port in Suffolk and concluded at the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich where Mr Huijts spoke with Dutch artists from an exhibition entitled A World of Water.

The Netherlands is the biggest trading partner to Norfolk and Suffolk, and it is hoped the Ambassador's extensive visit will strengthen direct links to Dutch investment teams and encourage partnership working following devolution with a focus on the areas covered in the visit.

Mr Huijts said: ""It was a great two-day visit to Suffolk and Norfolk. East Anglia and the Dutch have many historical connections and those ties resonate today. From the connection of Norwich Airport with Schiphol to shared expertise and collaboration in domains as agriculture and health.

""Next to the trade and historical ties cultural exchange also flourished over the years. Last week I attended the opening of the exhibition 'A World of Water' at the Sainsbury centre in Norwich, which shows the shared history and ongoing collaboration between the Dutch and East Anglia on water management, art and sustainability"".

Alex Durand, CEO of Saxon Air said: ""The East of England already supports aviation innovation, already taking a UK lead in development of electric aircraft, early availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and advanced development of commercial drone activity.

The GBP1.5 million study sets out nine options for the future of the industrial cluster in central Scotland.

Hundreds of jobs are set to be lost this year when the oil refinery there closes.

The study identifies nine ""feasible"" proposals which could attract private investment.

These include plastic recycling, fermenting Scottish timber into bioethanol, and hydrogen production.

Both governments say these projects could create up to 800 jobs by 2040.

Earlier this month, the Just Transition Commission warned it could take years to close the ""jobs gap"" left by the refinery's closure.

A summary of the report says the nine projects ""have the potential to significantly enhance low-carbon manufacturing across the UK and create a positive future for Grangemouth"".

It adds: ""However, the report also underscores the challenges of this transformation as low-carbon fuels and chemicals remain more expensive to produce than fossil alternatives.

""This will require substantial capital investment from the private sector [GBP3.5 billion capital expenditure] and development of new supply chains.""

Commenting on the report, UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: ""We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.

""This report and the GBP200 million investment by the UK government demonstrates that commitment.

""We will build on Grangemouth's expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors, secure a long-term clean energy future, and deliver on our Plan for Change.""

Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said: ""We will leave no stone unturned in order to secure the future of the Grangemouth refinery site, and the Scottish Government has already committed or invested a total of GBP87 million to help do so.

""Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors.

""Everyone working at Grangemouth's refinery – and in the wider industrial cluster – is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland's economic and net zero future.""

One of the nine options is to use low-carbon hydrogen to produce methanol, which would be converted into sustainable aviation fuel, SAF.

Union leaders have suggested this as a way forward which could save jobs, with Unite saying the plant could be converted ""relatively easily"" over a few years to produce SAF.

The Project Willow document says SAF operations would commence in 2035, with a capital expenditure of up to GBP2.1 billion required. Up to 270 staff would run the plant.

Derek Thomson, the Scotland regional secretary at Unite, urged the UK Government to back this option.

""What we're saying is, if you're going to accelerate anything in Project Willow, accelerate the sustainable air fuel plant,"" he said in an appearance before the Scottish Affairs Committee which coincided with the release of the report on Wednesday.

Thomson added: ""It just makes no sense to me whatsoever that you wouldn't say as a government, let's go for the SAF project.

""It saves Grangemouth, it saves the refinery, it gets us on track to meet our mandates for our own SAF production, and it doesn't rely on us to import oil.""

Such production, he added, could even result in making money for government.

A spokesman for the refinery's owners Petroineos said: ""The publication of the first Project Willow report is a milestone event for Grangemouth that could mark the beginning of a transformation for the whole cluster and, in time, create many more jobs and growth opportunities across a variety of related industries in Scotland.

""We look forward to continuing to support both UK and Scottish governments as they implement the recommended policy, regulatory and fiscal changes required to unlock the opportunities identified in our report.""

But another major driver of warming is often overlooked: contrails. These wispy cloud formations – short for condensation trails – form when aircraft fly through ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs) at high altitudes, emitting soot particles that serve as nuclei for ice crystal formation. While short-lived, contrails can trap heat and contribute significantly to warming.

While some early studies estimated contrails contribute up to two-thirds of aviation’s total warming effect, more recent analyses suggest the figure may be closer to one-third. There is still some uncertainty, but new analysis from CATF makes one thing clear: contrails must be tackled alongside CO₂ emissions if we are serious about reducing aviation’s climate impact.

Addressing contrails is essential for sustainable aviation

Aviation climate policies have largely centered on reducing CO₂ emissions. While decarbonizing jet fuel remains a critical long-term goal, CO₂ reductions alone won’t be enough to mitigate the industry’s climate footprint. Contrails exert a short-term but intense warming effect, meaning reducing them could yield near-immediate climate benefits – potentially faster than cutting CO₂ alone.

Ignoring contrails while focusing solely on CO₂ leaves a major climate lever untouched. That’s why a comprehensive approach is needed – one that tackles both CO₂ and non-CO₂ effects.

Relying on a single solution for contrails is risky – we need multiple approaches

Contrail formation depends on several factors, including fuel composition, engine technology, and atmospheric conditions. This complexity makes it risky to rely on any one solution to mitigate contrail effects. Instead, a combination of approaches – including cleaner fuels, low-soot engine designs, and smarter flight routing – will likely yield the best results.

Some mitigation strategies can be deployed today, while others require further research and investment. Below are the three primary areas for reducing contrails:

1. Cleaner fuels: Reducing soot through fuel treatment and SAF

One of the most effective ways to reduce contrails is to lower the amount of soot produced by aircraft engines. Since soot particles act as the initial nuclei for contrail formation, reducing their presence in exhaust emissions can limit ice crystal growth and shorten contrail lifespan.

Two main fuel-based strategies are under consideration:

Fuel treatment: Further refining jet fuel to remove aromatics, particularly naphthalene, in order to reduce soot emissions. This is a viable short-term mitigation option, though it is energy-intensive and would increase CO₂ emissions at the refinery level.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF blends, which contain fewer aromatics than conventional jet fuel, have been shown to reduce soot emissions by 50-70%, leading to fewer and weaker contrails. However, global SAF supply remains limited.

Given the current SAF supply constraints, a smarter strategy is needed. Instead of blending small amounts of SAF into all flights, research suggests that prioritizing high-contrail routes could be 9-15 times more effective at reducing warming. This approach would direct limited SAF resources where they have the most impact, maximizing climate benefits in the short term.

2. Engine modifications: Optimizing fleets for lower soot emissions

Advancements in engine technology present a significant opportunity to mitigate contrail formation by reducing soot emissions. Newer aircraft engines burn fuel more efficiently and produce fewer soot particles, which leads to weaker and shorter-lived contrails.

For example, the CFM Leap-1B engine, used in Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft, has demonstrated lower soot emissions, potentially reducing contrail formation. As airlines modernize their fleets, these newer, lower-soot engines could help cut aviation’s non-CO₂ climate impact.

However, since fleet turnover takes time, additional mitigation strategies – such as using SAF and smarter flight routing – must be implemented in parallel to maximize near-term contrail reductions.

3. Smarter flight routing: Avoiding contrail-forming conditions

Given that contrails only form in ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs), adjusting flight paths to avoid these areas could dramatically reduce contrail occurrence. Key methods for this sort of contrail avoidance include:

Weather forecasting models: Improved weather models could help airlines predict ISSRs and adjust flight plans accordingly. However, current humidity forecasts are not yet reliable enough for large-scale deployment.

AI and satellite monitoring: Emerging AI-driven contrail detection systems offer promising results. Google, in collaboration with American Airlines, conducted a trial using AI-assisted routing, which achieved a 54% reduction in contrails by optimizing flight paths.

Altitude adjustments: Research suggests that small altitude changes (~2%) on high-contrail flights could cut contrail-related warming by nearly 57% – with minimal fuel penalties (~0.03%).

These operational strategies may not be applicable in all situations (i.e., a plane cannot climb to avoid an ISSR after it has begun its landing decent), but to the extent this can be incorporated into ATC procedures, these strategies could provide near-term contrail reductions while longer-term solutions like SAF scale up.

Policy action is needed to integrate contrail mitigation into climate strategies

Despite growing recognition of contrail-related warming, current aviation regulations focus almost entirely on CO₂ emissions. This leaves a critical gap in aviation climate policy.

Governments, industry leaders, and regulatory bodies like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) must work to incorporate non-CO₂ mitigation strategies into their frameworks.

Key areas for policy action include:

Incentivizing the targeted use of SAF on high-contrail flights.

Funding research into low-soot engine designs and cleaner combustion technologies.

Enhancing air traffic management systems to enable real-time contrail avoidance strategies.

Contrail mitigation is one of the fastest ways to reduce aviation’s climate impact

These measures could significantly reduce aviation’s near-term warming impact, making them a critical component of sustainable aviation policy.

Because contrails dissipate within hours, mitigation efforts can provide immediate climate benefits – unlike CO₂ reductions, which take decades to show results. By tackling contrails alongside CO₂ emissions, we can make meaningful progress toward reducing aviation’s full climate footprint.

Aviation needs a multi-pronged approach, and contrail mitigation must be a core part of that plan.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/07121340/contrails-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 10:57:33.769180

There are already many established methods for upcycling waste oil.
Biodiesel is one of the known applications, but its production is confined to only certain types of waste oil, mainly lubrication oil.
The amount it can collect from local sources is small, limiting its production volume but, hopefully, with wider publicity, it would help if the public collect waste oil and waste wood products for this purpose, significantly reducing risks of waste oil polluting our sewage systems and waste wood being dumped in landfills.","In our hot pursuit of carbon neutrality in 2030 and zero carbon in 2050, the transport sector is doing its best to achieve this goal.

The rapid replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles by electric vehicles has allowed marked improvements in reducing roadside air pollution, no doubt helped by government action to reduce road tax and provide subsidies for purchase, as the financial incentive can attract a lot of new users.

For marine applications, battery-driven vessels are still not common, but the use of low-sulphur diesel has helped to reduce air pollution with less sulphur dioxide and trioxide emission, though it does not help to reduce carbon emissions.

For air transport, the Airport Authority, working together with airline companies, is doing its best to pursue the carbon-reduction goal, which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Apart from various initiatives such as experimenting with renewable diesel fuel for landside operations, replacing conventional vehicles with EVs and many other innovative moves, the AA is promoting the use of SAF - or sustainable aviation fuel - which has seen increasing usage by airlines and airports worldwide.

In the 2025-26 budget, SAF received special mention, with Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po advising that, following the completion of a study by the AA, the government will announce its consumption target this year.

We are all aware that aircraft use a large amount of fossil fuel. Worse than that, the amount used at takeoff is a large proportion of the total amount used in a journey, as a lot of energy is consumed to provide the necessary lift from the ground to reach the flying altitude.

Once in flight, with the rarified atmosphere at 3,000 meters, fuel consumption is vastly reduced as air resistance then becomes much smaller.

Because of this, there is a relatively large amount of carbon emission at or near the airport, which we should manage, as it would affect our ability to achieve the carbon-reduction goal.

It is obvious that, when we have already achieved sizable reduction in carbon emission on land, we should focus on other areas to reach the reduction targets with effective actions for marine and air transport.

International research estimates that, with application of SAF, carbon emission can be reduced as much as 80 percent.

So, how can we proceed to achieve that?

Aircraft engines, mainly using gas turbines instead of internal combustion engines, are less sensitive to fuel types, and most modern aircraft can burn a mixture of kerosine and SAF of up to about 50 percent without affecting longevity and reliability of their power train.

But the present issue is the limited supply of SAF.

SAF can be manufactured in a variety of ways, but the production volume is constrained mainly by supply of feedstock.

To comply with the sustainability goal, the source must either be from renewable source, non-fossil fuel, or from waste. In a busy city like Hong Kong, there is a large potential of waste oil available to be converted.

We have a large quantity of waste oil from restaurants, apart from industrial and land transport applications.

There are already many established methods for upcycling waste oil. Biodiesel is one of the known applications, but its production is confined to only certain types of waste oil, mainly lubrication oil.

Ecoceres, a subsidiary of Towngas in Hong Kong, is established to produce SAF.

Though waste fats, oils and greases, agricultural waste and non-food crops can all be used to manufacture SAF, Ecoceres mainly use waste cooking oil and wood biomass due to limited supply of other waste products.

The amount it can collect from local sources is small, limiting its production volume but, hopefully, with wider publicity, it would help if the public collect waste oil and waste wood products for this purpose, significantly reducing risks of waste oil polluting our sewage systems and waste wood being dumped in landfills.

At this time, the production quantity is still small and can only supply a small percentage of the current aviation fuel used by airlines, but the room for growth is huge as we have not yet fully explored its potential.

It will take time before this initiative receives good attention for a much wider application.

Carbon reduction is now a clear goal for us, but when we are able to devise an eco-system to achieve it, we can also help to reduce air and water pollution at the same time.

Basic engineering was completed in November 2024, and the project is now in the detailed engineering phase.

It comes as the EU looks to bolster SAF’s uptake, with its ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating that SAF makes up 2% of European aviation fuel supplies in 2025 and increasing to 70% in 2050.

SAF is one solution to reduce aviation emissions; however, as of 2024, SAF production represented only 0.53% of global jet fuel use – with high costs and feedstock restraints limiting commercial production.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2023/09/shutterstock_2304836079-2.jpg",N,,2025-03-19 07:56:07.890512

More information More about the KIT Energy Center","Fuels like kerosene can be produced in a climate-friendly way from CO2, water and green electricity using Power-to-Liquid processes. Researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have already demonstrated this with systems in actual operation. Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling - at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale - the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis. The project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

In order to achieve its climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that do not easily lend themselves to electrification. ""The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,"" says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from KIT's Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT). ""Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable."" Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project and heads the corresponding research activities at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: For the first time in the world, the innovative, highly efficient water vapor/CO2 co-electrolysis technology from industrial partner Sunfire was coupled directly with a synthesis process at an industry-relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis output).

Co-electrolysis Makes Power-to-Liquid More Efficient

For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT's Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used. First, syngas - a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - is produced from CO2 and water. In principle, there are several ways to generate syngas. The new configuration uses a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire, which simplifies this process step and, above all, boosts its efficiency. ""Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step. Up to 85 percent of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas. In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,"" says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire. ""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the syngas needs to be brought to reaction pressure. This job is done by a compressor with safety devices the researchers added to the process chain. In a microstructured reactor, the syngas is then converted to long-chain hydrocarbons - known as syncrude - using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These hydrocarbons can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products. Scientists at KIT developed this reactor technology, which is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a KIT spin-off. For the future, it is planned to use the heat released as vapor during synthesis for the co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy demand of the entire process and demonstrate that the product preparation to finally obtain kerosene is feasible at this scale. By combining these process steps, it is possible to fully utilize the carbon dioxide provided and achieve the highest possible energy conversion efficiency, as this process chain allows efficient recycling of material flows in addition to the energy flows.

The Next Step: A Tonne of Kerosene per Day

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to one hundred liters of syncrude per day. Coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus P2X project. The facility is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters syncrude per day. In the third and final funding phase, the research team has INERATEC additionally build a larger Fischer-Tropsch production facility in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. ""For the first time, tonne-scale production will be realized there,"" says Dittmeyer. The product, which will eventually be processed into kerosene, will be used by aircraft engine manufacturers and research partners for testing. Accompanying analyses ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.

About the Kopernikus P2X Project

In the Kopernikus P2X project, partners Climeworks, Sunfire, INERATEC, and the Institute for Micro Process Engineering are establishing and operating an integrated process chain at KIT's Energy Lab. Based on the ""Power-to-Fuel"" concept, carbon-neutral fuels, known as e-fuels, can be produced in this way. The project, which is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), involves 18 partners from industry and science as well as civil-society organizations.

A long-awaited report says up to 800 jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site, where Scotland's only oil refinery is set to close.

The Project Willow study, which was funded by the Scottish and UK governments, sets out nine areas for potential private investment in green industries.

It says jobs could be created in areas like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production and plastics recycling.

Owner Petroineos is shutting the loss-making refinery at the sprawling industrial complex on the Firth of Forth with the loss of 400 jobs.

The report, by consultants EY, lists nine potential uses for the wider site, which employs around 2,000 people.

About 480 jobs could be created with the manufacture of e-methanol for jet fuel and e-ammonia for shipping - but that would require £6.6bn of private investment and would not be operational until around 2035, the report said.

Plastics recycling could be done much sooner, within five years, at a cost of about £600m. It is estimated around 250 jobs could be created.

The report calls on the UK government to bring forward market reforms of the electricity sector to bring down the cost of hydrogen production.

Ministers should also encourage farmers to focus on plant-based products which can be turned into fuels, it says.

The UK and Scottish governments have promised £200m and £25m respectively to support new investment at Grangemouth.

UK Energy Minister Michael Shanks promised to ""leave no stone unturned"" in securing a future for the site.

""We will build on Grangemouth's expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors, secure a long-term clean energy future, and deliver on our Plan for Change,"" he added.

Scottish First Minister John Swinney said: ""Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors.

""Everyone working at Grangemouth's refinery - and in the wider industrial cluster - is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland's economic and net zero future.""

Although we've waited months for this, Project Willow is just the starting gun being fired on what could happen to Grangemouth.

Matching the ambition and the reality is not an easy job. In fact it's never really been achieved before.

But among the big companies which operate on this huge industrial complex there is a renewed sense of optimism because governments are now engaging with them seriously on what could be achieved.

The report sets out the options but it still requires billions of pounds in private cash. Decisions on whether to spend that money have to be done with an assurance of a return on that investment.

Moving operations to other parts of the world, like the Middle East, the US and Australia, look like more favourable options at the minute.

What both governments do next will be crucial.

Cheaper renewable electricity and regulator reform are two key areas identified for change.

The report talks about 800 potential new jobs but this whole town relies on a green industry developing at Grangemouth, so this will be a key test in whether a just and fair transition can ever truly be achieved.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b6b4/live/51b75cb0-04ad-11f0-b105-736ce33fe23a.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 07:56:38.432614

Europe’s aviation industry has taken a significant leap forward by publishing a toolkit designed to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This initiative, backed by key players including airlines, airports, and manufacturers, aims to strengthen Europe’s energy independence and establish a competitive advantage in sustainable fuel production.

The report, compiled by global consulting firm ICF, underscores the urgent need for a dedicated European Union (EU) SAF strategy. With the European Commission (EC) actively working on the Clean Industrial Deal and the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), now is the perfect time to align policies and investment strategies to achieve the region’s sustainability goals.

Why Europe Must Take the Lead

Current projections indicate that SAF production in Europe is not keeping pace with demand. Industrial policies in other global regions, such as the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and China’s strategic investments, have intensified competition, creating an imbalance in the market. If this trend persists, Europe risks becoming overly reliant on imported SAF, undermining its energy autonomy and economic resilience.

The implications of inaction are clear:

Consumers will face higher costs as imported SAF remains expensive.

The European workforce will lose potential employment opportunities in the SAF sector.

The region’s ability to lead in clean energy innovation will be weakened.

However, the report emphasizes that this trajectory is not inevitable. With the right policies and mechanisms, Europe can overcome these challenges and transform itself into a global SAF leader.

Unlocking Investment Through Smart Policy

To accelerate SAF production, the report outlines several key recommendations:

1. Risk-Sharing Mechanisms for Investment

Encouraging private investment is crucial to scaling SAF production. Implementing risk-sharing mechanisms can provide financial stability, making SAF projects more attractive to investors while also mitigating costs for consumers.

2. Strengthening Financial Support for SAF Facilities

Advanced SAF facilities require significant capital investment. Increasing funding for research, infrastructure, and production capacity will help Europe meet its SAF targets and compete on a global scale.

3. Prioritizing Feedstock Access

Ensuring a steady supply of sustainable feedstocks and renewable electricity is essential for the competitiveness of SAF production. By prioritizing access to these resources, Europe can create a more stable and sustainable fuel supply chain.

4. Refining Existing Regulatory Mechanisms

Policies such as the ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) can be optimized by introducing greater flexibility. This will enhance market efficiency, reduce volatility, and provide a more predictable investment environment.

A Defining Moment for European Aviation

The leaders of the six industry associations that commissioned the report stress that SAF is more than just a tool for decarbonization—it is an opportunity to establish Europe as a global leader in clean energy. With strong policy action, Europe can:

Lead the transition to a net-zero aviation industry.

Strengthen its energy independence.

Boost its global competitiveness in sustainable fuel technologies.

Collaboration for a Sustainable Future

The six organizations behind the report include:

Airlines for Europe (A4E) – representing major European airlines.

Airports Council International (ACI Europe) – advocating for sustainable airport development.

Airport Regions Council (ARC) – supporting local and regional airport authorities.

AeroSpace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD) – promoting innovation in aerospace sustainability.

European Regions Airline Association (ERA) – focusing on regional airline sustainability efforts.

General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) – supporting clean aviation technology advancements.

Conclusion

This SAF toolkit arrives at a pivotal moment. Europe has the potential to shape the future of aviation by embracing sustainability as a competitive advantage. However, success will require coordinated efforts from policymakers, industry leaders, and investors. The choices made today will determine whether Europe leads the global SAF transition or remains dependent on external suppliers.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-03-19 06:56:48.785955

This follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology which includes specific accounting rules and practices on how to include SAF in per-passenger CO2 data.

Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases.

In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added.

“Corporations and individual travellers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s senior vice-president commercial products and services.

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, directly contributed by airlines. This approach contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modeled averages.

With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas and Royal Air Maroc, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect. With each new airline participant, the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations improves—for individual travellers and corporates.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonisation powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IATA-CO-pic-Biofuel-19-3-768x577.jpg,N,,2025-03-19 07:56:52.718739
