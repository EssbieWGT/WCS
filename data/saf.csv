IAG Q2 Metrics

IAG reported second-quarter passenger revenue of nearly €7.8 billion, an increase of 4.9 percent year over year. Total revenue for the group was about €8.9 billion, up 6.8 percent from a year prior. Net income before taxes was €1.5 billion, up from more than €1.1 billion reported in Q2 2024. Second-quarter capacity increased 2.2 percent year over year, while load factor fell 1.3 percentage points to 85.4 percent.

British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia each posted year-over-year profit increases. Vueling's profit, however, fell €2 million to €95 million. BA recorded a £269 million uptick in profit to £824 million, driven by a 2.1 percent increase in capacity. This is despite the March 21 shutdown of its London Heathrow hub, which had an estimated adverse effect of £40 million.

The group said it will continue to invest in its core markets, namely the North Atlantic and Latin American markets, despite some ""weakness"" in U.S. point-of-sale economy leisure demand in the second quarter.

IAG secured more than 200,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel in the year’s first half, marking a 25 percent year-over-year increase, according to its earnings presentation. It also inked a deal with Microsoft to reduce the latter's Scope 3 emissions from business travel.

The group’s full-year outlook includes projected capacity growth of 2.5 percent year over year, down from the 3 percent growth previously estimated, due to geopolitical uncertainties.

“Previously agreed deliveries and contracts that had not been suspended in hopes the tariff would be eased will potentially keep the tallow market firm in August,” one source said.
That said, tallow supply in the domestic market remained reportedly tight, but not due to a real shortage, a source said.
Participants in the biodiesel sector said tallow prices were still paired with exports, which made it less competitive in the domestic market compared with soyoil.","An US executive order issued late on Wednesday exempted a list of Brazilian products and confirmed the 50% tariff on tallow, effective for products shipped from August 5. The news prompted speculation among market participants, but there was no immediate price reaction.

Fastmarkets assessed the export price for tallow, max 15% ffa, fob Santos unchanged week on week at $1,040-1,080 per tonne on Thursday.

No export deals were heard for September deliveries, but trading talks were held and lower bids from exporters for origination were reported before the executive order was signed.

Market participants noted that tanks at Santos and Rio Grande ports continued to receive tallow in the week, partly to accomplish contracts scheduled for August.

Fastmarkets heard a week earlier that three Brazilian companies sold 36,000 tonnes to US sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers using the US’s duty drawback system, which allows them to get back most of the tariff paid, as long as the finished product is exported.

“Previously agreed deliveries and contracts that had not been suspended in hopes the tariff would be eased will potentially keep the tallow market firm in August,” one source said.

It was uncertain whether new deals would be reached with the US under the 50% tariff or whether unsold volumes could be delivered to other destinations. Some exporters were still trying to find ways to offer the feedstock to Europe, sources said.

Some speculated on potential shipments to Argentina’s hygiene and oleochemical market, considering the country could export more tallow to the US if trading flows from Brazil decrease permanently.

The tallow market is one of the most affected by the tariff against Brazil, as nearly 97% of the exported volume has been sent to the US in 2025, customs data showed.

Domestic prices

Fastmarkets assessed the price for bleachable fancy tallow, max 3.5% ffa, cif Sao Paulo (inclusive of 12% tax) unchanged week on week at 6.20-6.50 Reais ($1.11-1.16) per kg.

Meanwhile, the main reference for Brazil’s biodiesel sector, bleachable fancy tallow, max 5% ffa, cif Sao Paulo (inclusive of 12% tax) was assessed at 6.10-6.30 Reais per kg, up from 6.00-6.20 Reais per kg a week earlier.

Sources told Fastmarkets that despite a recent decline in cattle slaughter in July following the US tariff announcement, production levels remained historically high.

That said, tallow supply in the domestic market remained reportedly tight, but not due to a real shortage, a source said.

“It seems more like a strategy by tallow producers to hold back supply in order to avoid sharp price declines,” the source told Fastmarkets.

Participants in the biodiesel sector said tallow prices were still paired with exports, which made it less competitive in the domestic market compared with soyoil.

The market expects increased demand for domestic feedstocks such as tallow and soyoil after the increase in the mandatory biodiesel blend in diesel from 14% to 15% (B15), which takes effect on August 1.

A source said the B15 blending mandate should not be expected to be felt in prices before October, as biodiesel producers currently have inventories.

“Since it takes about 40 days for the demand increase to take effect, that impact would likely not be seen in August and September,” they said.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/10/Ag_AnimalFats_BeefTallowBlock_AdobeStock_869070057-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 14:56:31.231833

Nanterre, 4 August 2025

VINCI wins major contract for innovative biofuel plant in Spain

Electrical, piping and industrial mechanical works for a major second-generation biofuel plant

A strategic project for the energy transition in Spain

Moeve and Apical have awarded Grupo Cobra and Masa - both subsidiaries of Cobra IS – the electrical, piping and industrial mechanical works of the largest second-generation (2G) biofuel plant in Spain.

Located in Palos de la Frontera (Huelva province), this plant, with an estimated total cost of €1.2 billion, will benefit from the synergies being located beside Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park.

The new plant will have an annual production capacity of 500,000 tonnes of sustainable fuels, including SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and HVO100 (renewable diesel). It will use agricultural waste and used cooking oils as raw materials.

Its design incorporates cutting-edge technologies to minimise environmental impact. In particular, it will rely exclusively on recylced water and will reduce CO₂ emissions by 75% compared to traditional plants, thereby avoiding the emission of nearly 3 million tonnes of CO₂ per year.

This ambitious and innovative project will consolidate Spain’s position as a leading player in clean energy. It reinforces Cobra IS’s commitment to the decarbonisation of transport in Europe.

In 2024, the VINCI Group generated a total revenue of €3.8 billion in Spain including €3.2 billion for Cobra IS, €0.3 billion for VINCI Energies and €0.3 billion for VINCI Construction.

A new white paper from the World Economic Forum and Kearney models four future scenarios for the industry.

These explore how geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, sustainability efforts and digitalization will shape the travel and tourism sector.

In the late 1950s, Frank Sinatra invited his beloved to “Come fly with me”. It evoked the faraway places burgeoning global air travel could take you to – something we all came to take for granted over the next seven decades. Until 2020, at least.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, travel and tourism became one of the hardest-hit sectors, but it is now back on track, with 7% growth in spending expected over the next decade. In the first quarter of 2025, international tourist arrivals grew by 5% compared to the previous year, led by travel to Asia Pacific and Africa.

Despite the rebound, the travel and tourism (T&T) industry now exists in a very different, more volatile world, shaped by a mix of geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, the move to more sustainable tourism and digitalization. A new white paper from the World Economic Forum and Kearney has modelled the interplay of these factors in four future scenarios.

Scenario 1: A thousand islands world

This scenario portrays a world characterized by geopolitical fragmentation and escalating global tensions that split it into “a thousand islands”.

Here, tourism spending will be curtailed by declining global trade, protectionist travel restrictions, stalling economic growth and reduced disposable incomes. Low-income destinations will feel the impact of these trends most acutely.

A drop in global air travel will help reduce aviation emissions. However, a shift to more regionalized travel between countries with harmonized and simplified entry requirements will drive up emissions from regional travel, including road and rail.

With less international travel, employment in areas such as aviation and cross-border services is predicted to drop off, making way for greater automation, while new jobs could emerge in regional travel.

Scenario 2: Harmonious horizons

The diametrical opposite of the “thousand islands” concept. This scenario is characterized by strong multilateral cooperation, trade liberalization and sustained GDP growth.

Visa liberalization and higher disposable incomes are expected to contribute to a nearly one-third (29%) surge in international tourist arrivals by 2030. Highlighting the potential for equitable growth, close to two-thirds of these (58%) will be from Global South economies, with significant contributions from India, Indonesia and Nigeria.

Tourism recruitment is expected to rise by nearly a third (29% compared to 2022), although labour shortages are likely to persist.

However, the surge in tourism will see aviation emissions rising, as adoption rates of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remain too low to cover increased fuel demand.

Alongside, the risk of overtourism will increase, and measures like dynamic pricing will be needed to prevent environmental degradation.

Loading...

Scenario 3: Green ascent

Here, the Forum maps out a world driven by decarbonization, stringent environmental regulation and environmentally-aware travellers looking for low-impact destinations and travel modes.

Substantial investments in low-carbon technologies and increased use of SAF will contribute to the success of this model, as will “high-value, low volume” experiences that reduce overtourism in popular holiday spots.

At the same time, regenerative tourism at eco-certified destinations becomes the preferred choice of more than two-thirds of tourists (68%). This preference also drives a shift to low-emission transport such as high-speed rail.

The scenario forecasts significant economic benefits such as green tourism jobs. However, it also warns of new trade-offs between sustainability and growth, for example the loss of tropical rainforest to the production of SAF.

Scenario 4: Tech turbulence

The final scenario juxtaposes hyper-accelerated technology adoption and fragmented economic recovery with uneven growth.

While the adoption of generative AI in T&T is expected to reach 78% by 2030, with advanced mobile networks covering most urban areas, a substantial digital divide will remain between regions.

Hybrid working using augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and virtual tourism are expected to grow. While driving down travel emissions, this trend will increase energy consumption from the underlying technology platforms.

Alongside, tourism will become polarized between high-end luxury travellers and mid-market tourists for whom dynamic pricing will increasingly threaten affordability.

Rapid technology adoption will also transform or automate 45% of T&T jobs, mainly routine tasks. However, automation will also create more than two million unfilled vacancies by 2030, making re-skilling in AI and AR/VR a priority across the sector.

Developing tailored strategies for travel and tourism

Each of the four scenarios will require tailored strategies to mitigate the associated risks, from overtourism and labour shortages to environmental degradation.

To navigate these four scenarios and shape a future that works for all, T&T leaders need to prioritize improved governance, workforce upskilling and innovative financing to meet investment needs. Public-private partnerships are crucial for funding, regenerative practices and digital transformation, making T&T resilient and a catalyst for equitable prosperity.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/2qQLBtA4hu1XXivJktP46OwLhuaSwtOyMJQF8U6xdys.png,N,,2025-08-04 11:56:25.813849

DTL3 has secured a take‑or‑pay storage agreement with EcoCeres Limited for the dedicated 100,000 m³, which serves as a catalyst for the expansion.

This follows EcoCeres’ announcement of a significant investment in a new production facility in Pasir Gudang, Johor Darul Ta’‑Zitam, Malaysia.

The biorefinery is expected to be operational in the second half of 2025, situated less than 1 km from DTL3, and directly connected to DTL3’s storage tanks via rundown pipelines.

The biorefinery is expected to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils (“HVO”) with an annual capacity of up to 350,000 tonnes.

The dedicated storage at DTL3 optimises EcoCeres’ investment in storage infrastructure, and the logistical integration via pipelines enhances operational efficiency.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.","The Minnesota Star Tribune reported last fall that the first sustainable aviation fuel, made from a Minnesota-grown crop called winter camelina, powered a Delta Air Lines flight from the Twin Cities to New York City. It marked the beginning of a plan by Minnesota SAF Hub—a coalition including Bank of America, Delta, Ecolab, and Xcel Energy—to eventually convert all Delta flights from MSP to bio-based jet fuels to reduce greenhouse gases.

You may think the sole star of the show here is sustainable aviation fuel. But, as a long-ago radio personality used to say, now for the rest of the story.

By tapping into the market for plant-based aviation fuel, University of Minnesota researchers at the Forever Green Initiative are commercializing two oil-producing plants—winter camelina and domesticated pennycress—that can give farmers a payday for planting winter cover crops that hold soil, take up excess nutrients, and help protect the quality of Minnesota’s streams and groundwater.

Mitch Hunter, associate director of the University’s Forever Green Initiative, says “What we’re trying to do is develop crops that make farmers money, and in the process, provide all those environmental benefits that we’ve been trying to get to for so long with very little success.”

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also recently awarded the University $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand project. It was selected as one of six projects working to “advance the production of low carbon intensity, purpose-grown energy crops critical to accelerating a clean energy bioeconomy.

From cover crops to jet fuel

This story really begins with “the big brown spot”—the vast agriculture region of the upper Midwest that stands barren from October through April, with nothing growing to protect the soil. “You can see the brown of this uncovered landscape from space,” says Hunter.

That bare earth is prone to wind and water erosion. Runoff of nutrients, especially nitrogen, into streams and groundwater fertilizes lakes, pollutes sources of drinking water, and contributes to the “dead zone” at the end of the Mississippi River. Says Hunter, “When soil has nothing living on it, rain falls, filters through the soil, and draws those nutrients directly into our waterways. You have to have a plant living there to take up the nitrogen and the phosphorus.”

The solution—plant something, anything, to hold soil and take up excess nutrients until the next cash crop is planted. A recent report by Forever Green partners, including consultants Ecotone Analytics and Friends of the Mississippi River, estimated that widespread use of cover crops could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23 percent and soil erosion by 35 percent by 2050.

But folks have promoted cover crops for a long time. “They get a lot of buzz, and they’re adopted in Minnesota on 2 or 3 percent of the total cropland, despite years and years and years of education and investment and incentives,” says Hunter. “So that model isn’t working.”

The problem? Cover crops take both time and money.

The many contributions of the Forever Green Initiative

So about 30 years ago, the late Don Wyse, Forever Green cofounder and codirector, began working with farmers to grow a perennial rye grass that not only anchors soil, but can be sold for commercial grass seed. Says Hunter, “All of a sudden, you transformed the cropping systems in that region to have perennial cover for a large part of the rotation, and it was all because they developed a crop that actually made farmers money.”

Wyse and his colleagues went prospecting for other potentially profitable cover crops. Of 15 or so, two are pertinent to our story today. The first is winter camelina, an old crop from Europe related to cabbage, kale, broccoli, and canola. Like canola, it produces tiny seeds with an oil content as high as 35 percent. The other is pennycress, a new crop bred from a ubiquitous weed. Like camelina, it is rich in oil, exceptionally winter hardy, and even quicker to grow and mature.

Forever Green’s plan is to target the more than 2 million acres in Minnesota used to raise spring wheat, corn silage, alfalfa, and small grains—crops that are harvested in early fall. Then farmers can plant winter camelina or pennycress, let it grow through late fall, winter, and early spring, and harvest the oil seed crop in late spring before planting the next cash grain crop.

But how to market camelina or pennycress oil seeds to get a good price? Selling them for food-grade oil means competing with a lot of well-established oils like canola and sunflower. Sustainable diesel fuel is a possibility, but ground transportation seems to be moving toward electrification.

Enter sustainable aviation fuel, a use that’s growing exponentially. Aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global emission of the carbon dioxide that drives climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Like other fields of transportation, aviation seeks to reduce its fossil fuel use.

Trains, trucks, and automobiles have been able to replace internal combustion engines with electric motors and massive banks of batteries. Unfortunately, in the air, every ounce counts—so aviation has looked to fuels from renewable biological sources such as used cooking fat and dedicated energy crops.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.

Hunter adds that state incentives and private support will continue to further the development of sustainable fuels and environmentally beneficial farming practices.",https://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/jet-fuel-crops.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:15.388548

Ground Support Worldwide sat down with Anna-Maria Kirchner, Head of Global Sales at Finnair Cargo, at the CNS Partnership Conference held in Miami in May, where she offered a look into the airline's operations, strategic pivots, and its commitment to specialized cargo. The following is an excerpt from that discussion.

GSW: What's the latest news from Finnair Cargo?

Kirchner: From last year to this year, we’ve effectively doubled our capacity into the US market. This means we now operate up to 11 flights per week to Dallas, five times a week to Los Angeles, five times a week to Seattle, and daily services to Chicago and New York, JFK. The strategic rationale is straightforward: we see an opportunity to capture a larger share of the market, particularly given our unique geographical position and operational strengths.

GSW: How much of a factor is Finland's geographical location to Finnair Cargo's opportunities and challenges?

Kirchner: Historically, Finland offered the shortest route from Europe to Asia by flying over Russia. However, the pandemic hit first, followed by the closure of Russian airspace. This presented a double crisis for us. Being only 200 kilometers from St. Petersburg and sharing a 1,300-kilometer border with Russia, this closure significantly impacted our direct routes.

Despite not being the largest carrier globally - we operate around 80 aircraft - we consider ourselves a niche carrier that's incredibly fast and agile in adapting our strategy. We've continued to fly to Asia by either taking a southern route or, more uniquely, a North Pole route back, flying over Alaska. This requires significant operational adaptation based on demand and geopolitical realities. While other Western and European carriers face similar challenges, our proximity to Russia means the extended flight times affect us more acutely.

GSW: What defines Finnair's niche in the air cargo market?

Kirchner: Our niche is specialized cargo, particularly in the cool chain. We are one of the largest transporters of salmon, shipping over 100,000 kilos of seafood daily, primarily from northern Norway, trucked down to Helsinki, and then flown to Asia and the US. Our entire operation is built around maintaining the cool chain. Our state-of-the-art cool terminal, opened in 2018, combines automation with human expertise and latest technology.

Our focus is on being a premium carrier. We don't aim to be the cheapest; instead, we prioritize quality and reliability. Our customers consistently acknowledge us as a premium product, trusting us to handle their shipments, especially sensitive cargo like pharmaceuticals, with the utmost care. This commitment to quality and specialization truly defines our niche.

GSW: Maintaining a successful cool chain operation involves significant technological and logistical integration. What do you see as the recipe for achieving this effectively?

Kirchner: A majority of our success stems from our technology supported hub and handling team in Helsinki. The technology within our COOL terminal is cutting-edge. However, the location of Helsinki itself plays a crucial role; it's a non-congested hub. Unlike mega-hubs in Europe such as Amsterdam or Frankfurt, which can experience bottlenecks for smaller shipments, our automation and lower congestion ensure smoother, more efficient handling, regardless of shipment size.

GSW: How do Finnish societal values and government policies inform Finnair's philosophy, particularly regarding employee welfare and operational efficiency?

Kirchner: Our government has a 55.8% ownership stake in the company, and this influence is evident in how we operate. We prioritize work-life balance for our employees; for instance, performance reviews begin by asking about work-life balance. Our regular working week is approximately 37 hours and we encourage rest to maintain energy.

A key Finnish trait reflected at Finnair is decentralized decision-making. We empower employees at various levels to make decisions, which allows us to react quickly to business opportunities. This ""one voice"" approach means everyone is accountable for their decisions, fostering a sense of ownership and agility.

Our longevity as one of the oldest carriers, established in 1923, is also a testament to this resilient and forward-thinking spirit. We've navigated challenges like the pandemic and airspace closure by constantly adapting and innovating. This cultural foundation contributes significantly to our positive and productive work environment.

GSW: Finnair appears to be very progressive in terms of gender equality and employee support. How do these principles manifest within the company, especially concerning family leave and career development?

Kirchner: It stems from a long-standing cultural ethos in Finland, where equal opportunity is a fundamental principle. For example, Finnish law allows for up to three years of maternity leave with job security, and free daycare facilities are strategically located near homes or workplaces to ease the transition back to work for mothers.

Crucially, this isn't just about women; it's about equal opportunity for all. We have male colleagues who take extended paternity leave, demonstrating a truly egalitarian approach. Our internal job rotation program is another example. We encourage employees to experience different departments, like moving from operations to revenue management or sales. This provides a 360-degree view of the business, fostering a deeper understanding and better collaboration, which ultimately benefits our cargo operations.

GSW: As an employer, how significant is Finnair within Finland, and what contributes to the strong loyalty among its employees?

Kirchner: Finnair is a very large employer in Finland, with around 6,000 employees. While this might not seem huge by American standards, for a country of 5.5 million people, it's substantial. We are consistently ranked among the top five most favorite employers in Finland, reflecting a strong brand and deep employee pride.

Employee loyalty is remarkable. I have colleagues who have been with the company for 20+ years. Many have received lucrative offers from other carriers, including those in the Middle East, but they choose to stay. This loyalty is attributed to a strong ""Finnair DNA"" - a positive, supportive, and empowering work environment that makes people feel valued and connected to the company's mission.

Q: How does Finnair balance technology and human expertise to maintain its premium service, especially with the increasing adoption of AI in the industry?

Kirchner: It's a balance of both. While we leverage technology extensively, including AI-supported forecasting for staffing and resource allocation, the cornerstone is our modern terminal that combines automation with the know-how of our cargo experts. The technology is only as good as the people operating it, which makes our human expertise critical.

We actively promote internal rotation among our cargo teams. For instance, someone from operations might spend a year in revenue management or sales. This cross-functional experience gives our team members a holistic understanding of the entire cargo

ecosystem, enabling them to connect the dots and anticipate needs more effectively. This unique approach, while less common in other companies, is something we actively encourage, fostering a highly knowledgeable and adaptable workforce that complements our technological capabilities.

GSW: Sustainability is a critical focus for the aviation industry. What initiatives is Finnair undertaking in this area, particularly within its cargo operations?

Kirchner: Sustainability is a significant priority, and Finnair is committed to advancing sustainable development in the industry. We have a dedicated sustainability manager for cargo and we work on various initiatives:

Waste Reduction: We are investigating processes to repair and re-audit cargo straps and nets used for cargo handling, preventing them from being discarded prematurely. While not cheaper, it significantly reduces waste.

Renewable Energy: Our COOL terminal in Helsinki is equipped with 2,990 solar panels, making it the second-largest solar panel field in Finland. These panels supply 37% of our electricity needs.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): In Europe, a 2% SAF mandate is in place, meaning we're obligated to use this blend. We're actively partnering with fuel suppliers like Neste (headquartered in Finland) and freight forwarders, such as our recent important deal with DB Schenker, where they voluntarily purchased SAF with us. This helps both us and our partners meet their emission reduction targets (Scope 3).

We view sustainability not as a distant goal but as an urgent reality. We're actively collaborating with other airlines and forwarders to achieve the industry goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, emphasizing education and collective action.

GSW: Looking ahead, what do you envision for the future of Finnair Cargo, in terms of opportunities and overarching goals for the organization?

Kirchner: We anticipate organic growth for Finnair. We are still integrating additional A350 aircraft, which are excellent for cargo and contribute to our sustainability goals. Our immediate focus is on fine-tuning our current flight network. The geopolitical situation remains a key factor that will shape future developments.

The air cargo industry is inherently dynamic - when it goes up, it goes up significantly, and when it goes down, it goes down significantly; there's rarely a ""normal."" This dynamism makes it incredibly interesting. At Finnair, our smaller, agile organization allows us to react quickly to market changes and seize opportunities. We are confident in our ability to adapt and continue our positive organic growth, making it an exciting time to be in this industry with Finnair.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/07/68810933cb3994a5848529fb-annakirchner_1.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-04 10:56:27.228886

Since the beginning of the 7th Administration, South Africa embarked on a process to stabilise and enhance mutually beneficial trade and investment relations with the US. The aim has been to address long-standing bilateral issues of concern for both sides in ways that move the trade relations forward. South Africa has been engaging the US at various levels with a view to ensure predictability in trade. However, even with these efforts, the US decided to impose a 30% unilateral tariff on South Africa. It is unfortunate that this government’s efforts in resetting the relationship with the US has been undermined by some actors within South African society.

The unilateral tariffs have been implemented notwithstanding, South Africa’s submission of a comprehensive and ambitious Framework Deal in May 2025 aimed at addressing the US trade deficit, address tariffs, promote digital trade, enhance commercial relations, promote investment and eliminate non-tariff barriers to enhance mutually beneficial trade relations with the United States.

The 30% unilateral tariffs on foreign imports apply to various US trading partners which will be implemented from 12:01 am on 8 August 2025. The Executive order published by the United States clarifies that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 8 August 2025, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall instead remain subject to the 10% tariff.

The US is South Africa’s third biggest trading partner, with the European Union and China being the first and second largest trading partners. The US accounts for 7.5% of our global exports. Thus, we will continue to engage the US with a view to conclude a deal that advances the interests of both countries. South Africa seeks to conclude deals that promote value addition and industrialisation, rather than extractive relations that deprive the country of the ability to beneficiate our mineral wealth by mimicking extractive colonial era trade relations.

South Africa’s minimal 0.25% share of total US imports makes the 30% tariff on our country are inscrutable, especially when these same tariffs have been applied indiscriminately to all US trading partners globally. Moreover, South Africa poses no trade threat to the US economy nor its national security. The calculation of US-SA “trade deficit” ignores the substantial US trade surplus in services, as well as the complementary nature of the bilateral trade and investment relations between the two countries.

South African exports do not compete with US producers and do not pose a threat to US industry. On the contrary, our exports are crucial inputs that support America’s own industrial base. Our agriculture exports are even counter-seasonal, meaning they fill gaps in the US market, not replace domestic products.

South Africa isn’t just a trading partner—we’re a major investor in the US, with our companies sustaining American jobs. Similarly, over 600 US companies in South Africa contribute to our industrial growth and create employment. Our goal is to preserve and grow these mutually beneficial relationships.

Impact of the tariffs

The uncertainty of the new tariff line is already incorporated into economic projections. For example, various economists estimated that it may shave off 0,2% of South Africa’s economic growth. The reduction in growth from the 30% tariff depends on a number of factors, including our ability to find alternative markets. It should be noted, however, that 35% of SA exports remain exempted from the tariffs. All applicable exceptions covered in the previous US Executive Order are set to remain in force and these exceptions covers products such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber articles, certain critical minerals, stainless steel scrap and energy and energy products.

Importantly, due to South Africa not enjoying a country exemption for Section 232 duties on steel and aluminium, South African companies have already adjusted to the Section 232 duties since 2018. However, the heightened policy uncertainty creates instability in trade and may have an impact on exports.

The new tariff regime implemented by the United States is a significant departure from a low-tariff environment. This policy shift, which affects not only South Africa but the entire world, has already led to higher tariffs than before, changing the landscape of global trade as we know it.

Response measures

Continuation of negotiations with the US

South Africa is committed to a principled approach, and we will continue to use all available diplomatic channels to negotiate a mutually beneficial trade deal with the United States one that respects our national interests while advancing our long-standing partnership. Such a deal will be pursued in a pragmatic manner that preserves regional integration and the SACU common external tariff, noting that SACU accounts for 9% of our global exports and must be preserved.

The South African Government is working with industry to consider aspects of the Framework Deal that can be modified, in a manner that promotes predictability in trade.

Implement an Economic Response Package which includes:

a.) The establishment of an Export Support Desk, which will serve as a direct point of contact for companies affected by the US tariff hike. The aim of this support measure is to support the diversification of export markets for increased resilience and facilitate the entry into alternative markets for affected exporters. The Desk will provide updates on developments and tailored advisory services to exporters on alternative destinations, guidance on market entry processes, insights into compliance requirements and linkages to South African Embassies and High Commissions abroad. The contact details of the Export Support Desk have been published on the dtic website.

b.) Measures to assist companies to absorb the tariff and facilitate long-term resilience and growth strategies to protect jobs and productive capacity in South Africa. The details of these are being finalised and will be communicated shortly.

c.) Localisation Fund Support (LSF) stands ready to contribute to the national effort to support South African companies impacted by the imposition of 30% import tariffs by the United States. In collaboration with the dtic, IDC and other agencies – LSF will issue an open call from firms operating in affected value chains, with the aim of providing targeted competitiveness and efficiency support.

d.) To build resilience, we are working on an Export and Competitiveness Support Programme (ECSP), which will include a working capital facility and plant and equipment facility to address short to medium term needs across all industries.

e.) We are also working with the Department of Labour on measures to mitigate potential job losses, using existing instruments such as the UIF that can be adjusted to respond to the current challenges.

Block exemption for exporters

The diversification of markets that will be required following the introduction of additional tariffs on South African goods may require exporters to coordinate their activities in relation to developing joint infrastructure for exports, sharing of market information and coordination of activities to achieve economies of scale and efficiencies that enable them to be competitive.

These activities may contravene the provision of the Competition Act. The Minister has following consultations with the Competition Commission, introduced a Block Exemption for Exporters to enable collaboration and coordination by competitors. The Block Exemption details the scope of application. A draft Block Exemption will be published by the end of the week so that the process can be concluded expeditiously.

Diversification of markets

We have been strengthening trade and investment partnerships with various trade partners. These efforts are bearing fruits, targeting markets across Africa, as well as in Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Americas.

Our announcement on the Clean Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union in March has unlocked a R90 Billion Investment Package that has been initially committed. This Clean Trade and Investment Partnership also aims to unlock new market access opportunities for South Africa, including the export of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by Sasol and the exports of hybrids and Electric Vehicles.

While facing global trade challenges, South Africa is proactively building a more resilient agricultural sector. We’ve made significant progress in opening up vast new markets like China and Thailand, securing vital protocols for products like citrus and others. With China alone being a $200 billion market, we are confidently expanding our reach and creating new opportunities for our agricultural producers.

Our government has not been idle; we are proactively and collaboratively diversifying our trade portfolio. Under the coordinated leadership of the Presidency, DIRCO, and the dtic, we’re making significant inroads into new, high-growth markets across Asia and the Middle East, including the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. These efforts are not only opening doors to new opportunities but also reinforcing our commitment to retaining the vital markets we already have. South Africa’s economic future is resilient, and we are working tirelessly to secure it.

We have also developed a number of Trade and Investment Packages with a number of countries, including Japan that aim to unlock new market access opportunities.

While the current measures present challenges, it also presents opportunities to build and accelerate the implementation of the AfCFTA and to develop new partnerships in markets that have remained untapped, including ASEAN and Türkiye.

Under this plan, which has been heavily backed by the incumbent Labour government, Heathrow could see its capacity expand to 756,000 flights per year. That is up from its current limit of 480,000 flights.

But the push for a third runway is not new, and has been the target of serious and disruptive opposition from pressure groups in the past. With shifting approaches towards climate action, and greater prominence of ‘sustainable’ aviation solutions, what pressure landscape will Heathrow face this time around?

Pressure on Aviation is growing globally

Since 2024, the volume of global pressure campaigns targeting the Aviation & Aerospace industry have been approaching levels not seen since the COVID pandemic.

Climate change, air pollution, and opposition to development remain the top issues driving pressure on the industry.

Concerns around weapons exports have also dogged aerospace manufacturers in recent years.

Attitudes towards Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Heathrow’s ‘shovel-ready plan’ includes a provision to reduce carbon emissions, and reach net zero by 2050, through its use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Pressure narratives around Sustainable Aviation Fuel began in 2020, and debates on the proposed solution are growing. H1 2025 saw more SAF-focused campaigns than all 12 months of 2024.

The role of SAF in aviation decarbonisation is polarizing among pressure campaigners. A narrative analysis of SIGWATCH data reveals that:

Such a split in attitudes in pressure campaigns is unusual, particularly when many tech-focused climate solutions are deemed to be ‘false solutions’ and ‘distractions’ by environmental groups.

What does this mean for Heathrow & the Aviation industry?

This new proposal for Heathrow’s expansion is being released into a dramatically different pressure ecosystem than previous attempts.

Scrutiny of the industry is up, but the types of campaigns likely to be provoked by this announcement will look different to the Extinction Rebellion-style direct action that we would have seen several years ago.

Split views around solutions such as SAF indicate more space for pragmatism, but opposition will likely continue through different stakeholder channels.

With European climate policymakers eyeing aviation taxation as a lucrative and underused tool, a fierce debate has reignited between environmental campaigners and the airline industry over how to fund decarbonisation fairly and effectively.

A new policy briefing from Carbon Market Watch (CMW) claims that a full expansion of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) to cover all departing and arriving flights, private jets, and aviation’s non-CO₂ climate impacts could raise nearly €500 billion between now and 2040. That figure is nearly five times the revenue expected under the EU-ETS’s currently limited scope.

The environmental NGO says these reforms are not only overdue, but also have strong public backing. Citing Eurobarometer polling and other research, CMW notes that over 75% of EU citizens support ending fossil fuel subsidies, including for kerosene. Most believe public funds should be directed to clean energy, and view the current exemption of aviation from fuel taxes as unfair.

“It is scandalous that the aviation industry has skirted paying for its climate impacts for so long,” says Bastien Bonnet-Cantalloube, CMW’s policy expert on the decarbonisation of aviation. “The upcoming EU-ETS review can set aviation on a decarbonisation flightpath and generate greater revenue to fund the bloc’s climate policies.”

Aviation taxation: Proposals on the table

CMW’s recommendations, backed by research from consultancy Carbone 4, include:

Extending the EU ETS to all flights departing and arriving in the EEA

Including non-CO₂ effects (such as contrail-induced warming and NOx emissions), with a proposed multiplier of 2x

Applying a 4x carbon multiplier to private jet emissions, reflecting their disproportionately high emissions per passenger

Doubling support for e-kerosene development, funded through auctioned allowances

The report estimates that, under an expanded scope, the ETS could cover 130 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually by 2030, compared to just 54 million today.

That would not only help bridge Europe’s €8 billion annual clean aviation investment gap, but also contribute substantially to international climate finance and rail infrastructure improvements.

IATA pushes back on unfair aviation taxation

However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has pushed back, arguing that additional taxes on aviation, including those targeting business class or private jets, could undermine the sector’s ability to invest in long-term decarbonisation.

The association spoke out against the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF), which has proposed a broad menu of 16 potential levies to raise around $90 billion annually. This includes a premium air travel levy, a fuel levy for private aircraft and a frequent flyer tax.

IATA warned that such taxes “do not reduce emissions” and risk “diverting funds away from the technologies and solutions that will.” The organisation continues to back CORSIA, the global carbon offsetting scheme developed by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), as the appropriate international mechanism.

“The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow,” says Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “Yet governments casually suggest a tax on flyers that is three times the airline industry’s annual profit without considering the real-world side effects for an industry that is a lifeline for remote communities, invigorates tourism markets and links local products to global markets.”

IATA argues that regional schemes like the ETS, especially if significantly expanded or duplicated by new levies, could fragment climate governance and erode international consensus.

“Airlines are not evading doing their part to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The industry is doing everything possible to achieve net-zero carbon emissions,” continues Walsh. “The last thing these efforts need is a USD90 billion gut punch of a tax.”

The future of the EU-ETS

The EU is preparing for a 2026 revision of the ETS Directive, which will revisit scope, pricing, and revenue allocation rules. In parallel, member states are working on the bloc’s 2028–2034 budget, including possible new own-resource revenues.

At the heart of the debate is not just how to price emissions, but how to spend the proceeds. Carbon Market Watch proposes that a portion of ETS revenue should be ringfenced for:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, with a strict focus on e-kerosene

Rail infrastructure upgrades to replace short-haul flights

Transition support for aviation workers and the least developed countries

The group argues that expanding aviation carbon pricing could generate ten times the revenue needed to fund SAF development alone.

Whether that vision wins political support remains to be seen. But with mounting climate commitments, lagging airline emissions reductions, and a patchwork of global policy tools, the EU may be running out of reasons, and time, not to act.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/viktor-forgacs-hBJIdtTOmeE-unsplash-1024x674.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:40.890833

The plant is located within LG Chem’s Daesan Chemical Complex in Seosan, Chungcheongnam-do, approximately 80km south-west of capital Seoul.

The joint venture, LG-Eni BioRefining, is overseeing the project, which aims for completion by 2027. Upon completion, the facility will process around 400,000 tons (t) of renewable bio-feedstock annually.

The demand for HVO and SAF is anticipated to increase due to global renewable fuel mandates. The fuels are produced by hydrogenating sustainable vegetable oils such as used cooking oil and other waste residues, using Ecofining technology developed by Eni in collaboration with Honeywell UOP.

Compared to traditional fossil fuels, HVO and SAF significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire product value chain.

LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol said: “LG Chem is transforming its portfolio to build a low-carbon foundation that ensures both a progressively more sustainable growth and profitability.

“By advancing innovation in renewable fuels and biobased feedstocks like HVO, we aim to strengthen our global competitiveness and meet our customers’ evolving needs efficiently.”

The establishment of this facility marks a significant move for LG Chem in the renewable energy sector. By integrating HVO into its supply chain, the company aims to broaden its range of International Sustainability and Carbon Certification PLUS-certified products.

These products target applications in various sectors, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for electronics and cars, ethylene-vinyl acetate for sporting goods, and superabsorbent polymers for hygiene products.

Enilive CEO Stefano Ballista said: “The Seosan biorefinery breaking ground reaffirms Enilive’s strategy in offering increasingly sustainable products and our company’s position as a leader in biofuels production.

“Together with the plants that are already operational in Italy and in the US, and with new biorefining plants under construction in Italy and Malaysia, the upcoming biorefining plant in Daesan will contribute to reach our 2030 target to increase our biorefining capacity to over five million tons per year, with the potential to produce more than two million tons per year of SAF.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/08/LG-Chem.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:51.080105

USGBC President and CEO Ryan LeGrand told Agri-Pulse that the name more accurately reflects the council’s work over the last 10 years, which has expanded to include export promotion for ethanol and high-protein distiller’s grains.

“The promotion of these products has been part of our identity and practice, but not in name,” LeGrand said. “We wanted to fully bring in the full portfolio of all the products that the Grains Council is handling into our name.”

Members voted on the name amendment at the organization’s 65th annual board of delegates meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday. LeGrand said the motion passed with “overwhelming” support.

In a press release published Monday, LeGrand said that the new name was also selected to capitalize on opportunities in the energy sector and reflect the organization’s work in both the grains and ethanol markets, while also preserving existing brand recognition.

“We're working in the SAF space, sustainable aviation fuel,” LeGrand said. “And then sustainable marine fuel is one that's starting to pop up on a lot of people's radars.”

Bioproducts encompass more than just ethanol, LeGrand said, adding that the new name should reflect the group’s work on the latest and future biofuels and, therefore, have staying power.

“It's a name that we're thinking will hold for another 30 years,” LeGrand said. “We looked at a lot of different options. And really landed on this one that we don't feel boxes us in to just one or two products.""

The name change is the culmination of a two-year process, LeGrand said, which included market research firms testing reactions to a name change.

The organization has been known as the U.S. Grains Council since 1998 – when it changed its name from the U.S. Feed Grains Council. That change was to expand the organization’s work to include coarse grains and co-products, the organization says.

The council was originally established in 1960 and has expanded to offer programs promoting exports across more than 50 countries and the European Union, with offices in nine countries.

Among the council’s victories have been its contribution to the establishment of Vietnam as a prominent U.S. export destination for U.S. grain. The council led one of the first farmer trade missions to the country in 1998, according to the organization’s website.

The plant, located in the coastal city of Seosan in South Chungcheong Province, is being developed by LG-Eni Biorefining, a joint venture between LG Chem and Italian energy company Eni. Completion is expected by 2027, the company said in a statement Monday.

Once operational, the facility will have the capacity to produce approximately 300,000 tons of HVO annually.

The renewable fuel — made by hydrogenating plant-based oils such as used cooking oil — is seen as a next-generation alternative to fossil fuels, offering significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while retaining high performance, especially in low temperatures.

In addition to its use as a diesel substitute, HVO can be further refined into sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel, and bio-naphtha. The latter is an increasingly valuable raw material in the petrochemical industry, particularly for producing ethylene, a core building block in plastics and other materials.

LG Chem plans to integrate bio-naphtha into its existing product lines to expand its portfolio of environmentally certified goods. These include components for electronics, automotive parts, hygiene products, and sporting equipment — all of which are manufactured in compliance with international sustainability standards.

“This facility will serve as a critical foundation for our transition toward low-carbon, high-efficiency materials,” said Shin Hak-cheol, CEO of LG Chem. “We will continue to drive technological innovation and commercialization in eco-friendly fuels and biomaterials to strengthen our global competitiveness.”

The project builds on a strategic partnership announced in December 2024 between LG Chem and Enilive, a subsidiary of Eni. The Italian firm already operates HVO production sites in Italy with a combined annual capacity of 2 million tons and maintains extensive supply networks across Europe, Africa, and Asia.

The recent announcement from SAS is one of those moments.

Their decision to bring the E195-E2 into their fleet is a strong endorsement of what the E2 family represents: performance, efficiency, and a clear path toward more sustainable operations. But it also speaks to something bigger — the growing momentum behind Embraer’s vision for the future of aviation.

One of the reasons airlines are turning to the E2 is its smart commonality. The E190-E2 and E195-E2 share 100% of parts, and both maintain 30% commonality with the first-generation E-Jets. That means less complexity, faster crew training, and lower maintenance costs — all without compromising performance.

And when it comes to sustainability, the E2, the most efficient small narrowbody, sets a new standard. Compared to the previous generation, it delivers up to 29% lower fuel burn and up to 68% less noise — real, measurable gains that are already making a difference. The aircraft has also been successfully tested with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and full certification is on the horizon. This isn’t just about meeting targets, it’s about leading responsibly, in ways that are being recognized by airlines and industry leaders around the world.

With Copenhagen Airport (CPH) serving as a strategic connectivity hub for SAS, the introduction of the E195-E2 not only enhances the airline’s ability to efficiently link Scandinavia and its international network but also unlocks future growth opportunities.

Lower gas prices. More energy independence. Stronger farms. Cleaner air. What’s not to like? These results are the proven outcomes of a groundbreaking bipartisan energy policy established twenty years ago, which continues to deliver benefits today.

Friday, Aug. 8 marks the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and we’re proud of RFA’s long history of developing, supporting, and resolutely defending this successful landmark policy. Created to promote U.S. energy independence, the RFS requires transportation fuel sold in the U.S. to contain annually increasing volumes of renewable fuels like ethanol and biomass-based diesel.

Click here for RFA’s new report summarizing the successes of the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The effects of this policy speak for themselves. It has helped lower fuel prices for American families, reduced our dependence on foreign oil, revitalized farm economies, and cut greenhouse gas emissions and tailpipe pollution—all while building a domestic energy sector that is cleaner and more competitive, diverse and resilient.

Like any major public policy, the RFS has certainly faced challenges, including fluctuating market dynamics, regulatory uncertainty, and evolving political and environmental priorities. But the core value proposition remains clear: By expanding the availability of American-made renewable fuels, the RFS supports our national interests economically and environmentally.

As the United States continues to chart a course toward a more secure and diversified energy future, the RFS can serve as a foundational model of a policy that bridges economic development and environmental responsibility. Far from being a relic of early-2000s energy policy, as some opponents like to claim, the RFS is a living example of how thoughtful, bipartisan legislation can deliver long-term, multi-dimensional benefits.

In celebrating two decades of the RFS, we also look ahead—to new innovations in production methods and fuel technologies that will continue to lower emissions, support farmers and deliver value to everyday Americans.

The plant is being built in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province, and is expected to be completed by 2027. Once operational, it will produce 300,000 tons of HVO each year, reports The Korea Herald.

HVO, also known as green diesel, is made by using hydrogen to process vegetable oils—mainly used cooking oil—into a cleaner fuel. While similar to biodiesel, HVO performs better in cold conditions and is more stable. Though it has slightly lower energy density than regular diesel, it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90 percent. HVO is used in areas like aviation fuel, car fuel, and as a chemical feedstock known as bio-naphtha.

LG Chem plans to use the HVO not only for biofuel but also as a raw material in its growing line of eco-friendly plastics. The company will convert bio-naphtha into high-quality plastics used in products like home appliances, vehicles, sports gear, and hygiene items.

“LG Chem is changing its business direction to focus more on low-carbon industries, aiming for long-term growth and better profits,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol. “We’ll keep investing in clean fuel and bio-based materials like HVO to stay globally competitive and meet customer expectations.”

The Seosan plant is a 50:50 joint project with Italian energy company Eni, which already produces 2 million tons of HVO each year in Italy and operates a large international supply network.

According to LG Chem, the new plant will help reduce dependence on imported raw materials, which the company has relied on until now for its chemical production.

The global demand for sustainable raw materials is rising quickly as businesses work to meet stricter environmental rules and increasing consumer interest in green products.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said:

Unite welcomes Heathrow’s plans and is pleased that the government continues to support building a third runway. Now ministers must put their words into action and ensure that construction begins as quickly as possible.

A third runway must be about more than just improving infrastructure – it must provide real material benefits to the thousands of workers who will build and run it. That means ensuring that the jobs created are well-paid and unionised.

Heathrow’s commitment to using UK produced steel is also welcome and must not be watered down. All national infrastructure projects should be using UK steel - no ifs, no buts.

Graham also highlighted the opportunity for Heathrow’s expansion to align with broader industrial and environmental strategies, particularly in the aviation sector’s transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

She criticised the lack of plans to convert the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland to SAF production, describing it as “outrageous” given the potential to preserve jobs and strengthen the UK’s industrial base.

Graham added:

As well as providing much needed support to our steel industry, the expansion at Heathrow must be accompanied by joined up thinking when it comes to the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) planes must soon start using.

Scotland’s Grangemouth refinery is ideally suited to transition to SAF production and it is frankly outrageous that there currently are no plans for this to happen when it would safeguard hundreds of jobs and bolster UK industry.

The company announced Monday that construction has started on the HVO plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province. Once completed in 2027, the facility is expected to produce 300,000 tons of HVO annually.

HVO, sometimes called green diesel, is produced by using hydrogen to break down vegetable oils, particularly used cooking oil, into smaller molecules. The concept is similar to biodiesel but the different chemistry of the resulting fuel means it is more stable and performs better at low temperatures.

While HVO has around 10 percent lower energy density than petroleum diesel, its proponents claim it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90 percent. It is used in various applications, including sustainable aviation fuel, car fuel and bio-naphtha — a versatile feedstock in the chemical industry.

LG Chem plans to utilize HVO not only for biofuel production but also to expand its eco-friendly plastics business, which it sees as a core driver of future growth. The company aims to convert bio-naphtha into high-performance plastics used in home appliances, automobiles, sporting goods and hygiene products.

“LG Chem is transforming its business portfolio toward low-carbon models, aiming for both sustainable growth and improved profitability,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.

“We will continue to drive technological innovation and commercialization in eco-friendly fuel and bio-resources, including HVO, to strengthen our global competitiveness and respond proactively to customer demand.”

The Seosan facility is being developed through a 50:50 joint venture with Italian energy firm Eni, which currently produces 2 million tons of HVO annually at its facilities in Italy and has an extensive global supply network.

An LG Chem official said the new facility will provide the company with more affordable access to bio-based feedstocks for its chemical manufacturing operations, which until now have largely relied on imports from global suppliers.

Competition to secure sustainable raw materials is intensifying worldwide, as companies seek to meet growing customer expectations and regulatory requirements.

According to Fortune Business Insights, the global HVO market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 8.2 percent, expanding from approximately $21.36 billion in 2025 to $36.86 billion by 2032.

Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.","Minahasa Selatan, Sulut, ruangenergi.com-Transisi energi di Indonesia tidak bisa hanya ditopang oleh satu pilar. Jika kita ingin mencapai target emisi nol bersih (net zero emission) pada 2060, maka strategi nasional harus ditopang oleh dua kaki utama: elektrifikasi berbasis energi terbarukan dan penguatan energi alternatif non-listrik seperti bioenergi, hidrogen, amonia, hingga carbon capture.

Sejauh ini, sektor elektrifikasi melalui PLN dan proyek-proyek berbasis EBT (Energi Baru Terbarukan) memang telah berjalan cukup progresif. Program 5 GW energi hijau dari PLN tiap tahun—dengan nilai investasi mencapai 6–7 miliar dolar AS—adalah langkah besar. Namun, kaki kedua, yakni sektor bioenergi, biofuel, bioetanol, green ammonia, hingga sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), masih belum mendapatkan ruang regulasi dan dukungan yang memadai.

Padahal, sektor non-listrik ini adalah kekuatan besar Indonesia. Pertamina, misalnya, memiliki kompetensi dan infrastruktur kuat dalam ekosistem biofuel dan energi molekular lainnya. Bioetanol, biodiesel, hingga green hydrogen bukan lagi sekadar opsi, tapi merupakan fondasi percepatan transisi energi di sektor transportasi, industri, dan maritim.

Direktur Proyek dan Operasi PT Pertamina NRE, Norman Ginting, menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan strategi nasional.

“Transisi energi harus dijalankan dengan pendekatan dua kaki. Elektrifikasi memang penting, tapi pengembangan bioenergi dan teknologi molekular tak kalah krusial untuk dekarbonisasi sektor-sektor yang tidak bisa dialiri listrik langsung,” ujar Norman kepada ruangenergi.com di sela-sela kunjungan ke PLTP Lahendong , Kamis(31/07/2025), di Sulawesi Utara.

Sayangnya, proses regulasi dan perencanaan energi nasional saat ini masih cenderung berat sebelah. Banyak potensi bioenergi belum tergarap secara optimal. Negara-negara produsen minyak seperti Brasil dan Arab Saudi bahkan telah bergerak lebih cepat melalui penguatan bioekonomi dan pengembangan SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Dua Lokomotif, Satu Tujuan

Norman bercerita, transisi energi tidak akan stabil jika hanya ditarik oleh satu lokomotif. PLN dan Pertamina harus menjadi dua mesin penggerak utama. Keduanya mewakili dua sisi strategi besar: elektrifikasi dan dekarbonisasi molekular. Pemerintah perlu menjamin bahwa kolaborasi antara keduanya berlangsung harmonis dan berimbang.

Namun dua kaki ini saja tidak cukup. Diperlukan peran aktif dari sektor swasta sebagai inovator, akselerator, sekaligus penyandang modal. Sayangnya, belum ada ekosistem kolaboratif yang benar-benar inklusif. Sektor swasta masih minim keterlibatannya dalam desain besar transisi energi nasional.

Regulasi Harus Dipercepat

Salah satu kunci utama adalah percepatan regulasi. Menurut Norman, dukungan terhadap bioenergi, green fuel, dan teknologi non-listrik seperti carbon capture dan green ammonia harus dituangkan ke dalam kebijakan yang jelas, insentif yang menarik, serta roadmap yang terukur dan realistis.

Regulasi yang kuat juga akan menjadi sinyal positif bagi para investor. Tanpa kepastian hukum dan kebijakan, baik investor lokal maupun global akan ragu untuk masuk. Transisi energi tidak boleh menjadi domain eksklusif BUMN saja—ini adalah proyek nasional yang harus melibatkan semua pihak.

Kesimpulan: Transisi Energi Butuh Akselerator, Kolaborator, dan Keseimbangan

Indonesia tidak bisa bertumpu pada satu kaki saja. Transisi energi akan goyah jika hanya berfokus pada elektrifikasi, tanpa memperkuat pilar bioenergi dan inovasi molekular lainnya. PLN dan Pertamina harus bergerak bersama sebagai dua lokomotif utama. Pemerintah harus menjadi akselerator, fasilitator, dan penyambung antar pelaku.

Dan yang paling penting: swasta harus dilibatkan secara penuh. Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.",https://www.ruangenergi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/norman1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:54.899321

This resurgence, however, must be contextualized within the broader dynamics of a post-pandemic aviation sector that is navigating both headwinds and tailwinds. For investors, the question is whether THAI's revival is a fleeting rebound or a durable repositioning for long-term growth.

Catalysts for the Surge: Restructuring, Resilience, and Reimagining

Thai Airways' journey from insolvency to recovery is a case study in strategic restructuring. By 2020, the airline had accumulated over 400 billion baht in debt, forcing it into bankruptcy protection. Yet, through a combination of debt-to-equity conversion, cost-cutting, and operational streamlining, THAI reduced its liabilities to 95 billion baht by Q1 2025. Shareholders' equity turned positive at 55 billion baht, and the company now holds 125 billion baht in cash—a stark contrast to its near-delisting status in 2021. The Central Bankruptcy Court's June 2025 termination of its rehabilitation plan marked the culmination of this effort, restoring investor confidence and triggering the stock's meteoric rise.

Analysts from Tisco and Yuanta Securities have underscored THAI's improved balance sheet and aggressive growth plans. With a 26.5% EBIT margin in Q1 2025—the highest among Asia-Pacific full-service carriers—and a projected EBITDA CAGR of 8.6% through 2027, the airline's financial health is no longer a liability but an asset. Strategic partnerships, including a Joint Business Agreement with Turkish Airlines and collaborations with Airports of Thailand (AOT), further strengthen its regional and global connectivity.

The Aviation Sector's Post-Pandemic Renaissance

The broader aviation industry is experiencing a nuanced recovery. Global passenger demand has not only rebounded to pre-pandemic levels but has surpassed them, with IATA forecasting 5.2 billion travelers in 2025—a 6.7% increase over 2024. This growth is fueled by pent-up demand, falling airfares (down 44% in real terms since 2014), and a shift toward leisure travel. However, airlines face challenges: fuel remains a 26.4% cost burden in 2025, and regulatory pressures, such as CORSIA compliance and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, add complexity.

THAI's position in this landscape is unique. Unlike budget carriers, which operate on razor-thin margins, THAI's focus on full-service operations allows it to leverage premium revenue streams while maintaining cost discipline. Its fleet modernization—45 Boeing 787s and 32 Airbus A321neos—enhances fuel efficiency and passenger experience, aligning with trends toward sustainability and comfort. Moreover, its 22% market share at Suvarnabhumi Airport positions it as a critical player in Thailand's ambition to become a regional aviation hub.

Long-Term Potential: A Structural Shift in Aviation

Investors must consider structural shifts in the industry. Airline profitability is increasingly tied to digital transformation and AI-driven revenue management. THAI's digital initiatives—enhanced booking platforms, “Cash + Miles” loyalty programs, and SCB credit card partnerships—position it to capture a larger share of the digital-first traveler market. Additionally, its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2065 and partnerships with PTT Global Chemical to integrate SAF align with global ESG trends, which are becoming non-negotiable for long-term capital.

The airline's expansion plans are equally compelling. By 2033, THAI aims to double its fleet from 78 to 150 aircraft, supported by strategic acquisitions and leases. This growth is not speculative: it is underpinned by a 12.3% year-on-year revenue increase in Q1 2025 and a 3%–13% revenue growth projection for 2025–2027. The airline's ability to balance capacity with demand—raising ASK by 21.1% in Q1 2025 while maintaining an 83.4% load factor—demonstrates operational agility.

Risks and Realities

No investment is without risk. Fuel prices, though currently favorable, remain volatile, and a spike could erode margins. Regulatory compliance costs, particularly for CORSIA and SAF, could also strain profitability. Additionally, the competitive landscape is intensifying, with low-cost carriers and regional players vying for market share. However, THAI's debt reduction, liquidity, and strategic partnerships mitigate these risks. The airline's debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37—a sharp decline from 20.66 in 2020—provides a buffer against external shocks.

Investment Thesis

For investors with a long-term horizon, THAI presents a compelling opportunity. The airline's financial restructuring has created a resilient foundation, while its strategic bets on fleet modernization, digital innovation, and sustainability align with global trends. Analysts' consensus target price of 10.40–10.70 baht suggests a 10–15% upside from current levels, but the broader recovery of the aviation sector could unlock even greater value.

However, patience is key. The stock's volatility reflects both optimism and uncertainty. Investors should monitor THAI's ability to execute its expansion plans, maintain cost discipline, and navigate regulatory challenges. Those who can stomach short-term fluctuations may find themselves positioned for a substantial payoff as the airline reclaims its role as a leader in the Asia-Pacific aviation ecosystem.

In a world where industries are being reshaped by technology, sustainability, and shifting consumer behavior, Thai Airways' revival is more than a story of survival—it is a blueprint for reinvention. For investors, the question is not whether the airline will recover, but how much further it can go.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:59.329102

In an era of shifting geopolitical alliances and rising multipolarity, Indonesia’s formal entry into BRICS in January 2025 marks more than just a diplomatic milestone. It signals a new strategic direction for Southeast Asia’s largest economy, particularly in its approach to global norms, alternative development finance, and sectoral cooperation, including civil aviation. After being officially declared a full member in January 2025, Indonesia was immediately accepted as the 10th member of BRICS. BRICS originally consisted of five countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — but has since expanded to include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, and Indonesia. This expanded group now represents over 45% of the world’s population and a significant share of global GDP. For Indonesia, its participation opens doors to enhanced economic, technological, and diplomatic networks that go beyond the traditional Western-led institutional framework.

Aviation Diplomacy in the BRICS Context

Aviation has long symbolized and facilitated sovereignty, mobility, and integration. For Indonesia — a vast archipelagic nation with over 17,000 islands — aviation is not a luxury but a lifeline. However, the sector faces persistent challenges: uneven infrastructure, reliance on foreign technology, skill gaps, and vulnerability to external economic shocks. By joining BRICS, Indonesia gains an alternative platform for forming partnerships and technical cooperation in aviation. This includes potential collaborations in areas such as air traffic management, satellite-based navigation systems, airport development, safety oversight, and personnel training. Indonesia’s diplomacy within BRICS can now focus on advocating for more inclusive global aviation governance — particularly within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where BRICS countries are increasingly coordinating their positions. With India and China already active in ICAO’s Council and technical panels, Indonesia could now join this emerging bloc to balance the influence of traditional powers.

Technology Transfer and Diversified Aviation Supply Chains

One of the key benefits of increased BRICS involvement is the potential for technology transfer and diversification of the supply chain. Indonesia currently imports much of its aviation technology — from radar systems to ground-based navigational aids — from Europe and the United States. While these systems are technically advanced, they come with restrictions: complex procurement standards, intellectual property limitations, and vendor lock-in, which can limit Indonesia’s independence. Through BRICS, Indonesia can access collaborative R&D programs with countries like China, India, and Russia, which are actively developing satellite navigation systems (e.g., Beidou, GAGAN, GLONASS), indigenous aircraft manufacturing initiatives, and airport infrastructure technologies suited to emerging markets. These countries are also more open to co-production, local assembly, and licensing agreements. Indonesia’s aerospace industry — led by PT Dirgantara Indonesia — can benefit from exposure to different design approaches and compatible standards. Such cooperation could lessen reliance on a few Western OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and establish a diverse supply network for both civilian and military aviation needs.

Infrastructure and Alternative Financing Opportunities

One of the persistent bottlenecks in Indonesia’s aviation sector has been infrastructure development, especially in remote and underdeveloped regions known as the 3T (Terdepan, Terpencil, dan Tertinggal).

Traditional financing routes — dominated by Bretton Woods institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank — often impose strict conditionalities related to governance, environmental impact, and fiscal prudence. While these safeguards are important, they can delay or disqualify projects that fail to meet rigid procedural benchmarks.

In contrast, BRICS’ New Development Bank (NDB) provides a more flexible financing mechanism. Although still maintaining safeguards, the NDB emphasizes local ownership, quicker disbursement timelines, and more adaptable terms of credit. This could be a game-changer for Indonesia’s efforts to fund regional airports, satellite-based air navigation systems, weather radar, and search and rescue (SAR) operations.

Moreover, access to NDB financing could allow Indonesia to pilot next-generation air mobility programs, including seaplane bases, unmanned aircraft corridors, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure — all within frameworks better suited to national development priorities.

Civil-Military Integration and Airspace Sovereignty

Another strategic dimension is the management of Indonesian airspace and Flight Information Regions (FIRs). Indonesia has long aspired to regain full control over several FIRs currently delegated to neighbouring states. Yet progress has been gradual, constrained by technical readiness, diplomatic complexity, and military-civil coordination challenges.

BRICS participation offers new avenues to learn from countries that have achieved FIR sovereignty under contested circumstances, such as India and China. Additionally, joint exercises, simulation training, and technology-sharing initiatives could support Indonesia’s push for integrated air surveillance and radar fusion systems, critical for both safety and national security.

Beyond FIRs, the issue of cybersecurity and data sovereignty in aviation is increasingly important. Partnering with BRICS countries could help Indonesia secure its aviation databases, aircraft tracking infrastructure, and communications networks from foreign interception or unilateral dependencies.

Challenges: Geopolitics, Standards, and Perception

Despite its many potential benefits, Indonesia’s BRICS participation is not without challenges, particularly in the aviation sector.

First, geopolitical alignments within BRICS can complicate consensus-building. For instance, the interests of Russia and China may not always align with those of Brazil, India, or South Africa, let alone Indonesia. In aviation diplomacy, where regulatory alignment is key, diverging priorities could slow progress on standard-setting and interoperability.

Second, while BRICS promotes alternative standards, the global aviation system remains anchored in frameworks defined by ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and other legacy institutions. Integrating BRICS-based practices into this system requires careful navigation to avoid misalignment or duplication.

Third, there is the challenge of international perception. Indonesia must reassure its traditional aviation partners, including the US, EU, and Japan, that BRICS participation complements rather than contradicts existing commitments. Diplomatically, Indonesia must uphold its “independent and active” foreign policy while navigating the optics of deeper ties with Russia or China, especially amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Recommendations: Strategic Steps Forward

To maximize the aviation-related gains from BRICS membership, Indonesia should consider the following steps:

Establish a BRICS Aviation Cooperation Desk within the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate sectoral initiatives and track joint programs.

Leverage NDB for pilot projects, especially in outer island airports, disaster response aviation systems, and satellite navigation services.

Forge technical partnerships with Indian and Chinese air navigation service providers to accelerate domestic capacity-building in air traffic control and aeronautical data services.

Promote joint ventures involving PT Dirgantara Indonesia and BRICS aerospace firms for component manufacturing and aircraft retrofitting.

Develop a long-term aviation diplomacy roadmap that aligns BRICS priorities with Indonesia’s ICAO and ASEAN obligations.

Maintain transparency and multilateral balance to prevent over-dependence on any one bloc or funding source.

Champion inclusive aviation governance, using BRICS as a platform to advocate for fairer global rules on carbon markets, passenger rights, and safety oversight.

A Broader Strategic Vision

Indonesia’s entry into BRICS is a reminder that global governance is evolving. For too long, the developing world’s aviation needs have been addressed through a top-down model dominated by the Global North. With BRICS, Indonesia can help rewrite this narrative — not through confrontation, but through constructive collaboration.

In a world where connectivity is currency, aviation becomes both a tool of influence and an index of inclusion. Indonesia must now rise to the challenge of transforming this new diplomatic opportunity into tangible progress for its skies and its citizens.",https://geotimes.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/geotimes-Indonesias-BRICS-Shift-Opens-New-Runways-for-Global-Air-Cooperation.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:57:34.127918

The current India-US trade relationship is facing renewed strain following the United States’ imposition of a 25 per cent blanket tariff on all Indian imports, effective, August 1, 2025. This move, driven by concerns over India’s high tariffs on agricultural and dairy products, its continued engagement with Russian oil and defense markets, has disrupted the momentum of bilateral trade negotiations aimed at expanding trade to USD 500 billion by 2030. As a result, talks have stalled and key Indian export sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, auto components, and electronics face heightened vulnerability in the US market.

Amidst these tensions, India, the US, and Brazil continue to collaborate through the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), launched during India’s G20 presidency in 2023. The alliance is focused on advancing biofuel adoption, including ethanol blending, sustainable aviation fuels, and flex-fuel technologies. India’s ambitions to reach 20 per cent ethanol blending by 2025 align closely with Brazil’s mature biofuel ecosystem and the US’s technological leadership. While the tariff dispute underscores geopolitical and trade frictions, the trilateral cooperation on clean fuels remains a strategic area of convergence, offering a counterbalance to growing protectionist trends, reinforcing shared commitments to energy security and low-carbon growth.

The Global Biofuels Alliance aspires to ensure sustainable biofuel production across the Global South, but can it remain unaffected by the sudden shift in global trade dynamics?

Why biofuels?

Biofuel, as most would understand, is a fuel that is made from plant material or animal waste. On the strategic level for India, the GBA is an extension of the International Solar Alliance, where these two countries are jointly attempting to shape global energy norms from the perspective of developing countries. The initiators of the GBA see this as another strategic step in India’s international relations game plan of promoting the effort to establish energy norms globally from a developing nation’s perspective. For Brazil, it will be a chance to reassert its leadership position in the bioenergy market, more so when completing its outreach for diversification of diplomatic avenues into ties with Global South countries and beyond. It is most likely that the tango between India and Brazil plays out at many levels.

Biofuels are a critical element in the global strategy to fight climate change. They help lower GHG emissions, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, promote sustainable land use, support rural economies, and are necessary for achieving national and international climate goals, especially in hard-to-abate sectors of the economy. The India Brazil collaboration on biofuels is being intensified considering that this partnership, erstwhile on the periphery of biofuel diplomacy, is currently placed at the heart of larger geopolitical shift concerning energy security and climate protection, where a meeting of urban and rural people takes place. This changing focus has put biofuels at the centre of an energy renaissance in the rural world. The people in this narrative are doing a tango and getting down to brass tacks in biosphere unison.

Ethanol, a biofuel primarily derived from sugarcane, is Brazil’s remedy when its hydroelectric plants are under duress, and it is becoming the world’s largest large-scale sugarcane ethanol energy economy. Brazil grows sugarcane in its off-season, allowing both ethanol and sugar production to provide more than 30 per cent of the nation’s car fuel consumption through ethanol. Biofuels can boost rural incomes by creating demand for crops, generating jobs, and encouraging investment in agriculture. They support energy security and climate resilience. However, without safeguards, they may risk food security and environmental sustainability. Will any biofuel model in India based on ethanol mixed with petrol be distinguishable from Brazil?

High Ambition in Policy

Both the countries have high-blending mandates at the policy level. Brazil has had the Fuels of the Future law in force since October 2024, bringing a gradual increase in biodiesel blending, with blending rates increasing from 14 per cent at the start of 2025 to 20 per cent in 2030. At the same time, the Indian Government is furthering its ethanol-blending program with the imposition of a 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol as an interim target, whilst placing compressed biogas and sustainable aviation fuel as key pillars of its energy portfolio. These mandates have strong regulatory frameworks and financial incentives backing them, and they send a signal for medium — and long-term commitment to biofuels as important parts of the national energy policy.

Indian technologists are tapping Brazilian researchers and policymakers in sugarcane-based ethanol and second-generation biofuels to come and work in India and deepen this partnership. However, even as India uses feedstocks like rice straw, maize, and used cooking oil to amplify its biofuel output, the partnership strengthens Brazil’s soybean, oil, and sugarcane portfolio, creating enough diversification to withstand global supply shocks. Now, the two are looking at joint ventures in India and Brazil to build picobiorefinerías or bio-refineries, with Indian companies pumping money into Brazilian infrastructure deals and the other way around. Petrobras, Brazil’s mammoth state-owned energy company, has committed $600 million to biodiesel and biomethane projects in its 2025 derecho plan, while Indian companies like ONGC Videsh and Bharat Petroleum are getting into the business of upstream oil and bioenergy in Brazil.

The biofuel partnership between Brazil and India serves as a case study in South-South cooperation, showing how two developing countries can work together to solve mutual problems in a respectful and cooperative way. Both countries have a lot of experience dealing with the kinds of energy and rural development problems that many African countries face. They are using that experience to promote biofuels as part of a rural development and climate resilience toolkit for those countries. Brazil’s renewed engagement with African countries like Angola and Nigeria, coupled with India’s growing presence in East Africa, allows for a parallel in energy diplomacy that could benefit the trilateral cooperation of the two countries with African nations.

Political Complexities

The dance has its missteps, and the question of feedstock sustainability is no exception. Brazil’s dependence on soybean oil — over 70 per cent of biodiesel in commercial application in Brazil — has caused some raised eyebrows with regard to the Amazon and Cerrado. In the meantime, India is trying to juggle food security with expanding on biofuels as ethanol production from sugarcane and maize is ramped up. Politics about sourcing feedstock in amounts suitable for the kinds of biofuels meant to be of assistance are complex and likely only to heat up further. After all, trade is not just import and export; it is also a matter of conserving and expanding political power.

The world of biofuels knows no friction. It’s a mini-maelstrom of pricing shenanigans, currency swings, and regulatory inequities. The pricing scenario for biodiesel in Brazil, the second-largest producer of biodiesel in the world, has been nothing short of unprecedented. High prices of biodiesel were witnessed in late 2024, garnering a lot of attention as prices went up to about 30 per cent compared to the previous year because of Government mandates and the new crushing dynamics of the soybean industry in South America. In Brazil, biodiesel producers were paid R$6115/m3, whereas the biodiesel sector of India seemed to be frozen, not due to bad weather but due to traffic congestion caused by ethanol production and excessive vehicles on the road.

The evolving India-Brazil biofuels alliance is emerging as a compelling response to the rapidly shifting global energy and climate geopolitics. At a time when dominant economies like China are championing electric vehicles and synthetic fuels, and the United States is reshaping its clean energy architecture through the Inflation Reduction Act, Brazil and India represent a distinct alternative. Rooted in the principles of developmental equity and south-south cooperation, their collaboration articulates a vision of green industrialisation that is inclusive, pragmatic, and reflective of the needs of emerging economies.

What Next?

As the world’s energy landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and competitive, the India-Brazil partnership offers a narrative grounded in mutual resilience, technology exchange, and long-term sustainability. It moves beyond mere trade dynamics to define a new axis of energy diplomacy in the Global South. The forthcoming BRICS Summit in Brasilia presents an opportunity to strengthen this narrative, especially by positioning biofuels within broader discussions on climate finance, innovation, and south-led green transitions. A particularly promising area of collaboration is the aviation sector, which is under growing pressure to decarbonise. With no viable electrification or hydrogen-based alternatives currently feasible for large-scale aviation, Sustainable Aviation Fuel has emerged as a key enabler. Capable of reducing emissions by up to 80 per cent, SAF offers a practical decarbonisation pathway but global production remains limited. Here, Brazil’s advanced ethanol infrastructure and India’s expanding renewable energy base provide a synergistic foundation for joint SAF development, potentially establishing the Global South as a major contributor to aviation sustainability.

The India-Brazil biofuels alliance is thus more than a policy framework, it is a declaration of shared intent and strategic alignment. It signals the emergence of a bilateral compact that not only boosts trade and energy security but also contributes to shaping global norms on sustainable fuels.

As countries contemplate pathways to a low-carbon future, Brazil’s biofuel legislation serves as a pragmatic model an invitation to join a new era of biomass-based energy with clear rules and shared benefits. Moving forward, the alliance must focus on institutionalising its cooperation through joint research platforms, investment in SAF and ethanol infrastructure, and coordinated engagement in multilateral forums such as the Global Biofuels Alliance and BRICS. By leading with ambition and inclusivity, India and Brazil can redefine the contours of global biofuel leadership transforming their bilateral dance into a blueprint for the world.

As the energy transition accelerates, the winners and losers will be determined not by crude prices alone, but by the evolving arithmetic of refinery utilization and sector divergence.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly refinery utilization rate is more than a dry statistical report—it is a seismic barometer of sectoral shifts in the energy transition. As of August 2025, the data reveals a striking trend: utilization rates climbed steadily from 90.5% on August 2 to 93.3% by August 30. While this appears to signal robust refining activity, it masks a deeper structural divergence. A closer examination of historical patterns, fuel price dynamics, and sectoral interdependencies reveals why a utilization rate miss (i.e., a deviation from expected trends) could trigger bearish pressure on the Oil & Gas sector while creating bullish momentum for Passenger Airlines.

The Bear Case: Refinery Utilization and Oil & Gas Margins

Refinery utilization rates are intrinsically tied to refining margins, often measured by the ""crack spread""—the difference between crude oil input costs and the value of refined products like gasoline and diesel. When utilization rates rise, crack spreads typically widen, reflecting strong demand for refined fuels. However, in 2025, this dynamic is being upended.

The recent peak in utilization (93.3%) coincides with a structural decline in demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV) adoption, now exceeding 18% of U.S. auto sales, has eroded gasoline consumption. Refiners, once flush with margins during peak utilization periods, are now grappling with overcapacity. For example, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have reported declining orders for refining equipment upgrades, as operators prioritize mothballing older facilities over expansion.

A utilization rate miss—such as a sudden drop below 90%—would exacerbate this bearish narrative. It would signal weakening domestic demand for refined products, further compressing crack spreads and squeezing refining profits. This dynamic is already evident in the Oil & Gas sector's underperformance: the S&P 500 Energy Index has lagged the broader market by 12% year-to-date, as investors price in the long-term erosion of refining margins.

The Bull Case: Airlines and the Fuel Price Tailwind

While the Oil & Gas sector faces headwinds, Passenger Airlines are poised to benefit from the same shifts. As refining utilization stabilizes or declines, gasoline and diesel prices at the pump have remained subdued relative to crude oil prices. This has created a favorable tailwind for airlines, whose fuel costs typically account for 20-30% of operating expenses.

The EIA's historical data underscores this inverse relationship. In 2015, when utilization rates hit 95.1%, gasoline prices spiked $0.36 above crude-linked forecasts, directly cutting into airline margins. By contrast, 2025's utilization rates (93.3%) have kept refining margins in check, with gasoline prices aligning closely to crude oil prices. This has allowed airlines like Delta and American Airlines to lock in fuel savings through hedging strategies, improving net margins by 4-6 percentage points.

Moreover, the energy transition has created a unique arbitrage opportunity. As refiners reduce capital expenditures on ICE infrastructure, they are shifting focus to hydrogen and biofuel projects—sectors where airlines are already investing. For instance, United Airlines' recent $1.5 billion investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is now more economically viable in a low-refining-margin environment.

Strategic Portfolio Reallocation: The Energy Transition Playbook

The divergence between these sectors demands a strategic rebalancing of energy-related portfolios. Here's how investors can capitalize:

Underweight Oil & Gas Refiners: Refiners operating in overutilized regions (e.g., the Gulf Coast at 93.5% utilization) are increasingly exposed to margin compression. Companies like Valero and Marathon Petroleum are facing pressure to divest non-core assets, which could trigger further valuation declines.

Overweight Industrial Conglomerates: As refining activity shifts toward retrofitting and decarbonization, industrial firms like Caterpillar and 3M are seeing renewed demand for equipment upgrades and emissions-control technologies. These firms are positioned to outperform as refiners prioritize compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates.

Long-Term Positioning in Airlines: With fuel costs stabilizing and demand for air travel rebounding post-pandemic, airlines are entering a phase of margin expansion. Investors should consider ETFs like the iShares U.S. Airlines ETF (IAA) or individual stocks with strong hedging strategies.

Short-Term Bets on Energy Transition Plays: The shift from refining to decarbonization creates opportunities in hydrogen infrastructure and carbon capture. Companies like Plug Power and Occidental Petroleum are set to benefit from policy-driven capital flows.

The Unseen Thread: EIA Data as a Sector Rotation Signal

The EIA's refinery utilization data is not just a backward-looking metric—it is a forward-looking signal for sector rotations. A utilization rate miss (e.g., a sustained drop below 90%) would likely accelerate capital outflows from Oil & Gas and into energy transition plays. Conversely, a rate above 93% would reinforce the bear case for refiners but could temporarily benefit automakers reliant on ICE demand.

Investors must monitor this data alongside other indicators, such as the EIA's weekly crude oil inventory reports and the American Petroleum Institute's (API) refining activity assessments. The interplay between these metrics will shape the next phase of the energy transition, offering both risks and opportunities for those attuned to the sectoral shifts.

In a world where fuel price dynamics and utilization rates dictate sectoral fortunes, the EIA's weekly report is no longer just a footnote in energy markets—it is a roadmap for strategic portfolio reallocation. As the energy transition accelerates, the winners and losers will be determined not by crude prices alone, but by the evolving arithmetic of refinery utilization and sector divergence.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 16:56:07.853530

Ökologische Wende: Zusammen mit Partnern treibt Japan Airlines die Einführung von Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) voran. Das innovative Projekt zur CO2-Reduktion könnte langfristig nicht nur die Umweltbilanz verbessern, sondern auch Kosten senken.

Domestischer Reiseboom steht bevor

Die kommenden Wochen könnten weitere positive Impulse bringen: Während der traditionellen Obon-Ferien zwischen dem 8. und 17. August verzeichnet Japan Airlines bereits jetzt hohe Buchungszahlen für Inlandsflüge. Der Reiseboom dürfte die nächsten Quartalszahlen zusätzlich stützen.

Doch nicht alles läuft nach Plan: Die neuen US-Zölle ab 7. August belasten zwar nicht direkt die Airline, könnten aber die allgemeine Stimmung am japanischen Markt trüben. Für Japan Airlines stellt sich nun die Frage: Kann das Unternehmen seine positive Dynamik trotz makroökonomischer Gegenwinde fortsetzen? Die jüngsten Ergebnisse geben jedenfalls Anlass zu vorsichtigem Optimismus.

In a YouTube video posted by Radia, Lundstrom explains that wind turbines installed in offshore wind farms have blades that can exceed 100 meters (345ft) in length.
In Radia’s video explainer, Lundstrom adds: “The turbines are simply too big to get under bridges, through tunnels, around curves.” Why are bigger wind turbines important?

Founded in 2016 by the aerospace engineer Mark Lundstrom, Boulder-based Radia is working to build the WindRunner, a plane big enough to transport super-size wind turbines to onshore locations.

In a YouTube video posted by Radia, Lundstrom explains that wind turbines installed in offshore wind farms have blades that can exceed 100 meters (345ft) in length.

However, turbines built on land are typically limited to blades of about 70 meters 230ft - a problem chiefly caused by the challenge of transporting the blades along roads not built for such enormous cargo.

Turbines “simply too big” for road infrastructure

“It’s the inability to move big things that is basically the barrier that prevents us from super-sizing onshore wind turbines,” Lundstrom told an interview with the BBC this week.

In Radia’s video explainer, Lundstrom adds: “The turbines are simply too big to get under bridges, through tunnels, around curves.”

Why are bigger wind turbines important?

By enabling the installation of larger wind turbines in on-shore locations, wind farms’ productivity can be multiplied, notes the U.S. Department of Energy.

“Larger rotor diameters allow wind turbines to sweep more area, capture more wind, and produce more electricity,” the agency says.

“A turbine with longer blades will be able to capture more of the available wind than shorter blades - even in areas with relatively less wind.”

WindRunner dimensions - length, wingspan, payload:

According to Radia, the WindRunner will be 365ft in length, with a 261ft wingspan. Compare that to the Boeing 747, which measures a comparatively paltry 250ft in length and has a 224ft wingspan.

The WindRunner will have a payload volume of 272,000ft³, which the company notes is some 12 times greater than that of the Boeing 747.

The WindRunner’s length and payload would also outstrip those of the Antonov An-225 Mriya, so far the largest airplane ever built.

Built in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, the An-225 was 275ft long, with a payload bay some six times smaller. The craft was destroyed in 2022, during fighting in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Designed with a flying range of 1,200 miles, the WindRunner will run on sustainable aviation fuel, Radia says, and will be able to land on short, unpaved runways.

“It has the capability of […] landing on dirt within a wind farm,” Lundstrom says. “By doing this, we will be able to create the path to the cheapest energy in the world.”

Per Aerospace Global News, Radia aims to complete its first WindRunner in 2028, before pressing the craft into full service by 2030.

“The airline industry does in my view have a serious intent to meet net-zero targets but faces increased challenges in doing so”, John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, said. “Alternative technologies are being pushed further out, which means an increased emphasis on the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which is still in limited supply.”

The delays may also create another obstacle to the planned expansion of Heathrow. The airport said on August 1 that it would “only deliver expansion in a way that is consistent with net zero 2050”. And some analysts believe the hold-up increases the chances of a challenge to Boeing and Airbus from new entrants more eager to take up the environmental mantle.

Aviation is estimated by the International Energy Agency to account for 2.5 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, with a slightly greater — 4 per cent — contribution to global warming thanks to the creation of vapour trails. In the UK, it has a greater share of direct emissions: 9 per cent this year, according to the Climate Change Committee, the government’s independent advisers. That share is forecast to grow to 11 per cent by 2030 and 16 per cent by 2035.

That global emissions share is also likely to increase. After a severe decline during the pandemic, flights are now increasing fast. Iata, the airline trade body, has said passenger numbers will grow nearly 6 per cent this year to just under 5 billion and could hit 16 billion by 2050. As other energy-intensive industries find ways to cut their carbon emissions — electricity replacing blast furnaces in steel, new technology for making cement, and electric vehicles for land transport — aviation’s share of total CO₂ could, by some estimates, rise to 20 per cent by 2050.

Carbon-cutting technology for aviation is proving slow to arrive. Most experts think battery-power will be limited to small commuter aircraft, but there are high hopes for hydrogen. Airbus had invested significantly, including a plan to test a hydrogen fuel-cell engine on a modified A380 superjumbo. But it paused work in February, saying progress on “key enablers”, in particular the production of large amounts of hydrogen from renewable energy, was “slower than anticipated”.

Boeing has been less interested in hydrogen, but said the X-66A could lead to a 10 per cent reduction in emissions. When it cancelled the project it said it would instead concentrate on other designs for thinner, more efficient wings.

Neither manufacturer appears in any rush to bring out radical designs. Airbus’s plan to replace its bestselling A320 family of aircraft envisages something familiar to passengers today, albeit with engines that can be powered by conventional fuels or “sustainable” replacements. That plane is unlikely to enter service until 2035 at the earliest, and probably much later.

Boeing, which has been beset by a series of crises in the past year, also appears to be in no hurry. At its quarterly results on July 29, chief executive Kelly Ortberg said: “I don’t think the market is ready yet for a new airplane.”

• Boeing 737 Max 8: which airlines use the plane and is it safe?

Slow progress on alternative technology means airlines’ hopes rest on the rapid introduction of sustainable fuels — hydrocarbons not pumped from the ground, but made from plants or re-used oils, or directly synthesised. However, the current supply is tiny — a mere 0.53 per cent of total aviation fuel worldwide last year, according to Air Transport Action Group (Atag), which brings together airlines, airports and aerospace manufacturers.

Atag’s Waypoint 2050 report concluded that making enough sustainable fuel to hit net zero would require the construction of 5,000 refineries, costing $1.45 trillion over the next 25 years. IBA, the aviation consultancy, has forecast production of sustainable fuels will hit 18 million tonnes a year by 2035 — but that will be 23 million tonnes short of demand.

Environmental campaigners are scornful. “The only serious remedy [to increasing CO₂ emissions] is demand restraint,” Dr Douglas Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said. “Everything else — the nonsensical offset schemes, the utopian technology forecasts and now the implausible optimism surrounding ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel — is primarily a collection of elaborate misdirection techniques.”

If aviation’s emissions do grow as a proportion of the total, Airbus and Boeing could face societal pressure to do more. Nick Cunningham, managing partner at Agency Partners, an aerospace analysis firm, recently published a note on how “complacency” on decarbonisation posed an “existential risk” to the companies.

Cunningham said planemakers were understandably reluctant to make large investments in new technology. “Boeing does not at the moment have the financial resources to develop an all-new aircraft. Airbus has reason to be wary because some of its development programmes — the A380 and the A400M for example — ended up way over budget.”

• Net zero by 2050 struggles with reality

The Chinese aerospace industry could be a potential challenger. There are now 16 Comac C919s, the first modern Chinese airliner, in service, with a second, larger aircraft, the C929, expected to begin commercial flights towards the end of the decade. Cunningham said, however, that carbon reduction is not China’s main goal. “There could be a challenge from China, but for the moment it is concentrating on replacing imports of western aerospace equipment,” he said.

One potential rival to the Airbus-Boeing hegemony is JetZero, a California-based company set up in 2021. It has ambitious plans to build a radical new type of passenger aircraft: a blended wing body, where the wings and fuselage are one smooth shape. The Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber, used by the US Air Force in the recent attacks against Iran, is such a design.

JetZero claims its design could cut emissions in half compared to conventional designs. It has secured backing from two big US carriers, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, including a commitment from them to buy aircraft. The USAF has awarded it a development contract for a potential new transport aircraft.

“JetZero is extremely interesting,” Cunningham said. “The backing it has from airlines and the air force give it credibility, and it has very ambitious production plans. Its design would be more efficient than conventional aircraft, and crucially it would lend itself to a switch to hydrogen fuel when that is adopted.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F7a76cc80-d40b-4ce7-a770-c0b6a20a95b8.jpg?crop=2325%2C1308%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:18.379222

Net zero rules introduced by Sir Keir Starmer mean planes must be filled with at least 2 per cent sustainable fuel, which will rise to 10 per cent followed by 22 per cent by 2040.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate means airlines that do not comply with the green policy face heavy fines likely to be passed on in part to passengers.

Costs associated with the new levy are expected to reach £4.5 billion by 2035, according to a new analysis by Public First.

This works out at £12.79 per passenger per flight leaving the UK, adding £51.16 to the average overseas holiday taken by a family of four.

The impact of the policy is expected to hit Britons as soon as 2027, with its cost hitting £200 million in that year.

‘Ludicrous net stupid zero’

By 2030, this figure will have ballooned to £1.5 million, the equivalent to £4.64 per passenger per flight – making a holiday for a family of four £18.56 more expensive.

Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, told The Telegraph: “This is yet another egregious tax on working citizens to pay for the ludicrous net stupid zero. A Reform government will scrap all this nonsense.”

Greg Smith, a Tory transport minister, said: “Labour said the transition to green aviation would cost pennies but now families are being hit with soaring ticket prices to fund Ed Miliband’s net zero experiment.

“It’s not just weekend getaways being priced out. It’s regional airports under threat, tourism on the ropes, and British families paying the price for Labour’s ideological fantasy.

“The truth is net zero by 2050 is impossible without bankrupting our country and Labour’s plan to chase it will ground British families before it ever lands.”

80pc cost could be passed to consumers

The Government’s own impact assessment of the green mandate found that as much as 80 per cent of its cost could be passed on to consumers.

Labour claims the pledge to use more sustainable fuel will support thousands of jobs while cutting the UK’s transport emissions on the way to becoming a “clean energy superpower”.

The figures come as ministers were urged to relax red tape that means SAF cannot currently be made from non-food grade British-grown wheat.

Phil New led the Government’s independent review into the future of SAF and urged it to consider British bioethanol as a credible and scalable option.

Mr New said: “Ethanol made from British-grown milling wheat, which would otherwise be exported as animal feed, can be processed into SAF in a way that meets the emissions reductions required by the UK’s standards.

‘Home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry’

“This is a real opportunity to create a home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry that supports British agriculture, strengthens fuel security and helps us meet our climate ambitions.”

Ben Hackett, managing director at Vivergo Fuels, added: “The UK has the capability today to produce sustainable aviation fuel from home-grown non-food grade wheat – supporting British farmers, reducing carbon emissions, and improving our energy security. But outdated regulations are blocking this from happening.

“It makes no sense that ethanol from British wheat can be blended into petrol for cars, but not used to make jet fuel, especially when other countries are already moving ahead with this technology.”

The analysis by Public First also found the UK could require the output of seven large-scale bioethanol plants by 2035 to meet growing domestic demand for SAF.

Industry leaders fear that excessive reliance on imported cooking oil could hinder progress in growing domestic demand.

Liz Webster, the founder of Save British Farming, said: “British farmers should be able to grow British wheat to power British planes.

“It’s a win-win, unless we cave to foreign pressure and let down British farmers yet again.”

British farmers facing disaster

Earlier this year, a leaked memo claimed British farmers were facing disaster because of Sir Keir’s trade deal with Donald Trump.

Under the deal struck by Sir Keir, which has not yet come into force, the US will be able to supply Britain with some 1.4 billion litres of duty-free ethanol.

Vivergo runs the UK’s largest bioethanol plant at Saltend in East Yorkshire, but has warned this will have to close without help given from the Government.

This would in turn represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who provide grain to the site.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The move to greener fuels has been designed to cut emissions while protecting both industry and consumers from excessive cost increases. Any impact on ticket prices is expected to be within the range of normal year to year changes in air fares.

“Our SAF mandate sets out ambitious but achievable targets. Our approach to growing the UK SAF industry will also support skilled jobs in every part of the country, while boosting economic growth and reducing our emissions.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/08/03/TELEMMGLPICT000434587637_17542299168040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:23.074738

One of those countries, Japan, has been one of the U.S.’s most dependable trading partners. That deal was announced July 23 and the White House also announced a pact with Indonesia on July 22.

Japan

Japan will invest $550 billion directed by the U.S. to rebuild and expand core American industries, the White House said. The funds, at Trump’s direction, will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s strategic industrial base in five core areas: Energy infrastructure and production; semiconductor manufacturing and research; critical minerals mining, processing, and refining; pharmaceutical and medical production; and commercial and defense shipbuilding.

As part of the agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate. The White House believes the agreement will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan with an enforceable and transparent trade policy.

The agreement also calls for increased market access for agricultural producers. Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75% with a major expansion of import quotas. Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The agreement was applauded by U.S. Meat Export Federation and CEO Dan Halstrom.

“USMEF greatly appreciates the Trump administration with Japan, reassuring and expanding opportunities in the No. 2 export destination for U.S. beef and pork,” Halstrom said. “In President Trump’s first term, the critical U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement was reached, returning U.S. red meat to a level playing field in Japan reinforcing its position as an extremely reliable market.”

According to the information released by the White House, the new agreement focuses on reinforcing the long-term economic partnership between the two countries, which for decades has delivered tremendous benefits for U.S. livestock and meat industries and for Japanese consumers, importers and customers, he added.

Indonesia

The Republic of Indonesia agreed to a framework for negotiating an agreement on reciprocal trade, the White House announced. That agreement builds on a longstanding agreement that was first signed in 1996.

Indonesia will eliminate an approximately 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Indonesia.

The U.S. will reduce to 19% the reciprocal tariff that was started on April 2 on goods originating in Indonesia, and identify certain commodities that are not naturally available or domestically produced in the U.S. for a further reduction in the reciprocal tariff rate.

In the agricultural front, the two countries agreed to address and prevent barriers to U.S. food and agricultural products in the Indonesia market, including exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all import licensing regimes, including commodity balance requirements. It provides permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin designation for all applicable U.S. plant products. The agreement recognizes U.S. regulatory oversight, including the listing of all U.S. meat, poultry and dairy facilities and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

Halstrom said Indonesia is a market with incredible potential and could mean as much as $250 million annually for U.S. beef.

“But today, exports are minimal due to numerous trade barriers,” he said. “We are encouraged to see that the highlights detailed in the U.S.-Indonesia joint statement include resolving key issues such as import licensing, the commodity balance policy and Indonesia’s onerous plant-by-plant approval process.

“For both U.S. beef and U.S. pork, these longstanding restrictions have limited exports to Indonesia. Indonesian importers and consumers are demanding U.S. red meat, and we look forward to the swift conclusion of these negotiations and expanded export opportunities.”

The White House also announced that Indonesia has agreed to purchase soybeans, soybean meal, wheat and cotton with an estimated value of $4.5 billion.

Final Verdict The UK bioethanol industry is a cautionary tale for investors: even well-intentioned renewable energy projects can crumble under the weight of geopolitical decisions.","The UK bioethanol industry is at a crossroads, and investors in renewable energy infrastructure tied to regional agricultural supply chains need to tread carefully. Recent trade policy shifts, particularly the May 2025 U.S.-UK trade deal, have exposed vulnerabilities that could unravel decades of progress in decarbonizing transport and supporting domestic agriculture. For those eyeing the green energy sector, this is a stark reminder that political decisions can be as volatile as stock prices—and just as dangerous if ignored.

The Trade Deal's Blow to Domestic Producers

The removal of the 19% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports, granting duty-free access to 1.4 billion liters annually, has created a perfect storm for UK producers. With U.S. ethanol priced 30–40% lower than UK-produced wheat-based ethanol, companies like Vivergo Fuels and Ensus are staring down the barrel of insolvency. These plants, which process millions of tonnes of UK wheat and corn annually, are not just factories—they're linchpins in a regional agricultural ecosystem.

Consider the ripple effects: Vivergo alone sources wheat from 4,000 farms, producing 420 million liters of ethanol and 420,000 tonnes of high-protein animal feed. If it shuts down, farmers lose a critical market, and the livestock sector faces higher feed costs. The same applies to Ensus in Teesside. This isn't just about energy; it's about food security, rural economies, and the circular economy.

The Structural Weakness of Renewable Energy Supply Chains

The UK's reliance on bioethanol for its Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates is now at risk. The government's plan to increase petrol blending from E10 to E15 by 2026 hinges on domestic production. But with U.S. ethanol flooding the market, that mandate could backfire, accelerating the collapse of local producers.

The SAF mandate—requiring 22% SAF in jet fuel by 2040—is equally precarious. The alcohol-to-jet pathway, which depends on domestic ethanol, will struggle without stable feedstock supplies. Meanwhile, the government's focus on waste-based SAF (like HEFA) overlooks the strategic value of wheat and corn-based ethanol. Investors should ask: Can a country that's losing its ethanol plants realistically meet its climate targets?

Government Support: A Temporary Bandage, Not a Cure

The UK government has offered a £75 million annual subsidy to Vivergo and Ensus through 2026, along with promises to boost ethanol blending mandates. But these measures are stopgaps, not long-term solutions. The subsidies come with strings attached—specifically, they're tied to meeting blending targets that may become unachievable if U.S. imports dominate the market.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's team has pledged “close engagement” with the industry, but time is running out. Vivergo Fuels is already warning of closure by September 13, 2025, unless urgent action is taken. This uncertainty makes the sector a high-risk bet for investors.

Investment Implications: Where to Watch

For investors, the key takeaway is to avoid overexposure to UK bioethanol companies without clear policy protection. Vivergo Fuels (parent company ABF Sugar) and Ensus are underperformers unless the government intervenes aggressively. Instead, consider hedging with companies in the waste-based SAF sector or renewable infrastructure less tied to agricultural feedstocks.

Monitor the following:

1. Policy Developments: Will the UK raise tariffs on U.S. ethanol or implement a carbon border adjustment mechanism to level the playing field?

2. Blending Mandates: Can the E15 mandate drive enough domestic demand to sustain producers?

3. SAF Incentives: Will the government shift subsidies toward alcohol-to-jet pathways to preserve ethanol supply chains?

The Bigger Picture: Trade vs. Climate Goals

This crisis underscores a fundamental tension in renewable energy policy: the clash between free trade and climate resilience. The UK's pursuit of trade concessions (e.g., steel and car export quotas) came at the expense of its bioethanol industry. Investors should watch how this plays out—will the government prioritize climate goals over trade deals in the future? The answer will shape the next decade of green energy investments.

In the short term, the UK bioethanol sector is a ticking time bomb. But for those willing to navigate the political turbulence, there's potential in companies that adapt to a post-ethanol world—whether through diversification into SAF or partnerships with agricultural tech firms. Just don't expect smooth sailing.

Final Verdict

The UK bioethanol industry is a cautionary tale for investors: even well-intentioned renewable energy projects can crumble under the weight of geopolitical decisions. Stay cautious, keep a close eye on policy shifts, and don't bet the farm on a sector that's already on the brink. For now, the safest play is to wait for clarity—and maybe a government that's ready to stand up to the ethanol titans across the Atlantic.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 15:56:13.009329

The Japanese conglomerate's performance underscores its ability to adapt to volatility while maintaining profitability and long-term growth momentum. For investors seeking stability amid uncertainty, ITOCHU's strategic reinvention and diversified portfolio position it as a compelling case study in resilience-driven value creation.

Resilient Earnings Amid Economic Headwinds

ITOCHU's Q1 2026 results highlight a striking divergence between revenue and profit trends. While total revenue declined 1.1% to ¥3.56 trillion, net profit surged 37% year-on-year to ¥283.9 billion. This outperformance was driven by disciplined asset management and sectoral reallocation. The privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, boosted the Textile segment's profitability by 37%, showcasing ITOCHU's agility in optimizing its portfolio. Similarly, the Food division benefited from Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, while the North American electric-power-related business thrived due to rising electricity demand and maintenance-free operations.

The company's ability to generate robust earnings despite a stronger yen (averaging 144.59 against the dollar) and falling resource prices reflects its strategic focus on high-margin services like logistics and renewable energy. This shift reduces exposure to cyclical commodities and aligns with global decarbonization trends, a critical factor for long-term sustainability.

Strategic Initiatives: Innovation and Diversification

ITOCHU's growth strategy is anchored in three pillars: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), North American energy expansion, and shareholder alignment.

Leading the SAF Revolution

ITOCHU has emerged as a key player in the global transition to cleaner energy. The company completed Phase 1 of a world-first initiative to promote SAF usage, collaborating with partners like ENEOS and Japan Airlines. This effort, validated by third-party verification from Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK), paves the way for a scalable Scope 3 environmental value trading system. By diversifying SAF production pathways—Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch (FT), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)—ITOCHU mitigates feedstock volatility and technological risks. Strategic partnerships with Neste and Raven SR ensure access to 2.2 million tons of HEFA-based SAF capacity by 2026 and 200,000 tons of FT-based SAF by 2025, aligning with Japan's 2030 mandate for 10% SAF blending.

North American Energy Expansion

The North American electric-power-related business is a cornerstone of ITOCHU's energy strategy. Q1 2026 saw a 21% progress toward the annual goal, driven by increased electricity sales revenue and the absence of maintenance disruptions. The company is accelerating investments in solar power and renewable development assets, leveraging tax incentives and global demand for clean energy. With plans to expand peripheral services like operation and maintenance, ITOCHU is positioning itself to capitalize on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and Europe's ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, creating complementary markets for its SAF exports.

Shareholder Alignment and Financial Discipline

ITOCHU's commitment to shareholder returns is evident in its 50% total payout ratio, exceeding its own Management Policy target. The company maintained a dividend of ¥200 per share and executed a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already completed in Q1. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical in an environment where interest rate uncertainty and potential recessions in developed markets could strain cash flow. A net debt/EBITDA ratio under 0.6x and ¥1 trillion in planned investments underscore ITOCHU's disciplined capital allocation, ensuring it remains financially robust while funding growth.

Risk Mitigation and Global Positioning

ITOCHU's strategic depth is further reinforced by its proactive risk management. The company has expanded PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA, a sustainability service firm, and deepened its Silicon Valley presence to target tech-driven business development. These moves align with global decarbonization trends and diversify revenue streams. However, risks such as potential U.S. trade policy shifts under a “Trump 2.0” administration and yen strength remain. ITOCHU's focus on renewable energy and high-margin services, however, provides a buffer against these uncertainties.

Investment Outlook

For investors, ITOCHU represents a rare blend of defensive qualities and growth potential. Its current valuation (P/E of ~14x) reflects stable earnings from its core trading business while offering exposure to high-growth SAF and renewable energy markets. Analysts project annual revenue growth of 4% and a 2.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings, with return on equity (ROE) expected to reach 14% in three years.

Recommendation: ITOCHU is well-positioned to navigate macroeconomic headwinds through its diversified portfolio, innovative strategies, and financial prudence. Investors seeking exposure to the energy transition and sustainable logistics should consider a long-term position, with a focus on monitoring the company's North American energy projects and currency risk management. With a target net profit of ¥900 billion for FYE 2026 and a clear path to scaling SAF production, ITOCHU exemplifies how strategic agility can turn uncertainty into opportunity.

In a world where resilience is the new competitive edge, ITOCHU Corporation stands out as a model of adaptive leadership—a company not just surviving, but thriving, in the face of global challenges.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:23.746921

Peningkatan harga tiket disebabkan kebijakan baru Pemerintah Singapura yang mewajibkan penggunaan bahan bakar penerbangan ramah lingkungan atau sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) dengan komposisi campuran minimal 1 mulai 1 Januari 2026.

Berikut fakta harga tiket pesawat akan naik, pajak karbon masuk hitungan yang dirangkum Okezone, Minggu (3/8/2025).

1. Mulai 1 Januari 2026

""Singapura itu, mulai 1 Januari 2026 itu mandat 1 dengan SAF. Kemudian konsekuensinya, kalau kita belum ada mandat (penggunaan SAF) tetapi pesawat rute internasional kita terbang di wilayah udara lain yang sudah mandat, itu akan kena carbon tax,"" ujarnya saat ditemui pada acara Indonesia Aero Summit 2025 di Jakarta.

Denon menjelaskan, kebijakan Singapura atau negara lain itu akan memicu tambahan beban biaya operasional bagi maskapai, terutama akibat penerapan pajak karbon atau carbon tax yang dikenakan kepada penerbangan yang memasuki atau melintasi wilayah udara negara-negara yang telah menetapkan mandat emisi karbon. Menurutnya, tambahan itu pada akhirnya akan dibebankan kepada penumpang.

2. Tiket Bakal Lebih Mahal

Dengan demikian, tiket pesawat tujuan Singapura dipastikan akan lebih mahal dibandingkan sebelumnya. Kenaikan ini bukan hanya disebabkan oleh harga bahan bakar alternatif yang lebih tinggi, tetapi juga oleh konsekuensi regulasi karbon yang kini semakin ketat di kawasan Asia Tenggara.

""Contohnya kalau sekarang ada rute Garuda ke Amsterdam, itu kan melewati juga sebagian besar Mainland, nah itu akan kena carbon tax, per penumpang,"" tambahnya.

3. Harus Susun Regulasi

INACA mendorong pemerintah untuk menyusun regulasi pengelolaan ruang udara Indonesia. Salah satunya pengenaan carbon tax bagi maskapai asing yang belum menerapkan mandat SAF jika melintasi ruang udara Indonesia.

""Sehingga kalau misalnya ada maskapai lain yang lewat di airspace Indonesia, penerapan pentarifan carbon tax-nya juga harus didesain oleh Indonesia. Karena setiap negara yang dilewati pesawat itu buang karbon di negara mereka, itu kena carbon tax,"" lanjutnya.

4. Transisi Penerbangan Berkelanjutan

INACA mendukung transisi menuju penerbangan berkelanjutan. Di Indonesia sendiri, pemerintah melalui Pertamina dan Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) tengah mempersiapkan penerapan bioavtur berbasis used cooking oil (minyak jelantah) dengan target campuran sebesar 3 persen pada 2026.

5. Target Net Zero Carbon pada 2060

Langkah ini dilakukan untuk mendukung target nasional mencapai net zero carbon pada 2060.

6. Penerapan Bahan Bakar

INACA menekankan bahwa penerapan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan harus diikuti dengan strategi distribusi yang efisien dan terdesentralisasi agar biaya tidak melonjak tajam. Jika dikelola dengan baik, penggunaan bioavtur dalam negeri diharapkan dapat menekan biaya operasional maskapai dan menjaga harga tiket tetap terjangkau bagi masyarakat.",https://static.rctiplus.id/media/600/files/fta_rcti/news/images/harga_tiket_pesawat-7bDo_large.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:35.702987

In an unprecedented move towards decarbonizing aviation, Japan Airlines (JAL), ITOCHU Corporation, ENEOS Corporation, and a consortium of industry leaders have completed the first phase of a groundbreaking project that aims to foster the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through innovative Scope 3 environmental value trading. This initiative, launched in August 2024, marks a historic step towards achieving more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. The demonstration phase, which ran from August 2024 to March 2025, has set the stage for future expansion, with the goal of significantly reducing aviation’s carbon footprint through the promotion of SAF.

The collaboration among leading companies such as Japan Airlines, ITOCHU Corporation, ENEOS, and Narita International Airport Corporation represents a united effort to develop a platform for trading Scope 3 environmental value. This scheme is designed to incentivize companies in the aviation sector to adopt SAF by facilitating the buying and selling of environmental value associated with its use.

Demonstration Test Phase: Outcomes and Key Findings

The Phase 1 demonstration test allowed the participating companies to assess the effectiveness of Scope 3 environmental value trading. Key findings from this phase include the successful establishment of a platform that brought together multiple companies to trade environmental value, the first successful trades through bilateral contracts, and the confirmation of the system’s transparency and reliability, as evaluated by the third-party organization Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK).

The demonstration test was a vital first step in proving the viability of Scope 3 environmental value trading as an effective tool in promoting the use of SAF in the aviation industry. The initiative demonstrated that by registering environmental value and trading it among companies, it is possible to create an economic incentive for adopting SAF and other sustainable practices in aviation.

According to the project partners, this phase provided valuable insights into the operational mechanics of the trading system and helped identify potential challenges that need to be addressed in future phases. Despite these challenges, the results from Phase 1 are seen as a significant milestone in advancing the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Strategic Reinvention: From CAPEX to Shareholder Returns ITOCHU's Q1 results reflect a disciplined approach to capital allocation and long-term positioning.
Risks and Opportunities in the Outlook While ITOCHU's Q1 performance is commendable, the road ahead is not without risks.
However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer.
Investment Implications For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation.","Japan's ITOCHU Corporation, a global trading giant with a diversified portfolio spanning energy, machinery, textiles, and food, has delivered a Q1 FYE2026 performance that underscores its operational resilience in a turbulent global economy. Despite a 1.1% decline in revenue to ¥3.56 trillion, the company reported a staggering 37% year-on-year surge in net profit to ¥283.9 billion. This divergence between top-line and bottom-line results reveals a strategic recalibration that positions ITOCHU to navigate macroeconomic headwinds while capitalizing on emerging opportunities.

Navigating a Fractured Global Market

The first quarter of FYE2026 unfolded against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating exchange rates, and resource price volatility. ITOCHU's ability to boost profits despite these challenges speaks to its structural adaptability. The yen's appreciation and falling commodity prices—iron ore dropped from $111 to $98 per ton, and crude oil fell from $85 to $67 per barrel—eroded margins in its Metals & Minerals segment. Yet, the company offset these pressures through strategic asset management and sectoral reallocation.

A key driver was the privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, which contributed significantly to the Textile segment's 37% profit growth. By consolidating this asset, ITOCHU not only strengthened its direct-to-consumer model but also leveraged lean management practices to enhance profitability. Meanwhile, the Food division, bolstered by Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, demonstrated resilience against inflationary pressures.

The company also navigated U.S. tariff risks with relative success. While the immediate impact of Trump-era trade policies on Q1 was limited, ITOCHU remains vigilant about potential escalation. Its North American electric-power-related business, however, thrived due to rising electricity demand and the absence of maintenance costs, highlighting the value of its renewable energy investments.

Strategic Reinvention: From CAPEX to Shareholder Returns

ITOCHU's Q1 results reflect a disciplined approach to capital allocation and long-term positioning. The company executed ¥185 billion in investments approved in FYE2025 and added ¥50 billion in new initiatives, including CAPEX of ¥62 billion. These funds are directed toward high-growth areas such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), cellulose nanofiber-reinforced plastics, and logistics innovations. For instance, the launch of PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA—a sustainability service company—aligns with global decarbonization trends, while its Silicon Valley expansion targets tech-driven business development.

Shareholder returns remain a priority. ITOCHU maintained its dividend at ¥200 per share and announced a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already executed by Q1's end. The 50% total payout ratio exceeds its own Management Policy target, signaling confidence in its cash flow generation. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical for investors seeking both growth and income in an uncertain environment.

Risks and Opportunities in the Outlook

While ITOCHU's Q1 performance is commendable, the road ahead is not without risks. A potential “Trump 2.0” administration could disrupt global trade dynamics, and a recession in developed markets could dampen demand for machinery and energy. Moreover, the yen's strength—averaging 144.59 against the dollar in Q1—continues to pressure resource-based profits.

However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer. Its diversified portfolio limits exposure to any single sector, and its focus on high-margin services (e.g., logistics, renewable energy) reduces reliance on cyclical commodities. The company's 2.2% net profit growth guidance for FYE2026, coupled with a robust balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA <0.6x), suggests a conservative yet ambitious approach.

Investment Implications

For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation. The company's ability to generate strong earnings growth in a volatile environment, coupled with its proactive reinvestment in sustainable and tech-enabled sectors, positions it as a defensive yet growth-oriented play.

However, prudence is warranted. A 50% total payout ratio is ambitious, and any sharp rise in interest rates or a global economic slowdown could strain cash flow. Investors should monitor ITOCHU's progress in its North American energy projects and its capacity to mitigate currency risks.

In a world where global supply chains are increasingly fragmented and environmental regulations tighten, ITOCHU's blend of operational agility and strategic foresight makes it a standout. As it moves through FYE2026, the company's focus on asset optimization, innovation, and shareholder alignment will be key metrics to watch.

For now, ITOCHU offers a rare combination: resilience in the present and a clear-eyed vision for the future. In an era of uncertainty, that is precisely the kind of business model that can outperform.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 21:56:18.385957

Hal itu mengakibatkan jumlah penumpang domestik untuk penerbangan berjadwal selama tahun 2024 stagnan dengan tahun 2023. Selain itu, jumlah pesawat juga turun karena banyak pesawat yang masuk perawatan Repair and Overhaul (MRO) dan kesulitan mendapatkan spareparts.

Menurutnya, terdapat beberapa tantangan penerbangan nasional, baik untuk maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, dan kargo yang harus disikapi bersama stakeholder penerbangan, yaitu regulasi yang kurang fleksibel; risiko nilai tukar rupiah terhadap dolar AS; pengadaan spareparts; hubungan dengan pengelola bandara dan Airnav.

Selanjutnya masalah operasional penerbangan tidak berjadwal (terbang malam, terbang khusus, air ambulance dan lainnya; serta Ilegal charter (penerbangan charter ilegal).

""Diperlukan langkah-langkah strategis jangka pendek, menengah dan panjang, agar tantangan ini bisa segera teratasi dan industri penerbangan pulih seperti sebelum pandemi COVID-19,"" ujar Denon.

INACA berharap pembahasan permasalahan industri penerbangan secara holistik dan komprehensif mulai dari bisnis dan operasional penerbangan sampai dengan hal-hal pendukungnya dengan melibatkan pemerintah lintas kementerian dan lembaga; kalangan bisnis; akademisi; media; dan masyarakat dapat dilanjutkan.

Kedua, dilanjutkan pembahasan upaya peningkatan kondisi finansial maskapai penerbangan baik maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo dan perintis melalui regulasi operasional bisnis penerbangan yang lebih adil

""Ketiga menyelenggarakan konektivitas penerbangan secara komprehensif dengan sistem hub dan spoke baik untuk penerbangan domestik maupun internasional,"" katanya pula.

Keempat melakukan deregulasi terkait proses ekspor-impor sparepart baik yang melekat maupun tidak melekat di pesawat dengan menggunakan Ilustrated Part Catalog (IPC) serta berdasarkan aturan Tokyo Round dari WTC.

Kelima meningkatkan implementasi safety management system (SMS) dan peningkatan safety culture dalam operasional penerbangan dari semua stakeholder, baik itu regulator (pemerintah), operator penerbangan (maskapai, bandara, MRO), dan masyarakat.

""Keenam dibentuknya Dewan Transportation Board bekerjasama dengan moda transportasi lain dan stakeholder terkait untuk mengembangkan transportasi multi moda dalam rangka mendukung pertumbuhan perekonomian nasional Indonesia,"" ujar Denon.

INACA juga berharap peningkatan dukungan pemangku kepentingan di sektor penerbangan terhadap maskapai penerbangan nasional baik berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo, dan perintis.

Dengan begitu dapat meningkatkan konektivitas penerbangan dan menjembatani kesenjangan pembangunan, mendukung desentralisasi, meningkatkan daya saing komoditas lokal, dan meningkatkan fungsi sebagai katalisator bagi pembangunan ekonomi lokal sehingga memastikan tidak ada wilayah Indonesia yang tertinggal.

""Selain itu pengembangan sektor penerbangan yang strategis juga dapat meningkatkan aksesibilitas domestik, regional, dan internasional, mendorong mobilitas ekonomi nasional, dan memberikan nilai tambah bagi negara,"" kata Denon lagi.",https://imgsrv2.voi.id/TeIGovYBUuuH6vvCKf4EmdqmPJ_xqIIp4vdFwGtiKMA/rs:fill/w:800/h:450/g:sm/wm:1:nowe:0:0:1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy81MDE1MjcvMjAyNTA4MDMwMDMyLW1haW4uY3JvcHBlZF8xNzU0MTU1OTU2LmpwZWc.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:44.972523

After five years in deep storage triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the final two giants are being readied for service, signaling a renewed era of ultra-luxury and high-capacity air travel.

Etihad Airways is set to reintroduce two more Airbus A380-800 aircraft into its fleet. The move was initially reported by aviation journalist Andreas Spaeth, who identified aircraft A6–APC and A6-APB as the next in line to return to active duty.

Confirmation followed during an Etihad open day held for Wizz Air Abu Dhabi staff in late July 2025. At the event, Arik De, Etihad’s Chief Revenue and Commercial Officer, shared the carrier’s strategy for expanding its A380 operations.

According to the timeline:

A6-APC is scheduled to rejoin the fleet by June 2026

A6-APB will return by January 2027

These two will complement the seven A380s already flying for Etihad, bringing the total to nine by early 2027. One A380, A6-APA, remains in storage but is being parted out and will not return to service.

Etihad’s CEO, Antonoaldo Neves, has expressed a clear long-term vision to keep the A380 flying until at least 2032, bucking the trend of other airlines retiring the type in favor of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. This decision comes as the airline experiences strong demand recovery and expands its global reach.

Currently, Etihad’s A380s serve major international routes from Abu Dhabi (AUH) to destinations including: London (LHR), Paris (CDG), Singapore (SIN), Toronto (YYZ)

A380 service to New York (JFK) was recently dropped due to underperformance, though new long-haul destinations are under review.

Etihad is in full expansion mode. In July 2025 alone, the airline accepted delivery of:

Its first Airbus A321LR (set for commercial service to Phuket starting August 1)

Two Boeing 787 Dreamliners

One Airbus A350-1000

One Airbus A320

As part of its 2025 growth roadmap, Etihad aims to carry 21.5 million passengers, more than double its 2022 numbers.

The latest report comes after Ian Ball, the man who attempted to kidnap Princess Anne in 1974, was released from a high-security facility.","King Charles III has made surprising announcement amid reports of his younger sister Princess Anne's kidnapper's release.

The 76-year-old monarch has reportedly put his late mother Queen Elizabeth II's luxury helicopter on the market.

The monarch has decided to sell the eight-seater red 2009 Sikorsky and will instead use two environmentally friendly jets, believed to cost £8.5m each.

The opulent interior of the late Queen's helicopter has been revealed for the first time after it was put on sale. Spacious grey leather seats are matched with a blue carpet, while a magazine rack, a wooden clock and tinted windows complete the design.

The listing, by helicopter broker AeroAsset, boasts that it has only had 'one owner since new' and is a 'Head of State Aircraft'. It has had 5222 hours of flying and comes with 'ultraleather and ultrasuede interior panel upholstery,'

The Queen made innumerable trips in her helicopter, including one from Sandringham to Windsor a few months before she died. The royal family have flown the helicopter for 15 years, between 2009 and 2024.

Her personal Range Rover, which she used between 2006 and 2008, is also up for auction. The 2006 L322 model features a distinctive ornament of a labrador with a grouse in its mouth.

It also has a number of unique features including side steps, mud flaps, a made-to-measure dog guard for Elizabeth II's canine companions and extra wiring for security measures.

It is worth mentioning here that the royal family now uses the new AgustaWestland AW139s, which run on 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel.

Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy.","Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) has always been a barometer of the energy and infrastructure sectors. Its second-quarter 2025 earnings report, however, reveals a company navigating a turbulent landscape. Revenue of $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.43 fell short of historical benchmarks, with adjusted EBITDA declining 42% year-over-year to $96 million. Yet, beneath these figures lies a story of strategic recalibration and long-term positioning in megatrends that could redefine global energy systems. For investors, the question is not whether Fluor is struggling, but whether its resilience and adaptability can unlock value in a world increasingly defined by decarbonization and digital transformation.

Headwinds and Hurdles: A Q2 in Context

Fluor's Q2 results reflect the dual pressures of sector-specific challenges and macroeconomic headwinds. The Energy Solutions segment, once a cornerstone of profitability, saw profits plummet from $75 million in Q2 2024 to $15 million, driven by cost overruns on three infrastructure projects and an unexpected $31 million arbitration ruling. Meanwhile, the Mission Solutions segment, while posting a $35 million profit, faced a temporary stop work order on a key airfield project.

The Urban Solutions segment, which reported a modest $29 million profit, has been particularly vulnerable to subcontractor errors and project delays. Fluor's response—strengthening execution teams and taking legal action against underperforming partners—signals a recognition of operational fragilities. Yet, these issues are symptomatic of a broader industry-wide struggle with supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures.

Strategic Resilience: The Long Game in Energy Transition

While the Q2 numbers are sobering, Fluor's long-term value proposition hinges on its alignment with the energy transition. The company's $28.2 billion backlog—80% reimbursable—provides a critical buffer against short-term volatility. This includes high-margin, long-term contracts in hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture, sectors poised for explosive growth.

The LNG Canada project, now shipping its first cargo after achieving Ready for Start-Up (RFSU) for Train 1, exemplifies Fluor's ability to deliver complex, capital-intensive projects. The proposed phase 2 expansion, which could double the facility's size, underscores its relevance in a world increasingly reliant on cleaner energy sources. Meanwhile, Fluor's 51% stake in NuScale Power—a leader in small modular reactors (SMRs)—offers a unique advantage in the nuclear renaissance. A $3.2 billion pretax mark-to-market gain from NuScale in Q2, though non-recurring, highlights the potential of this asset to generate long-term value.

Fluor's foray into green hydrogen and carbon capture further cements its role in the energy transition. The company's expertise in converting existing facilities into renewable fuels production sites—such as the former Come By Chance refinery—positions it to capitalize on the shift toward sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Additionally, Fluor's patented Econamine carbon dioxide recovery technology is being deployed in projects like the Albemarle Lithium Conversion Project, aligning with global net-zero targets.

The Infrastructure Imperative: A $57 GW Opportunity

The infrastructure segment remains a double-edged sword for Fluor. While cost overruns and execution challenges have dented profitability, the underlying demand for infrastructure is robust. By 2030, data centers alone are projected to drive 44 GW of additional energy demand, much of it to be met by renewables. Fluor's work on colocation data centers in India and its partnerships with tech firms to deploy AI-optimized power systems position it to benefit from this surge.

However, Fluor must address its operational execution risks. The company's revised 2025 guidance—adjusted EBITDA of $475–525 million and operating cash flow of $200–250 million—reflects a more cautious outlook. Share repurchases have been scaled back to $450–500 million for the year, a sign of fiscal prudence in uncertain times. For investors, the key will be whether Fluor can stabilize its infrastructure segments while accelerating its energy transition bets.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Caution and Opportunity

Fluor's Q2 results underscore the challenges of executing large-scale infrastructure projects in a high-inflation environment. Yet, its strategic focus on energy transition and digital transformation—through tools like Building Information Modeling (BIM) and AI-driven predictive analytics—positions it to outperform in the long run. The company's $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, coupled with a manageable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.75, provides flexibility to weather near-term headwinds.

For investors, the path forward is nuanced. Fluor's revised guidance and cash flow challenges suggest caution in the short term. However, its backlog, energy transition expertise, and NuScale stake offer compelling long-term upside. A prudent approach would involve a staggered entry into the stock, with a focus on its exposure to hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture—a $2.5 trillion global market by 2030. Historically, a simple buy-and-hold strategy following Fluor's earnings releases has shown promising results, with a 57.14% win rate over three days, 71.43% over ten days, and 78.57% over thirty days, peaking at a 10.47% return on day 59.

Conclusion: A Company at the Crossroads

Fluor Corporation stands at a crossroads. Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy. While the near-term outlook is cautious, the company's alignment with megatrends like decarbonization, AI-driven efficiency, and green hydrogen offers a compelling narrative for long-term investors. For those willing to navigate the volatility, Fluor represents a unique opportunity to bet on the future of energy—one modular reactor, one carbon capture project, and one data center at a time.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:56:24.396425

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal Air France-KLM's exit from the Air Europa bid is a microcosm of the European airline industry's broader transformation.
While consolidation remains a strategic imperative, the sector's risks—ranging from regulatory hurdles to sustainability costs—demand a measured approach.","The recent withdrawal of Air France-KLM from its bid to acquire a controlling stake in Air Europa marks a pivotal moment in the post-pandemic evolution of the European airline industry. This decision, driven by an irreconcilable valuation gap with Air Europa's owners, reflects a broader shift in strategic priorities and underscores the mounting risks facing investors in a sector grappling with financial, regulatory, and environmental headwinds.

A Failed Bid and the Valuation Dilemma

Air France-KLM's €300 million offer for 51% of Air Europa—a valuation of roughly €600 million—was dismissed as insufficient by the Hidalgo family, who valued a 25% stake at the same amount (implying a €960 million total valuation). This discrepancy highlights the challenges of aligning expectations in a market where recovery trajectories remain uncertain. For Air France-KLM, the decision to exit the race was a pragmatic one, avoiding a costly stalemate with stakeholders unwilling to compromise. However, it also signals a recalibration of appetite for large-scale acquisitions in an environment where capital allocation must now balance growth ambitions with profitability pressures.

The airline's repeated attempts to secure a stake in Air Europa—from a 2019 bid derailed by Iberia's interest to a 2021 partnership with Delta Air Lines—underscore the strategic value of Madrid-Barajas as a hub for transatlantic and Latin American routes. Yet the failure to finalize a deal now shifts the spotlight to Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines, both of whom are reportedly circling the Spanish carrier. This dynamic illustrates the intensifying competition for market share in a fragmented industry, where access to key hubs and route networks remains a critical differentiator.

Post-Pandemic Consolidation: Strategic Gains and Structural Risks

The European airline sector is undergoing a wave of consolidation, driven by the need to counteract the pandemic's long-term effects, including reduced consumer demand, higher fuel costs, and the transition to sustainable aviation. Lufthansa's integration of ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's fleet modernization with A350s and 787-10s are emblematic of this trend. These moves aim to enhance unit revenue, reduce costs, and align with 2030 sustainability targets. However, the sector's gains are tempered by systemic risks that investors must scrutinize.

One such risk is the soaring cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is now 4.2 times pricier than conventional jet fuel. While European carriers are investing in SAF partnerships, scaling production will require regulatory incentives and technological breakthroughs. Additionally, supply chain bottlenecks have delayed aircraft deliveries, pushing the average fleet age to 15 years and constraining capacity growth. These constraints are compounded by CORSIA compliance costs, which could drain €1 billion from the sector in 2025 alone.

Regulatory scrutiny further complicates consolidation efforts. The European Commission's evolving merger framework—combining route-based and airport-based market definitions—has raised the bar for approvals. For example, the EC's rejection of the Connect Airways/Flybe merger hinged on the inability to transfer valuable take-off and landing slots, a hurdle that Air Europa's bidders must now navigate. With Brexit-era regulatory duality (e.g., UK Competition and Markets Authority involvement), the path to cross-border deals is fraught with legal and political uncertainties.

Investment Implications: Balancing Resilience and Volatility

Despite these challenges, the sector offers compelling opportunities for investors who can discern resilience amid volatility. The European airline industry's net profit margin improved to 4.3% in 2025, outpacing historical averages in the context of higher operating costs. Low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air have accelerated capacity expansion, operating at 105.2% of 2019 levels, while legacy carriers are leveraging premium offerings (e.g., Lufthansa's Allegris brand) to capture higher-yielding passengers.

However, investors must remain cautious. Sudden spikes in fuel prices, geopolitical shocks, or regulatory overreach could erode margins swiftly. For instance, Air France-KLM's recent operating profit of €736 million in Q2 2025 masks underlying fragility: a 2.4% increase in unit revenue per ASK is modest against a backdrop of rising SAF and CORSIA costs. Similarly, Lufthansa's 27% year-on-year profit growth is contingent on maintaining cost discipline and navigating aircraft delivery delays.

For investors, the key is to adopt a diversified approach. Strategic alliances—such as Lufthansa's stake in ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's investment in SAS—offer a safer path to expansion than outright acquisitions. Additionally, companies positioned in premium and intercontinental markets (e.g., British Airways, Air France) are better insulated against price-sensitive demand shifts.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

Air France-KLM's exit from the Air Europa bid is a microcosm of the European airline industry's broader transformation. While consolidation remains a strategic imperative, the sector's risks—ranging from regulatory hurdles to sustainability costs—demand a measured approach.

The King is selling his mother's eight-seater red 2009 Sikorsky and will instead use two environmentally friendly jets, believed to cost £8.5m each.

The royal family have used the new AgustaWestland AW139s, which run on 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel, since last year, having flown in the previous helicopter for the previous 15 years.

The opulent interior of the late Queen's helicopter has been revealed for the first time after it was put on sale.

Spacious grey leather seats are matched with a blue carpet, while a magazine rack, a wooden clock and tinted windows complete the design.

The listing, by helicopter broker AeroAsset, boasts that it has only had 'one owner since new' and is a 'Head of State Aircraft'.

It has had 5222 hours of flying and comes with 'ultraleather and ultrasuede interior panel upholstery,' it adds.

The Queen made innumerable trips in her helicopter, including one from Sandringham to Windsor a few months before she died.

Her personal Range Rover, which she used between 2006 and 2008, is also up for auction.

The 2006 L322 model features a distinctive ornament of a labrador with a grouse in its mouth.

It also has a number of unique features including side steps, mud flaps, a made-to-measure dog guard for Elizabeth II's canine companions and extra wiring for security measures.

While the rear grab handles, to help with the late Queen's entry and exit from the vehicle have been removed.

The car has covered 120,000 miles and is described as being in 'exemplary condition throughout.

The model's current value is between £9,000 and £16,000.

But it is estimated to raise up to £70,000 when it goes for sale at the Silverstone Festival on August 23.

The same auction house sold a different one of her Range Rovers for £132,750.

The car's MOT record shows that by April 2009 - around a year after it was released from the Royal Household - it had clocked just under 18,000 miles. Today, it is showing 119,938.

Rob Hubbard, Managing Director and Principal Auctioneer of Iconic Auctioneers, said: 'Vehicles with such distinguished provenance rarely enter the market, making this an exceptional opportunity for collectors and enthusiasts alike.

SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production.","The University of Sheffield has received significant backing from the UK government to push forward the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a major stride towards cleaner air travel.

During a visit to the university on Monday, 21 July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane MP announced that Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million initiative aimed at commercialising a new SAF production method. The project is designed to attract investment for large-scale SAF production facilities, helping to increase the availability of low-carbon fuels across the aviation sector.

The initiative, known as NextGen-SAF, brings together an international consortium of partners, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK). It has also garnered letters of support from key industry players such as Airbus, Boeing, Qatar Airways, and the City of Doncaster Council.

Traditional SAF production typically relies on bio-based or waste-derived feedstocks, raising questions about the long-term sustainability and scalability of supply. The University of Sheffield’s innovative approach bypasses this challenge. Instead, it uses renewable energy and advanced carbon capture technologies to create synthetic fuel.

At the core of this approach is a method known as Power to Liquid (PtL), which combines renewable electricity and atmospheric or industrial carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen. These elements are then converted into synthetic hydrocarbons, which are refined into SAF.

The process not only holds promise for reducing aviation emissions but could also offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for decarbonising other industrial operations.

NextGen-SAF plans to build the world’s first demonstration plant integrating two breakthrough technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The MCFC is capable of both generating hydrogen and capturing CO₂, while the AFT reactor transforms these components into synthetic fuel. The demonstration plant will test the full system’s performance, with the goal of scaling it up for commercial use.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

“We are proud to lead this pioneering project, made possible through crucial government funding, to develop a new route for producing sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production. This project not only aligns with national sustainability goals but also strengthens the UK’s fuel production capabilities and long-term economic growth.”

The announcement comes as part of a wider £63 million funding package from the Department for Transport, supporting 17 projects across the UK aimed at boosting SAF innovation.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution,” said Aviation Minister Mike Kane. “We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and cementing the UK’s place as a global leader in sustainable flight.”

The University of Sheffield is internationally recognised for its leadership in SAF research. Its Energy Innovation Centre is equipped with state-of-the-art pilot-scale testing facilities, enabling close collaboration between researchers and industry to trial clean energy technologies before they’re brought to market.

The university is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two centres globally that support fuel producers in gaining certification for SAF to be used in commercial aviation.

Sheffield played a key role in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered entirely by SAF. Its researchers assessed the impact of the fuel on particulate emissions and contrail formation, with findings showing a reduction in emissions of up to 70%, thanks to testing conducted at the Energy Innovation Centre.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-8.png,N,,2025-08-02 11:56:37.484198

If approved, flights could take off from the new runway within a decade.

The expansion will boost connectivity with at least 30 new daily routes, modernised terminals, and capacity for 150 million passengers annually. The project aligns with Heathrow’s net-zero by 2050 commitment and supports long-term UK economic growth.

London Heathrow Plans Third Runway and New Terminals

Heathrow Airport (LHR), home to British Airways (BA) and others, has launched its most ambitious development yet. A third runway measuring 3,500 metres will lift annual capacity to 756,000 aircraft movements and 150 million passengers. Parliament has approved the proposed layout and design.

To support this, Heathrow will expand terminal infrastructure. The plan includes Terminal 5X, three satellite terminals, and a larger Terminal 2. Terminal 5X will serve as a second main entrance to Terminal 5, with a shared transport interchange.

The airport will phase out Terminal 3 and redevelop the Central Terminal Area. These upgrades aim to improve operations and passenger experience. Heathrow wants to streamline transfers across terminals.

Heathrow will invest $27.9 billion (£21 billion) on the third runway and airfield expansion, $16 billion (£12 billion) on new terminals and airport infrastructure, and $20.7 billion (£15 billion) to upgrade existing infrastructure. These costs reflect inflation and project complexity.

The third runway and initial works should finish by the mid-2030s. Terminal upgrades will follow in stages. All funding will come from private investors under a tailored regulatory system.

Heathrow Airport’s Expansion Boosts Economy and Connectivity

Heathrow’s expansion could boost UK GDP by 0.43 percent. The airport supports over $260 billion (£200 billion) in annual trade and connects exporters to 92 percent of global output. A third runway would raise cargo capacity by 50 percent and add long-haul routes.

The plan will improve regional connectivity. Areas like Cornwall, Scotland, and Northern Ireland will gain better access to Heathrow’s global network. Business leaders across the UK welcome the inclusive growth model.

easyJet (U2) plans to scale operations at Heathrow. The carrier sees more competition and lower fares ahead. This may reshape Heathrow’s accessibility for budget travellers.

Surface transport links will also improve. A new road tunnel, two parkways, and upgraded rail connections are planned. Walking and cycling paths will promote greener journeys.

Construction and operations will generate tens of thousands of jobs. Around 60 percent of supply chain spending will support regions beyond London. A community fund will assist local residents.

Heathrow Airport Aims Long-Term Sustainability

Heathrow aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Since 2019, it has cut flight emissions by 10 percent and ground emissions by 15 percent. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and clean energy drive this strategy.

Redesigned airspace will reduce delays and holding patterns. This improves punctuality and cuts emissions. Current air quality monitors remain within legal limits.

Heathrow has reduced its noise footprint by 41 percent since 2006. Expansion will standardise flight paths and lessen disruption. Environmental assessments will continue throughout the project.

New terminals will adopt energy-efficient designs and support electric vehicles. SAF infrastructure and low-emission ground equipment will be built in. These steps align with the UK’s climate goals.

Heathrow will engage closely with regulators and communities. It aims to set global standards in green aviation. Ongoing consultation will ensure progress is transparent.

Government Support and Industry Backing

Business groups strongly support the expansion. The Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, and Federation of Small Businesses see trade and regional growth opportunities. They call it a national priority.

easyJet (U2) endorses the expansion plans. The airline expects better fares and more consumer choice. Heathrow could soon serve more price-sensitive travellers.

Air travel becomes the default choice, not just for the wealthy, but for millions of everyday families.
The democratization of air travel is a win for global connectivity, business, and cultural exchange.","Why Is Air Traffic Set to Soar in the Next Two Decades?

If you’ve ever wondered why airports seem busier every year, you’re not alone. Boeing, one of the world’s leading aircraft manufacturers, predicts that air travel isn’t just holding steady—it’s about to skyrocket. The company’s latest outlook suggests that by 2044, there could be as many as 50,000 planes crisscrossing our skies. That’s a staggering leap from today’s fleet, and it raises a big question: what’s fueling this massive growth?

How Are Emerging Markets Changing the Aviation Game?

Let’s start with a simple truth: the world is getting more connected, and much of that growth is happening outside traditional aviation powerhouses. Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are investing heavily in airports, runways, and air traffic control systems. These aren’t just vanity projects—they’re laying the groundwork for millions of new travelers to take to the skies.

Take India, for example. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), India is on track to become the world’s third-largest aviation market by 2026. Airports are expanding, new routes are opening, and low-cost carriers are making air travel accessible to a broader swath of the population. Similar stories are unfolding in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Nigeria, where rising incomes and urbanization are turning air travel from a luxury into a necessity.

What Role Does the Expanding Global Middle Class Play?

Here’s where things get interesting. The global middle class is booming—especially in Asia. The Brookings Institution estimates that by 2030, two-thirds of the world’s middle class will live in Asia. More disposable income means more people booking flights for business, leisure, and family visits.

This isn’t just about vacations, either. As people move into higher income brackets, their expectations shift. They want faster, more convenient ways to travel, both domestically and internationally. Airlines are responding with new routes, better service, and more competitive prices. The result? Air travel becomes the default choice, not just for the wealthy, but for millions of everyday families.

Are Airlines and Airports Ready for This Surge?

Growth is exciting, but it comes with challenges. Airports in rapidly developing regions are racing to keep up with demand. In China alone, more than 200 new airports are planned or under construction, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Meanwhile, airlines are placing record orders for new aircraft, betting big on the future.

But it’s not just about building runways and buying planes. There’s a pressing need for skilled pilots, air traffic controllers, and maintenance crews. The aviation industry is investing in training programs and technology to ensure safety and efficiency keep pace with expansion. Boeing’s own projections highlight a need for over 600,000 new pilots globally by 2040. That’s a hiring spree of epic proportions.

How Will This Boom Affect the Environment?

It’s impossible to talk about aviation’s future without addressing its environmental impact. More planes in the sky mean more carbon emissions—unless the industry adapts. The good news? Airlines and manufacturers are making real strides. Sustainable aviation fuel, lighter materials, and more efficient engines are all part of the equation.

Boeing, for instance, is investing heavily in research to reduce the carbon footprint of its next-generation aircraft. Meanwhile, international agreements like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) are pushing airlines to offset emissions and invest in greener technologies. It’s not a perfect solution yet, but the momentum is real.

What Does This Mean for Travelers and the Industry?

For travelers, the coming decades promise more choices, better prices, and new destinations. Imagine flying direct from a mid-sized city in Africa to Southeast Asia, or hopping on a budget flight across South America with ease. The democratization of air travel is a win for global connectivity, business, and cultural exchange.

For the industry, the stakes are high. Companies that adapt quickly—by embracing new technologies, investing in sustainability, and training the next generation of aviation professionals—will thrive. Those that don’t may struggle to keep up with the pace of change.

The big takeaway? The future of air travel isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end. The sky’s not the limit; it’s just the beginning.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/soaring-skies-ahead-as-global-air-travel-set-to-surge-with-expanding-middle-class.avif,N,,2025-08-02 13:56:53.282973

North American airlines have emerged as pioneers in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry. Their leadership is visible in long-term SAF offtake agreements, early infrastructure deployment, and corporate partnerships that foster demand aggregation. As of 2025, five major carriers United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Air Canada, and JetBlue have committed to substantial SAF volumes, illustrating the increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size in the region.

United Airlines leads the charge with a total of 2.9 billion gallons in SAF commitments. Notably, a landmark 1 billion gallon agreement with Cemvita marks a shift toward synthetic fuel pathways. United plans to use 10 million gallons of SAF in 2025, tripling its 2022 volume.

Delta Air Lines has secured offtake agreements totaling 910 million gallons 525 million from Gevo and 385 million from DG Fuels targeting a 5% SAF blend by 2030.

American Airlines has inked deals worth 620 million gallons through 2030. Its partnerships with Aemetis and Gevo include annual deliveries beginning in 2024, reinforcing its strategic SAF ambitions.

Air Canada will deploy 77.6 million liters (20.5 million US gallons) of Neste SAF in 2025, representing 1% of its fuel consumption, with further growth expected under Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations.

JetBlue, while smaller in scope, has launched a 1 million gallon per year SAF program at JFK, marking the first regular SAF supply at that major hub.

These examples reflect growing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share among North American airlines.

Barriers to Scaling SAF

Despite remarkable progress, the SAF Industry faces systemic barriers that hinder broader adoption. Chief among them are cost premiums, feedstock limitations, infrastructure inadequacies, and inconsistent policy frameworks.

SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel often 2 to 5 times the cost. In Europe, SAF blending mandates are projected to add $1.7 billion in airline costs in 2025 alone. These price disparities reduce competitiveness, especially for carriers operating on tight margins.

Feedstock availability poses another critical challenge. Most SAF today is produced using the HEFA pathway, reliant on used cooking oil and animal fats. However, this feedstock stream is expected to plateau at 2 million tonnes by 2030. Advanced feedstocks like municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass require intricate logistics and higher processing costs.

Infrastructure remains a bottleneck. Only 25% of North American airports are SAF-capable, and retrofitting facilities is capital intensive. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market cannot scale unless distribution and blending infrastructure is widely available.

Finally, regulatory fragmentation further complicates progress. The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge sets ambitious voluntary goals, but lacks federal blending mandates. Tax credits under Section 45Z expire between 2024–2027, creating long-term uncertainty. Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations are more prescriptive, requiring 1 billion liters of SAF by 2030, but regional differences remain.

Opportunities for Acceleration

Despite these challenges, significant opportunities exist to catalyze SAF Market growth across North America.

Emerging SAF pathways, such as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), promise dramatic lifecycle emissions reductions. United Airlines is investing in Twelve’s CO2-to-fuel technology, which can reduce emissions by up to 90%. DG Fuels is developing timber waste-to-SAF conversion plants with 85% reduction potential.

Corporate demand aggregation is gaining traction. Programs like Eco-Skies Alliance enable cargo and logistics companies (e.g., SEKO Logistics) to co-invest in SAF, creating reliable demand pools and de-risking project financing.

Policy incentives are proving effective. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and Michigan’s $1.50/gallon SAF tax credit stimulate regional production and feedstock utilization, helping to expand Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Technological integration also supports scaling. Companies like LanzaJet are deploying modular ATJ facilities to lower capital expenditure. Digital platforms, such as SAFc-Registry powered by Chooose, streamline SAF transaction certification and traceability.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

North American policy is evolving to support the SAF Industry, but further alignment is needed to create long-term stability.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge outlines a goal of 3 billion gallons of annual SAF production by 2030, scaling to 35 billion by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act offers Section 45Z tax credits of $1.25–$1.75/gallon, contingent on emissions reductions of over 50%.

State-level programs complement federal efforts. California’s LCFS rewards carbon intensity reductions, while Michigan offers per-gallon credits to SAF producers. However, without a federal mandate, airlines and producers still face demand uncertainty.

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations offer more structured targets: 1 billion liters by 2030 (approximately 10% of aviation fuel) and up to 25% by 2035. Provincial mandates and incentives further support regional development, boosting Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Trends.

Airline Leading Company Profiles

United Airlines: With a 2.9 billion gallon SAF commitment, United has invested in innovative platforms including Cemvita and Twelve. The airline will use 10 million gallons of SAF in 2025 and is scaling PtL facilities like AirPlant One.

Delta Air Lines: Delta’s 910 million gallon SAF offtake from Gevo and DG Fuels supports its 5% blending target by 2030. Projects focus on cellulosic feedstocks and Alcohol-to-Jet conversion.

American Airlines: With 620 million gallons committed through Aemetis and Gevo, American is exploring E-SAF pathways from CO2 via Infinium, supported by Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Air Canada: A 20.5 million gallon SAF purchase from Neste marks a major milestone. The airline integrates SAF pipeline delivery to YVR and adheres to ISCC sustainability certifications.

JetBlue Airways: Operating the first regular JFK SAF supply through a 1 million gallon/year partnership with Valero and World Fuel Services, JetBlue also promotes corporate sustainability programs.

Strategic Recommendations

To expand the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size and achieve net-zero aviation by 2050, coordinated efforts are required:

Establish a federal blending mandate in the U.S., starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling to 10% by 2030. This would create predictable demand and incentivize private investment.

Extend and expand tax incentives under Section 45Z and explore Contracts for Difference (CfDs) to reduce financial risk for producers.

Invest in advanced feedstocks such as cellulosic biomass, algae, and direct air capture through grants and tax credit mechanisms.

Fund infrastructure retrofits at major hubs to enhance SAF blending and storage capabilities.

Strengthen partnerships between airlines, SAF producers, and corporations to promote collaborative offtake agreements and boost Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Fueling the Future of Flight

North American airlines are setting the global pace in the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. Through bold commitments, innovative partnerships, and policy advocacy, they are building the foundation for a low-carbon aviation sector. Yet realizing the full potential of the SAF Market depends on overcoming high costs, scaling feedstock supply, harmonizing policy, and upgrading infrastructure. As these elements align, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry will be poised for exponential growth, enabling aviation to meet its climate goals and reshaping the future of flight.

Investment proposal

The £49bn investment consists of three main elements: £21bn (US$27bn) for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14bn in 2018 due to construction inflation); £12bn (US$16bn) for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X; and £15bn (US$20bn) to modernize the current airport by expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3. The blueprint details a north-western runway up to 3,500m, and increased capacity to accommodate up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers.

According to the airport, a third runway and supporting infrastructure could be ready within a decade, with the full investment across all terminals taking place over the coming decades.

A new road tunnel and plans for two dedicated parkways and improvements to the country’s busiest bus and coach station have also been proposed. Heathrow’s proposals include more choice and capacity on public transportation, such as enhanced rail capacity and walking and cycling routes, reducing local and environmental impacts.

Advantages

The airport says the expansion would add approximately 30 extra daily domestic routes connections and a better selection of flight times to the most popular destinations. Terminals will be more spacious and accessible, and the once-in-a-generation redesign of the airfield will enable flights to take off more quickly.

Once completed, Heathrow’s plans are projected to grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP, adding 50% capacity to the country’s most valuable trading port – already enabling more than £200bn (US$260bn) of annual trade. Expanding Heathrow is expected to deliver new long-haul routes to growing economies and increase cargo capacity by 50%, expanding trading opportunities for businesses of all sizes.

Local employment

The airport has highlighted the tens of thousands of employment opportunities during design, construction and operation. Meanwhile 60% of the wider supply chain spend will go to companies outside London and the South-East. A community fund is being proposed for the airport’s nearest neighbors.

Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Heathrow, said, “It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilize and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.”

Next steps

If the UK government implements the necessary policy changes, Heathrow will consult with airlines, the local community, local authorities, businesses and others from next year. A planning application is expected to be submitted in 2028.

The Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, Make UK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, stated, “The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway – an investment in the nation’s future. The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs and driving skills across the country.”

Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet, added, “Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.”

Sustainable growth

With this proposal, Heathrow has confirmed its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and set targets on noise reduction and air quality. So far, the airport has cut 10% of its carbon from flights since 2019, and 15% of its carbon emissions on the ground. It has plans to further ramp up its world leadership on the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Heathrow’s noise footprint has also reduced by 41% since 2006 and all air quality monitors around the airport are meeting limits.

This proposal is not just an airport expansion—it is an investment in the country’s future.","The London airport of Heathrow unveiled a firm and ready-to-execute proposal this Friday: the construction of a third runway entirely financed with private capital, which could be operational in less than ten years. This project, valued at £21 billion, represents a direct commitment to the economic growth of the UK and its leadership in global connectivity.

More Flights, Better Prices, and Greater Connectivity

The expansion would allow the airport to handle up to 756,000 flights and 150 million passengers annually, unlocking at least 30 new daily routes and strengthening domestic connections. This will translate into more destination options, better schedules, and more competitive fares, thanks to increased competition among airlines.

Additionally, a complete transformation of the airfield is planned, promising faster takeoffs and more spacious, accessible terminals. The new “T5X” terminal, along with the expansion of Terminal 2 and the construction of three satellite terminals, are part of this ambitious overhaul.

Direct and Distributed Economic Impact

The expansion would add 0.43% to the UK’s GDP, with 60% of that benefit generated outside London and the Southeast. Heathrow, already considered the country’s most valuable port with over £200 billion in annual trade, would increase its cargo capacity by 50%.

→ Global Passenger Demand Grows in June, but at a Slower Pace, IATA says

The impact will also be felt in employment: tens of thousands of jobs will be created during the design, construction, and operational phases. Sixty percent of the supply chain spending will benefit companies located outside the London metropolitan area, reinforcing the national character of the project.

Environmental Commitment: Carbon, Noise, and Accessibility

Heathrow is not only betting on growth but also on doing so sustainably. The proposal includes:

A goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

A 10% reduction in flight emissions since 2019 and a 15% reduction in ground emissions.

Promotion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.

A 41% reduction in noise footprint since 2006.

Compliance with air quality limits at all monitoring stations.

Additionally, significant improvements in public transport and airport access will be implemented: increased rail capacity, dedicated cycling and pedestrian routes, a new road tunnel, two dedicated parkways, and upgrades to the busiest bus and coach station in the country.

A Viable, Backed, and Ready Proposal

The plan includes a northwest runway of up to 3,500 meters, an infrastructure already backed by Parliament. Unlike other proposals, Heathrow has years of prior studies and engagement, enabling it to meet government deadlines and begin investments this year, provided the regulatory framework allows it.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye was emphatic: “It’s now or never. We are operating at capacity, affecting trade and connectivity. If the government gives the green light and provides the right regulatory support, we are ready to take off with investments across the country.”

Timeline and Next Steps

2025: Consultation with airlines, local authorities, and the community.

2028: Formal submission of the planning application.

2029: Expected approval.

Next decade: Third runway operational.

The project has the backing of chambers of commerce across the country, unions, educators, and construction sector businesses. All agree that this is a historic opportunity to strengthen access to global markets and secure the UK’s economic future.

An Airport at Capacity, a Nation at Risk

Heathrow currently connects British exporters to 92% of the global economy. Without expansion, the UK risks losing its position as an international hub to European competitors with room to grow.

The expansion plans aim to enable Heathrow to give passengers more choice – at least 30 new daily routes, extra domestic connections and a better selection of flight times to the most popular destinations. Once completed, Heathrow’s plans aim to grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP, add 50% capacity to the country’s most valuable trading port – already enabling more than £200bn of annual trade – while keeping its global competitive edge.

The blueprint submitted to Government today includes:

A north-western runway up to 3,500m – a design that already has Parliamentary support

Increased capacity to serve up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers

A brand-new terminal ‘T5X’, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals

The investment consists of three main elements: £21 billion for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14 billion in 2018 due to construction inflation), £12billion for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X – and £15 billion for modernising the current airport through expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3.

A third runway and supporting infrastructure can be ready within a decade and the full investment across all terminals would take place over the coming decades.

Heathrow’s proposals include more choice and capacity on public transport, such as enhanced rail capacity and walking and cycling routes, reducing local and environmental impacts. A new road tunnel, plans for two dedicated parkways and improvements to the country’s busiest bus and coach station will make it easier to reach the airport.

Crucially, Heathrow is confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and has a deliverable plan to get there, as well as setting targets on noise reduction and air quality. The airport is already ahead of target on its decarbonisation journey, cutting carbon from flights by around 10% since 2019, and carbon on the ground by 15% and has plans to ramp up further its world leadership on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Heathrow’s noise footprint has reduced by 41% since 2006 and all air quality monitors around the airport are meeting limits. A third runway and redesigned airspace will give communities and passengers more certainty and reliability on flight paths.

There will be tens of thousands of employment opportunities during design, construction and operation, unlocking lifelong careers for those who live closest. Meanwhile 60% of the wider supply chain spend will go to companies outside London and the South-East, a truly national endeavour.

For the airport's nearest neighbours, a community fund is being proposed, and Heathrow will continue to engage on how to be a better neighbour to its local community.

An appropriate regulatory framework needs to be put in place – one that encourages growth and investment while remaining affordable for customers – to secure many tens of billions of private capital from equity shareholders and from debt investors.

Feedback from the Government will be required by September to stay on track for Ministers’ set timeline.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said: “It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from Government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country, it is time to clear the way for take-off.”

If the Government implements the necessary policy changes, Heathrow plans to consult with airlines, the local community, local authorities, businesses and others from next year. A planning application is expected to be submitted in 2028.

Support for Heathrow expansion comes from Chambers of Commerce across the whole of the UK, businesses wanting better access to global markets, trade unions reaffirming the career opportunities, while local Chambers of Commerce, educators and construction firms are ready to roll up the sleeves and get to work.

Heathrow has stressed that its role in the country’s economy is unique. Today it connects UK exporters to 92% of the world’s economy in a direct flight. It argues that expanding Heathrow will deliver new long-haul routes to growing economies and increase cargo capacity by 50%, expanding trading opportunities for businesses of all sizes and that without action, the UK is at risk of losing its global aviation hub status in the face of growing competition from European hubs. While international competitors have room to grow, Heathrow is already at capacity. Without expansion the UK’s hub will fall behind, harming opportunities for the country’s economy.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander welcomed the initial proposals for Heathrow expansion. She said: “I am pleased to have received the initial Heathrow expansion proposals - a significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure to drive forward our Plan for Change.

“We'll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year.”

Kenton Jarvis, CEO, easyJet said: ""The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway — an investment in the nation's future.

“Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.”

Amy Smith, Managing Director (Interim), Cornwall Airport Newquay, said: “Cornwall Airport Newquay supports infrastructure development that enables true regional connectivity. The proposed third runway at Heathrow has the potential to deliver meaningful hub access for regions like Cornwall - but only if there is a clear and sustained commitment to slot accessibility and affordability for regional carriers and regional routes. Direct and reliable connectivity to a UK hub is vital for Cornwall’s economy, inward investment and the future of sustainable regional aviation.”",,N,,2025-08-01 21:56:29.829336

Depending on the feedstocks used and the efficiencies built into the production process, our SAF can offer enough carbon abatement and sustainability as attributes that it can be classified as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Since it is ready to replace petroleum-based jet fuel, our ATJ SAF is demonstrated to meet or exceed the standards in ASTM D1655/7566 specification, which specifies blending up to 50 percent (though we’ve flown test aircraft on 100-percent SAF). Here’s a breakdown:

For flash point, the standard stipulates a 38 degrees C minimum, and ATJ is well within acceptable range at 45 to 50 degrees C.

Both also pass the standard for thermal oxidation stability.

For freezing point, the standard requires -40 degrees C maximum for Jet A and -47 degrees C for Jet A-1, and Jet A-1 complies with -50 degrees C, while ATJ is -78 degrees C.

The energy density standard is 42.8 MJ/kg minimum, and Jet A-1 complies with 42.9 MJ/kg, while ATJ has 44.0 MJ/kg.

The total sulfur content standard is 0.3 percent max, while Jet A-1 comes in at 0.05 percent and ATJ rates at less than 0.00 percent.

SAF Opportunities

While the terms Synthetic Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are often used interchangeably, there are important distinctions. Here’s a helpful breakdown of the determining qualifications for each label:

Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Synthetic aviation fuel refers to hydrocarbons created through chemical synthesis. These fuels can be derived from a wide range of sources, not all of which are sustainable, and have the following characteristics:

Usually considered sustainable aviation fuel only if the production process meets sustainability criteria.

Source materials also are a factor in determining the level of sustainability—not considered inherently sustainable unless made from green H₂ and captured CO₂.

Often made from fossil sources, such as coal or natural gas

Examples include:

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) using electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

CTL (Coal-to-Liquid) using coal

GTL (Gas-to-Liquid) using natural gas

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is an umbrella term for aviation fuels that reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. They must meet sustainability criteria, including feedstock origin and carbon intensity over the lifecycle of the product, and have the following characteristics:

Derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks.

Must reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by at least 50 percent (per ICAO CORSIA standards).

Examples include:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) from used cooking oil or animal fats

FT-SPK (Fischer Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) produced through a process called Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which converts synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, into liquid hydrocarbons from solid waste or biomass

ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) converts alcohols like ethanol and butanol, derived from renewable sources, into sustainable aviation fuel

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) use renewable electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

How Does Gevo Fit in the World of SAF?

Gevo Inc. is a U.S.-based company that produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and they fall into the “Alcohol-to-Jet” (ATJ) category, developing both ATJ and Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) pathways.

Gevo SAF at a Glance

Why Gevo’s SAF Is Both Synthetic and Sustainable

Gevo’s process synthesizes jet fuel molecules, but from biologically derived alcohols.

Since the source is renewable (plant-based sugars from regeneratively grown corn) and the process is engineered to minimize emissions, Gevo’s fuel meets sustainability criteria.

Therefore, while it’s chemically synthesized, it is certifiable as sustainable aviation fuel under the ATJ-SPK pathway.

Enap, whose bottom line climbed 84% year-on-year in January-June to US$318mn, has earmarked around 70% of its multibillion-dollar war chest to projects, with the balance assigned for maintenance.

Profit growth drivers were increased sales of added-value products, logistics optimization and lower financial costs linked to a debt-reduction process.

Sustainable fuels

In terms of energy diversification, Enap CEO Julio Friedmann, in response to a BNamericas question during a results presentation, said the company was working on three fronts: renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green hydrogen.

Enap this year announced the launch of a renewable diesel pilot project, employing used cooking oils and infrastructure at its Aconcagua refinery in Valparaíso region. The mining industry was an offtaker of initial production last half, for usage in buses and trucks.

A next phase would involve building a standalone plant.

Echoing comments made by Enap chair Gloria Maldonado earlier in the week, Friedmann said long-term supply contracts would be needed to unlock further investment, adding that renewable diesel production is not something still stuck on the drawing board.

Friedmann said: ""We've got the capacity, today, to produce this renewable diesel; with successful sales and the agreement of long-term supply contracts, we'll be able to finalize the business case to justify the eventual construction of a plant dedicated to renewable diesel

""Depending on sales volumes, on how the market grows, we could, here, think about directing some of the investment plan to increase capacity, dedicated exclusively to renewable diesel.""

In parallel, Enap is sharpening its focus on SAF. The company already supplies the local aviation market with conventional jet fuel.

SAF development would follow a similar trajectory as that of renewable diesel, said Friedmann, adding that conceptual trial work was planned this half.

""We're in talks with airlines, which have expressed interest in the matter,"" Friedmann said.

He said development of this product, like renewable diesel, is not something that is a long way over the horizon.

The UN's civil aviation standards and planning agency, ICAO, is due to publish a Chilean SAF feasibility report this half, BNamericas reported recently. The airline industry aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which will require a major uptick in SAF usage.

In terms of green hydrogen, Enap has begun ground preparation work at its Cabo Negro industrial site in Magallanes region, where a 1.2MW electrolyzer is due for installation by the end of the year. Output from the US$12mn wind-powered pilot facility, whose construction contract was awarded to Germany's Neuman & Esser, will initially be used in Enap industrial processes, with scope to potentially deploy it elsewhere in the region. Enap staff are receiving technical training.

The Enap facility will join HIF's Haru Oni e-fuels demonstration plant, also in Magallanes.

Refining

Another major pillar is refinery modernization and operational flexibility work, with goals including boosting capacity to process a wider range of crude.

In terms of flexibility, Friedmann referred to the need to mitigate global price and product volatility: ""So we've invested, and that's how it's going to continue. For example, we call it a retrofit – replacing some of the internal components of existing equipment so that we can, for instance, process a wider range of crude oils.""

Logistics, exports

Increasing logistics efficiency is also a key pillar. Enap has 11 ships and four maritime terminals, along with storage infrastructure.

""We're going to place a strong emphasis on modernizing our logistics infrastructure,"" Friedmann said. ""We want it to be more efficient, whether through our own investment plan or through partnerships with third parties we're working with. There's nothing we can announce at this time, as it always involves ongoing discussions and confidentiality agreements, but it's something we're actively working on as well.""

In the sphere of logistics efficiency, Enap is seeking the environmental green light to carry out a US$60mn dredging project at its San Vicente crude and fuel terminal in Biobío region to support the access of larger crude carriers.

""Our investment plan takes into account this dredging work,"" said Friedmann, who added work was underway to boost operational flexibility of the terminal.

This falls under a wider plan to have capacity to potentially export crude. Enap has ramped up oil imports from Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play via the 110,000b/d Otasa duct, in which it is a stakeholder, along with YPF and Chevron.

In May, 12,000m3/d (75,477b/d) was exported to Enap's Biobío region refinery via the Otasa pipeline, according to data from Argentina's federal energy department.

About 30% of crude refined in Chile today comes from Vaca Muerta. Enap will retain capacity to obtain crude from diverse sources, such as Brazil and Ecuador.

A potential Otasa capacity expansion is being considered.

Upstream

In Chile, Enap operates in the upstream segment in Magallanes region, where the gas it produces supplies local offtakers, among them methanol producer Methanex.

A chunk of cash is earmarked for keeping gas flowing and replacing reserves both in Chile and elsewhere. After exiting Argentina, in terms of its international upstream footprint, Enap today has assets in Ecuador and Egypt.

Friedmann said: ""Part of the investment plan also involves Magallanes and ensuring the long-term supply for that region. Remember, that region is 100% dependent on natural gas production, and also Methanex, which is a private company.""

He added: ""And in our international operations, we've also made it a priority to see how we can responsibly replace reserves – whether through organic or inorganic growth – and that may also require a portion of our investment plan.""

At the end of December, Enap's total reserves stood at 121Mboe, chiefly spread across Chile and Ecuador. In 2024, Enap oil production in Chile was 23,000boe/d (20,000boe/d gas and the balance crude).

Refining capacity is around 224,000b/d, spread across three facilities.",https://cdnimg.bnamericas.com/tHTLxnvmPqLfzCmnIVzZTEwOUWmndaNZJhPnODUpmVSceUQWyUKZZmkzzbRpHroo.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:56:33.050738

As the UK government weighs final approval by September 2025, investors and policymakers must assess how this £49 billion endeavor could reshape asset values, industrial demand, and economic connectivity across the country.

Strategic Implications for Real Estate Markets

Heathrow's expansion is already triggering a seismic shift in the West London industrial real estate landscape. Over 850,000 sq. ft. of industrial space within the development zone faces potential displacement, forcing occupiers to relocate to areas like Slough and Reading. This migration is tightening supply in these hubs, driving industrial rents upward. For instance, Slough currently commands £23–£28 per sq. ft., while Park Royal and Uxbridge see rates above £30 per sq. ft. Analysts project further increases as demand intensifies, creating a compelling case for investors to target logistics and warehousing assets in these regions.

The ripple effects extend beyond commercial property. As businesses and their workforces relocate, residential demand in Slough and Reading is likely to rise, buoyed by improved transport links and infrastructure upgrades. While the government has yet to finalize flight paths, the anticipation of increased economic activity alone could spur speculative development in these areas. Investors should monitor local planning decisions and housing supply trends, as residential property values may outpace national averages over the next five years.

Aviation and Environmental Considerations

Heathrow's third runway aims to elevate the UK's global aviation dominance, supporting up to 756,000 flights annually and connecting 92% of the world's economy to the UK. This expansion aligns with the government's broader Airports National Policy Statement, which prioritizes connectivity and economic growth. However, the project faces scrutiny over its carbon footprint. Heathrow's net-zero pledge by 2050 hinges on aggressive adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which currently accounts for less than 1% of jet fuel. The UK's £63 million Advanced Fuels Fund in 2025-26 is a step forward, but scalability remains a challenge.

Investors in the aviation sector must balance the short-term gains from increased passenger and freight traffic against long-term environmental risks. Airlines operating at Heathrow, including British Airways and easyJet, may benefit from expanded routes but could face pressure to offset emissions through SAF investments or carbon credits.

Regional Economic Growth and Diversification

The project's economic benefits are projected to extend beyond London, with 60% of the GDP uplift expected in regions like the Southeast. This aligns with the UK's “levelling up” agenda, aiming to reduce regional disparities. For instance, the relocation of the M25 motorway to a tunnel under the new runway could catalyze industrial growth in nearby areas, while the £15 billion modernization of existing infrastructure will create jobs and stimulate demand for construction materials.

Competing proposals, such as the Arora Group's shorter runway, highlight the government's dilemma between cost efficiency and long-term capacity. Investors should closely follow the September 2025 decision, as it will determine the pace and scale of economic activity.

Investment Opportunities and Risks

Industrial Real Estate: Focus on logistics hubs in Slough, Reading, and Uxbridge, where demand is surging. Consider REITs or private equity funds targeting UK industrial assets.

Infrastructure Providers: Companies involved in airport construction, such as Balfour Beatty or VINCI, could see increased contracts.

Sustainable Aviation: Invest in SAF producers or airlines prioritizing green technology, though this sector remains high-risk.

Regional Development: Monitor freeport-linked projects in Thames, Liverpool, and Teesside, which align with the government's industrial strategy.

Conclusion

Heathrow's third runway is a transformative project with the potential to unlock £49 billion in economic value and reshape the UK's real estate and aviation sectors. While environmental and political challenges persist, the project's strategic importance for global connectivity and regional growth cannot be overstated. Investors who position themselves early in logistics hubs and sustainable aviation may reap significant rewards, provided they navigate the uncertainties of regulatory outcomes and market dynamics. As the UK charts its post-Brexit economic path, Heathrow's expansion offers a rare opportunity to align infrastructure investment with long-term strategic goals.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 04:56:47.998656

The 21 billion GBP runway proposal forms part of a broader £49 billion investment plan to expand capacity and modernise infrastructure at the UK’s busiest airport.
The plan is privately financed and includes a new 3,500-metre north-west runway, a new terminal T5X, and upgrades to existing terminal facilities.
According to Heathrow, the expansion could enable up to 756,000 flights and 150 million passengers per year.
Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said: It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow.","Heathrow Airport has submitted updated proposals for a third runway, stating it could be operational within ten years if the UK Government puts in place the required regulatory and policy framework.

The 21 billion GBP runway proposal forms part of a broader £49 billion investment plan to expand capacity and modernise infrastructure at the UK’s busiest airport.

The plan is privately financed and includes a new 3,500-metre north-west runway, a new terminal T5X, and upgrades to existing terminal facilities. According to Heathrow, the expansion could enable up to 756,000 flights and 150 million passengers per year.

The airport says the project is “shovel-ready”, with many technical studies and consultations already undertaken. If Government feedback is received by September, Heathrow expects to begin wider engagement with airlines, local authorities, businesses and communities from 2026, and submit a formal planning application by 2028.

Heathrow estimates the expansion would contribute around 0.43% to UK GDP, with 60% of economic benefits occurring outside London and the South East. The airport also expects to create employment opportunities through construction and operations, including across its national supply chain.

Additional capacity is intended to support up to 30 new destinations and strengthen domestic connectivity. Heathrow claims increased competition from more airlines operating at the airport would offer passengers a wider choice and could place downward pressure on fares.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said:

It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from Government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.

Transport and Environmental Commitments

Despite the controversy of the third-runway plans, the proposals include commitments to the environment and surrounding transport networks. These include improvements to surface transport connections, such as rail capacity enhancements, a new road tunnel, two new parkways, and expanded walking and cycling routes. Plans also involve upgrades to Heathrow’s bus and coach station to improve access for passengers and airport staff.

Environmental measures form part of the submission, including a target for net zero emissions by 2050. Heathrow reports it has already reduced carbon emissions from aircraft by 10% and ground operations by 15% compared with 2019 levels. It plans further use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and airspace redesigns intended to improve reliability and reduce community disruption.

The airport’s noise footprint has reportedly reduced by 41% since 2006, and all current air quality monitoring stations are said to be within legal limits.

Heathrow is now awaiting the Government’s response to keep the project aligned with their proposed roadmap. The airport operator has said it is ready to begin early-stage investment and supply chain mobilisation before the end of this year, subject to policy clarity and regulatory alignment.

The total 49 billion GBP investment comprises:

21 billion GBP for the runway and associated airfield infrastructure

12 billion GBP for the new terminal and additional stand capacity

15 billion GBP for modernisation of existing infrastructure, including a major redevelopment of Terminal 2 and phased closure of Terminal 3

The figures include inflationary increases since previous estimates in 2018 and are subject to adjustment as design and regulatory processes progress.
