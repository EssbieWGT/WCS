During its meeting Monday, Sept. 8, city council members voted unanimously to authorize city staff to enter into an option agreement with DG Fuels, a sustainable aviation fuel company that has expressed interest in building a $5 billion production facility in Moorhead. Council member Lisa Borgen was not at the meeting.

In November 2024, Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels announced it had picked Moorhead as the site of a facility to produce low-carbon aviation fuel. The proposed facility will produce around 193 million gallons of fuel annually, according to the company’s announcement. Production is expected to begin in 2030.

The plant would use biomass, including materials left in the field after corn harvest and timber waste, to produce near-zero carbon fuel, the announcement said.

Derrick LaPoint, president and CEO of Downtown Moorhead Inc., told The Forum the agreement will allow DG Fuels to hold the land. Through the agreement, the city of Moorhead will not be able to sell the land to another party without notifying DG Fuels, he explained.

“It’s really a tactic to allow time for them to do due diligence on the land, check on permitting and environmental and all that kind of stuff,” LaPoint said. “Then ultimately, if that’s satisfying to them, then we work towards entering a purchase agreement with them.”

DG Fuels is interested in a tract of land that stretches from Moorhead’s new industrial park to the Moorhead Municipal Airport. According to LaPoint, the parcel includes 554 acres of land.

LaPoint told city council members that DG Fuels Chairman Michael Darcy requested the agreement as part of an application for federal Energy Department tax credits. To continue with the application, the company has to show site control, he said.

“We feel that this is low risk to the city of Moorhead,” LaPoint said. “We feel that this is a great first step and really kind of securing some time and due diligence needed to make sure that this project can move forward in a real detailed way.”

In the coming months, the city will explore details of the proposed development, including its size, timeline and infrastructure needs, like power, water and wastewater, LaPoint said.

There is a payment tied to the agreement, LaPoint said, but an amount has not yet been finalized. If DG Fuels decides to purchase the property, the payment will be applied to the purchase price, according to the City Council packet.

LaPoint said the agreement will be for 12 months, but will be extendable.

Provisional data suggests SAF made up just 2% of aviation fuel supplies in 2023, up slightly from 1% the year before.

Current use: SAF made up just 2% of UK aviation fuel in 2023.
For airlines, the warning is stark: without greater government support and faster investment in domestic production, net zero targets may soon slip out of reach.","Britain’s aviation industry is sounding the alarm over the Government’s net zero targets, warning that without urgent action the country risks falling behind its climate pledges.

Two of the UK’s largest carriers, Virgin Atlantic and International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways – have raised concerns that the Government’s 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate for 2030 is becoming increasingly unrealistic.

At a global SAF summit in London, airline executives warned of a widening “credibility gap” between the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals and the actual pace of fuel production. Despite the UK government mandating that one in ten litres of jet fuel must come from sustainable sources by the end of the decade, not a single SAF production plant has yet been built on British soil.

For Virgin Atlantic, the issue is one of trust. Holly Boyd-Boland, vice president of corporate development, told delegates that airlines risk reaching an inflection point where they can no longer convincingly claim they are on track for net zero.

“We’re at risk of a growing credibility gap for us as a sector in terms of where we set our ambition and what we actually deliver,” she said. “From a consumer perspective and wider stakeholders, we’re getting close to an inflection point where we cannot demonstrate supply in the system and a reduction in emissions.”

IAG’s group head of sustainability, Jonathon Counsell, highlighted just how steep the climb will be. Global SAF production stood at 1 million tonnes in 2023 – a fraction of the 400–500 million tonnes per year that would be required to hit global net zero targets by 2050.

IAG, which last year used more SAF than any other airline group at 162,000 tonnes, has attempted to lock in supply through contracts extending as long as 14 years. But Counsell admitted these deals were hard-fought internally. “It took five board meetings to get approval,” he said, citing fears that governments could soften mandates in the future, leaving those who invested early exposed to higher costs than rivals.

The situation has been compounded by last week’s announcement from Shell that it would abandon plans for a major biofuels plant in Rotterdam. Once touted as one of Europe’s largest SAF facilities, Shell concluded the project was too costly and “insufficiently competitive.”

For analysts, Shell’s retreat underscored the fragility of the sector. Ashley Kelty, energy analyst at Panmure Liberum, described it as “another nail in the ideological coffin” for SAF. The immediate consequence is that supplies will remain scarce and prices high, making it even harder for airlines to deliver on their green promises.

Boyd-Boland flagged another hurdle on the horizon: the UK’s decision to cap the use of SAF derived from used cooking oils and animal fats from 2027. Beyond that date, the country will need to pivot toward second-generation fuels made from municipal waste, non-edible crops and biomass. Yet Britain has no production capacity for these next-generation fuels.

Although the Government has earmarked £63 million for 17 prospective plants, none has yet secured a final investment decision – and industry insiders warn the clock is ticking.

From the European side, Dutch airline KLM’s sustainability chief Zita Schellekens said SAF still held the potential to be aviation’s “silver bullet.” But she cautioned that scaling up production required governments to play a much more active role in de-risking investment.

“This is a critical year,” she said. “The situation isn’t looking very favourable at all. Suppliers are taking a wait-and-see approach. We need more government intervention. More carrots.”

Consumer buy-in also remains weak. KLM revealed that just 1% of passengers opted to pay a surcharge for SAF, with many sceptical about whether their money would genuinely be used to buy cleaner fuel.

The Department for Transport insists progress is being made. A spokesman said: “SAF is a core part of the global drive to decarbonise aviation. SAF is already being produced and supplied at scale in the UK and we are seeing encouraging early signs that the SAF mandate will be met.”

But the industry’s scepticism tells a different story. Provisional data suggests SAF made up just 2% of aviation fuel supplies in 2023, up slightly from 1% the year before. That leaves a daunting trajectory to reach 10% in just seven years.

UK SAF challenge at a glance

Mandate: UK requires airlines to use 10% SAF by 2030.

Current use: SAF made up just 2% of UK aviation fuel in 2023.

Global supply: 1m tonnes produced worldwide in 2023 vs 400–500m tonnes needed annually by 2050.

Shell exit: Oil giant cancels Rotterdam plant, warning of high costs and weak competitiveness.

Domestic plants: 17 prospective UK facilities, £63m pledged, but none with final investment decision.

Future fuels: From 2027, UK will cap cooking oil and animal fat fuels, forcing shift to waste and biomass — where Britain has zero capacity.

For airlines, the warning is stark: without greater government support and faster investment in domestic production, net zero targets may soon slip out of reach. The fear is not only reputational but also competitive. If the UK lags behind Europe and the US in scaling up SAF, it risks losing both investment and influence in shaping global aviation policy.

As Virgin, IAG and KLM made clear, the industry wants to lead the decarbonisation drive. But ambition without supply is meaningless. Unless Britain’s SAF sector gets off the ground, the promise of sustainable flying may prove a mirage — and net zero aviation by 2050 could remain little more than a flight of fancy.",https://travellingforbusiness.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Virgin_SAF_100-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 19:56:20.098566

US Japan Trade Framework Implemented in Executive Order","In a major development for international trade and domestic economic growth, President Trump signed an executive order last week implementing the U.S.-Japan trade framework agreement announced in late July. This new trade deal is valued at over $15 billion and marks a significant step in strengthening economic ties between the United States and Japan.

The agreement secures vital access to Japanese markets for American exporters. As outlined in the deal, “American farmers and producers will immediately benefit from the deal with Japan’s commitment to purchase $8 billion of U.S. agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizers, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel; Japan will make stable and long-term incremental purchases of U.S. energy, including liquified natural gas, totaling $7 billion per year; and Japan will expedite implementation of a 75% increase in purchases of American rice, among others.”

The executive order also introduces new U.S. tariffs. The United States will apply a 15% baseline tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, including automobiles and auto parts, with additional sector-specific tariffs on other goods to protect and support domestic industries.

According to the White House, “Japan’s historic $550 billion investment commitment to President Trump will be invested in U.S. projects selected by President Trump, creating hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, dramatically expanding domestic manufacturing, and securing American prosperity for generations.”

This historic U.S.-Japan trade agreement is being praised across sectors, especially in agriculture. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins posted on X: “Huge Win for America’s farmers and ranchers. Our ally Japan just delivered MAJOR market access. This is what strong trade leadership looks like! Thank you President Trump for putting America’s farmers FIRST! I’ll be in Japan in just a few weeks to build on this historic trade deal working to deliver immediate market access for America’s farmers and ranchers. Standby!”

CONTACT: Michael Lee CEO, UMeWorld Limited Email: info@umeworld.com","MIAMI, Sept. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF), a public company engaged in functional nutrition and sustainable biofuel innovation, today provided a comprehensive corporate update.

UMeWorld operates a dual-growth platform powered by a single proprietary enzymatic technology. This breakthrough process enables the Company to deliver both DAGola™ functional cooking oils, clinically validated to improve metabolic health, and enzymatic biofuels, designed to convert low-cost feedstocks into sustainable biodiesel. This “one technology, two markets” strategy uniquely positions UMeWorld at the intersection of wellness and sustainability, offering investors exposure to both consumer health and renewable energy.

Alongside operational progress, UMeWorld also announced its intention to redomicile from the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) to the State of Delaware, USA as part of its long-term growth strategy and preparation for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange.

DAGola Functional Cooking Oils

UMeWorld’s flagship brand, DAGola™, continues to gain traction in the fast-growing functional foods sector. The brand has received strong reviews on Amazon, validating both product quality and consumer demand. To accelerate growth, the Company is preparing a micro-influencer marketing campaign aimed at expanding awareness and engagement across social media platforms.

A major milestone is expected in Q4 2025, when DAGola sales in China are scheduled to begin through a local established sales platform with a proven distribution network. This launch will be supported by targeted digital marketing and e-commerce initiatives. Looking further ahead, management plans to expand DAGola into Southeast Asia and the EU in 2026, building on rising demand for healthier edible oils and leveraging clinical validation.

Timeline Roadmap:

Now (2025): Scaling U.S. sales through Amazon and direct-to-consumer channels.

Q4 2025: China launch with local distribution and integrated digital campaigns.

2026: Expansion into Japan, Korea and EU markets.

The global edible oil market is valued at more than $250 billion annually, while the functional foods sector exceeds $150 billion. With clinically validated benefits - including up to 80% less triglycerides and proven improvements in metabolic health - DAGola is well-positioned to capture share within these large, growing markets.

Biofuel Pilot Plant in Malaysia

Building on the same enzymatic technology that powers DAGola, UMeWorld is expanding into the renewable energy sector. Preparations are underway to establish the Company’s first biofuel pilot plant in Malaysia, with a planned production capacity of 1,000 to 5,000 tonnes per year.

The pilot plant will focus on converting palm oil mill effluent (POME), used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, and other low-cost feedstocks into sustainable biodiesel. A key objective of the facility is to obtain EU and U.S. certification for UMeWorld’s enzymatic biofuel, which will pave the way for access to premium markets and carbon credit opportunities. Achieving certification will also serve as the foundation for developing a full-scale commercial plant that meets international standards.

Timeline Roadmap:

2025–2026 (12–18 months): Pilot plant development and certification process.

2027–2028 (2–3 years): Planning and execution of a commercial-scale facility meeting EU/US standards.

Beyond 2028: Expansion opportunities into U.S., EU, and Asia-Pacific markets.

The global biodiesel market is projected to exceed $90 billion by 2030, driven by strong EU and U.S. mandates for renewable energy adoption. By focusing on low-cost, waste-based feedstocks, UMeWorld aims to deliver both cost efficiency and sustainability advantages over conventional chemical and HVO-based biodiesel production methods.

Future Potential: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Beyond biodiesel, UMeWorld’s enzymatic process is also adaptable to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets. By pre-treating difficult feedstocks such as POME, UCO, and animal fats under mild, selective conditions, the Company’s technology can produce cleaner intermediates that integrate seamlessly with established hydroprocessing steps used in SAF production. Global aviation regulators and airlines are committing to ambitious carbon reduction goals, with SAF expected to represent a growing share of jet fuel consumption by 2030. UMeWorld’s long-term strategy includes exploring SAF pathways, positioning the Company to potentially supply low-carbon aviation fuel to premium international markets and form strategic partnerships with refiners and airlines.

Redomiciliation to Delaware

In parallel with these operational initiatives, UMeWorld is taking a major step to strengthen its corporate governance and capital markets profile. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a plan to redomicile through a statutory merger and share exchange. Upon completion, all outstanding shares of UMeWorld Limited (BVI) will be exchanged for shares of a newly incorporated Delaware entity, UMeWorld Inc.

Redomiciling to Delaware will provide the Company with a stronger corporate governance framework, greater transparency, and closer alignment with U.S. investor expectations. Most importantly, it establishes the structural foundation necessary for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq.

“Redomiciling to Delaware is not just a legal formality,” said Michael Lee, CEO of UMeWorld Limited. “It’s a strategic milestone that enhances our credibility, strengthens our corporate foundation, and positions UMeWorld to engage more fully with U.S. capital markets. Alongside DAGola’s growth and our biofuel expansion, this move sets the stage for long-term value creation.”

The redomiciliation is subject to customary shareholder approval and regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). UMeWorld will provide further details, including anticipated timelines and shareholder instructions, in upcoming communications.

President and CEO Derrick LaPoint first told The Flag about DG Fuels and their plan to build a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production facility near the Moorhead Municipal Airport.

According to the company, the plant will convert so-called ‘biomass’ agricultural by-products and clean hydrogen to produce high-value fuel.

On Tuesday night, the Moorhead City Council is expected to process an option agreement for 550 acres of land near the airport.

The approval would be a precursor to the actual purchase of the land by DG Fuels.

“We felt it was an appropriate next step to take this option agreement,” said LaPoint.

“We’re talking about a five to seven billion dollar plant that’s going to be constructed [which will come with] a lot of jobs, a lot of power and a lot of water. Those are all things that we have to figure out and have a plan for over the next twelve months.”

LaPoint says that includes “what that full infrastructure need is going to be.”

Production at the plant is expected to begin in 2030 according to DG Fuels.

Meanwhile, LaPoint says White Earth Nation is conducting a market survey to figure out how to build a casino and convention center on almost 300 acres of land the tribe purchased in Moorhead in December 2024.

“A casino doesn’t need that much land, but they’re trying to figure out the size of a hotel, convention center or an event space and the footprint of the casino,” said LaPoint. “There’s also been talk of a water park and other amenities as well.”

And as Fargo considers a site for its own new convention center, LaPoint says they’re coordinating conversations between the city and the tribe.

“We don’t see it as a competition,” said LaPoint. “We certainly don’t want to overlap. We want to make sure it’s complimentary and the tribe is well aware of that”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2327/2025/03/03222313/untitled-design-40.png,N,,2025-09-08 15:56:42.363997

From 2029, Verso will supply at least 6,000 tonnes of green hydrogen from its Carling Hydrogen Next Generation (CarlHYng) project in France.

The green hydrogen will supply SHS Group’s Saarland steelmakers, including Dillinger’s heavy plate production, Saarstahl’s long products and the joint venture ROGESA. Each company is transitioning under the government-backed Power4Steel decarbonisation programme.

Verso plans to flow the hydrogen through the cross-border mosaHYc pipeline into the Dillingen steel plant, before being distributed across SHS’ facilities. The volumes will be used alongside scrap metal in new direct reduction and electric arc furnaces to reduce CO2 emissions.

The energy firm specified that the green hydrogen will be developed to meet the EU Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) criteria. The electrolyser plant is currently at the development stage.

The mosaHYc pipeline, however, was commissioned last year, meaning the transport infrastructure is in place ahead of the plant construction.

“For Saarstahl and Dillinger, there is only one direction: forward,” said Stefan Rauber, SHS Managing Director. “The availability of renewable hydrogen is an important criterion for the success of our Power4Steel decarbonisation project.

“[The group] will offer customers a high-quality portfolio of CO2-reduced steel products.”

Xavier Caïtucoli, Verso Energy’s President, said the contract and CarlHYng project “confirm the company’s trajectory,” as it aims to become a European leader in the production of low-carbon fuels.

Beyond CarlHYng, Verso is advancing four hydrogen-based e-SAF projects in France, with additional plans for one in the US and two in Finland.

Now, this new capability extends the company’s reach into the HEFA pathway, a vital route for global SAF supply.","LanzaTech Global, Inc., a recognized leader in carbon management solutions, has announced a major technological milestone that could reshape both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and industries heavily reliant on palm oil. The company, already well-known for commercializing its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process to convert ethanol into SAF, has now expanded its technological reach by enabling production through the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. This achievement not only boosts aviation decarbonization efforts but also introduces a sustainable substitute for palm oil—an ingredient linked to deforestation and environmental degradation.

This innovation was developed in partnership with the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB and the Mibelle Group. Together, the organizations have created a palm oil alternative that preserves critical functional properties, particularly those demanded by the cosmetics industry. Beyond its industrial application, the development offers a novel pathway for producing SAF without relying on traditional oil crops or waste oils, which face limitations in scalability and sustainability.

Peter Müller, CEO of the Mibelle Group, emphasized the significance of this milestone, describing it as a new benchmark for the cosmetics sector. He highlighted the collaboration’s potential to enhance supply chain resilience while contributing to environmental responsibility. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, echoed this sentiment, underscoring how the partnership exemplifies the power of innovative alliances to generate wide-ranging impacts—from reducing reliance on deforestation-linked ingredients to unlocking sustainable aviation fuel opportunities.

Tackling Palm Oil’s Environmental Burden

Palm oil remains a key global raw material thanks to its durability, heat resistance, and high yield. However, its widespread use has fueled extensive deforestation, habitat destruction, and significant CO2 emissions. These concerns have created urgent demand for scalable alternatives that reduce environmental harm while maintaining industrial utility.

The joint breakthrough addresses this challenge through a unique dual fermentation process pioneered by LanzaTech and Fraunhofer IGB. The method converts waste CO2 gases into alcohol, which is subsequently processed by non-GMO oil yeasts into a fat structurally similar to palm oil. After successful laboratory-scale demonstrations at Fraunhofer IGB and positive application trials at Mibelle Group laboratories, the project has advanced to pilot-scale production at Fraunhofer’s Center for Chemical-Biotechnological Processes in Leuna. This scale-up marks a critical step toward full commercial deployment.

Expanding Pathways for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

LanzaTech’s ethanol is already well established as a feedstock for SAF via the ATJ route. When derived from CO2 and green hydrogen, it can also produce e-fuels. Now, this new capability extends the company’s reach into the HEFA pathway, a vital route for global SAF supply. By converting ethanol into synthetic oils that mimic conventional HEFA feedstocks, LanzaTech can broaden the available resources for SAF production, offering a sustainable and circular alternative.

This breakthrough strengthens LanzaTech’s leadership in the SAF market while providing airlines and fuel producers with a practical solution for meeting decarbonization goals. The innovation demonstrates how carbon recycling technologies can have cross-sectoral impacts, delivering value to both energy and consumer goods industries while driving progress toward a more sustainable future.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-08 12:56:52.704063

Known as SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach, the system is designed to aid pilots in optimizing their fuel usage by analyzing their performance flight-by-flight.

In recent years, sustainability has become an increasingly important buzzword in the dynamic and diverse world of the commercial aviation industry, as airlines and airports around the world race to reach the sector's shared goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. While this is a huge challenge, it is certainly true that every little helps, and little steps such as these can make a big difference when extrapolated.

JetBlue Is The First US Airline To Implement This System

As confirmed earlier today in a statement released by the New York-based hybrid airline, JetBlue has become the first US carrier to integrate the SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach tool into its operations. This innovative and widely-used application, JetBlue explains, ""enables pilots to analyze their individual fuel performance on past flights and receive tailored recommendations to improve future fuel consumption.""

With this system already having been put to use by more than 75 airlines worldwide, JetBlue is blazing the trail on this front in the US as it ramps up its sustainability efforts. Chris Lum, a System Chief Pilot at JetBlue, explains that ""small gains in efficiency can translate into major savings"" when using the SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach tool in everyday operations. Commenting on its rollout, he states that:

""With access to SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach on the flight deck, our pilots have access to real-time performance insights that help them refine their procedures and contribute to our JetForward strategy, strengthening our financial foundation through cost savings while also meaningfully addressing our emissions.""

All About SkyBreathe

SkyBreathe offers more than just the MyFuelCoach application when it comes to its efforts in helping airlines around the world to boost their sustainability credentials. Indeed, JetBlue noted in its statement earlier today that its partnership also uses ""the SkyBreathe 360 dashboard to identify broader operational trends.""

This portal, the carrier explains, dives deeper into the data, and, beyond identifying areas where individual pilots can save fuel on a flight-by-flight basis, it also looks to highlight deeper trends. According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, JetBlue has scheduled 4,950 flights this week, giving it plenty of data to work with.

For instance, the data harnessed in this way can be used to refine taxi procedures. JetBlue also highlights the fact that, on a broader level, it can help the carrier identify airports that are prone to congestion. Using this information, it can then adjust its schedules to prevent ground delays and long taxis, thus saving fuel.

JetBlue Is Already Seeing Benefits From Its Partnership With SkyBreathe

Regular readers of Simple Flying will know that JetBlue has taken various steps in the last few years to boost its sustainability credentials. As long ago as 2020, the carrier revealed its ambitions to become the first carbon-neutral US airline, later saying that COVID-19 wouldn't derail these plans. More recently, March this year saw it take its first regular supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at New York JFK.

As such, the fact that it has added another string to its sustainability bow in the form of its new partnership with SkyBreathe doesn't exactly come as a surprise. As it happens, this is an agreement that has already seen JetBlue reap rewards.

Indeed, the airline, which is already saving 15,000 gallons of fuel a month by championing single-engine taxiing, revealed today that, by working with SkyBreathe, it has been able to harness historical flight data to add another 73,000 gallons of monthly savings to its books. This equates to over 700 tons of CO2 a year.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/jetblue-embraer-e190.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-08 12:56:56.735729

Zacks Investment Research","As industries across the board race toward a carbon-neutral era, the global aviation industry, with its aspiration to achieve full decarbonization by 2050, has been driving the demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Being a prominent leader in this industry, The Boeing Company (BA) thus has been playing a crucial role in making SAF a reality.

In particular, commercial aviation, responsible for 2-3% of global CO??? emissions, is facing growing pressure to adopt cleaner fuels. However, although SAF offers up to 80% lifecycle emission reduction without aircraft modifications, its production remains below 1% of global jet fuel demand.

Boeing has spearheaded efforts to bridge this gap for over a decade. In 2008, it conducted the world’s first commercial SAF test flight with Virgin Atlantic and GE Aviation. A decade later, its ecoDemonstrator program performed the first commercial flight using 100% SAF on a 777 Freighter with FedEx.

In 2023, Boeing partnered with NASA and United Airlines to study how SAF affects contrails and non-carbon emissions. The following year, it agreed to purchase 9.4 million gallons of blended SAF — its largest annual commitment to date.

Most recently, in January 2025, Boeing partnered with Norway’s Norsk e-Fuel to develop one of Europe’s first large-scale e-SAF production facilities, accelerating the availability of electro-fuels and supporting deeper decarbonization of aviation.

Looking ahead, Boeing’s commitment includes ensuring that all its new aircraft are 100% SAF-capable by 2030. This, along with its aforementioned initiatives, underscores the jet maker’s critical role in making SAF a cornerstone of aviation’s sustainable future.

Other Stocks to Watch

With SAF being a critical driver of future commercial aviation, apart from Boeing, other aerospace stocks like Airbus (EADSY) and Embraer (ERJ) are also undertaking significant SAF-related initiatives and thus warrant a look.

Notably, all Airbus aircraft are currently capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of SAF and conventional fuel. By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters are projected to be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF. In March 2025, Airbus took a significant step toward scaling the adoption of SAF by testing a new “Book and Claim” approach to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide.

On the other hand, Embraer’s E2 family of aircraft is certified to fly with blends of up to 50% SAF and is currently in the process of being fully certified to fly on 100%. ERJ has been using SAF in operations since 2021 and aims to reach at least 25% by 2040. In June 2024, Embraer agreed with Ann Arbor to increase its uptake of SAF at Melbourne Orlando International Airport in Florida to one load per week.

To mitigate aviation-related climate effects, the civil aviation sector has been promoting the development of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
The quality of the sustainable fuels is very high and there is no technical barrier to their use in military aviation.
The question is: to what extent can the climate and environmental impact of military aviation operations be reduced if sustainable aviation fuels are introduced?
SAFs will not make military aviation climate neutral, but they could substantially reduce its environmental footprint at a time when both security and sustainability are pressing concerns.","Military aircraft – from fighter jets to transport planes – are playing a significant role in today’s unstable world. Cumulatively, the operations carried out by these fleets, from combat missions to training flights, consume large amounts of fossil fuel.

Nevertheless, military aviation is rarely included in national climate inventories. In addition to greenhouse gases, aviation also emits other pollutants such as soot and particles, which affect both climate and air quality, and have detrimental effects on human health and ecosystems.

Recently, the UK government announced that it would purchase 12 F-35A fighter aircraft, some of which will be used to reduce a backlog in pilot training. The F-35A is the standard variant of the F-35 fighter jet.

While the decision is primarily motivated by defence and alliance commitments, it also has environmental implications. Expanding training activities will increase the number of flight hours, and consequently, fuel use and emissions. Fighter jets consume large quantities of fuel per flight hour.

The combustion process in aircraft engines releases carbon dioxide (CO₂), but the impact on the climate and environment extends further: emissions of soot particles, nitrogen oxide compounds, water vapour and sulphuric compounds influence atmospheric chemistry and cloud formation.

The persistent contrails and the cirrus clouds they generate are estimated to cause an impact on the climate comparable in magnitude to the warming effect of CO₂ from commercial aviation.

Any assessment of mitigation options must therefore consider both CO₂ and non-CO₂ effects arising from aircraft engine combustion. To mitigate aviation-related climate effects, the civil aviation sector has been promoting the development of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

When produced from waste oils or residues, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (Hefa) fuels – which are forms of sustainable aviation fuel – typically achieve 50–70% lower life-cycle CO₂ emissions compared with fossil-based jet fuel. Synthetic aviation fuels known as advanced power-to-liquid (PtL) e-fuels, produced using renewable electricity, could reduce emissions by more than 80%, though they are not yet available at scale.

Wars and climate change are inextricably linked. Climate change can increase the likelihood of violent conflict by intensifying resource scarcity and displacement, while conflict itself accelerates environmental damage. This article is part of a series, War on climate, which explores the relationship between climate issues and global conflicts.

In addition to a lower carbon footprint compared to fossil fuels, SAFs have also been shown to produce fewer soot particles during combustion, reducing the likelihood and severity of contrails and cirrus clouds.

For technical reasons, down to the specific molecular composition SAF compared to fossil based jet fuel, commercial SAFs are currently not certified as standalone fuels. However, they are available for blends of up to 50% along with fossil-based jet fuels.

The quality of the sustainable fuels is very high and there is no technical barrier to their use in military aviation. The question is: to what extent can the climate and environmental impact of military aviation operations be reduced if sustainable aviation fuels are introduced?

Sustainable fuel and the F-35

Let’s take the example of the F-35, which was the aircraft purchased recently by the UK government. Under certain conditions, the F-35 can burn five tonnes of jet fuel in a single sortie lasting an hour. For comparison, a diesel car like the Volvo V70 would, in its whole lifespan, burn an amount of fuel corresponding to just four hours of combat manoeuvring with the F-35.

Technically, the F-35 is already approved to operate on blends of conventional kerosene and certified synthetic fuels. Similar to civil aviation standards, military standards allow for blending ratios of up to 50%, depending on the production pathway.

No modifications to engines or fuel systems are required. F-35 flights that used commercially available fuel with 40% SAF were carried out by the Norwegian Air Force in early 2025.

There are no significant technical barriers to the new F-35A aircraft entering UK service to operate on commercially available SAF blends with up to 50% renewable fuel. Compatibility is not the limiting factor, but, unfortunately, the availability and cost of fuel are.

For military training flights, which may involve large numbers of sorties, SAF can therefore provide significant reductions in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. A 50% blend of Hefa, for instance, could cut average CO₂ emissions per flight by around one third.

Since contrails can account for a large fraction of aviation’s total climate impact, this effect is potentially important. The strategic allocation of SAF to flights that are most likely to generate persistent contrails, like training missions at high altitude in humid conditions, could amplify the climate benefit of limited SAF supplies.

The UK’s acquisition of additional F-35A aircraft will help address a backlog in pilot training, but it will also increase emissions. From both a climate and national security perspective, SAFs represent the most practical near-term mitigation option.

The F-35 is technically compatible with sustainable aviation fuels – and substantial life-cycle emission reductions are achievable this way. Additional benefits may come from reduced contrail formation. However, limitations in global SAF production and their higher costs restrict the extent to which these fuels can currently be deployed.

SAFs will not make military aviation climate neutral, but they could substantially reduce its environmental footprint at a time when both security and sustainability are pressing concerns.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/689612/original/file-20250908-56-bluie1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C339%2C5428%2C2714&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-08 11:56:13.431534

The airline has also detailed a clear roadmap to reach emission reductions of 99% from its owned GSE by 2035.

The result of these actions means less diesel, less noise and improved local air quality.

The electrification of ground operations vehicles is just one part of Jet2’s Sustainability Strategy, which covers three pillars: ‘In the Air’, ‘On The Ground’ and ‘In Resort’.

A key component of the ‘On The Ground’ pillar includes work to reduce the airside carbon footprint, through the introduction of all-electric crew buses and GSE.

As a result of this electrification programme, several hundred vehicles and pieces of GSE which include belt loaders, baggage tractors, pushback tractors, ground power units, steps, high-loaders, airside vans and cars, customer buses and crew buses have now been converted to an electric fuel supply.

In addition, a company-wide electric car salary-exchange scheme has been launched enabling Jet2 colleagues to switch to electric vehicles.

Jet2 has recently received recognition for its approach to sustainability, including being named the winner of the Package Holiday/Leisure Airline category at the global AirlineRatings.com 2025 Sustainability Awards, as well as Large Business category at the Yorkshire Sustainability Excellence Awards.

These awards recognise Jet2’s sustainability strategy, which is underpinned by two key objectives: to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a milestone of 35% reduction in carbon intensity by 2035.

To monitor Jet2’s journey to NetZero, the airline and tour operator is using key metrics, third-party verification, and transparent reporting to track and share its progress.

As well as focusing on EV, Jet2’s results driven Sustainability Strategy includes actions such as:

A new climate transition plan, focused on existing technologies and tangible actions that can be taken currently. This will see Jet2 reduce its carbon emissions per revenue paying passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK) by 35% in 2035 compared to 2019 (43.55gCO2/RPK in 2035 vs. 67gCO2/RPK in 2019).

Investing billions into decarbonising its fleet, with a firm order for 155 brand-new Airbus A321neo aircraft. These aircraft give a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 20% and are 50% quieter compared to the aircraft they are replacing.

The project, which was initiated in 2022, has been under review as the company reassessed its feasibility. After conducting a detailed commercial and technical evaluation, Shell concluded that moving forward with the plant would not be competitive enough in the current market environment.

Machteld de Haan, President of Shell’s Downstream, Renewables, and Energy Solutions division, explained the rationale behind this strategic decision. According to her, the assessment revealed that completing the facility would not align with the company’s priority of providing affordable, low-carbon energy solutions to customers. She emphasized that, although difficult, this decision ensures Shell directs capital toward projects capable of balancing customer needs with shareholder value.

De Haan also reaffirmed Shell’s belief in the long-term role of low-carbon molecules, particularly biofuels, in shaping the future energy landscape. She noted that Shell continues to play a leading role in this sector as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Despite halting this specific construction project, Shell remains committed to investing in lower-carbon energy opportunities. Between 2023 and 2024, the company allocated approximately U.S. $8 billion to a range of cleaner energy solutions. These include renewable power generation, carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen development, and the advancement of low-carbon fuels. By 2024, Shell had already traded over 10 billion litres of low-carbon fuels and sold ten times more than it produced, highlighting its strong presence in the sector. Additionally, in the same year, Shell positioned itself as one of the global leaders in the supply of SAF.

The Netherlands continues to hold strategic importance for Shell’s business operations. The company maintains a wide footprint across the nation’s energy system, ranging from upstream oil and gas production to its extensive retail fuel network. Over recent years, Shell has invested around €6.5 billion in energy transition projects within the Netherlands. Notable initiatives include the Porthos CCS project for large-scale carbon dioxide storage, the Holland Hydrogen 1 project aimed at renewable hydrogen development, and modernization measures such as new furnaces and electrification at Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk.

In summary, while Shell has opted to discontinue the Rotterdam biofuels facility due to cost competitiveness issues, the company continues to demonstrate its dedication to supporting the global energy transition. Its strategic investments in low-carbon technologies reflect a broader vision of becoming both a leading partner and the investment case of choice in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-08 11:56:26.920543

In a significant step forward for sustainable aviation, Delta Air Lines has achieved a remarkable milestone at Portland International Airport. Working together with Shell and local authorities, they have successfully introduced more than 400,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel into the airports fuel system. This achievement represents more than just a number it showcases how traditional infrastructure can be adapted for a greener future.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF, represents one of the most promising solutions for reducing the environmental impact of air travel. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable

sources and can reduce carbon emissions by more than 80 percent over its lifecycle. The vurdhaan process of creating SAF involves converting waste materials into clean burning fuel that works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines.

Innovation Through Collaboration

The Portland project demonstrates the power of partnership in driving sustainable innovation. Shell supplied the initial SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal, where it underwent careful blending with conventional fuel to meet safety standards. This mixture then traveled by barge, truck, and pipeline to reach the airport, proving that existing transportation networks can support renewable fuel distribution.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

Beyond environmental advantages, this initiative brings economic opportunities to the Pacific Northwest. Delta employs approximately 4,500 people in the region, and this project helps secure their future while creating new jobs in the renewable energy sector. The successful implementation at Portland International Airport serves as a model for other airports nationwide.

Breaking Down Barriers

While SAF technology exists and works effectively, widespread adoption faces several challenges. Current global production levels would supply the airline industry for less than a week. However, supportive policies like the federal Blenders Tax Credit and Clean Fuel Production Credit are helping to address cost barriers and encourage increased production.

Looking Ahead

The Portland achievement builds upon previous successful SAF implementations at other major hubs including Minneapolis St. Paul and Detroit. This expanding network of SAF capable airports demonstrates the feasibility of transitioning to cleaner aviation fuel on a national scale.

Conclusion

The successful integration of sustainable aviation fuel at Portland International Airport marks an important advancement in the journey toward cleaner air travel. Through continued collaboration between airlines, fuel suppliers, airports, and government agencies, the aviation industry is proving that environmental responsibility and operational excellence can work hand in hand. This project not only reduces emissions but also creates a blueprint for sustainable aviation infrastructure that other airports can follow.

Conclusion: A Model for Future-Proof Aviation JetBlue’s adoption of SkyBreathe® exemplifies strategic operational transformation in action.","In an industry where fuel costs constitute 20–30% of operating expenses—global airlines spent $291 billion on jet fuel in 2024 alone—operational efficiency is no longer optional but existential [1]. JetBlue Airways’ recent implementation of the SkyBreathe® Analytics Platform marks a pivotal step in its strategic transformation, aligning cost optimization with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) imperatives. By leveraging AI-driven fuel efficiency solutions, JetBlue is not only addressing immediate financial pressures but also positioning itself as a leader in sustainable aviation.

Strategic Operational Transformation: From Cost Center to Competitive Edge

SkyBreathe® represents a paradigm shift in how airlines manage fuel consumption. The platform integrates Big Data algorithms, AI, and Machine Learning to analyze billions of data points from Flight Data Recorders (FDR), Operational Flight Plans (OFP), and ACARS systems [2]. This enables JetBlue to identify granular inefficiencies in taxiing, climb, cruise, and descent phases, delivering actionable insights to pilots via the MyFuelCoach mobile app [3].

The results are already measurable: JetBlue has identified potential monthly fuel savings of 73,000 gallons, equivalent to 700 tons of CO₂ emissions annually [1]. When combined with complementary initiatives like single-engine taxiing (saving an additional 15,000 gallons monthly), the cumulative impact is transformative [4]. These savings are not theoretical—OpenAirlines CEO Alexandre Feray notes that measurable results emerged within months of implementation [3].

For investors, this underscores SkyBreathe’s role as a scalable solution. A 3–5% fuel saving on a fleet of 50 Boeing 737-800s translates to $9.6 million in annual savings [1]. With JetBlue’s fleet of over 100 aircraft, the platform’s potential to reduce operating costs while enhancing route profitability is significant.

ESG Alignment: Fuel Efficiency as a Climate Action Lever

The aviation sector faces mounting pressure to decarbonize, with regulatory frameworks like CORSIA and EU-ETS tightening compliance requirements. SkyBreathe® directly addresses these challenges by enabling real-time CO₂ tracking and optimization. JetBlue’s adoption of the platform aligns with its JetForward strategy, which includes commitments to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and electrified ground operations [4].

The platform’s 360° dashboard provides a unified view of environmental performance, allowing JetBlue to monitor progress toward its net-zero 2050 goals. For instance, the system’s predictive analytics help identify routes where minor adjustments—such as optimized descent profiles—can reduce emissions by thousands of pounds per flight [2]. This data-driven approach not only supports regulatory compliance but also strengthens stakeholder trust, a critical factor for ESG-focused investors.

Moreover, SkyBreathe’s AI assistant, SkyBreathe® Advisor, empowers pilots to make eco-conscious decisions during flights. By fostering a culture of sustainability, JetBlue is transforming its operational DNA—a shift that resonates with passengers and investors prioritizing climate action.

Financial and Market Implications

The financial benefits of SkyBreathe® are clear. At $2.50 per gallon (a conservative estimate), the 73,000 monthly savings translate to $182,500 in direct cost reductions. Annually, this amounts to $2.19 million, with additional savings from CO₂ emission reductions and regulatory compliance. When scaled across JetBlue’s fleet, the platform could yield tens of millions in savings, directly boosting EBITDA margins.

Beyond cost savings, SkyBreathe enhances JetBlue’s competitive positioning. As fuel prices remain volatile, airlines with advanced efficiency tools will outperform peers. For example, Vietjet’s use of SkyBreathe® has already cut CO₂ emissions by 96,000 tons annually [2], demonstrating the platform’s scalability. JetBlue’s early adoption positions it to capitalize on future fuel price fluctuations and regulatory changes.

Challenges and Mitigation

Implementation hurdles, such as data integration and format conversion, are common in AI-driven systems. However, JetBlue’s collaboration with OpenAirlines—evidenced by SunExpress and Viva Aerobus’ successful deployments—suggests a robust framework for overcoming these challenges [1]. The airline’s emphasis on cross-departmental collaboration (maintenance, operations, and flight planning) further ensures seamless adoption.

Conclusion: A Model for Future-Proof Aviation

JetBlue’s adoption of SkyBreathe® exemplifies strategic operational transformation in action. By merging cutting-edge technology with ESG-driven goals, the airline is redefining efficiency in aviation.

In parallel with these operational initiatives, UMeWorld is taking a major step to strengthen its corporate governance and capital markets profile. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a plan to redomicile through a statutory merger and share exchange. Upon completion, all outstanding shares of UMeWorld Limited (BVI) will be exchanged for shares of a newly incorporated Delaware entity, UMeWorld Inc.

Redomiciling to Delaware will provide the Company with a stronger corporate governance framework, greater transparency, and closer alignment with U.S. investor expectations. Most importantly, it establishes the structural foundation necessary for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq.

“Redomiciling to Delaware is not just a legal formality,” said Michael Lee, CEO of UMeWorld Limited. “It’s a strategic milestone that enhances our credibility, strengthens our corporate foundation, and positions UMeWorld to engage more fully with U.S. capital markets. Alongside DAGola’s growth and our biofuel expansion, this move sets the stage for long-term value creation.”

The redomiciliation is subject to customary shareholder approval and regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). UMeWorld will provide further details, including anticipated timelines and shareholder instructions, in upcoming communications.

Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen;

Introduction

1. Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you at the 2025 Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference, or APPEC for short. APPEC is hosted annually in Singapore by S&P Global and supported by Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG), and this 41st edition is the most well-attended to date, with over 1,200 delegates from 46 countries.

2. This year’s theme, “Navigating Trade, Technology and Transition”, is a timely one. The global energy sector is facing both turbulence and transformation, shaped by geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy.

3. Singapore remains committed to being a thriving global hub for energy trade in a low-carbon future. However, we also recognise that traditional energy sources will continue to be important for some time. We will smoothly manage this transition by supporting companies in navigating the 3Ts of Trade, Technology, and Transition.

Trade — Navigating Complexity in an Uncertain Landscape

4. The first T is on navigating an increasingly challenging trading landscape.

a. Geopolitical tensions have ushered in a new era of volatility. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted global energy supply chains, resulting in a surge in energy prices. US tariffs have dampened global growth prospects, and uncertainty remains over how India may or will recalibrate its demand for Russian oil in response to the tariffs.

b. Supply dynamics are shifting, too. OPEC+ has unwound its production cuts, while non-OPEC producers, such as the US and Brazil, have expanded output. In addition, oversupply from China is weighing on margins. Combined with softer demand from tariff-induced economic uncertainty and structural changes in key markets like China, Brent crude recently hit a four-year low in May 2025 at US$60 per barrel. However, it has since recovered slightly to US$67 per barrel.

c. There is structural overcapacity in refining and petrochemicals, especially in East Asia. A glut of refined products, such as diesel and naphtha, has placed downward pressure on margins. The International Energy Agency recently projected a record oil supply glut next year, with an expected surplus inventory of around 3 million barrels per day.

5. Singapore remains a global energy trading hub of choice for companies, amid this uncertain environment.

a. Between 2023 and 2024, energy trade conducted through Singapore grew from US$1.44 trillion to US$1.67 trillion, along with a 5% increase in the number of trading professionals based here. We continue to welcome you to deploy, to anchor more professionals to be based here so that you can use Singapore as a control tower base to manage, orchestrate as well as plan your operations in Asia Pacific.

b. Singapore also welcomed six new firms from the energy and chemicals sector on board EnterpriseSG’s Global Traders Programme in 2024. One example is Yulong Petrochemical, which operates a 400,000 barrels-per-day refinery in Shandong.

c. We continue to build on our key strengths as a trusted, stable and connected hub to anchor trading activities in Singapore.

Technology — Harnessing Innovation to Stay Ahead

6. The second T is on harnessing technology, which is reshaping how firms trade, produce, and compete.

a. Traders are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into forecasting and risk management, with assistance from government programmes.

b. EnterpriseSG offers support to firms in expanding or setting up new operations, including those that leverage on AI. Mining major BHP Group Limited set up a regional AI hub in May 2025. By integrating AI into its core operations, it has unlocked new insights to support sustainable and profitable growth across its global commodity supply chains. AI will help is achieve three As –

1. Assist – it will help us to assist some of your staff who may not have any teams to manage. AI will help them to develop the arms and legs to assist them.

2. Augment – it will help to augment the products and services, how we are delivering it to the customers.

3. Automate – from the example of BHP Group, you can see how we can use AI to grow the topline and bottom line and also help to mitigate the existing risks that we talked about.

c. AI Singapore’s (AISG) 100 Experiments provides co-funding of up to S$180,000 per project and access to manpower and AI experts. Four Elements Capital is a commodity asset manager which developed a machine learning (ML) framework with AISG’s support, helping it to predict base metal price fluctuations. This enables it to more effectively identify trading and arbitrage opportunities.

Transition – Thriving in a Low-Carbon Future

7. The third T is positioning Singapore well to seize growth opportunities as it transitions to a low-carbon economy.

8. With Asia growing in importance as a key import and export market for green commodities, Singapore is well-positioned to play a significant role in the four key growth areas of sustainable products, biofuels, alternative maritime fuels, and carbon trading.

9. First, we are expanding our production of sustainable products on Jurong Island to meet the growing regional demand. We will continue to grow the base in Jurong Island. We recently welcomed speciality chemicals firm Arkema, which manufactures polyamide-11, a high-performance polymer derived from renewable castor oil, which leaves a much lower carbon footprint versus fossil-based polymers. In July 2025, Arkema opened in Singapore, the world’s largest integrated factory dedicated to bio-circular materials.

10. Second, we are actively growing our biofuels production and trading ecosystem to capitalise on fast-growing regional demand. According to the International Energy Agency, Asia is set to overtake Europe in production and demand of biofuels by next year.

a. On the production side, Singapore is home to the world’s largest sustainable aviation fuel production facility, operated by Neste. The energy and chemicals sector here plays a vital role in producing and supplying fuels for the world, and we are keen to support this sector to seize new opportunities in the manufacturing of biofuels.

b. On the trading side, Singapore has an extensive network of over 250 traders in energy and agri-commodities, including major trading firms such as Wilmar and Olam, which control the feedstock for biofuels. This confluence of buy and sell sides makes us compelling as a biofuels trading hub, with Singapore’s biofuels trading revenue reaching S$1.5 billion in 2023.

11. Third, we are developing more support for alternative maritime fuels, especially ammonia. Singapore’s position as the world’s largest bunkering hub is a unique advantage as we prepare for a multi-fuel future. While LNG, methanol and biofuels will remain relevant in the near term, ammonia is expected to gain momentum and account for a substantial share of bunker fuels by 2050. The strong industry response of 26 bids for EMA & Maritime Port Authority’s (MPA) ammonia bunkering Request for Proposal or RFP, underlines market confidence in Singapore’s potential to be a leader in maritime fuels and ammonia.

12. Fourth, we are developing Singapore as a hub for carbon services and trading. Today, we are home to more than 150 firms across the carbon services and trading value chain – double the number from 2021. EnterpriseSG supports global trading firms and energy players in setting up new carbon credit trading functions. Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and Chevron all have local carbon trading teams to capture opportunities in this space, as do independent traders Trafigura, Mercuria, Vitol and Glencore.

Conclusion

13. The energy and chemicals trade sector is facing one of its most complex periods in its history.

14. Singapore is committed to working with you to navigate this challenging time and to bridge today’s energy demands with tomorrow’s possibilities. Together, we will build a more resilient and sustainable future.

15. I wish all of you a fruitful time at APPEC, with meaningful conversations and the forging of fresh and successful partnerships. Thank you.",https://www.mti.gov.sg/html/images/mti-favicon.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:58:30.311852

For Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (6505.TW), these challenges are both existential and operational. While the company’s recent financial performance underscores vulnerabilities—declining revenue since 2021, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.65 in 2024, and a Moody’s downgrade to Baa2—their strategic initiatives reveal a deliberate pivot toward resilience. This analysis examines how Formosa Petrochemical balances sector-specific risks with innovative strategies to secure its long-term viability.

Sector-Specific Risks: A Fragile Landscape

The petrochemical sector is underpinned by cyclical demand, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory shifts. Formosa Petrochemical’s 2024 revenue of $50 billion, with $8 billion from plastics, reflects a broader industry trend of stagnation. Global demand for petrochemicals is weakening, exacerbated by oversupply from China, which added 10% to its production capacity in 2024 alone [1]. This oversupply has compressed margins, forcing companies to compete on price rather than innovation.

Debt management further complicates the outlook. Formosa Petrochemical’s leverage, coupled with peers like Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corporation (1326.TW) reporting a net debt-to-EBITDA of 7.28, signals a sector-wide reliance on capital-intensive operations [4]. Meanwhile, energy transition mandates, such as the EU’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) requirements, are reshaping demand structures. Companies unable to adapt risk obsolescence as markets prioritize decarbonization.

Strategic Resilience: Innovation and Diversification

Formosa Petrochemical’s response to these risks is multifaceted. First, the company is leveraging digital transformation to enhance efficiency. AI-driven process optimization and the “Formosa Oil APP” for customer engagement aim to reduce costs and diversify revenue streams [1]. Second, sustainability is no longer a peripheral goal but a core strategy. By 2025, the company plans to produce 5,500 metric tons of SAF annually, with a target of 50,000 tonnes by 2030. This aligns with partnerships with China Airlines and EVA Air, securing long-term contracts for SAF supply [3].

Geographic expansion is another pillar of resilience. Formosa Petrochemical is capitalizing on U.S. shale gas advantages by expanding production in Texas, where new facilities for caustic soda and chlorine are underway [1]. In China, the Ningbo Plant’s capacity upgrades position the company to meet regional demand while mitigating risks from domestic overcapacity. Additionally, solar projects at facilities in New Jersey and Louisiana—producing over 94% renewable energy—underscore a commitment to aligning with global decarbonization trends [1].

Financial Health and Market Positioning

Despite these initiatives, Formosa Petrochemical’s Q2 2025 results highlight ongoing challenges. The company reported a net income loss of TWD 293.44 million, a stark contrast to National Petroleum’s stable Q2 2025 EPS of NT$0.56 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.06% [5]. This disparity underscores the urgency of debt restructuring and cost optimization. However, Formosa Petrochemical’s debt metrics, while concerning, remain within manageable thresholds compared to peers. For instance, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre’s debt-to-assets ratio of 0.31 suggests the sector is not uniformly insolvent [4].

The company’s strategic investments in SAF and digital tools also offer a path to differentiation. By 2030, SAF is projected to account for 10% of global aviation fuel demand, a market Formosa Petrochemical is positioning itself to dominate [3]. This forward-looking approach could offset near-term profitability declines.

Conclusion: Balancing Risks and Opportunities

Formosa Petrochemical’s long-term viability hinges on its ability to navigate sector-specific risks while executing its strategic vision. The company’s investments in SAF, digital transformation, and geographic diversification are critical to countering oversupply and regulatory pressures. However, its financial health remains fragile, necessitating disciplined debt management and operational efficiency.

For investors, the key question is whether Formosa Petrochemical can scale its sustainability initiatives and market expansion quickly enough to offset declining profitability. While the path is fraught with challenges, the company’s proactive stance on energy transition and innovation suggests a resilient trajectory—if executed effectively.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:58:33.978810

CONTACT: Michael Lee CEO, UMeWorld Limited Email: info@umeworld.com","MIAMI, Sept. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF), a public company engaged in functional nutrition and sustainable biofuel innovation, today provided a comprehensive corporate update.

UMeWorld operates a dual-growth platform powered by a single proprietary enzymatic technology. This breakthrough process enables the Company to deliver both DAGola™ functional cooking oils, clinically validated to improve metabolic health, and enzymatic biofuels, designed to convert low-cost feedstocks into sustainable biodiesel. This “one technology, two markets” strategy uniquely positions UMeWorld at the intersection of wellness and sustainability, offering investors exposure to both consumer health and renewable energy.

Alongside operational progress, UMeWorld also announced its intention to redomicile from the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) to the State of Delaware, USA as part of its long-term growth strategy and preparation for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange.

DAGola Functional Cooking Oils

UMeWorld’s flagship brand, DAGola™, continues to gain traction in the fast-growing functional foods sector. The brand has received strong reviews on Amazon, validating both product quality and consumer demand. To accelerate growth, the Company is preparing a micro-influencer marketing campaign aimed at expanding awareness and engagement across social media platforms.

A major milestone is expected in Q4 2025, when DAGola sales in China are scheduled to begin through a local established sales platform with a proven distribution network. This launch will be supported by targeted digital marketing and e-commerce initiatives. Looking further ahead, management plans to expand DAGola into Southeast Asia and the EU in 2026, building on rising demand for healthier edible oils and leveraging clinical validation.

Timeline Roadmap:

Now (2025): Scaling U.S. sales through Amazon and direct-to-consumer channels.

2027–2028 (2–3 years): Planning and execution of a commercial-scale facility meeting EU/US standards.

Beyond 2028: Expansion opportunities into U.S., EU, and Asia-Pacific markets.

The global biodiesel market is projected to exceed $90 billion by 2030, driven by strong EU and U.S. mandates for renewable energy adoption. By focusing on low-cost, waste-based feedstocks, UMeWorld aims to deliver both cost efficiency and sustainability advantages over conventional chemical and HVO-based biodiesel production methods.

Future Potential: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Beyond biodiesel, UMeWorld’s enzymatic process is also adaptable to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets. By pre-treating difficult feedstocks such as POME, UCO, and animal fats under mild, selective conditions, the Company’s technology can produce cleaner intermediates that integrate seamlessly with established hydroprocessing steps used in SAF production. Global aviation regulators and airlines are committing to ambitious carbon reduction goals, with SAF expected to represent a growing share of jet fuel consumption by 2030. UMeWorld’s long-term strategy includes exploring SAF pathways, positioning the Company to potentially supply low-carbon aviation fuel to premium international markets and form strategic partnerships with refiners and airlines.

Milan, 8 September 2025 – MAIRE (MAIRE.MI) announces that NEXTCHEM, through its subsidiary MyRechemical, key player in the Waste-to-Chemical segment, has been awarded an engineering study contract by Altalto Ltd. based on its proprietary NX CircularTM gasification and NX CPOTM technologies for a SAF plant in Immingham, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.

Altalto (Immingham) Ltd. is a company set up by Velocys to develop SAF projects in the UK. The plant is expected to be operational in 2030. Initial targets include the production of 30 million litres (23 thousand tonnes) of SAF per year for the UK market in support of the SAF Mandate[1]. Feedstocks will be sourced from residual municipal solid waste (MSW) and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste.

The project has been awarded a grant from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund to progress Basic Engineering Design. The SAF from the plant will be enough to power over 500 flights from London to New York per year.

Cutting-edge NX CircularTM gasification technology allows the plant to convert waste by generating synthesis gas (syngas), which is subsequently transformed to SynCrude through Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch technology and upgraded to high-quality sustainable fuels. The application of this solution, combined with NX CPO™ technology, offers a unique and efficient design. NX CPOTM ensures an advanced innovative process to produce synthesis gas via controlled partial oxidation through a very fast reaction. When applied to synthetic fuel production, this versatile technology is contributing to maximizing overall yield while minimizing carbon intensity of the product.

MyRechemical will operate as a technology provider and as coordinator for other technological partners. It will also supply engineering services supported by NEXTCHEM’s NX Engineering District in Catania and involve other sister companies of the MAIRE Group. Altalto expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 100,000 tonnes of CO₂-equivalent per year (including CCS), valorize residual waste and create about 100 permanent jobs. The project will also generate an additional 1,000 direct and 300 indirect jobs during construction. Altalto is aiming to significantly improving the UK balance of payments by reducing fuel imports while generating substantial investment and export opportunities for the Country.

Fabio Fritelli, Managing Director of NEXTCHEM, commented: “This award confirms the validity and flexibility of our technological proposal, which meets the needs of players in the mobility sector, particularly in aviation where decarbonisation is of paramount importance.”",https://www.groupmaire.com/static/project/share/maire-social-share.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 03:56:12.938354

With policies favoring fossil fuels and a rollback of international climate commitments, the vacuum in global climate governance is being filled by Asian markets, particularly Hong Kong. For investors, this represents a pivotal moment to reassess risk and opportunity in a world where geopolitical dynamics are reshaping the energy transition.

The U.S. Retreat and Its Implications

The Trump 2.0 administration’s emphasis on nationalist energy policies and fossil fuel expansion has created a stark contrast with the global push for decarbonization. According to a report by China Daily, the U.S. is now promoting policies that prioritize domestic energy production over multilateral climate cooperation, effectively retreating from the leadership role it once held [1]. This shift has destabilized global climate markets, creating uncertainty for investors and weakening the momentum of international agreements like the Paris Accord.

The U.S. withdrawal has also disrupted capital flows. Green finance, which relies on consistent policy frameworks and long-term commitments, is now facing a fragmented landscape. As stated by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s Institute for the Environment, the absence of U.S. leadership has forced other regions to accelerate their own strategies, with Hong Kong emerging as a critical player [1].

Hong Kong’s Strategic Climate Ambitions

Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050, which aims for carbon neutrality before 2050, is underpinned by a HK$240 billion investment over two decades [3]. This commitment has already yielded tangible results: greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 24% between 2014 and 2022, driven by cleaner electricity generation and regional power imports [2]. To build on this progress, Professor Benjamin Horton of City University of Hong Kong has proposed eight strategic priorities, including scaling renewable energy, transforming urban mobility, and investing in carbon capture technologies [2].

The city’s transition finance policies are equally robust. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has mandated that financial institutions achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2030 and financed emissions by 2050. By August 2024, the HKMA’s sustainable bond program had mobilized around US$120 billion in underlying debt issuance [7], positioning Hong Kong as a bridge between China’s green finance ecosystem and global markets.

Transition Finance: A New Frontier for Investors

Hong Kong’s 2024-2025 budget has further expanded its green finance toolkit. The Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, extended until 2027, now includes transition bonds and loans to support industries in decarbonization [6]. Additionally, the city is developing sustainability disclosure standards aligned with the International Financial Reporting Standards (ISSB), ensuring transparency and investor confidence [3].

Innovation is another cornerstone of Hong Kong’s strategy. A $400 million Green Tech Fund supports R&D in decarbonization technologies, while the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Subsidy Scheme incentivizes early-stage innovation [6]. These initiatives are complemented by sector-specific incentives, such as feasibility studies for green-methanol bunkering and streamlined approvals for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) [6].

China’s Role in the Global Green Transition

China’s broader efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 provide a tailwind for Hong Kong’s ambitions. By 2024, China’s wind and solar capacity had surpassed 1,400 GW—six years ahead of its 2030 target—while accounting for 75% of global wind farm installations in 2023 [5]. However, the country’s reliance on coal remains a challenge, with coal power construction hitting a decade-high in 2024 [4]. To address this, China has introduced the Green and Low-Carbon Transition Industry Guidance Catalogue, which includes carbon capture and low-carbon coal projects [8]. Hong Kong’s Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, aligned with international frameworks, enhances its role as a conduit for international capital into these projects [7].

Strategic Opportunities for Investors

For investors, Hong Kong’s transition finance policies and China’s renewable energy growth present a unique opportunity. The city’s alignment with global standards, such as the ISSB, reduces regulatory friction for cross-border investments. Meanwhile, its role as a green fintech hub—supported by subsidies and R&D funding—offers exposure to high-growth sectors like AI-driven energy efficiency and circular economy technologies [3].

Conclusion

As the U.S. retreats from climate leadership, Hong Kong and China are redefining the global green finance agenda. For investors, the key lies in capitalizing on the region’s policy momentum, technological innovation, and strategic alignment with international markets. The transition is no longer a Western-led narrative—it is now a global race, and Asia is surging ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 03:56:21.431888

***********************************************************************************

Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at 2025 Hong Kong Green Finance Association (HKGFA) Annual Forum ""Navigating Climate Finance and Geopolitics: Strategies for Transition"" today (September 8):

Dr. Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), Professor Li (Professor of Political Science and Founding Director of the Centre on Contemporary China and the World of the University of Hong Kong, Dr Li Cheng), Dr. Berglöf (Chief Economist, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Dr Erik Berglöf), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the eighth edition of the Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum.

This year's Forum marks the opening of Hong Kong Green Week. This week, leading voices from global financial institutions, corporations and policy circles will engage in essential discussions on sustainable finance, climate technologies, impact investing and regional green co-operation. They'll share knowledge, experiences and explore how green transformation can create fresh opportunities, particularly in the face of a volatile geopolitical landscape.

A world of contrast

Let me begin by acknowledging some uncomfortable realities. The urgency of the climate crisis is clearer than ever, and we are all witnessing it and feeling it first-hand, in the unprecedented heatwaves from Europe to Japan and the numerous black rainstorms that have battered our city this summer.

This devastating reality is compounded by rising unilateralism. The US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and an overt policy shift back to fossil fuels, are disappointing. It weakens the collective commitment to climate action and, no less important, complicates the US$1.3 trillion annual climate-finance target for developing countries, reached at COP 29 (the 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).

Still, we must not lose hope. Many countries remain firmly committed to net-zero transition, in particular our country, China, which stands by its 3060 goals. According to estimates, our country's CO2 emissions in the first quarter this year fell by 1.6 per cent year on year. This is the first time that clean-energy expansion is leading the fall in CO2 level, and that's despite rapid growth in power demand. China is expected to invest some US$820 billion in energy transition this year, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global total.

Moreover, its national emissions trading scheme continues to expand, now covering 70 per cent of the country's emissions, including key polluting sectors such as cement, steel and aluminium.

Across Asia and the Global South, the progress is also encouraging. In the Asia-Pacific region, investment in energy transition, last year, surpassed US$1 trillion for the first time. That's more than double the amount invested in the Americas. ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states reaffirmed their commitment to climate resilience at their recent summit, underscoring the priority the region has accorded to climate action. For Belt and Road economies as a whole, renewable energy now constitutes 30 per cent of their total energy investments, up from less than 5 per cent just a decade ago.

Technological advancements are also offering new hope. Beyond solar power and electric vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force. The International Energy Agency predicts that, by 2035, the widespread use of AI could reduce global energy consumption by an amount greater than the total energy usage of Mexico.

How Hong Kong can contribute

Here in Hong Kong, we remain steadfast in our commitment to climate action. We are on track to cut our carbon emissions in half by 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This goal is anchored in four key strategies: decarbonising power generation, improving energy efficiency in buildings, promoting green transport and reducing waste.

In power generation, we are making pleasing progress. By 2026, with the completion of enhancements to the cross-boundary Clean Energy Transmission System, the share of zero-carbon electricity in our fuel mix is expected to rise from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. We are also planning for the construction of new facilities in Tseung Kwan O to further expand our capacity to import zero-carbon energy. Upon completion of the project, the share of zero-carbon energy in our fuel mix could increase to about 60 to 70 per cent.

Beyond fulfilling our domestic commitments, Hong Kong has much more to offer the world. As an international financial centre and an innovation hub, we are well positioned to contribute to global green transition.

On green and sustainable finance

Hong Kong has long been Asia's frontrunner in green and sustainable finance. In 2024, we issued more than US$80 billion in sustainable debts, with green bonds accounting for around 45 per cent of the regional total. Estimated issuances of sustainable debts in the first half of 2025 reached over US$34 billion, an increase of 15 per cent year on year. Over 200 ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have been authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with an AUM (assets under management) exceeding US$140 billion, up more than 50 per cent in just three years. These figures speak volumes about our growing role as a green financing and investment hub.

And we have been doing more than that. For example, in the area of transition finance. While it still represents a small fraction of the sustainable finance markets, it is gaining a traction and offers considerable prospects. For instance, transition bonds account for only around 3 per cent of the sustainable bonds market in the ASEAN+3 Market. Hong Kong obviously has the potential to become a transition finance hub, helping hard-to-abate sectors to decarbonise.

Separately, last year, we issued the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which aligns with the frameworks of both the Chinese Mainland and the European Union. Today, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) begins a public consultation to expand this taxonomy to cover transition finance. Other elements include expanding sector coverage and introducing climate change adaptation. These are pivotal to scaling up capital flows to accelerate green transformation.

Taking a broader perspective, setting and upholding international standards are important if we are to attract and channel more investments to green and transition projects. Hong Kong is proud to contribute to the setting of the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) reporting standards and the related disclosure framework. As confirmed by the IFRS Foundation (the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) in June this year, Hong Kong is one of the few jurisdictions in Asia with a clear roadmap for full adoption.

We are also working to mobilise more capital across the public and private sectors. The HKMA has entered into strategic partnerships with multilateral organisations to co-invest in climate and development projects. And our vibrant venture capital and private-equity sector, plus the concentration of wealthy family offices and high-net-worth individuals, are great resources. A study shows that 87 per cent of high-net-worth investors are eager to support climate-focused investments. There is even stronger interest in transition investing than in sustainable investing.

In this regard, there is great potential in developing innovative, climate-focused financial products that cater to market appetite.

Expanding green innovation

Beyond finance, technological innovation is the engine that will drive green transformation. On this, Hong Kong is emerging as a green technology hub. Today, more than 250 green tech companies are based in Science Park and Cyberport. These firms are developing globally competitive solutions – from smart grid to carbon capture technologies. They are expanding rapidly into the Mainland and international markets.

And, through the coordinated efforts of the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, OASES (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises), Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, we are attracting prime green enterprises from around the world. These companies span a wide array of technologies – from AI-driven green solutions to sustainable aviation fuel, electric mobility infrastructure and next-generation power systems.

We are helping them to connect with Hong Kong universities and supply chains, identify more application scenarios and tap into markets across the Greater Bay Area, Asia and beyond.

Just as I said earlier, AI can power green transition. It can help traditional industries and sectors optimise production processes and energy consumption, thereby substantially reducing their carbon footprint. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry. I'm confident that many AI solutions for decarbonisation can scale here and make a lasting impact.

Closing

Ladies and gentlemen, there is only one earth, one planet that we all share. While the world may be facing substantial geopolitical challenges, Hong Kong is fully committed to becoming a reliable and resourceful partner in the global green transformation.

Through forums like this, we reaffirm our commitment to collaboration and partnership. In the space of sustainable finance, technology, talent and many other areas, we can work together to turn climate challenges into rewarding opportunities.

On this note, I wish the Forum and Hong Kong Green Week every success, and all of you the best of health and business.

Thank you.

For investors, this creates a unique window to capitalize on margin expansion opportunities through strategic positioning in refining and energy logistics.

Market Dynamics: A Perfect Storm of Supply and Demand

According to a report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. inventories for motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, and jet fuel are projected to fall to their lowest levels since 2000 due to declining refinery production and rising consumption [1]. This inventory contraction, coupled with record-high global crude runs of 85.6 million barrels per day in August 2025, underscores tightening supply conditions [2]. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that refining margins hit 15-month highs in July 2025, reflecting robust demand for cleaner fuels and advanced refining technologies [4].

The U.S. jet fuel market, in particular, faces acute supply constraints. With consumption forecast to reach an all-time high and inventories projected to fall to 21 days of supply—the lowest since 1963—wholesale and retail prices are likely to surge unless crude oil prices decline significantly [1]. Conversely, the distillate fuel market is being reshaped by biofuels. Renewable diesel and biodiesel are expected to account for 9% of total consumption in 2026, up from 5% in 2021, as stricter emissions regulations drive demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) [1].

Strategic Initiatives: Biofuels, Diversification, and Compliance

The Trump administration’s 2026 biofuel mandates, proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are a game-changer. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has been set at a record 24.02 billion gallons, with a biomass-based diesel mandate of 7.12 billion gallons—a 67% increase from current levels [1]. This policy shift favors domestic biofuel producers like Darling Ingredients and Chevron while increasing compliance costs for refiners reliant on imported feedstocks [3].

Refiners such as Valero are proactively adapting. Valero’s expansion of renewable diesel capacity through joint ventures like Diamond Green Diesel and its investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects, including the Port Arthur SAF facility, exemplify a forward-looking strategy to align with low-carbon mandates [4]. Similarly, Marathon Petroleum and Delek are diversifying crude oil sources to mitigate volatility and meet stringent environmental standards [5].

Infrastructure and Technology: Gulf Coast as a Strategic Hub

The Gulf Coast’s dominance in refining is underscored by its 93.5% utilization rate, compared to the East Coast’s 59% [1]. This regional disparity creates asymmetric opportunities for midstream logistics firms and industrial conglomerates. Gulf Coast refineries, with their robust export infrastructure and access to low-cost feedstock, are central to global crude processing. Companies like Kinder Morgan and Magellan Midstream Partners stand to benefit from stable refining activity and retrofitting projects aimed at meeting low-carbon mandates [1].

Energy service providers such as Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are also well-positioned to capitalize on the demand for decarbonization technologies. The EIA’s refinery crude runs data highlights the critical role of biofuel compliance credit markets and grid-modernizing utilities like Xcel Energy in managing fuel price volatility [2].

Conclusion: Positioning for Long-Term Gains

The 2026 margin expansion in the refined fuels market is not a fleeting phenomenon but a structural shift driven by policy, technology, and demand dynamics. Investors should prioritize Gulf Coast infrastructure, energy transition technologies, and biofuel compliance strategies to navigate this evolving landscape.

§ GMB London Save Our Aviation Charter PCS, Aviation Review, 2013 Prospect, Towards a sustainable aviation industry, 2015 Prospect, Written evidence, 2021 RMT, Who Says There Is No Alternative?","Aviation produces 2.5% of global carbon emissions. But those emissions are rising rapidly. In other high-emission sectors there are technical alternatives (electricity generation from renewables or nuclear rather than fossil fuels, e-vehicles, food supply shifted back to plants and low-emissions livestock and forward to farm-free food), whatever the political difficulties of introducing them. In aviation, less so.

""Sustainable Aviation Fuel"" is only 0.7% of fuel used, not increasing fast, and often not really sustainable. Incremental improvements such as fewer vacant seats on aircraft reduced CO2 per passenger-km by 60% between 1990 and 2021, but it's hard to see them going much further, and total emissions doubled in those same 31 years.

Thus issues like a third runway for Heathrow loom larger in eco-debate than 2.5%. Globally, there are about 100 big airport-building or expansion projects every year.

Unlike with fossil-fuel extraction, no-one proposes to stop aviation outright, or to reduce it radically. The debate is about braking the growth.

Several UK unions have produced documents about this. The RMT rail union says high-speed rail should be expanded to replace short-haul flights. Especially if rail prices were subsidised and flights taxed more, that would help, though China in recent decades has expanded high-speed rail fast yet also increased flights, just as fast.

Aviation is lightly taxed. There is no tax on aviation fuel (except for flights within the EU). International flights, and domestic flights inside the UK, are zero-rated for VAT or sales taxes.

The UK has an Air Passenger Duty (APD), and other countries have similar levies. APD is £94 on long-haul cheap seats, £224 on long-haul posh seats; £13 and £28 for short-haul, £84 for private jets.

The Prospect union, which organises air traffic controllers, suggests a higher APD for frequent flyers. Prospect does not say this, but APD could also be increased to punitive rates for private jets (or private jets could be banned).

Prospect favours compulsory carbon-offsetting, presumably via a levy on fares and freight rates. It says it is ""not convinced"" about ""managing demand"", i.e. measures to reduce the number of flights. It favours airport expansion, focuses on resistance to cost-cutting on air traffic control, and hopes for emission-cuts through smarter controls.

Unison Scotland has opposed plans to cut APD in Scotland which in fact did not go ahead.

Unite and GMB documents focus on state aid to revive aviation after the Covid lockdowns during which many firms laid off workers. In fact, airlines and airports have largely revived since then: global airlines return on invested capital was higher in 2023, 2024, and 2025 so far than before the pandemic. One company predicts labour shortages, as aviation firms seek 1.5 million new hires worldwide in the next decade.

Unite also favours state aid for ""next generation low-emission aerospace and aviation technologies"".

Some Workers' Liberty policy documents have proposed rationing of flights. What if your job cannot be done without flying? Or you have a frail parent in Bangladesh and want to visit them more than once a year before they die? It is hard to see how the rationing could work without exceptions and thus scope for the best-connected to game the rules or bribe their way round them.

Higher taxes, coupled with low rates on rail and other transport, and a general levelling of incomes so that the taxes do not leave the rich still flying lots and the poor earthbound, seem more plausible to me, coupled with public ownership and democratic control of airports and airlines to plan development, and of other big firms to enable rationalisation of ""business travel"". §

회사측은 이번 공정 도입으로 투자 비용은 최소화하면서 수익성 증대와 원료 다각화, 지속가능항공유(Sustainable Aviation Fuel, 이하 SAF) 원료 추가 확보 등이 가능해질 것으로 전망했다. 앞서 DS단석은 지난 8월 평택1공장에 효소 반응 공정의 퍼포먼스 테스트를 완료한 후 본격 가동을 시작했으며, 시화공장에는 올해 12월 말까지 공정 구축을 완료할 계획이다. 기존 설비에 공정이 추가되는 방식(Retrofit)으로 별도의 생산 중단은 없다.

효소 반응 공정(Enzymatic Reaction)은 기존의 바이오디젤 제조 공정에 효소 촉매 투입반응을 통해 바이오디젤을 제조하는 방법이다. 바이오디젤 제조 시 원료유 안에 포함되어 있는 유리지방산(Free Fatty Acid, 이하 FFA) 함량이 높을 경우 전처리 비용 증가 및 수율 저하 등의 문제가 발생된다.

'효소 반응 공정'이 구축된 DS단석 평택1공장 외관 사진. [사진= DS단석]

이러한 문제로 업계에서는 FFA 함량이 낮은 원료의 수급 경쟁이 치열하고 해당 원료유의 가격이 높아질 수밖에 없는데, 효소 반응 공정의 FFA 함량이 높은 저급 원료로도 품질 규격을 충족하는 바이오디젤 제조가 가능하다. 특히 DS단석은 자체적인 연속식 공정기술을 적용해 바이오디젤 제조 시 생산능력과 품질은 유지하되 수율을 약 3%p 향상시켰다고 밝혔다.

DS단석 관계자는 ""바이오디젤 원가의 약 90%가 원재료비에서 발생하기 때문에 원료 다각화는 중요한 문제""라며, ""이번 공정 도입으로 수율 개선과 저급 원료 적용을 통한 수익성 개선이 기대된다""고 밝혔다. 이어 ""원료 다각화를 통해 기존에 사용하던 원료는 SAF 전처리에 추가 투입할 수 있게 된 만큼 원료 공급망을 한층 강화하고 SAF 제조기반 구축도 추진해 나가겠다""고 덧붙였다.

The jet zero project is now in full-scale retreat, with companies pulling out of a market that doesn’t exist, and countries scaling back on aviation taxes.
It has been another bad week for the cheerleaders for sustainable flying.
All the flight-shaming in the world is not going to change that, while the aviation taxes just add to the cost of living.
Jet zero is not going to happen, at least not any time soon – and there is no point in wasting more money on it.","We would be a global force in “jet zero”, promised Boris Johnson, the former prime minister, five years ago. Britain would lead the way in creating “sustainable aviation”, with world-leading research on planes that could fly across the Atlantic without doing any harm to the environment.

Right across the Western world, leaders were making similar pledges, investing billions in new types of fuels and engines, while slapping punitive taxes on the old, dirty jets to make sure we switched to cleaner ones as quickly as possible.

The jet zero project is now in full-scale retreat, with companies pulling out of a market that doesn’t exist, and countries scaling back on aviation taxes. It isn’t going to happen – and we would be far better off cutting carbon emissions elsewhere while allowing the aviation industry to flourish.

It has been another bad week for the cheerleaders for sustainable flying. Shell decided that a huge new plant in the Netherlands that was designed to be one of Europe’s major converters of waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel was too expensive and insufficiently competitive.

The decision was, according to Ashley Kelty, an analyst at Panmure Liberium, “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”. Airlines still face mandatory targets to use set quotas of green fuels, but it is hard to know where they will get them, given that even a company as large as Shell, with lots of world-class expertise at its disposal, does not seem to be able to work out how to make the stuff at a reasonable cost.

Meanwhile, Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, and one of the UK’s leading green tycoons, is struggling with his sustainable airline, Ecojet. It emerged this week that his all-electric airline, which claimed to be a “flag-carrier for green Britain”, had sacked almost its entire workforce, and it has been struggling to raise the £20m it needs to get started, and to secure its air operator’s certificate from the Civil Aviation Authority.

It seems we won’t all be flying off on a mini-break on one of its hydrogen-electric turbo-props any time soon, and will have to make do with the same old Boeings and Airbuses we are used to for a while longer.

Meanwhile, a few countries are even giving up on aviation taxes. From July, anyone getting a plane out of Sweden will no longer have to pay a green levy on their ticket, after its government decided that the “flight-shaming” movement had done too much damage to the industry. India and Germany have also reduced the taxes on air travel. With grim inevitability, Britain’s tax-obsessed Labour Government is still putting them up, with yet more rises in air passenger duty in the last Budget, but at least some countries are recognising they do more harm than good.

The jet zero strategy is in tatters. It is very hard to make the technology of decarbonising air travel work. Batteries are too heavy for a plane, and the electric engines do not generate enough power to keep an aircraft in the air.

Meanwhile the sustainable fuels that could have been an alternative cannot be produced at a competitive price. Sure, that may change, and the technology develops all the time, but we are not even close to making it work yet.

A few of us might be willing to follow the lead of Greta Thunberg and get a boat across the Atlantic, and the network of sleeper trains emerging across Europe will attract a few passengers, but most of us are not willing to give up flying. It remains by far the quickest, cheapest, and of course safest, mode of transport for anything much over 500 miles that we have. All the flight-shaming in the world is not going to change that, while the aviation taxes just add to the cost of living.

We need a change of strategy. We can all take a view on whether climate change is an emergency, or whether it is something that can be managed by gradually switching to different technologies as they emerge, and as they prove themselves effective, reliable, and cheap to run.

But even if you are closer to the Extinction Rebellion side of that debate, it still does not make much sense to obsess over air travel. In fact, flying might get a lot of coverage, partly because virtue-signalling politicians and celebrities love to boast about how they are travelling to Rome by canal, or getting a camel ride to Thailand, or whatever happens to look good on Instagram, but in fact, aviation only accounts for 2.5pc of global carbon emissions. It is never going to be critical to the outlook for global warming one way or another.

It would be far more sensible just to cut back on carbon emissions elsewhere. In the UK we could, for example, get on with building a new generation of nuclear power stations, and scrap all the cumbersome planning rules that make it twice as expensive to build one in Britain as it is in France or South Korea.

Across the EU, countries could drop the tariffs and quotas on Chinese electric vehicles, so that they could accelerate the switch to battery powered models by importing lots of cheap, well made cars. There are still lots of relatively simple ways of decarbonising the economy using technology that has been shown to work. We could then allow people to fly as much as they wanted to, without slapping punitive taxes on anyone who wants to take their children on holiday, or make a business trip; without guilt tripping everyone each time they go to the airport; and without wasting hundreds of millions of technologies that are clearly not going to work.

The blunt reality is this. Jet zero is not going to happen, at least not any time soon – and there is no point in wasting more money on it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WJKJg7.O6XKRnbwzHpeF7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/fff17bfe8dcd7e4b769f0aa4f64245eb,N,,2025-09-07 23:56:33.286488

As at weekend, average price of the fuel in Spain was $675.50 per metric tonne.

However, last week, six vessels departed Nigeria with the fuel following high demand in Australia, Chile, Spain, Italy, Poland, United States, Netherlands and Turkey as Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)’s shipping data revealed that Front Future left the country with 99,000 tonnes; Nave Atria, 40,000 tonnes and Albaro, 44,000 tonnes.

Others are Pacific Blue, 44,000 tonnes; STI Mighty, 44,000 tonnes; Ardmore Endurance, 40,000 tonnes and MH Daisen, 38,000 tonnes. Findings from ship traffic revealed that Front Forture was currently en route to Brisbane, Australia, with an estimated arrival time being September 14, 2025, as Albaro is around Lome Port in Togo and MH Daison currently en route to New York, United States, with an estimated arrival time on September 18, 2025.

Also, STI Mighty is currently located off the US East Coast, anchored in the Long Island Sound. Meanwhile, NGO Climate Catalyst and the SASHA Coalition have stressed the need for robust due diligence to ensure investments in aviation biofuels and e-fuels are both environmentally sustainable and financially sound.

It noted in its report that biofuel feed stocks may cause biodiversity loss, land-use change emissions or breach environmental rules, leading to regulatory penalties, saying that poor worker reskilling, lack of local economic planning, or weak community engagement could destabilise jobs and damage reputations.

Also, it explained that misuse of resources like food, water or energy could exacerbate insecurity, undermining community wellbeing and long-term investment stability. To mitigate these risks, the guide provides a framework of questions investors can use to engage with portfolio companies, including requirements for transparent lifecycle emissions accounting, holistic risk assessments, and greater accountability in SAF projects.

Climate Catalyst and SASHA argue that this approach not only protects investors but also ensures that the aviation industry’s fuel transition genuinely contributes to a sustainable and equitable climate pathway. Advocacy Manager at the SASHA Coalition, Nuala Doyle, said that alternative fuels from truly sustainable feed stocks were critical for achieving net zero aviation, saying with supply currently low, significant investment was needed to scale these solutions at the necessary pace.

He said: “However, without proper precautions, misplaced investments today risk locking in economic, environmental or social harms for years to come.” Recall that Global aviation bodies like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) had championed the adoption of SAF as part of an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

In an effort to meet environmental targets, the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) called for the new Dangote Refinery to lead the charge in SAF production, noting that Africa, home to one of the fastest-growing aviation markets, must position itself at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel development.

With Dangote Refinery’s advanced infrastructure and capacity, AFCAC sees it as a potential key player in reshaping the continent’s aviation fuel landscape, making SAF production a priority for future-proofing the industry. In July 2025, NPA’s shipping data indicated that 488,000 tonnes of the fule left the country, while 527,000 tonnes tonnes in June.

On Tuesday, Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman spoke during a hearing at the U.S. International Trade Commission. Hartman participated alongside other farmers, technology companies, and Brazilian representatives.

Ethanol is mostly made from corn in the United States. The biofuel faces an 18 percent tariff when it enters Brazil. The South American country is the second-largest ethanol producer behind the United States. Brazil pays a 2.5 percent tariff when exporting ethanol to the U.S.

""At the same time, they've been bringing in their sugar cane ethanol into California with hardly no tariff at all,"" Hartman said. ""We as corn growers, we're all about free trade, but we're also about a level playing field and fair trade.""

Hartman said that when Brazilian sugar cane ethanol is imported into California, it is calculated at a lower carbon intensity (CI) score than American-made corn-based ethanol. He said this is mostly due to the different model the Brazilian government uses to calculate carbon emissions.

He said the discussions happening now will have an impact on future market opportunities, including for sustainable aviation fuel.

""I think it's just another situation where we appreciate the Trump administration's working on having a level playing field,"" Hartman said. ""We haven't really done much when it comes to trade agreements for how long. So, now the President has put an emphasis on equal trade throughout the world, and we're hoping that we can get some opportunities to open trade.""

Hartman said new trade deals, including with the United Kingdom, are a step in the right direction.

""The only way we're going to fix this problem if we keep producing a crop like we're doing, is to have more markets,"" he said. ""When it comes to corn, we're at record exports, but we still got this big crop....If this all comes to fruition, there's just a concern that we're going to have $3 corn and we need to sell some grain.""",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WQAD/images/c5729c9f-28c8-43c6-87ec-0c3420e6158c/20250907T231214/c5729c9f-28c8-43c6-87ec-0c3420e6158c_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 20:56:09.689731

About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said.
Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective.
Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.
“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.","RAPID CITY — Jerry Schmitz is rarely at a loss for words about soybeans.

But when asked if farmers have faith in a good outcome from the Trump administration’s trade standoff with China, his gaze shifted and his brow creased momentarily as he thought about the best way to answer.

“Hope might be the better word over faith,” he said.

Schmitz, of rural Vermillion, is the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association and the South Dakota Soybean Checkoff. A checkoff is a fee that’s collected from soybean sales and used for research and promotion of the crop.

South Dakota governor’s economic advisers bemoan Trump’s tariff policy

During and after a roundtable discussion Saturday at the Central States Fairgrounds hosted by a nonprofit called Farmers for Free Trade, Schmitz expressed concerns about the effects of trade disputes on farmers.

About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said. China imports soybeans largely for livestock feed to meet the growing demand for meat among its 1.4 billion people.

Now the country is boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs on Chinese goods imposed recently by Republican President Donald Trump.

“There is not a bushel sold to China right now, and we’re about to harvest,” Schmitz said.

Trump has said he’s wielding tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a negotiating tool to correct trade imbalances with other countries.

The Chinese boycott has reduced demand for U.S. soybeans, which has influenced prices. Soybeans sold for about $10.50 per bushel one year ago in South Dakota, but are now $1 to $1.50 lower, and there are fears of further declines without a China trade deal.

Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective. Noting that South Dakota farmers raise nearly 250 million bushels of soybeans annually, he said a price drop of $2 per bushel translates to a loss of $500 million.

Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.

“We need a deal sooner rather than later,” Johnson said, “because there is not an unlimited ability in farm country to be able to weather the storm.”

Johnson and Schmitz said farmers are planning to store some of the soybeans they’ll harvest this fall, in hopes of selling later at a higher price. Schmitz said grain elevators and soybean processors lacking buyers might have to store excess beans on the ground outside their facilities.

Both also stressed the long-term importance of finding additional buyers for U.S. soybeans. That could include developing better trade relationships with countries that have large populations and growing economies, such as India.

It could also include capitalizing on new domestic markets, such as the possibility of converting soybean oil into sustainable aviation fuel. A $500 million processing plant that will open this fall in Mitchell, for example, will process soybeans and other oilseed crops for uses in renewable fuel, food, livestock feed, lubricants and more.

Those efforts could reduce dependence on Chinese demand but aren’t likely to wholly replace it.

“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.

The congressman said many of the farmers he meets are “still backing the president’s play” to use tariffs in negotiations that could benefit agriculture in the future, but he said high tariffs “cannot be business as usual on a go-forward basis.”

“The president’s trying to use them as a tool to get better deals,” Johnson said. “I understand that approach, but we do not want to just end with high tariffs.”

The roundtable organizer, Farmers for Free Trade, is on a 14-state tour in an RV wrapped with pro-trade messaging. The group advocates for open markets and reduced trade barriers, said its executive director, Brian Kuehl, of Wyoming.

He referenced a statistic indicating exports account for 20% of the value of U.S. agricultural production.

“So if you were to lose all your exports, you’re going to lose farms, and you’re going to lose farmers. You’re going to lose rural America and rural communities,” Kuehl said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2788.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:56:15.927613

Now, are all SAF pathways the same? Of course not.

Today on the podcast we will talk with Mukund Karanjikar, founder and CEO of CleanJoule, a SAF startup based in Utah that is developing a SAF production method that delivers more joules of energy per unit of fuel mass than other traditional biogenic pathways.

What’s more, not content with powering a commercial aviation industry that is thirsty for SAF, CleanJoule is also developing biogenic SAF for space travel. So, when it comes to CleanJoule, you could well say that the sky is not the limit!

The prospect of clean space travel is quite interesting by itself, but, of course, there are other considerations too, such as cost and strategic independence and, on these two counts, CleanJoule is also ready to deliver, says Mukund.

So, in today’s episode we are going to learn a bit more about CycloSAF and CycloRP, the two flavours of sustainable aviation fuel that CleanJoule is developing (for the aviation and space industries, respectively) and how CleanJoule plans to roll out and scale production before the end of this decade.

We will also talk about the positioning of CleanJoule is the broader and constantly evolving SAF industry landscape and why this startup has got the attention of prominent investors such as Indigo Partners (a private equity firm which owns a global portfolio of low-cost airlines) and Temasek (one of Singapore’s most prominent groups).

Airlines such as Lufthansa, Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways are investing heavily in the new twinjet to expand networks, reduce costs, and provide passengers with a comfortable travel experience.

Tourism authorities have welcomed the development, emphasizing the economic benefits of direct flights. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), nonstop flights increase inbound tourism by reducing travel fatigue and making destinations more accessible. Passengers traveling from Sydney to London or Doha to Santiago will experience fewer travel disruptions and shorter overall journey times, enhancing global tourism flows.

Reaching Further Without Compromise

The Boeing 777X family includes two models: the larger 777-9 and the smaller 777-8. The 777-9 can carry approximately 400 passengers up to 7,300 nautical miles, while the 777-8 extends the range to nearly 8,700 nautical miles. These capabilities allow airlines to launch nonstop connections that were previously impossible, offering direct access for tourists to high-demand destinations without layovers.

Advanced Design for Airports and Comfort

A key feature of the 777X is its folding wingtips. While in flight, the wings extend to 71.8 meters for better lift efficiency. On the ground, the wingtips fold to 64.8 meters, allowing the plane to fit into standard 777 gates without costly airport modifications. Unlike the Airbus A380, which required special infrastructure, the 777X can operate at existing airports worldwide.

Inside, the cabin has been redesigned for passenger comfort. Larger windows, wider aisles, and improved lighting allow airlines to create more spacious and flexible seating arrangements. The modern interiors aim to reduce jet lag and improve the travel experience on ultra-long-haul flights.

Powerful and Efficient Engines

The Boeing 777X is powered by the GE9X engines, the world’s largest commercial turbofans with a 134-inch fan diameter. They deliver 10% better fuel efficiency compared with previous models while supporting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Carbon-fiber composite blades make the engines lighter and more durable, reducing maintenance and operating costs for airlines.

Tourism and Economic Impact

Direct, long-range flights create a direct tourism boost for destination cities. Governments and tourism boards, including Tourism Australia and Visit Britain, highlight that nonstop connectivity encourages higher visitor numbers, longer stays, and increased spending in hotels, restaurants, and local attractions.

For example, Sydney tourists flying directly to London for cultural and business trips, or travelers from Doha visiting Santiago for leisure, can now experience a faster and more convenient journey. The 777X will also support business tourism, conferences, and international events by connecting key global hubs.

Airline Commitments and Market Reach

Lufthansa is the launch customer, replacing its Boeing 747 fleet with the 777X. Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways have placed significant orders, signaling confidence in the aircraft’s operational and environmental advantages.

The 777X program currently has 259 orders, representing the largest commercial aircraft investment in history. By offering longer nonstop routes and reduced operational costs, airlines can expand routes, attract more tourists, and strengthen global tourism markets.

Looking Ahead

FAA certification is expected in 2026, following rigorous testing across multiple flight conditions. Governments and tourism agencies are already preparing to market the new direct routes, highlighting ease of access, cultural experiences, and luxury travel opportunities.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-7-2025-06_11_15-PM-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:56:19.678421

That balance gives airlines the flexibility to expand networks and protect margins in slot-constrained airports, Simple Flying reported.

Key Design Innovations

A central feature of the 777X is its composite wing with folding wingtips. Extended, it reaches a span of 71.8 meters for an improved lift-to-drag ratio. On the ground, the tips fold up, reducing the span to 64.8 meters, allowing the aircraft to operate as a Code-E jet without requiring airport modifications.

Unlike the Airbus A380, which faced infrastructure challenges, the 777X can fit seamlessly into existing 777 operations.

The cabin has also been redesigned to provide a better passenger experience, with larger windows, improved lighting, and wider cabins. This gives airlines more flexibility in configuring seating while keeping comfort at the forefront.

Power Behind 777X: GE9X Engines

The GE9X engine is the world’s largest and most powerful commercial turbofan, with a 134-inch fan diameter and a bypass ratio of 10:1.

It delivers a 10% fuel efficiency improvement over the GE90 while cutting thrust-specific fuel consumption by 5% compared with other widebodies.

The fan blades, made from carbon fiber composites with steel leading edges, are lighter and stronger, reducing weight and improving durability. Fewer blades—16 instead of 22 in the GE90—further improve efficiency.

These advances lower maintenance costs, extend shop intervals, and help airlines reduce operating expenses while supporting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use.

Orders and Market Impact

Boeing secured 259 orders at launch, making it the largest aircraft program by dollar value in history. Emirates ordered 150 units, Qatar Airways committed to 50, and Etihad placed an order for 25.

Lufthansa (FRA) purchased 34 of the 777-9, becoming the launch customer and signaling the end of its Boeing 747 operations as the new jets arrive.

The combination of high seat count, lower unit costs, and longer range makes the 777X a versatile replacement for aging quadjets like the Airbus A380 and Boeing 747. It also strengthens airline fleets against rising fuel costs and environmental regulations.

Testing and Certification Progress

The 777X test program is one of Boeing’s most extensive. Recent trials at Victorville (VCV) and Edwards Air Force Base (EDW) covered takeoff performance and environmental condition evaluations.

According to Boeing executives, certification is expected in 2026 after delays from the original 2020 target. FAA guidance continues to shape the certification timeline, with extended ETOPS testing to follow.

Despite setbacks, progress remains steady. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg emphasized that the 777X has accumulated more flight test hours than any prior program, increasing confidence in its entry into service.

Why the 777X Matters

The Boeing 777X stands as a successor to legendary long-haul jets, combining efficiency, reliability, and passenger-focused design.

Its wings, engines, and cabin represent major technological advances, while its ability to operate at existing airports avoids infrastructure limitations.

For airlines, the 777X offers lower costs per seat, longer nonstop missions, and compatibility with SAF, aligning with both commercial and environmental goals. For passengers, it promises a more comfortable, modern experience on the world’s longest flights.

But even if you are closer to the Extinction Rebellion side of that debate, it still does not make much sense to obsess over air travel.
Jet zero is not going to happen, at least not any time soon – and there is no point in wasting more money on it.","Meanwhile, a few countries are even giving up on aviation taxes. From July, anyone getting a plane out of Sweden will no longer have to pay a green levy on their ticket, after its government decided that the “flight-shaming” movement had done too much damage to the industry. India and Germany have also reduced the taxes on air travel. With grim inevitability, Britain’s tax-obsessed Labour Government is still putting them up, with yet more rises in air passenger duty in the last Budget, but at least some countries are recognising they do more harm than good.

The jet zero strategy is in tatters. It is very hard to make the technology of decarbonising air travel work. Batteries are too heavy for a plane, and the electric engines do not generate enough power to keep an aircraft in the air.

Meanwhile the sustainable fuels that could have been an alternative cannot be produced at a competitive price. Sure, that may change, and the technology develops all the time, but we are not even close to making it work yet.

A few of us might be willing to follow the lead of Greta Thunberg and get a boat across the Atlantic, and the network of sleeper trains emerging across Europe will attract a few passengers, but most of us are not willing to give up flying. It remains by far the quickest, cheapest, and of course safest, mode of transport for anything much over 500 miles that we have. All the flight-shaming in the world is not going to change that, while the aviation taxes just add to the cost of living.

We need a change of strategy. We can all take a view on whether climate change is an emergency, or whether it is something that can be managed by gradually switching to different technologies as they emerge, and as they prove themselves effective, reliable, and cheap to run.

But even if you are closer to the Extinction Rebellion side of that debate, it still does not make much sense to obsess over air travel. In fact, flying might get a lot of coverage, partly because virtue-signalling politicians and celebrities love to boast about how they are travelling to Rome by canal, or getting a camel ride to Thailand, or whatever happens to look good on Instagram, but in fact, aviation only accounts for 2.5pc of global carbon emissions. It is never going to be critical to the outlook for global warming one way or another.

It would be far more sensible just to cut back on carbon emissions elsewhere. In the UK we could, for example, get on with building a new generation of nuclear power stations, and scrap all the cumbersome planning rules that make it twice as expensive to build one in Britain as it is in France or South Korea.

Across the EU, countries could drop the tariffs and quotas on Chinese electric vehicles, so that they could accelerate the switch to battery powered models by importing lots of cheap, well made cars. There are still lots of relatively simple ways of decarbonising the economy using technology that has been shown to work. We could then allow people to fly as much as they wanted to, without slapping punitive taxes on anyone who wants to take their children on holiday, or make a business trip; without guilt tripping everyone each time they go to the airport; and without wasting hundreds of millions of technologies that are clearly not going to work.

The blunt reality is this. Jet zero is not going to happen, at least not any time soon – and there is no point in wasting more money on it.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/09/05/TELEMMGLPICT000427218227_17570905056530_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdLdu0TL-Cg_AMOUqySXmFgU.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Comment,N,,2025-09-07 08:56:16.173196

Through Air New Zealand, SAF’s “book and claim” system enables corporate partners to purchase SAF certificates (known as SAFc) that contribute to the airline’s use of sustainable fuel. These certificates can then be applied to a company’s own carbon reporting, helping reduce Scope 3 emissions from business travel.

The trial comes at a time when global momentum around SAF policy and production is rapidly increasing. Airlines, governments, airports, and fuel companies across the Asia-Pacific region are investing in alternative fuels, and Air New Zealand is working to help ensure New Zealand is at the table given our nation’s heavy reliance on long-haul aviation and trade.

MinterEllisonRuddWatts’ involvement aligns with its Sustainability Strategy and reinforces the firm’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The firm has pledged that 80% of its travel during the working week will be sustainable and is actively seeking innovative ways to reduce its environmental impact.

“This partnership demonstrates our leadership and accountability in the sustainability sector,” says Holly Hill, partner and sustainability leader at the firm.

“By championing SAF, we’re not only addressing a portion of our carbon footprint – we’re also helping to stimulate demand for sustainable fuel and encourage local production in New Zealand.”

Air New Zealand has offered emissions reductions through SAF to a group of early adopters to better understand corporate customer demand and inform future SAF investment, says Kiri Hannifin, the airline’s chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer.

“SAF is a complex commodity to understand, and it's a big step for a New Zealand company to buy SAF certificates because they're so new. We are very grateful to MinterEllisonRuddWatts for the leap of faith they have shown and for their leadership,” says Hannifin.

“Customers contributing to SAF like this is meaningful not only for climate reasons, but also because their action helps set up and scale a global SAF system for the future.”

But only if we dare to move from consumers to producers, from workers to entrepreneurs, from pragmatism to sustainability.","- Advertisement -

One afternoon at a vocational aviation campus in Curug, a young student approached me after class. His eyes lit up as he described a simple idea: building an application to optimize crew scheduling so that airlines could run more efficiently. “If this were in the United States,” he said, “an idea like this could easily get the attention of investors. But here, it’s almost impossible. Forget about funding—getting permission just to test it is already a big hurdle.”

His frustration was real, yet his words captured something larger: the dilemma of Indonesia’s aviation ecosystem. We have thousands of young people who are talented, disciplined, and full of ideas. They dream not only of flying planes or repairing engines, but also of designing new systems, apps, and hardware. Yet the ecosystem around them is not fertile. Airports are deemed too risky for experiments. Operators hesitate to become the first customers. Regulators remain more focused on maintaining the status quo than opening space for innovation.

This is paradoxical. If there is one sector where Indonesia cannot afford to stagnate, it is aviation. With over 17,000 islands, our nation depends on the skies for integration, connectivity, and growth. Aviation is not just another industry; it is the backbone of national unity. But without entrepreneurs who can transform ideas into sustainable businesses, we risk being forever dependent on imported technologies while our own talents remain spectators.

The Urgency in Numbers

The aviation sector is not just strategic for Indonesia—it is economically massive. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air transport contributes US$15 billion annually to Indonesia’s GDP and supports more than 4 million jobs directly and indirectly. By 2035, passenger traffic in Indonesia is projected to nearly triple, making it one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world.

Meanwhile, the global drone logistics market is projected to reach US$29 billion by 2030. The market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), driven by global decarbonization goals, is expected to exceed US$200 billion by 2050. These are not abstract numbers—they represent opportunities where Indonesia’s young entrepreneurs could play a role, if only given the chance.

Yet, the paradox is glaring. While we graduate tens of thousands of students from vocational and technical aviation schools annually, almost all are channeled into fixed career tracks: pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers, ground staff. The pipeline is efficient for producing workers, but barren for producing innovators.

In comparison, Singapore—despite having only a fraction of our population—has already launched over 100 aviation-related startups through its Aviation Innovation Programme. Indonesia, with 270 million people and 17,000 islands, has virtually none making it to international recognition.

This is not just a missed opportunity—it is a strategic vulnerability.

Problem Definition: A Worker’s Paradigm in a Changing Economy

- Advertisement -

For decades, Indonesia’s vocational aviation schools have excelled at producing skilled workers: pilots, engineers, ground handlers, and technicians. This is necessary—safety and professionalism are paramount in aviation. But it has also created a “worker paradigm.” Students are trained to be operators of systems, not creators of solutions. They become competent “tukang”—craftsmen—rather than entrepreneurs.

This paradigm reinforces a pragmatic economy mindset. The goal is to graduate, secure a job, earn a stable salary, and climb the professional ladder. There is little room for risk-taking, innovation, or entrepreneurship. For many students, the safest career is working in state-owned airlines or airport authorities, not starting a business.

At the same time, the ecosystem is weak. There are few testbeds where students or startups can experiment. Private investors avoid aviation, seeing it as capital-intensive and heavily regulated. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) prefer to buy off-the-shelf foreign technologies rather than take risks with local innovators. As a result, young Indonesians with fresh ideas hit a wall: they have the talent, they have the ideas, but they lack the market, the funding, and the policy space.

The consequence is stark: while Indonesia consumes foreign aviation technologies, we contribute little to global innovation. Our airports are filled with imported systems, our airlines rely on foreign software, and our startups shy away from aviation altogether. This worker-oriented, pragmatic model may have served us in the past, but it cannot sustain Indonesia’s aviation future.

Policy Window: Why Now?

The timing could not be more critical. Several factors converge to make this the right moment to push for aviation entrepreneurship.

First, the demographic dividend. Indonesia is experiencing a surge of young talent. Millions of students graduate from vocational and technical schools every year. If even a fraction of this energy can be channeled into entrepreneurship, the impact would be transformative.

Second, global sustainability pressures. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) are pushing for greener, more sustainable aviation. Airlines worldwide are exploring electric ground support equipment, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and carbon-monitoring technologies. Indonesia cannot remain on the sidelines.

Third, ASEAN competition. Singapore has established itself as a regional hub for aviation innovation, with sandbox environments at Changi Airport. Vietnam and Thailand are aggressively investing in drone logistics and smart airports. If Indonesia fails to act, we risk being left behind in our own backyard.

Fourth, the digital economy momentum. Indonesia has already proven it can produce unicorns such as Gojek, Tokopedia, and Traveloka. These successes demonstrate that young Indonesians are capable of world-class innovation when the ecosystem supports them. Aviation, as a sector deeply intertwined with logistics and digital solutions, is a natural next frontier.

In short, the window of opportunity is open. The question is whether we will seize it.

The Cost of Inaction

If Indonesia fails to act, the consequences will be more than economic.

Dependence on imports. We will continue to purchase aviation technologies—from air traffic management software to biometric boarding systems—from foreign suppliers. This not only drains foreign reserves but also weakens technological sovereignty.

Talent exodus. Talented youth frustrated by lack of opportunities will either leave the sector or migrate abroad. Already, we see Indonesian engineers contributing to aerospace projects in Singapore or even the Middle East.

Lost sustainability momentum. With global aviation under pressure to reduce emissions, Indonesia risks being labeled a “laggard,” missing out on green financing and carbon-credit opportunities.

Regional marginalization. As ASEAN neighbors push forward with drone logistics, urban air mobility, and smart airports, Indonesia could find itself sidelined—reduced to being a consumer market rather than a producer hub.

The opportunity cost is staggering: every year of inaction means billions in potential market value slipping away.

Concrete Areas of Innovation

Indonesia does not need to chase science-fiction dreams; many practical areas await innovation:

Smart apron management systems to reduce congestion.

Drone-based agricultural spraying for plantations in Kalimantan and Sumatra.

Digital compliance platforms for safety audits.

Electrified ground support equipment (e-GSE) for greener airports.

Cold-chain cargo monitoring to support fisheries and pharmaceuticals.

These niches are pragmatic, high-demand, and scalable—perfect entry points for young entrepreneurs.

Evidence and Comparative Analysis

Around the world, countries are finding ways to balance safety and innovation.

Singapore: Changi Airport has pioneered the Changi Innovation Sandbox, a controlled environment where startups can test technologies ranging from biometric boarding to automated baggage handling. This model shows that safety and innovation can coexist if there are boundaries and frameworks.

Rwanda: Despite limited infrastructure, Rwanda has become a global leader in drone logistics. Through partnerships with Zipline, drones deliver blood and medical supplies to remote villages in minutes. The lesson: innovation does not require a wealthy ecosystem, but it does require regulatory will and openness.

European Union: Through programs like Horizon Europe, the EU funds sustainable aviation projects—from SAF research to green airport infrastructure. By blending public funding with private innovation, Europe demonstrates how to align entrepreneurship with sustainability goals.

These examples illustrate a critical point: Indonesia does not need to reinvent the wheel. The models are out there. What is missing is the political will and institutional design to adapt them to our context.

Policy Recommendations: Building an Aviation Entrepreneurship Ecosystem

To shift from workers to entrepreneurs, and from pragmatic to sustainable economics, Indonesia must pursue a coherent set of policies. Six pillars stand out.

Curriculum Reform: Embedding Entrepreneurship in Vocational Education

Vocational aviation campuses must go beyond technical training. Entrepreneurship modules should be integrated into curricula. Students must learn how to develop business plans, pitch ideas, and assess risks alongside technical mastery. Final-year projects should not only be academic theses but also business proposals tested in real environments.

Airport Sandboxes: Creating Living Laboratories

Selected airports should be transformed into controlled innovation hubs. For example:

Kertajati as a hub for drone logistics and regional cargo solutions.

Soekarno-Hatta as a center for smart airport operations.

Batam as a cluster for light aerospace manufacturing and maintenance.

With proper regulation, these sandboxes can allow experimentation without compromising safety.

Sustainable Financing: Funding Innovation Responsibly

The government should establish green financing schemes for aviation startups. This includes:

Tax deductions for R&D.

Import duty exemptions for prototype components.

Matching funds where government co-invests alongside private investors.

By tying these funds to sustainability metrics, Indonesia can ensure that entrepreneurship aligns with long-term goals.

Domestic First-Customer Scheme: SOEs as Early Adopters

State-owned enterprises should act as “first customers” for local startups. A six-month trial contract with limited value can provide crucial validation. If successful, the product can be scaled. This approach spreads risk while giving innovators a chance to prove themselves.

Sustainable Business Integration

All business plans emerging from aviation campuses must incorporate sustainability. Whether it is reducing emissions, enhancing energy efficiency, or enabling circular economy practices, sustainability should be a default requirement.

Community and Branding: Building a Culture of Innovation

Indonesia needs a recurring platform such as an “Indonesia Aviation Startup Forum” to connect students, regulators, investors, and operators. Annual competitions can showcase talent and attract attention. Over time, this builds not just individual startups but also a culture that sees aviation as fertile ground for innovation.

Entrepreneurial Vision: From Tukang to Innovator, From Consumer to Producer

At its core, this is about a paradigm shift.

From tukang—skilled workers who execute tasks—to entrepreneurs who identify problems, design solutions, and create jobs.

From pragmatic economics, where the goal is stability and survival, to sustainable economics, where the goal is resilience, innovation, and long-term value.

From consumer of foreign technologies to producer of local solutions that can compete globally.

Vocational campuses can become the breeding ground of this transformation. They already instill discipline, precision, and technical excellence—the very qualities required for aviation. By adding entrepreneurship and sustainability to this foundation, we can produce a generation of innovators who are both competent and visionary.

Closing Narrative

As the conversation with the student in Curug ended, he looked at me with determination. “I don’t want to just be a spectator,” he said. “I want to build something in my own country.”

His words were simple, but they carried profound meaning. Indonesia’s youth are ready. They do not lack talent or ideas. What they lack is an ecosystem that allows them to grow from workers into entrepreneurs, from pragmatic earners into sustainable innovators.

If regulators can become facilitators, if airports can serve as laboratories, if investors can show trust, then Indonesia’s skies will not only connect islands. They will also showcase the creativity and ingenuity of our own people.

When that happens, we can finally say: the skies above Indonesia are not just airways—they are spaces of innovation, pride, and sustainable prosperity.

The sky above Indonesia is not just a passageway for planes. It can be a laboratory of innovation, a marketplace of ideas, and a symbol of national pride. But only if we dare to move from consumers to producers, from workers to entrepreneurs, from pragmatism to sustainability.

Neste’s current production capability is about 100,000 tons of SAF per year, worldwide. By the end of 2023, the company intends to increase that capacity to around 1.5 million tons of SAF annually. Other producers are ramping to begin or increase their production, with the potential for more than 1 billion gallons of SAF produced annually globally by 2025, according to the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative. Other methods of achieving carbon neutrality, such as carbon offsetting, building more efficient infrastructure, and development of more efficient aircraft, including electric aircraft, will certainly contribute to aviation’s decrease in emissions and overall mission of sustainability, but experts agree SAF is the key. If SAF is such a critical component to decreasing emissions and to carbon neutrality in the aviation sector, why aren’t aircraft operators using more of it? Two variables impact SAF use, and they’re the usual chicken-and-egg market scenario. SAF suppliers are hesitant to ramp up production and supply until they know there is industry demand to purchase SAF. Some potential SAF purchasers are hesitant to purchase SAF at the current prices. More demand will result in more supply, which will inevitably lower the price, leading to more demand. Building effective infrastructure for SAF production and delivery and creating sustainability-friendly policy will be vital as supply and demand increase. “SAF is widely considered to hold the greatest near-term potential for reducing aviation’s climate impact, as it can reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional (petroleum-based) jet fuel, with even greater reductions possible in the future,” aviation groups said while advocating for incentivizing the use of SAF through public policy. The good news is – the overview above is nowhere near a complete accounting for the industry’s progress toward widespread SAF usage in the last year. And as Vettel demonstrated in Bahrain, SAF is available for those who demand it.

About London Heathrow Airport Originally opened in 1946 as London Airport, London Heathrow Airport has evolved from a small airfield into the world-class facility it is today, comprising five terminals.","London Heathrow Airport (LHR) is by far the busiest airport in the UK, processing more than 83 million passengers in 2024. The facility is the world's best-connected international airport, offering direct links to over 200 destinations worldwide.

However, not content with its current accolades, and in order to ensure it continues to offer the best possible passenger experience and to support the significant operational challenges often faced by many airports, London Heathrow Airport is embarking on a massive £2.3 billion ($3.1 billion) upgrade plan over the next two years, which will be privately funded.

In this article, we will examine the plans and their implications for the airport's airline operators and the millions of passengers they serve. We will also consider London Heathrow Airport's place in the wider aviation industry.

Greater Accessibility & Improved Operational Resilience

Before embarking on its recently announced £2.3 billion upgrade plan, London Heathrow Airport consulted closely with airline partners and more than two million passengers to better understand their challenges and needs. As a result, one of the key objectives of the airport's plan is to enhance accessibility, enabling all passengers to navigate the airport with dignity and independence. Although the specifics are yet to be revealed, it will do this through the Independent Journeys Project, which is designed to empower passengers who need extra assistance and offer more autonomous travel options throughout the airport.

Another major aim of the plan is to improve operational resilience and punctuality. To achieve this, some of the privately funded investment will be put towards changing the airfield layout and increasing the number of aircraft stands. Significant investment will also be made in the airport's baggage delivery systems, helping to ensure baggage is delivered to the right place in a quicker timeframe.

Sustainability Is Key

Sustainability is now one of the key areas of focus for all industries around the world, and even more so in aviation. It is therefore unsurprising that developing sustainable initiatives features heavily in London Heathrow Airport's £2.3 billion upgrade plan.

This will include the addition of more walking and cycling routes between terminals through Active Travel initiatives, investment in electric vehicle infrastructure, energy-efficient buildings, and innovative waste-reduction solutions, demonstrating the airport's commitment to sustainable transport solutions. This will also involve the use of the latest technologies to align the operation with London Heathrow Airport's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions.

The CEO of London Heathrow Airport, Thomas Woldbye, reiterated that the improvement and expansion of the airport's infrastructure can go hand in hand with greater sustainability.

“With strict environmental safeguards, expanding Heathrow will prove that the UK economy can be grown responsibly and deliver on commitments to future generations. This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon that the Government sets out in the Airports National Policy Statement – it’s as simple as that. Even though we’re serving more passengers than ever before, our noise footprint is smaller and we’re also using more sustainable aviation fuel than ever before. I want to assure you that we are committed to listening and working with our local communities to provide them with the certainty they deserve, ending years of doubt.”

Significant Investment Has Already Been Made

In addition to the £2.3 billion upgrade plan that London Heathrow Airport is about to embark on, the facility has already made around £1.1 billion ($1.49 billion) of improvements in 2024, involving more than 1,100 supply chain partners from across the UK and beyond.

This includes a £191 million ($258 million) upgrade to the airport's security facilities, which has already started to prove fruitful, with improvements in both passenger satisfaction and operational efficiency. This is no mean feat, given that the airport boasts more than 140 individual security lanes across its four operational terminals. The airport aims to have at least 95% of passengers passing through security in under five minutes.

London Heathrow Airport is also in the process of installing advanced CT scanners, which will initially mean that passengers are no longer required to remove liquids or electronic devices from their bags, with the longer-term goal of being able to remove the 100ml liquid restriction altogether. The airport had initially hoped to finish this work in 2024, but the completion date has since been pushed back to 2025.

The World's Best-Connected International Airport

According to data from OAG, London Heathrow Airport was ranked the world's best-connected international airport in 2024, thanks to its direct links to over 200 destinations worldwide. The airport managed to retain its number one position in 2023. The world's second-best connected international airport last year was Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KUL), followed by Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND) in third place. The busiest international routes from Kuala Lumpur International Airport last year were:

Meanwhile, the best-connected airport on an international level in the US is still John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), although the facility fell from second place in 2023 to sixth place in 2024. New York-JFK currently serves more than 190 destinations in over 80 countries, with flights operated by around 70 different airlines from across the world. This includes more than 35 destinations in Europe and 12 in South America.

London Heathrow Airport's Role In The UK's Economy

London Heathrow Airport plays a major role in the UK's economy, connecting the country with businesses and tourists from across the world. The benefits will also be felt more locally too, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) surrounding the airport benefiting from increased opportunities for trade. London Heathrow Airport's upgrade plan will undoubtedly help to cement the UK's position as a leading global destination for international business and tourism.

If and when a third runway is eventually built at London Heathrow Airport, economic benefits will likely be felt throughout the whole country, with studies estimating a 0.43% increase in GDP by 2050 thanks to the proposed expansion. The UK's Chancellor approved the third runway program earlier this year.

“This privately funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year. Heathrow is proud to answer the Chancellor's call to get Britain building,"" Woldbye said. ""A third runway is critical for the country’s future economic success, and I confirm we will submit our plans for a third runway to Government this summer. Ahead of then, as part of a phased expansion programme and supported by the Government’s clear backing, I am today confirming multi-billion-pound investment plans, 100% privately funded, to upgrade our terminal buildings, enhance passenger experience, and improve resilience and sustainability. This is vital investment and will ensure Heathrow remains globally competitive and a jewel in the country’s crown – the UK’s Gateway to Growth”.

About London Heathrow Airport

Originally opened in 1946 as London Airport, London Heathrow Airport has evolved from a small airfield into the world-class facility it is today, comprising five terminals. However, only four are currently operational, as Terminal 1 has been closed since 2015. Terminals 2 and 5 are the most modern, having opened in 2008 and 2014, respectively. The latter is home to the airport's largest airline operator, British Airways.

Terminal 2 was designed to be efficient, modern, and passenger-focused, replacing the original 1955 structure with a far more sustainable and spacious terminal. The building features a visually striking, wave-like roof, flooding the terminal with natural light. Linear passenger journeys also help to reduce walking distances. Today, Terminal 2 is home to most Star Alliance carriers, including United Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Air Canada.

London Heathrow Airport is served by more than 80 airlines. Both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have hubs at the airport, but many other carriers from around the world fly into the airport from their respective hubs, including Qantas, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, LATAM Airlines, China Airlines, and Air India. The busiest destinations from the airport in 2024 are outlined in the table below:

As further improvements are made to London Heathrow Airport's operational resilience and passenger experience, it is only likely that the facility will be able to handle more flights, more passengers, and more connections in the future.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2179773861-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-07 04:56:14.340752

China has dramatically increased its investment footprint in Brazil's energy landscape, establishing itself as a dominant foreign investor in South America's largest economy. In 2024, Chinese investments in Brazil more than doubled year-over-year, reaching $4.18 billion across 39 projects, with the China investment in Brazil energy sector capturing the largest share of this capital influx. This strategic focus reflects China's dual approach to securing both traditional and renewable resources while expanding its global economic influence.

The power sector, particularly solar and wind projects, received 34% ($1.43 billion) of total Chinese investments in Brazil during 2024, while oil and gas attracted 25% ($1 billion). This balanced approach demonstrates China's pragmatic energy transition trends that simultaneously advances renewable capacity while maintaining access to fossil fuel resources.

What Drives China's Interest in Brazilian Energy Resources?

Strategic Resource Security

China's investment strategy in Brazil is fundamentally driven by resource security concerns. As the world's largest energy consumer, China seeks to diversify its supply sources and reduce vulnerability to market volatility and geopolitical tensions. Brazil offers an attractive combination of established oil production, renewable energy potential, and critical minerals necessary for energy transition technologies.

The investments serve multiple strategic objectives:

Securing long-term access to Brazil's offshore oil reserves

Establishing positions in renewable energy development

Accessing critical minerals like lithium, niobium, and rare earths

Building influence in a major regional economy with significant natural resources

Complementary Energy Policies

Both China and Brazil pursue parallel energy strategies that combine aggressive renewable energy expansion with continued fossil fuel development. Brazil maintains approximately 90% renewable electricity generation (primarily hydropower) while simultaneously expanding its oil production capacity. Similarly, China leads globally in renewable energy deployment while continuing to develop coal, oil, and gas resources.

This policy alignment creates natural investment synergies, allowing Chinese firms to pursue diverse energy projects that match their domestic expertise and strategic priorities. According to a recent analysis by Alvarez & Marsal, this complementary approach has positioned Brazil as China's third-largest investment destination globally.

Which Sectors Receive the Most Chinese Investment?

Renewable Energy Dominance

Since 2007, Chinese companies have invested $77.5 billion across 303 projects in Brazil, with the power sector claiming the largest share at 45% of total investments. Major Chinese energy corporations have established significant positions in Brazil's renewable energy landscape:

China Three Gorges (CTG): Acquired multiple hydroelectric assets and developed solar projects

State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC): Invested in wind and solar facilities

CGN Power: Developed utility-scale solar installations and transmission infrastructure

The Luiz Gonzaga Solar Complex represents one flagship project with substantial Chinese investment, highlighting the scale of renewable energy commitments and battery recycling innovation efforts.

Oil and Gas Strategic Positioning

The oil industry ranks as the second-largest recipient of Chinese investment at 29% of the cumulative total since 2007. Chinese national oil companies have secured stakes in Brazil's prolific pre-salt offshore oil basin, which has driven most of Brazil's production growth in recent years.

These investments provide China with:

Direct access to Brazilian crude oil exports

Participation in production sharing agreements

Technology transfer opportunities in deep-water exploration

Diversification away from Middle Eastern oil dependencies

Critical Minerals and Manufacturing

Beyond direct energy investments, Chinese firms have strategically targeted Brazil's mining sector, focusing on materials essential for the energy transition supply chain. For example, China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group (CNMC) acquired Brazilian firm Mineração Taboca, the country's largest refined tin producer, for $340 million in late 2024.

This acquisition secured access to:

Tin (used in solar panel manufacturing)

Niobium (critical for high-strength steel and superconductors)

Tantalum (essential for electronics and energy storage)

Manufacturing investments have also followed, representing 8% of total Chinese investment since 2007, often supporting energy-related supply chains.

What Are the Recent Investment Trends?

Strategic Adaptation

As global energy markets evolve, Chinese investments will likely adapt to changing priorities while maintaining core strategic objectives. This may include greater emphasis on technologies supporting electrification, digitalization, and decarbonization while maintaining positions in conventional energy resources.

The investment relationship will continue balancing:

Short-term resource security needs

Long-term energy transition goals

Technological leadership ambitions

Economic and political influence objectives

Conclusion

China's multibillion-dollar investments in Brazil's energy sector represent a sophisticated strategy that secures access to both traditional and renewable resources while expanding economic influence in Latin America's largest economy. The complementary energy policies of both nations create natural investment synergies, despite apparent contradictions between fossil fuel development and renewable energy expansion.

As Brazil positions itself to host the COP30 climate summit while simultaneously pursuing oil production growth, Chinese investment provides crucial capital and technology to advance both conventional and renewable energy development. This partnership will continue shaping global China investment in Brazil energy markets, supply chains, and geopolitical relationships in the coming decades.

The dual focus on securing traditional energy resources while investing heavily in renewables reflects a pragmatic approach to energy transition—one that acknowledges the continuing importance of fossil fuels while building the infrastructure for a lower-carbon future. As this investment relationship evolves, it will significantly influence both countries' energy landscapes and their positions in the global energy order.

Menurut data Traction Energy Asia, Indonesia menghasilkan sekitar 933.200 kilo liter minyak jelantah setiap tahun. Tanpa pengelolaan, limbah ini bisa mencemari lingkungan, namun jika diolah, dapat menjadi sumber energi berkelanjutan.

Pertamina melalui inovasinya berhasil mengolah minyak jelantah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), bahan bakar ramah lingkungan yang mampu menurunkan emisi karbon hingga lebih dari 80% dibanding avtur biasa. Pada Agustus lalu, Pertamina resmi memproduksi SAF pertama di Indonesia sekaligus Asia Tenggara melalui Kilang Cilacap. Produk PertaminaSAF ini bahkan telah meraih sertifikasi internasional ISCC dan RSB sebagai jaminan standar keberlanjutan global.

Komperta Plaju Jadi Pionir Pengumpulan Jelantah di Sumatera

Produk PertaminaSAF bukan hanya hasil inovasi teknologi, tetapi juga strategi penting untuk mendukung ketahanan energi, menjaga lingkungan, sekaligus memberdayakan masyarakat. Pertamina menekankan bahwa keterlibatan publik adalah kunci terbentuknya ekosistem SAF yang berkelanjutan. Melalui inisiatif ini, limbah minyak jelantah (UCO) tidak hanya berkurang, tetapi juga memberi manfaat ekonomi. Salah satu jalur partisipasi yang dihadirkan adalah UCOllect Box.

Bekerja sama dengan Noovoleum, Pertamina menempatkan UCOllect Box di berbagai titik Indonesia sebagai sarana masyarakat menyetorkan minyak jelantah agar bisa diolah kembali menjadi energi ramah lingkungan. Di Sumatera, fasilitas ini pertama kali hadir di Komperta Kilang Plaju dan Komperta Sungai Gerong, Palembang, tepatnya di toko swalayan Coopmart, Jalan Antara No. 292, Plaju. Lokasi ini dipilih karena dinilai memiliki potensi besar dalam mendukung pengumpulan minyak jelantah.

Sejak beroperasi pada Februari 2025, antusiasme warga Palembang terus meningkat. Data Kilang Plaju mencatat, rata-rata 175 liter minyak jelantah berhasil dikumpulkan setiap bulan sepanjang Februari–Agustus 2025. Sumbernya beragam, mulai dari dapur Koperasi Wanita Petra (KWP), rumah tangga pekerja, hingga masyarakat umum di sekitar Plaju. Fakta ini memperlihatkan tumbuhnya kesadaran kolektif warga untuk mengelola limbah secara lebih bertanggung jawab, dengan semakin banyak keluarga memilih menyalurkan minyak bekas gorengan ke UCOllect Box ketimbang membuangnya sembarangan.

Area Manager Communication, Relations & CSR Kilang Plaju, Siti Rachmi Indahsari, menegaskan bahwa program ini merupakan langkah strategis perusahaan untuk menghubungkan dapur masyarakat dengan agenda besar transisi energi.

“Pengelolaan limbah tidak hanya tentang membuang, tetapi bagaimana kita bisa memanfaatkannya kembali agar memiliki nilai ekonomi sekaligus mendukung energi hijau. Pertamina mengajak masyarakat untuk berpartisipasi dalam ekosistem energi bersih yang berkelanjutan, dengan mengumpulkan setiap tetes jelantah di dapur untuk menjadi produk SAF,” imbuhnya.

Terbuka Untuk Umum

Fasilitas UCOllect Box di Palembang terbuka untuk seluruh masyarakat, memungkinkan siapa pun menyetorkan minyak jelantah mereka. Dengan begitu, manfaatnya tidak hanya dirasakan warga Komperta, tetapi juga menjadi sarana partisipasi kolektif masyarakat luas dalam mendukung energi bersih.

Kehadiran UCOllect membuktikan bahwa transformasi energi hijau bisa dimulai dari langkah sederhana. Satu liter minyak jelantah yang sebelumnya berpotensi mencemari jutaan liter air, kini bernilai Rp5.500 jika ditukarkan, sekaligus menjadi bagian rantai pasok bahan baku Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Dari dapur rumah tangga hingga tangki pesawat, setiap tetes jelantah berkontribusi menghadirkan energi ramah lingkungan.

Dengan capaian ini, Kilang Plaju tidak hanya berperan sebagai pengolah migas dan petrokimia, tetapi juga motor penggerak energi berkelanjutan. Program ini memperlihatkan bagaimana minyak jelantah yang terkumpul dapat mendorong Indonesia menuju era penerbangan rendah emisi sekaligus menjaga bumi untuk generasi mendatang.

Inisiatif ini juga sejalan dengan komitmen Pertamina dalam menerapkan prinsip Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) serta mendukung pencapaian Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs).",https://images.bloombergtechnoz.com/data/2025/09/image-20250906175452.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 23:56:15.315600

There is a growing need to expand Sarawak’s aerospace capacity, following a strong rebound in Sarawak’s air traffic.

According to Transport Minister Datuk Seri Lee Kim Shin during the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly (DUN) Sitting in May this year, the state recorded 30,980 aircraft movements and 2.5 million passengers in the first quarter of 2025 (1Q25).

This marks an eight per cent increase compared to the same period last year.

He added that air cargo movements also surged by 23.3 per cent to 14,438 tonnes, driven by rising demand for electronics, oil and gas equipment, e-commerce goods, perishables and general cargo.

“Internationally, Sarawak currently sees 37 international flights per week, while domestic routes from other Malaysian states contribute an average of 427 weekly flights,” he said.

“Kuching International Airport remains the busiest hub with 216 weekly flights, followed by Miri (99), Sibu (55), and Bintulu (45).”

Sarawak’s very own airline, AirBorneo, is on track to officially take to the skies by early 2026, following the full acquisition of MASwings Sdn Bhd from Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG).

During the Sarawak DUN Sitting in May, Lee noted that the Share Purchase Agreement between the Sarawak Government and MAG was signed on February 12 this year, with the legal and beneficial ownership of MASwings expected to be transferred to AirBorneo Holdings Sdn Bhd by Dec 31, 2025.

“All stakeholders are actively working to fulfil the necessary regulatory, operational and legal requirements during this transition period to ensure a seamless handover.

“AirBorneo will also focus on enhancing regional and international air connectivity, while continuing to serve rural areas under the Rural Air Services (RAS),” he added in his ministerial winding-up speech at the May DUN Sitting.

He said to ensure service continuity, all MASwings staff will be retained post-acquisition, leveraging their experience to maintain reliability.

He also assured that the schedule, frequency and routes under the RAS network will remain unchanged during and after the transition.

Progress is being made for the state-owned airline. Last week, the Sarawak government officially launched its airline logo named ‘Wings of Unity’ at Satria Pertiwi Complex officiated by Sarawak Premier, Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Abdul Rahman Zohari Tun Datuk Abang Openg.

The Premier described this move as a symbol of confidence in Sarawak’s position in the global landscape, as well as emphasising AirBorneo’s role in supporting the Post-Covid-19 Development Strategy (PCDS 2030) through improved Asean air connectivity, job opportunities, improved infrastructure and support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

The new airline’s brand identity also features elements of Sarawak’s heritage colours and motifs, symbolising the diversity and unity of the Borneo community.

AirBorneo is expected to commence operations in January 2026, taking over and expanding MASwings’ services, including full routes and rural to inland air services.

New airline progressing well, but deadline looms

Nevertheless, starting an airline is one of the most complex and capital-intensive ventures in the business world, involving a daunting number of legal, financial, and operational hurdles.

According to an industry observer, the airline industry is highly regulated and competitive, requiring significant investment and expertise.

“Airlines are extremely capital-intensive. Beyond the cost of acquiring or leasing aircraft — which is often staggering — a new airline must secure funding for a wide array of other expenses, including aircraft acquisition, operational costs and labour,” the specialist commented to BizHive.

This includes hiring and training pilots, flight attendants, ground crew, and administrative staff is a massive undertaking. Pilots, in particular, require extensive and expensive training and certification.

“A new airline must also navigate a labyrinth of regulations in Malaysia to get off the ground. The most critical step is obtaining an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) from the national civil aviation authority. This process is rigorous and can take years.

“It requires a new airline to prove its competency in several key areas such as operational safety (the airline must demonstrate it has the procedures, manuals, and staff to ensure safe flight operations) and maintenance.”

The industry observer noted that the acquisition of an existing carrier like MASwings by AirBorneo simplifies some of this processes, as MASwings already holds an AOC. However, the transition still requires regulatory approval for changes in ownership, management, and operational scope.

“The process of obtaining additional route licenses and international approvals for new destinations also adds to the complexity.”

A successful airline also relies on a complex network of interconnected systems and services for fleet management, route planning and IT systems for the implementation and integration of essential systems for reservations, ticketing, crew scheduling, and maintenance tracking.

For AirBorneo, the transition from MASwings presents its own unique set of challenges from the perspective of a business model shift.

“MASwings primarily operated as a subsidised rural air service (RAS), focusing on domestic routes in East Malaysia with a fleet of turboprop aircraft like the ATR72-500s,” the observer noted.

“AirBorneo, however, aims to become a full-service carrier (FSC) with a hub-and-spoke model, expanding to regional and international routes.

“This requires a fundamental shift in strategy, fleet, and services, including new aircraft and service level upgrades.”

All eyes are locked in on the December 31, 2025 deadline for the transfer of the legal and beneficial ownership of MASwings to AirBorneo Holdings Sdn Bhd.

Global aero giants boost presence in Sarawak

Catching the attention of the world’s leading aviation giants, Airbus and Boeing, is testament to Sarawak’s rapid aerospace potential.

Airbus and Boeing are the two largest aerospace manufacturers in the world, and their histories reflect different paths to market dominance.

Boeing’s story is one of a pioneering American company that grew into a global powerhouse. The company’s position was solidified with the launch of the 707 in 1958, which ushered in the era of commercial jets.

This was followed by the highly successful 747 ‘jumbo jet’ in 1970, which revolutionised long-haul air travel and made mass air transportation a reality.

Over the decades, Boeing expanded its portfolio to include a family of popular aircraft like the 737 and 777, military planes, and space vehicles, becoming the undisputed leader in the aerospace industry for much of the 20th century.

In the late 1960s, American manufacturers like Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Lockheed dominated the global aviation market. To compete, several European nations, including France, Germany, Spain, and the UK, formed a consortium called Airbus Industrie GIE in 1970.

Their first aircraft, the A300, was the world’s first twin-engine wide-body jet. While initially slow to gain sales, its success was a major step towards establishing a European presence in the market.

Airbus’s big breakthrough came with the A320 in 1987, which introduced new technologies like “fly-by-wire” flight controls, which were a game-changer for the industry. This marked the beginning of intense competition between the two companies.

Airbus’s strategy focused on a family of aircraft with a common cockpit design to reduce training costs for airlines. The company later challenged Boeing’s dominance in the super-jumbo market with the A380, the world’s largest passenger airliner, in 2007.

Today, both Airbus and Boeing define the aerospace industry, with both companies constantly innovating and competing for market share.

Sarawak is tapping into their global expertise via strategic partnerships focused on talent development, technological innovation, and sustainable aviation, are set to transform the state into a regional hub for high-technology industries.

With both Airbus and Boeing now actively involved in developing the state’s aerospace sector, Sarawak is well on its way to achieving its goal of becoming a key player in the global aviation landscape.

Sarawak partners Airbus to develop aerospace industry

Back in early May, the Sarawak government announced a strategic collaboration with Airbus in developing the state’s aerospace industry.

During an official visit to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, Abang Johari stated that the official visit has opened the door to six key areas agreed upon for joint exploration, with the goal of establishing Sarawak as a new aerospace hub in the Asia-Pacific region.

According to a Sarawak Public Communications Unit (Ukas) report, the Sarawak Premier said one of the identified areas is the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with Sarawak actively conducting research to produce SAF in line with the global goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“The second area is the development of human capital in the aerospace industry, with collaboration between Airbus and local institutions such as i-CATS to be expanded in order to develop training programmes and aerospace-related syllabi.

“This initiative will open up opportunities for Sarawakian students to undergo industrial training at an international standard,” he said at a press conference following the working visit to the Airbus Campus and the ATR headquarters in May.

The third area of agreement, he added, involves the development of a supporting industry ecosystem.

Sarawak will also explore the potential for manufacturing composite materials and gas-based synthetic leather for use in the aviation industry, in addition to avionics technology and instrumentation related to AI-powered smart chips.

“The fourth area involves the digitalisation of travel and aviation services, with the introduction of a ‘digital journey’ concept.

“This is aimed at integrating the entire travel process—from flight ticket booking and the use of the Autonomous Rapid Transit (ART) transportation system to accommodation—into one seamless digital package,” he further explained.

The fifth agreed area is the establishment of a Sarawak–Airbus Joint Task Force to formulate a roadmap for the development of Sarawak’s aerospace industry, involving expertise from both parties.

“A team will be formed on our side, while Airbus will also form their own team. This move aims to create a synergy of expertise in the industry through comprehensive collaboration and discussions between the specialists involved.

“This effort is expected to act as a catalyst for the growth of the aviation industry, while also opening new opportunities for the sector to advance on an international level,” he explained.

The sixth area involves the development of an Aerotropolis as part of efforts to strengthen the aviation industry in the state.

“The state government plans to develop a 100-acre area as the site for the Aerotropolis—an integrated hub where all buildings are interconnected, making it more efficient and supportive of the aviation industry ecosystem,” he added.

Boeing to boost aerospace education in Sarawak

Meanwhile, earlier this week, American multinational corporation Boeing signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sarawak’s i-CATS University College to advance aerospace education and talent development in Sarawak.

The partnership supports Sarawak’s ambition to position itself as a regional hub for aerospace and high-technology industries, building on i-CATS’ recent launch of its Aerospace Engineering programme.

Under the MoU, Boeing and i-CATS will explore opportunities to engage Boeing experts in workshops, speaker sessions, and competitions organised by the i-CATS Aerospace Students’ Club.

The partnership will also support the development and delivery of coursework and executive education certificates in sustainable aviation, supply chain, and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO); as well as foster partnerships with industrial companies and international institutions for undergraduate and master’s students.

Boeing Southeast Asia president, Penny Burtt, said the company is committed to supporting Sarawak’s vision of building a strong and sustainable aerospace ecosystem.

“Equipping i-CATS students with Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) resources and opportunities is exactly what is needed to help inspire and grow Malaysia’s aviation workforce of the future.”

i-CATS vice chancellor Prof Emeritus Datuk Dr Mohamad Kadim Suaidi said the collaboration reflects the university’s commitment to nurturing a new generation of aerospace professionals.

“Together, we are laying the foundation for Sarawak to emerge as a competitive hub for aerospace education and research in the region,” he added.

AirAsia firms up Malaysia-Indonesia ties with new routes

Local private airlines are not missing out on the action in Sarawak, as low cost carrier AirAsia Bhd (AirAsia) recently strengthened its position as airline with largest network between Malaysia and Indonesia.

In July, it launched two new direct routes connecting Kuala Lumpur and Kuching to Pontianak, the capital city of West Kalimantan, Indonesia with AirAsia as the only airline operating international flights to the city starting 12 September 2025.

This expansion follows AirAsia’s rapid growth in Indonesia including the recent launch of the Kuala Lumpur-Palembang route in July and the upcoming Kuala Lumpur-Semarang in September.

On Friday (September 5), AirAsia Malaysia officially commenced its Kuala Lumpur–Semarang service which connects Malaysia with Central Java’s capital city.

With the return of international flights to Jenderal Ahmad Yani Airport, travellers now have greater access to Central Java’s cultural landmarks, business hubs, and emerging economic zones.

The launch of these new routes strengthens regional connectivity and supports both government targets, including Malaysia’s goal to attract 4.3 million Indonesian tourists in 2025 and Sarawak’s target of five million visitor arrivals by year-end.

It also aims to contribute to Indonesia’s national target of 16 million international arrivals with Malaysia remaining one of its top source markets.

In an interview with BizHive, AirAsia Malaysia chief executive officer Datuk Fareh Mazputra explained that AirAsia fully supports Sarawak’s vision under the PCDS 2030 framework, and it remains committed to play a catalytic role in elevating Kuching’s status as a key regional aviation hub.

“We are working closely with tourism and aviation authorities to position Kuching as a viable connecting hub for traffic between the Asean region,” he said in the interview.

“This includes optimising our network to improve flight timings, facilitating seamless transfers and promoting multi-destination travel itineraries.

“Operationally, AirAsia is currently the only national airline with a hub in Kuching, with a total of seven Airbus A320 aircraft stationed at the Kuching International Airport and serving a total of over 400 weekly flights within, into and from Sarawak, including our new Pontianak route in September.

“Our operation in Sarawak is backed by over 750 Allstars including at least 80 per cent Sarawakians who serve as pilots, cabin crew, aircraft engineers, sales, operation and administrative personnel.”

Fareh noted that AirAsia continuously enhances its digital platforms to enable easier bookings for connecting traffic via Kuching, as part of a broader effort to grow transit traffic and make Kuching more attractive to international carriers and partners.

“Our strategy includes leveraging Kuching not just as a terminus, but as a connecting hub for traffic between ASEAN markets,” he said, adding that the airline invests in digital and operational infrastructure to enhance transit experiences.

“AirAsia has already begun restoring and expanding our domestic and international network into Sarawak with Kuching as the primary gateway, including the recent announcement of our flights between Kuching and Pontianak in West Kalimantan, Indonesia that is set to take off in September.”

While the increased frequency to Kuching, Miri, and Sibu is vital, Fareh says AirAsia is keeping its eye to enhance “last-mile” connectivity to smaller, economically crucial towns like Bintulu, Mukah, and Kapit.

“Yes, we fully recognise that true connectivity extends beyond major cities, it’s about ensuring accessibility for all regions.

“Bintulu is already served with direct flights to Kuching, Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu, and we are currently reviewing potential frequency enhancements in line with demand trends.

“For other towns with smaller airports and airfields, these are currently being served by another operator under the Government’s Rural Air Service programme.”

Keeping towards low cost strategy

Fareh underscored AirAsia’s focus on affordability and accessibility being integral to AirAsia’s mission.

“We remain firmly committed to providing low fares for all, especially for Sarawakians who rely on air travel for family, business, leisure and educational purposes,” he said.

“Our dynamic pricing model allows us to allocate a significant number of seats at low fares, especially when booked in advance, and offers exclusive discounts and promotional deals to ensure that essential travel remains affordable.

“In the long term, we will continue to work with the authorities to explore fare incentives, subsidy frameworks, and travel passes that benefit Sarawakians, especially students, business travelers, and families.

“Additionally, by continuously improving efficiency and leveraging technology, we aim to keep operating costs low, enabling us to pass savings back to our guests in the form of competitive fares.”

Meanwhile, on AirAsia’s stategy towards new market, Fareh said they were always actively studying several high-potential international markets with strong tourism, business, education and diaspora links to Sarawak and this will of course be subject to market assessments in order to evaluate demand, partnerships, and operational feasibility.

He said they work very closely with key tourism stakeholders such as the Sarawak Tourism Board, Tourism Malaysia, Ministry of Tourism, Creative Industry and Performing Arts Sarawak, Ministry of Transport Sarawak and the Sarawak Economic Planning Unit to identify potential new routes, realising these routes will depend on the availability of aircraft, regulatory approvals and alignment with tourism and trade promotion efforts.

“We would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to the people of Sarawak for their continued trust and support, which has made us winner of the Skytrax award for the World’s Best Low Cost Airline 16 years in a row.

“AirAsia is proud to be a long-standing partner in Sarawak’s journey towards sustainable growth, regional prominence, and improved quality of life.

“As we expand our footprint and strengthen connectivity, our commitment remains unchanged—to provide safe, affordable, and reliable air travel for all Sarawakians.

“We look forward to working even more closely with state and community stakeholders to build a future where Sarawak is not just a destination, but a thriving aviation and economic hub for all of Asean and beyond.”

Batik Air links Kuching-Subang for better East-West air travel

The successful launch of Batik Air’s direct flight between Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Subang and Kuching International Airport (towards the end of July marked a major milestone in enhancing regional connectivity for Sarawak.

Speaking at a press conference after the touchdown of flight OD1612 on July 28, Sarawak Transport Minister Dato Sri Lee Kim Shin reiterated his call for Batik Air to expand its services to Sarawak and to help promote the state, including by launching its first international route from here.

“For example, it can fly to China or even to Korea, but that depends on the passenger load. But certainly, they can have a flight to China. For example, to Shenzhen or to Guangzhou or even other cities in China.

“We hope Batik Air will help us and support us with our requests because then, Batik Air would be the first airline to have direct international flights,” he said.

“At present, all flights are from either Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) or KLIA 2.

“Some passengers may prefer to fly from Subang because it is more convenient for them. From Subang, it normally takes about 30 to 45 minutes to get to the airport, depending on traffic conditions,” said Lee.

He said Batik Air now covers all four airports in Sarawak, adding that there is also a daily flight from KLIA operated by Batik Air to Miri, as well as daily flights to both Sibu and Bintulu.

“With these services, Batik Air has opened up new routes to Sarawak,” he said.

The launch underscored Batik Air’s commitment to enhancing direct point-to-point connections in response to increasing demand for greater convenience, speed, and accessibility.",https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2025/09/COVER-p1.png,N,,2025-09-06 21:56:10.737188

The Indian rupee fell 21 paise from its close of 88.15 on Thursday to a new all-time low of ₹88.36 versus the US dollar. Despite the government’s aggressive GST reforms, which were intended to boost domestic demand and consumption, this fall nonetheless happened. Although it was anticipated that the reforms would increase market activity, global uncertainties—such as concerns about inflation, rising US interest rates, and geopolitical tensions—remain dominant. The rupee and other emerging market currencies are under tremendous pressure as analysts note that global risk aversion and foreign money outflows are increasingly outweighing local policy initiatives. For now, the road to stability seems difficult.

Starlink Moves Closer to Launch in India

Elon Musk’s Starlink, the satellite internet venture, has crossed a major hurdle by receiving provisional spectrum clearance from India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT). This green signal allows Starlink to begin trial satellite broadband services in one of the world’s largest digital markets. With this permission, the company will proceed to build ground infrastructure, deploy base stations, and conduct critical security compliance tests. Industry experts believe that Starlink’s entry could be a game-changer for rural India, offering high-speed internet where terrestrial broadband remains inaccessible. The trial phase is expected to pave the way for a large-scale commercial launch in the near future.

Swiggy Raises Platform Fee Amid Festive Rush

Swiggy, India’s leading food delivery platform, has raised its platform fee to ₹15 per order, marking the steepest hike in its history. This is the third increase in just three weeks, as the company seeks to capitalize on the festive season surge and improve profitability. Earlier, Swiggy had briefly tested a ₹14 fee during Independence Day celebrations before reverting to ₹12. Now, with growing operational costs and competition in the delivery space, the ₹15 fee reflects a strategic push to enhance margins. Industry insiders see this as a clear sign that Swiggy is shifting focus from pure growth to sustainable financial health.

Instant House Helpers: The New Gig Economy Trend

India’s gig economy has welcomed a surprising new service—instant house helper apps—that promise domestic help at your doorstep within just 15 minutes.

For corn, rising domestic shortfalls have made Japan more reliant on US supplies, particularly for both food and feed use.
It added that the Japanese government is also working to accept US-manufactured and US-safety-certified passenger vehicles for sale in Japan without additional testing.
""These investments -- which will be selected by the United States government -- will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations,"" the executive order added.
""For automobiles and automobile parts, the tariff will be reduced from 25% to 15%, including existing tariffs,"" Ishiba said.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order reducing an additional 25% tariff on automobiles and other goods to 15% under the US-Japan agreement, White House officials said, paving the way to implement Tokyo's $550 billion investment pledge across US energy, infrastructure and industrial sectors.

The move, which came Sept. 4, follows a July 22 framework agreement between the US and Japan, which lays the foundation for cutting the US' ""reciprocal tariffs"" on Japan from 25% to 15%.

Under the agreement, the US will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the US, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the US, according to the executive order.

The new tariff framework, combined with expanded US exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall US trade position, the executive order said.

Japan will also provide American manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, food, energy, automobile and industrial goods producers with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors, it said.

Specifically, the Japanese government is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase in US rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of US agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel) and other US products, totaling $8 billion annually.

In biofuels, Japan is exploring additional imports of ethanol -- including for sustainable aviation fuel via ETBE -- but since ETBE and ethanol for ETBE production already face a zero tariff, any future increase would primarily depend on Tokyo's decisions around higher domestic blending mandates and potential adjustments to required carbon intensity thresholds.

The July 22 framework also outlined expanded access for US beef and pork into the Japanese market, with Tokyo agreeing to work toward reducing tariff-rate quota barriers that have limited imports in recent years. For corn, rising domestic shortfalls have made Japan more reliant on US supplies, particularly for both food and feed use. The agreement also highlighted Japanese interest in scaling imports of US-origin bioethanol, provided that new blending or sustainability rules create additional demand.

It added that the Japanese government is also working to accept US-manufactured and US-safety-certified passenger vehicles for sale in Japan without additional testing. Separately, Japan will purchase US-made commercial aircraft and US defense equipment.

Tokyo has agreed to invest $550 billion in US sectors, including energy infrastructure and production, LNG, advanced fuels, grid modernization, critical minerals mining, processing and refining, and commercial and defense shipbuilding, including new yards and modernization of existing facilities. It will also target pharmaceutical, medical production and semiconductors.

""These investments -- which will be selected by the United States government -- will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations,"" the executive order added.

""Regarding reciprocal tariffs, it has been decided that, retroactively from Aug. 7, items with existing tariff rates of 15% or more will not be subject to additional tariffs, while items with rates below 15% will be charged a tariff of 15%, including the existing rates,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters in Tokyo Sept. 4.

""For automobiles and automobile parts, the tariff will be reduced from 25% to 15%, including existing tariffs,"" Ishiba said. ""Additionally, for semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, even if sector-specific tariffs are imposed in the future, our country will not be at a disadvantage compared to the EU, and no tariffs will be imposed on aircraft and aircraft parts.""

The US' 25% tariff on automobiles separately took effect April 3.

The US was Japan's largest export market in 2024, with exports valued at Yen 21.295 trillion ($145.19 billion), according to data from the Ministry of Finance.

Brian J West, executive vice president for finance and chief financial officer at Boeing, commented on the progress of 777X certification, according to ch-aviation.
According to Leeham News and Analysis, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said he was ""hopeful"" that certification testing will commence by year's end.
“I’m hopeful that we’ll get through the certification flight tests by the end of the year.
It’s an airplane that has had the most flight testing done of any other aircraft we’ve ever done in terms of hours.","Once it enters service, the Boeing 777X promises airlines a powerful set of tools for growing destination networks through a powerful blend of performance, efficiency, and passenger comfort. The jet will seat roughly four hundred passengers in a standard two-class layout, to beat out both 777-300ER or A350-1000 average seat counts. More importantly, it will ferry those souls at a lower burn than the big jet it replaces and its chief competitor from Airbus. The combination of lower operating cost and high seat capacity offers route flexibility and bottom-line padding that its predecessor could never hope to achieve.

The smaller 777-8 is projected to fly close to 8,700 nautical miles with a full passenger and cargo payload, while the larger 777-9 will max out around 7,300 nautical miles. Those figures make nonstop routes like Sydney to London, Dubai to Panama City, or Doha to Santiago possible. Missions that would force other widebodies, such as a Boeing 787 to takeoff payload-limited or in the case of an A330, nonstop is likely not feasible. The 777X will complement its performance and class-leading economics with a major upgrade to the cabin to make the experience even better for flyers as well as operators.

Boeing's Next-Generation Widebody

The new carbon-fiber wing with its novel folding wingtip is the spotlight feature of the new, gargantuan tinwjet. In the air, it spans almost 72 meters wide, but on the ground, its folding wingtips retract so that gate clearance matches the legacy 777-300ER. Airports can treat the jet as a normal Code-E aircraft, sparing operators the headaches and infrastructure surcharges that plagued the superjumbo A380 or even a jumbo 747-8. Carriers can dispatch the 777X to virtually every city already in its 777 network on day one, making the introduction of new routes equally easy too.

The 777X family comes in two sizes, with the 777-9 maximizing sheer volume to supplant the 747 or an A380 but with twin-engine fuel savings. Meanwhile, the 777-8 covers ultra-long-haul markets that demand fewer seats but an uncompromised range. Together, the qualities of high seat and cargo capacity, extreme range, and unrestricted airport compatibility create more viable routes than any other widebody.

The Future Of Long-Haul Flying

The Boeing 777X not only features the dramatically improved cabin, fuel saving and performance improvements but also a much more better maintenance interval with reduced cost and less frequent needs. A major factor in that is the new GE9X turbofans, which promise longer engine life with fewer shop visits that will add up to a stronger bottom line. That reliability and cost savings are equally vital for cargo and passenger carriers that fly long-haul across continents as well as transoceanic routes.

Boeing received 259 orders after it first opened the books, with the largest commercial aircraft launch in history by dollar value with Emirates ordering 150, Qatar Airways buying 50, and Etihad Airways ordering 25.

Brian J West, executive vice president for finance and chief financial officer at Boeing, commented on the progress of 777X certification, according to ch-aviation.

“Flight testing [for the 777X] recently resumed, and we still expect first delivery in 2026, and we will continue to follow the lead of the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] as we move through certification.”

The first airline to commit to the 777X was seeking to replace its departing fleet of 747 double-deckers, that was Lufthansa. Ordering 34 of the 777-9 extended variants, the German airline went for the maximum capacity model with its launch order. Due to the long-awaited arrival of the new twinjet, Lufthansa's fleet of 22 747s has gradually shrunk, after the 777X goes into service, the airline plans to retire its remaining aircraft.

Big Boeing: King Of The Twinjets

Its spotlight feature of Boeing’s 777X is a carbon-fiber wingtip that swings down into position for flight and folds up after takeoff for ground operations. The wings, when spread out to their full 71.8-meter span, provide an unmatched lift-to-drag ratio that makes the monstrous widebody more fuel-efficient than any competitor, despite its huge dimensions. When folded, the wings are around the same size as the current 777-300ER, so the aircraft can utilize existing Code-E gates and taxiways without requiring airports to change.

The new wing, featuring industry-first folding tips, enables the carrier to achieve a significant efficiency upgrade without incurring the costs of custom infrastructure or penalties for schedule restrictions that limit the use of the jumbo A380 or 747. The GE9X achieves double-digit fuel efficiency gains over the GE90 thanks to all-new material technology in the engine internals, a dramatically higher bypass ratio, and its 3.40-meter fan diameter. The massive engine size made it the largest turbofan ever certified, with a diameter that eclipses the 737’s fuselage dimensions.

Captain Ted Grady, 777X chief pilot, commented after a recent test flight on August 5.

“The 777-9 flies beautifully, and this airplane performed just as we expected. We appreciate the hard work of our teams who designed, built and prepared this airplane for flight, and we’re continuing our focus on getting the 777-9 certified and in our customers’ fleets.”

The 777X, with its folding wing, next-generation engines, and modernized and spacious cabin, will be a game-changer for current 777 operators. All of that, paired with legacy fleet commonality, will make the aircraft vital for airlines in a future with slot-restricted hubs and ever-more restricted operating budgets.

The Fire-Breathing Heart Of The 777X

Replacing the legacy quadjets, the 747 and A380, with twinjets demands more power from fewer engines to accomplish the same mission. It is expected to be the most fuel-efficient in its class and operate on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends. The GE9X engine is the world’s most powerful commercial turbofan ever produced, as detailed by Yahoo Finance.

The GE9X's sustainability improvements include 10% greater fuel efficiency than the GE90 and an overall pressure ratio of 61:1, which allows for a 5% lower thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC). The projected maintenance will also be less than the current GE90. Improved propulsion efficiency, thanks to the higher-bypass-ratio fan, is mostly to credit for the increased efficiency with the bypass ratio at 10:1.

The gargantuan engine nacelle of the GE9X is 184 in (4,700 mm) wide.

Having fewer fan blades reduces the engine weight as well, improves aerodynamic efficiency, and allows the low-pressure (LP) fan and booster to spin faster. The booster can better match its speed with the LP turbine. The fan blades feature steel leading edges and fiberglass trailing edges, as well as carbon fiber composite in their construction. This complex interweaving of advanced materials results in lighter, thinner, and stronger blades than anything else. The GE9X also uses a carbon fiber composite fan case, derived from the GEnx.

Ready To Depart: The 777X Nears Certification

A prototype 777X arrived in Victorville last month to begin takeoff performance testing at Southern California Logistics Airport (VCV), or Victorville Airport, with Edwards Air Force Base (EDW) also hosting the tests. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) subjected the jet to a series of trials to verify that the 777-9 meets FAA standards for safe and reliable operation under different runway and environmental conditions.

According to Leeham News and Analysis, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said he was ""hopeful"" that certification testing will commence by year's end.

“I’m hopeful that we’ll get through the certification flight tests by the end of the year. We may still be doing some ETOPS testing going into next year, but there is no real change to our forecast of getting that certification done so that we can start deliveries next year. It’s an airplane that has had the most flight testing done of any other aircraft we’ve ever done in terms of hours. We feel pretty good about the stability and our entry into service for the airplane that we’ve done enough flight testing on that it’s going to be a great airplane.”",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/fast2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-06 18:56:15.772156

With more than five years at Sopra Steria, he works closely with C-suite leaders, partners and new acquisitions to deliver innovative technologies and services. Passionate about driving growth and fostering future talent, he combines strategic insight with over 40 years of collective space expertise to help shape the sector’s next chapter.

Few industries are as critical to the UK’s long-term prosperity and sustainability as aerospace. Whether it’s accelerating defence programmes, advancing satellite and space systems, or leading cutting-edge R&D, aerospace sits at the heart of national innovation.

Generating £30.5 billion in annual turnover, the sector has grown by 7% over the past decade, a clear sign of its enduring strength and strategic importance. Much of this strength encompasses not only the large contractors but also the thousands of SMEs that form the backbone of the sector.

While there’s much to be optimistic about, it’s equally important to recognise the challenges the industry continues to face. These range from ramping up production rates and securing supply chains to driving digital transformation. Cybersecurity and reducing time-to-market also remain high on the agenda, demanding continued focus and coordinated action across the sector.

Layered on top of all this are heightened geopolitical tensions, the UK Defence Industrial Strategy’s renewed emphasis on sovereign production and the transformative potential of AI. Together, these forces are reshaping the sector’s priorities at pace. So, what will that look like in practice? Here are the trends set to shape aerospace in the years ahead.

Boosting future production ramp-up with generative AI

UK aerospace remains a major global player, with a reputation for reliability and technical excellence. From engine and wing manufacturing in the commercial sector to the development of next-generation military aircraft and space technologies, including satellites and launch systems, the UK continues to deliver at pace while upholding world-class quality standards.

However, like many complex production environments, the aerospace sector still faces operational inefficiencies that can hinder performance. Research suggests that issues such as lengthy inspection cycles and intricate testing processes could contribute to as much as £4 billion in downtime costs by the end of 2025. It’s a stark reminder of the need to modernise systems and strengthen productivity across the board.

Generative AI can help overcome these types of inefficiencies. Automating non-value-added tasks allows workers to focus on higher-value activities, improving overall consistency and accuracy and reducing the risk of human error.

Practical use cases include operators receiving summaries of complex assembly instructions to enable faster execution on the factory floor, or a mid-sized engineering firm using AI to accelerate inspection reporting, freeing up engineers from paperwork so they can focus on design work.

As these tools are deployed across dispersed production environments, ensuring the security of sensitive data and enabling trusted collaboration will be just as critical as the efficiency gains they deliver.

Strengthening supply chain planning will be central to greater resilience

Aerospace manufacturers are under growing pressure to improve planning processes in the face of mounting operational and economic challenges.

For example, 70% of UK manufacturers have seen their costs increase by up to a fifth in the last year, while almost one in ten have experienced an increase of up to 50%. This, on top of complex customer demands, shows that the ability to plan effectively has never been more critical. Those that treat supply chain planning as a strategic capability, rather than a day-to-day function, will be best placed to remain resilient and responsive.

Building supply chain resilience starts with greater visibility and awareness across the extended supplier network. This is particularly critical for SMEs, who typically operate on tighter margins and can be disproportionately affected by unexpected cost spikes or late changes in demand.

Manufacturers need a clear understanding of supplier capacity, potential risks and production demand to make operations more reliable. Achieving this depends on consistent, well-communicated data and the smart use of digital tools.

Breaking down data silos and improving data accuracy are essential first steps. From there, real-time monitoring, AI-driven modelling and scenario planning can help anticipate disruption, while stronger collaboration around shared data sets must become a strategic priority.

Driving innovation toward a decarbonised aerospace future

In response to the climate emergency, the aerospace industry is ramping up efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. International regulations like CORSIA are driving action, leading to initiatives like fleet renewal that combine aerodynamic improvements, lightweight materials and next-generation engines to cut fuel consumption.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), along with electric and hydrogen propulsion, are also gaining momentum across the industry. Meanwhile, in space, the push for more sustainable satellite technologies and debris mitigation is accelerating, as space becomes central to both climate monitoring and secure communications.

Looking ahead, manufacturers will need to treat emissions reduction not just as a regulatory requirement but as a core business priority, or risk falling short of compliance, facing financial penalties and damaging their reputation.

Achieving these goals at scale, however, will depend heavily on digital technologies. From research and development through to operations, these tools are accelerating the shift to a greener industry.

In R&D, digital twins are being used to simulate aerodynamics, test material strength, and optimise designs before production begins. Across supply chains, the use of SAF can be tracked and verified more accurately. In infrastructure planning, digital modelling supports the design of energy-efficient, future-ready facilities.

Moves like the proposed EU Space Act are also prompting greater alignment on sustainability and cyber-resilience across the satellite ecosystem, from lifecycle emissions to collision avoidance protocols. And operationally, AI-powered algorithms are improving flight planning, route efficiency and fuel burn.

An industry in transition

Faced with the dual challenge of decarbonisation and accelerating innovation, the aerospace industry stands at a strategic crossroads. The pursuit of ambitious sustainability goals, pressure to boost production and the need for greater supply chain resilience underline just how complex the road ahead will be.

These trends point to the need for a systemic transformation, one that spans operations, digital infrastructure and workforce capability. Success will depend on how effectively the industry embraces change, breaks down silos and embeds technology into every layer of its ecosystem.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Steve-Isaac-opinion-piece.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 16:56:26.182160

Sebagai bagian dari upaya membangun ekosistem produksi SAF yang berkelanjutan, termasuk dalam penyediaan bahan baku, Pertamina bersama Noovoleum sebagai mitra menghadirkan UCOllect Box di berbagai titik di Indonesia.

Kehadiran alat ini memungkinkan masyarakat luas untuk turut serta menyetorkan minyak jelantah yang dimiliki, agar tidak terbuang percuma dan justru dimanfaatkan kembali sebagai energi berkelanjutan.

Di Palembang, fasilitas UCOllect Box saat ini baru tersedia di kawasan Komperta Kilang Pertamina Plaju dan Komperta Sungai Gerong, yang menjadi pionir titik pengumpulan minyak jelantah di Sumatera.

Tepatnya berlokasi di toko swalayan Coopmart, Jalan Antara No. 292, Kelurahan Komperta, Kecamatan Plaju, Kota Palembang, fasilitas ini menyasar penduduk Komperta Plaju dan sekitarnya yang dinilai memiliki potensi besar untuk berkontribusi dalam penyetoran minyak jelantah secara berkelanjutan.

Sejak dioperasikan pada Februari 2025 lalu, antusiasme masyarakat untuk menyalurkan minyak jelantah terus tumbuh.

Data fungsi Environment-HSSE Kilang Pertamina Plaju mencatat bahwa sepanjang Februari–Agustus 2025, rata-rata 175 liter minyak jelantah berhasil dikumpulkan setiap bulannya.

Sumber pasokan jelantah ini sangat beragam, mulai dari dapur Koperasi Wanita Petra (KWP), rumah tangga pekerja, hingga partisipasi masyarakat umum di sekitar Plaju.

Fakta ini menunjukkan bahwa kesadaran kolektif warga untuk mengelola limbah sudah mulai mengakar.

Semakin banyak rumah tangga yang memilih untuk menukarkan minyak bekas gorengan mereka di UCOllect Box ketimbang membuangnya sembarangan.

Area Manager Communication, Relations & CSR PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional RU III, Siti Rachmi Indahsari, menegaskan bahwa program ini merupakan langkah strategis perusahaan untuk menghubungkan dapur masyarakat dengan agenda besar transisi energi.

“Pengelolaan limbah tidak hanya tentang membuang, tetapi bagaimana kita bisa memanfaatkannya kembali agar memiliki nilai ekonomi sekaligus mendukung energi hijau.

Pertamina mengajak masyarakat untuk berpartisipasi dalam ekosistem energi bersih yang berkelanjutan, dengan mengumpulkan setiap tetes jelantah di dapur untuk menjadi produk SAF,” ujarnya.

Terbuka Untuk Umum

Fasilitas UCOllect Box ini sepenuhnya terbuka untuk umum.

Artinya, siapa pun masyarakat di Kota Palembang yang memiliki minyak jelantah dapat menyetorkannya di titik ini, sehingga manfaatnya tidak hanya dirasakan oleh warga Komperta, tetapi juga menjadi sarana partisipasi kolektif masyarakat luas dalam mendukung energi bersih dan berkelanjutan.

Kehadiran UCOllect di Palembang membuktikan bahwa transformasi energi hijau bisa dimulai dari hal sederhana.

Satu liter minyak jelantah yang sebelumnya berpotensi mencemari jutaan liter air, kini bernilai Rp5.500 jika ditukarkan melalui UCOllect Box.

Lebih dari itu, setiap tetes jelantah yang terkumpul berkontribusi pada rantai pasok bahan baku SAF, membawa energi ramah lingkungan dari dapur rumah tangga hingga ke tangki pesawat.

Dengan capaian ini, Kilang Pertamina Plaju memperkuat perannya tidak hanya sebagai pengolah migas dan petrokimia, tetapi juga sebagai motor penggerak energi berkelanjutan.

Dari tetes jelantah yang dikumpulkan masyarakat, Indonesia kini melangkah lebih percaya diri menuju era penerbangan rendah emisi, sekaligus menjaga bumi untuk generasi mendatang.

Inisiatif pengumpulan minyak jelantah melalui UCOllect Box ini juga sejalan dengan komitmen Pertamina dalam menjalankan prinsip Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) serta mendukung pencapaian Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs).

Sejalan dengan SGDs & ESG

Program ini berkontribusi pada SDG 7 (Energi Bersih dan Terjangkau) melalui pemanfaatan sumber energi alternatif, SDG 12 (Konsumsi dan Produksi yang Bertanggung Jawab) lewat pengelolaan limbah berkelanjutan, SDG 13 (Penanganan Perubahan Iklim) dengan menekan emisi karbon, SDG 15 (Menjaga Ekosistem Darat) melalui pencegahan pencemaran lingkungan, serta SDG 17 (Kemitraan untuk Mencapai Tujuan) dengan menggandeng masyarakat, koperasi, dan berbagai mitra strategis.",https://palpos.disway.id/upload/a7c3f81526852abb2b1815a0d87c89fd.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 17:56:10.867439

Estas modernas instalaciones se iban a construir en el Parque Energético y Químico de Shell en Róterdam, cerca del mayor y más importante puerto de mercancías de Europa. Sin embargo, el combustible que iba a producir no estaba destinado a barcos sino aviones.

Inicialmente iba a ser un proyecto clave no sólo para la descarbonización de la compañía, también para la descarbonización de la industria aeronáutica europea, pero a Shell no le salen las cuentas. Tras una «exhaustiva evaluación económica y técnica», la compañía petrolera considera que el proyecto era demasiado caro y nada competitivo.

Esta planta se diseñó para ser una de las mayores convertidoras de residuos de Europa, capaz de convertir residuos orgánicos en hidrocarburos similares al queroseno de aviación (Jet A/Jet A-1), dando como resultado el conocido como combustible de aviación sostenible o SAF, por sus siglas en inglés («Sustainable Aviation Fuel»).

Mediante una serie de procesos industriales, se puede obtener combustible de aviación sostenible a partir de aceites de cocina usados, grasas animales, lodos de depuradoras, gases industriales o incluso residuos sólidos urbanos. El resultado final es un combustible con las mismas propiedades que el queroseno fósil, pero con una huella de carbono neta mucho menor (entre un 60% y un 90% menos, dependiendo de la materia prima y el proceso utilizado).

Conclusion The Air Canada labor dispute serves as a microcosm of the airline sector’s post-pandemic challenges.","The recent labor strike by Air Canada’s flight attendants, representing over 10,000 members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), has underscored the fragility of the post-pandemic airline sector. The three-day industrial action, which concluded with a tentative agreement on August 19, 2025, disrupted 500,000 passengers and cost the airline an estimated $98 million in daily losses [2]. While the deal includes wage increases and compensation for pre- and post-flight duties, its ratification remains pending, with voting closing on September 6 [1]. This case highlights broader systemic risks in the aviation industry, where unresolved labor disputes threaten financial stability, operational continuity, and long-term profitability.

Financial Risks: A Costly Disruption

The Air Canada strike exemplifies the acute financial vulnerabilities of airlines in a labor-intensive industry. According to a report by ePlaneAI, the airline’s daily losses during the strike were exacerbated by the grounding of 700 flights and the stranding of 25,000 passengers abroad [2]. These figures align with industry-wide trends: a 2025 IATA analysis notes that airlines globally face a 3.7% net margin, making them highly susceptible to shocks like labor disruptions [2]. For Air Canada, the strike’s financial toll is compounded by its efforts to process 20,000 customer claims and expand refund options, further straining liquidity [4].

The broader sector is not immune. Data from Morningstar indicates that core operating costs (excluding fuel) have risen 28% since the pandemic, driven by updated labor contracts and maintenance demands [1]. With fuel prices still averaging $87 per barrel—down from $99 in 2024—airlines remain exposed to volatile input costs [4]. For investors, this underscores the need to evaluate labor-related expenses as a critical component of operational risk.

Operational Risks: Labor Shortages and Aging Fleets

Beyond financial costs, unresolved labor disputes exacerbate operational challenges. The Air Canada strike coincided with a critical shortage of air traffic controllers (ATC) in Canada, particularly at Vancouver International Airport (YVR). A CBC report highlights that Air Canada pilots have publicly criticized these shortages, citing 50-minute delays and accusations that Nav Canada, the country’s ATC provider, prioritizes overtime over training [1]. This issue is not isolated: the global pilot shortage is projected to reach 50,000 by 2025, while U.S. air traffic control centers operate at 90% below recommended staffing levels [3].

Aging fleets further compound these risks. The average global aircraft age now stands at 14.8 years, increasing maintenance costs and reducing fuel efficiency [4]. For airlines like Air Canada, which must balance fleet modernization with labor negotiations, the interplay of these factors creates a volatile operational environment.

Industry-Wide Context: Post-Pandemic Pressures

The Air Canada case reflects broader post-pandemic challenges. A 2025 Gartner report ranks cybersecurity as the top risk for the aviation sector, with ransomware attacks like the Rhysida incident at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport exposing vulnerabilities [3]. Geopolitical conflicts also disrupt operations, with rerouting and insurance costs adding to expenses [4].

Despite these headwinds, the industry is projected to generate $36 billion in net profits in 2025, up from $32.4 billion in 2024 [2]. However, this growth is tempered by thin margins and the potential for renewed labor unrest. For instance, the tentative Air Canada agreement—while securing a 16–20% wage increase over four years—may not translate into long-term union gains, as labor experts caution against overestimating the strike’s political momentum [4].

Strategic Responses and Investor Implications

Airlines are adopting measures to mitigate these risks. United Airlines, for example, is investing in the Boeing 787 to improve route efficiency [1], while others leverage fuel hedging and digital transformation to stabilize costs [4]. For Air Canada, resolving the CUPE dispute is critical to restoring operational confidence. If the tentative agreement is ratified, the airline faces a week-long recovery period to restore full flight operations [3]. However, if rejected, arbitration on wage clauses could prolong uncertainty.

Investors should also monitor Nav Canada’s efforts to expand ATC training programs, which aim to address staffing shortages by 2028 [3]. Meanwhile, the industry’s reliance on aging fleets necessitates capital expenditure scrutiny. Airlines that prioritize fleet modernization and workforce development—such as through partnerships with training institutions—will likely outperform peers in a high-risk environment.

Conclusion

The Air Canada labor dispute serves as a microcosm of the airline sector’s post-pandemic challenges. While the tentative agreement offers a temporary reprieve, unresolved labor tensions, staffing shortages, and aging infrastructure continue to pose systemic risks. For investors, the key lies in identifying airlines that proactively address these vulnerabilities through strategic investments, cost containment, and collaborative labor relations. In an industry where margins are razor-thin and disruptions costly, resilience will separate winners from losers in the years ahead.

The new tariffs will take effect seven days after the announcement of the executive order.

According to Reuters, the US and Japan have officially reached an agreement, easing the significant uncertainty that has plagued Japan's automobile industry since the US-Japan trade agreement was announced in July. However, South Korea's automobile industry has expressed concerns that the move could put them at a competitive disadvantage.

In return, the executive order reaffirms that the Japanese government has agreed to invest US$550 billion (approximately HK$4.3 trillion) in US government-selected projects. Japan has also committed to increasing its purchase of American rice by 75% and buying US agricultural products, including corn, soybeans, fertilizers, bioethanol (including sustainable aviation fuel), and other goods, totaling US$8 billion (approximately HK$62.41 billion) annually.

Previously, Japan had indicated that under the existing framework, the share of US rice imports could rise, but the agreement ""does not sacrifice"" Japan's agricultural sector. Additionally, Japan stated that the agreement ensures the lowest tariffs for Japanese semiconductors and pharmaceuticals in all agreements negotiated in Washington. However, the US executive order makes no mention of such treatment.

South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Friday that Korean automakers like Hyundai and Kia, which compete directly with Japanese brands such as Toyota and Honda in the US market, are now concerned. While the US and South Korea previously reached a framework agreement, Trump has yet to sign the related executive order.

South Korean industry insiders noted that the 25% tariffs imposed on Korean vehicles have already placed immense pressure on the country's auto industry. With the US now lowering tariffs on Japanese vehicles, Korean automakers could face even greater challenges.

By aligning its fleet modernization with infrastructure investments and route expansion, the airline aims to balance cost efficiency, passenger capacity, and long-term profitability. This analysis examines how the adoption of the 787-10—coupled with hub-centric growth—positions Alaska Air Group to capitalize on trans-Pacific travel while navigating industry-wide challenges.

Fleet Modernization: Efficiency and Capacity for Trans-Pacific Growth

Alaska Airlines has aggressively restructured its fleet to meet surging demand for long-haul international travel. In July 2025, the airline exercised purchase options for five additional Boeing 787-9s and added 12 Boeing 737 MAX 10s to bolster its narrowbody fleet [1]. However, the most significant shift lies in the conversion of five Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 787-9 orders to the larger 787-10 variant [2]. This decision reflects a strategic prioritization of capacity on high-demand routes, such as Seattle to Tokyo and Honolulu to Los Angeles, where passenger traffic remains robust.

The 787-10’s advantages are twofold. First, its fuel efficiency—up to 30% better than older models—reduces operating costs, a critical factor amid volatile jet fuel prices [3]. Second, its increased seating capacity (typically 330 passengers in a mixed-class configuration) allows Alaska to maximize revenue on trans-Pacific routes without sacrificing frequency. According to a report by ePlaneAI, the airline anticipates $208 million in cost savings from reduced fuel consumption and fewer flight hours over the next decade [4]. These savings, combined with the ability to serve premium markets with lie-flat seats and enhanced amenities, strengthen the business case for the 787-10.

Hub Expansion: Seattle as a Global Gateway

The success of Alaska’s fleet strategy hinges on its parallel investment in infrastructure at the Seattle-Tacoma (SEA) hub. A $2.3 billion modernization initiative, led by the airline and the Port of Seattle, includes redeveloping terminal concourses, expanding security checkpoints, and reconfiguring office spaces to accommodate growing international traffic [5]. The SEA Gateway Project’s second phase, set to begin in 2026, will further enhance passenger flow and support the launch of 12 trans-Pacific routes by 2030 [6].

This infrastructure push is critical for managing the operational complexity of long-haul flights. For instance, the recent introduction of nonstop service to Seoul (Incheon) and plans for daily flights to London Heathrow underscore Alaska’s ambition to compete with legacy carriers like Delta and United [7]. By leveraging the 787-10’s range and efficiency, the airline can offer direct connectivity to Asia and Europe from a secondary U.S. hub, avoiding the congestion and higher costs of major East Coast airports.

Financial Projections and Strategic Risks

While the 787-10’s adoption promises cost savings and revenue growth, Alaska Air Group’s long-term profitability remains subject to external pressures. Stock forecasts suggest a 9.44% increase in share price by October 2025, with a projected range of $53.39–$69.75 for 2025 [8]. However, analysts caution that volatility could persist through 2027, when the stock’s average price is expected to dip to $48.06 [8]. This uncertainty stems from factors such as rising Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) costs and competition from low-cost international carriers.

The airline’s “Alaska Accelerate” plan—targeting $1 billion in incremental pre-tax profit—hinges on maintaining a 11%+ pre-tax margin through 2026 [9]. To achieve this, Alaska must balance fleet modernization with disciplined cost management. For example, while the 787-10’s commonality with the 787-9 reduces training and maintenance expenses [10], the airline’s reliance on a single aircraft type for long-haul operations could amplify risks if supply chain disruptions delay deliveries.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on Global Connectivity

Alaska Air Group’s strategic alignment of fleet modernization, hub expansion, and trans-Pacific route growth positions it to capitalize on a structural shift in air travel. The 787-10’s efficiency and capacity address both cost and demand-side challenges, while SEA’s infrastructure investments ensure the hub can scale with the airline’s ambitions. However, the path to long-term profitability will require navigating macroeconomic headwinds and maintaining operational agility. For investors, the key question is whether Alaska can sustain its cost advantages and route network optimization in an increasingly competitive global market.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 11:56:32.595033

Doch das Urlaubsgefühl hat seinen Preis: Die zivile Luftfahrt trägt weltweit zwischen zwei und drei Prozent zu den gesamten CO2-Emissionen bei. Um die CO2- und Feinstaub-Bilanz zu verbessern, schreibt die EU daher seit diesem Jahr die Nutzung des grünen Treibstoffs SAF („Sustainable Aviation Fuel“, deutsch: „Nachhaltiger Luftfahrttreibstoff“) vor – zwei Prozent müssen die Airlines dem regulären Kerosin beimischen.

Bis 2050 soll dieser Anteil sukzessive auf 70 Prozent ansteigen. Dieser Traum könnte allerdings bald platzen: Erst hat eine neue Recherche der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters aufgedeckt, dass viele Projekte noch in den Kinderschuhen stecken und bislang noch nicht mal Treibstoff herstellen. Nun kommt der nächste Rückschlag: Der Öl-Riese Shell hat bekannt gegeben, den geplanten Bau einer der größten SAF-Produktionsstätten Europas zu schließen.

SAF: Der grüne Flug-Wunderstoff

Bei SAF handelt es sich um einen Oberbegriff für alle Treibstoffe, die nicht aus fossilen Brennstoffen hergestellt werden. Diese Treibstoffe sind besonders gefragt, weil große, kommerzielle Passagierflugzeuge nach derzeitigem technischen Stand nur schwer auf einen elektrischen Betrieb umgerüstet werden können, anders als etwa Pkw oder Busse. Gleichzeitig steigen Jahr für Jahr die weltweiten Passagierzahlen, und damit auch die Nachfrage nach Flügen.

Deswegen setzt die Luftfahrt auf einen CO2-armen Treibstoff, der dem klimaschädlichen Kerosin beigemischt werden kann – und deswegen schreibt die Europäische Union auch die Beimischung von SAF für alle Flüge vor, die innerhalb der EU starten. Dieser verpflichtende Anteil soll von den derzeit geltenden zwei Prozent sukzessive erhöht werden:

Sechs Prozent ab 2030

34 Prozent ab 2040

Und ab 2050 – wenn die EU-Länder klimaneutral sein wollen – müssen mindestens 70 Prozent SAF beigemischt sein.

Um diese Vorgaben einzuhalten, sicherte sich IAG – eine Holdinggesellschaft, zu der auch British Airways gehört – im März des vergangenen Jahres ein großes Stück vom Kuchen: 785.000 Tonnen SAF über die nächsten 14 Jahre. Liefern soll das US-amerikanische Start-Up Twelve.

Auch ein anderes Start-Up aus den USA, WorldEnergy, hat einen großen Deal mit der amerikanischen Fluglinie United Airlines abgeschlossen. Wie Reuters herausgefunden hat, wurde die Fabrik, die den Treibstoff produzieren sollte, im April klammheimlich geschlossen - und dabei handelt es sich nicht um das einzige Projekt, das nur auf dem Papier existiert.

Das harte Shell-Urteil

Die heimliche Schließung einer der größten SAF-Fabriken nahm die Nachrichtenagentur zum Anlass, die 165 SAF-Projekte, die von Airlines in den letzten zwölf Jahren bekanntgegeben wurden, zu überprüfen. Das Ergebnis:

Zu 44 dieser Projekte gibt es seit der ursprünglichen Bekanntgabe kein Update.

23 Projekte wurden aufgegeben.

27 Projekte sind verspätet oder auf unbestimmte Zeit verschoben.

35 Projekte haben noch keinen Treibstoff hergestellt oder hatten es nie vor.

Insgesamt gibt es lediglich 36 SAF-Projekte, die tatsächlich Treibstoff produzieren – allerdings haben es bisher nur zehn geschafft, kommerzielle Mengen für die Fluggesellschaften herzustellen.

Und nun zieht sich also auch der Öl-Riese Shell aus dem Markt zurück. Schon im vergangenen Jahr hatte der Konzern den Bau einer großen Fabrik in Rotterdam, deren Kapazität zur Hälfte der Herstellung von SAF dienen sollte, auf Eis gelegt – zu unsicher waren die Marktbedingungen, so der Konzern. Nun wird das Projekt endgültig beendet, zugunsten des fossilen Kerngeschäfts von Shell. Eine Marktanalyse habe gezeigt, dass der Treibstoff nicht wettbewerbsfähig sein werde, hieß es in einer Mitteilung.

Streit um Treibstoff-Krise

Wer trägt die Verantwortung für die Treibstoff-Misere? Fluggesellschaften und Treibstoff-Industrie schieben sich gegenseitig den Schwarzen Peter zu. Nach einer Schätzung der IATA, des Branchenverbands des Flugverkehrs, werde SAF dieses Jahr lediglich 0,7 Prozent des Gesamttreibstoffes ausmachen. Die Produktion des grünen Treibstoffs hinkt den wachsenden Passagierzahlen deutlich hinterher

Gegenüber Reuters beschuldigte IATA-Chef Willie Walsh die Ölindustrie: Sie würde schlicht zu wenig Treibstoff produzieren. Die Branche hält schon länger dagegen, dass SAF momentan drei- bis fünfmal so teuer wie das handelsübliche Kerosin sei – und dadurch ein Ladenhüter ist. In Industriekreisen wird schon länger moniert, dass die Airlines sich bei der Umsetzung angekündigter SAF-Projekte kaum einbringen – und lieber Lobby-Druck auf Brüssel ausüben, die Beimischungs-Pflichten zu verwässern.

Der Treibstoff-Teufelskreis

Das Problem: Die meisten Hersteller nutzen Speisefettreste zur SAF-Produktion, von denen gibt es aber nur begrenzte Mengen. Das macht die Herstellung teuer und unsicher. Fluggesellschaften brauchen aber eine langfristig verlässliche Lieferkette.

Die Hersteller können also nicht genügend Treibstoff liefern, Airlines scheuen daher verbindliche Zusagen – aber genau diese sind notwendig, um in die Produktion zu investieren. Einige Airlines haben auch ihre eigenen SAF-Projekte ins Leben gerufen, was wiederum stürzt die bereits existierenden Hersteller in eine Krise stürzt. Ein Teufelskreis also.

Und dann ist da auch noch Trump

Der Traum vom klimaneutralen Fliegen könnte also bald platzen. Auch auf politischer Ebene wird es nicht besser: In den USA, wo zuletzt im April eine der größten SAF-Produktionsstätten heimlich dicht machte, könnte US-Präsident Donald Trump einen Wandel in der Branche konterkarieren: Die Trump-Regierung kündigte bereits an, die Förderungen seines Vorgängers Joe Biden zurückzunehmen, die unter anderem auch die Produktion von SAF ankurbeln sollte.

Und in Deutschland hat die Kürzung von knapp drei Milliarden Euro an Forschungsgeldern die Entwicklung und Marktreife von SAF so stark zurückgeworfen, dass mittlerweile Zweifel bestehen, ob das Projekt überhaupt noch rechtzeitig umgesetzt werden kann.

Deutscher Lichtblick

Eine wenige Lichtblicke verbleiben jedoch: Für eine am Düsseldorfer Flughafen geplante Anlage zur SAF-Herstellung gibt es jetzt einen Abnehmer. Der Anlagenbetreiber Greenlyte und die Fluggesellschaft Eurowings unterzeichneten eine Absichtserklärung für eine strategische Partnerschaft, wie Eurowings am Donnerstag in Köln mitteilte.

In den ersten drei Jahren will Eurowings die gesamte Produktionsmenge der Anlage abnehmen. Rechnerisch, so heißt es, soll das etwa für 60 Flüge zwischen Düsseldorf und Palma de Mallorca reichen.

- Encaleret was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported over the study period

- Based on these findings, BridgeBio intends to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret, an orally-administered investigational therapy, in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026

PALO ALTO, Calif., Sept. 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BridgeBio Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: BBIO) (“BridgeBio” or the “Company”), a new type of biopharmaceutical company focused on genetic diseases, announced today that encaleret showed parathyroid hormone (PTH)-independent normalization of blood and urine calcium in post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. The Phase 2 results were shared in an oral presentation at the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) Annual Meeting 2025.

“Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a challenging condition to manage because treatment involves striking a balance between blood and urine calcium. With conventional therapy, using calcium and active vitamin D, we typically aim for a low or low-normal blood calcium to reduce the risk of high urinary calcium which can cause kidney calcifications and renal injury. Unfortunately, not all patients are able to achieve this balance, and many still struggle – some with the disruptive symptoms of low blood calcium, and others with persistently high urine calcium,” said Iris Hartley, M.D., endocrinologist and clinician investigator at the National Institute of Dental and Cranial Facial Research of the National Institutes of Health. “There is a clear need for better options. New results from this study are very promising, suggesting a potential path for improved calcium control in a convenient pill form.”

The Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluated the PTH-independent effects of encaleret on renal calcium handling in patients with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism. Ten participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism were administered encaleret at 162 mg twice daily for up to 5 days. Calcitriol was stopped one day prior to the first dose. After starting encaleret, calcium and calcitriol were titrated based on blood calcium. The findings from the study include:

Encaleret treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in fractional excretion of calcium in nine participants with post-surgical hypoparathyroidism

80% of post-surgical hypoparathyroidism participants achieved concomitant blood and urine calcium in the normal reference range within 5 days of treatment initiation compared to 0% of participants on conventional therapy at baseline

These results support the continued evaluation of encaleret as an orally-administered treatment option for patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism

“These Phase 2 results show that encaleret may help normalize blood and urine calcium in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism, in the absence of stimulating PTH secretion, due to its effect on the calcium-sensing receptor expressed in the kidney. Based on these encouraging findings, we intend to initiate a registrational clinical study of encaleret in chronic hypoparathyroidism in 2026,” said Scott Adler, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Calcilytix, a BridgeBio affiliate that is focused on developing encaleret.

During ASBMR 2025, we also presented data from two preclinical studies of infigratinib, which demonstrated that low-dose infigratinib significantly improved bone growth in a hypochondroplasia mouse model as well as enhanced skull development in a Crouzon/Pfeiffer syndrome model. These data underscore the therapy’s broad potential for treating skeletal conditions. Additionally, the study of infigratinib in the hypochondroplasia mouse model was recently published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.

SHANGHAI, China, Sept. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hesai Group (NASDAQ: HSAI) (“Hesai” or the “Company”), the global leader in three-dimensional light detection and ranging (lidar) solutions, today announced the launch of its global offering (the “Global Offering”) of 17,000,000 Class B ordinary shares of the Company, which comprises a Hong Kong public offering of initially 1,700,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing on September 8, 2025 Hong Kong time (the “Hong Kong Public Offering”) and an international offering of initially 15,300,000 Class B ordinary shares commencing today (the “International Offering”), and dual-primary listing of its Class B ordinary shares on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Hong Kong Stock Exchange”) under the stock code “2525”.

The Company’s American depositary shares (the “ADSs”), each representing one Class B ordinary share of the Company, will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”). Investors in the Global Offering will only be able to purchase Class B ordinary shares and will not be able to take delivery of ADSs. Upon listing of the Class B ordinary shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Class B ordinary shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will be fully fungible with the ADSs listed on Nasdaq.

The Company has an offer size adjustment option, exercisable with prior written agreement with the Sponsor-OCs (as defined below) on or before the time of pricing, pursuant to which the Company may allot and issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, to cover additional demand.

In addition, the Company expects to grant the international underwriters an over-allotment option to require the Company to issue up to an additional 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares in the International Offering (or up to 2,932,500 Class B ordinary shares if the offer size adjustment option is exercised in full), representing 15% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Global Offering.

The initial number of Class B ordinary shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Offering represent approximately 10% and 90% of the total number of Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering, respectively, subject to reallocation, offer size adjustment, and over-allotment. Subject to the level of oversubscription in the Hong Kong Public Offering and reallocation, as described in the Hong Kong prospectus to be issued by the Company in Hong Kong dated September 8, 2025, the total number of Class B ordinary shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering could be adjusted to up to a maximum of 2,550,000 Class B ordinary shares, representing 15% of the Class B ordinary shares initially available under the Global Offering.

The offer price for the Hong Kong Public Offering (the “Hong Kong Offer Price”) will be no more than HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share (the “Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price”), or US$29.04, per Class B ordinary share (equivalent to US$29.04 per ADS) based on an exchange rate of HK$7.8499 to US$1.00 as of June 30, 2025 as set forth in the H.10 statistical release of The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The offer price for the International Offering tranche of the Global Offering (the “International Offer Price”) may be set higher than, or the same as, the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price. The Company will set the International Offer Price on or about September 12, 2025, Hong Kong time, by taking into consideration, among other factors, the closing price of the ADSs on the Nasdaq on the last trading day on or before September 12, 2025 and investor demand during the marketing process. The final Hong Kong Offer Price will be set at the lower of the final International Offer Price and the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price of HK$228.00 per Class B ordinary share. The shares will be traded in board lots of 20 Class B ordinary shares.

The Company has entered into cornerstone investment agreements with HHLR Advisors (part of Hillhouse Group), Taikang Life, WT Asset Management, Grab, Hongda Group and Commando Global Fund. Under such agreements, the cornerstone investors have agreed to, subject to certain conditions, subscribe for such number of Class B ordinary shares that may be purchased with an aggregate amount of approximately US$148.0 million, or approximately HK$1,153.7 million at the International Offer Price, representing approximately 29.8% of the Class B ordinary shares initially being offered under the Global Offering assuming such Class B ordinary shares are sold at the Maximum Hong Kong Offer Price, which percentage is subject to the offer size adjustment option and the over-allotment option. Such Class B ordinary shares are being sold in reliance on Regulation S and are exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, and this cornerstone placing will form part of the International Offering.

The Company plans to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering for investment in research and development, investment in its manufacturing capabilities, business development to accelerate its business expansion, and working capital and general corporate purposes.

WASHINGTON/TOKYO, Sept. 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday to implement lower tariffs on Japanese automobile imports and other products that were announced in July, providing some relief to Japan's export-heavy economy.

Formalizing the deal between the U.S. and a key Asian ally comes after months of negotiations, reduces uncertainty plaguing the massive Japanese auto sector since the July announcement and confirms an agreement for $550 billion of Japanese investment in U.S. projects.

The lower 15% tariffs on Japanese autos, down from the current 27.5%, are set to take effect seven days after official publication of the order.

The executive order also ensured that the 15% levy on Japanese imports agreed in July would not be stacked on top of those already subject to higher tariffs such as beef, while items previously subject to tariffs below 15% would be adjusted to 15%. This relief is retroactive to August 7.

In addition, it promised no tariffs on commercial airplanes and parts.

""Finally,"" Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's top trade negotiator, posted to X, in a nod to the months-long trade talks that had frustrated lawmakers in Tokyo. Thursday marked his 10th trip to the U.S. for the negotiations.

Speaking to reporters in Washington, Akazawa said Japan welcomed the executive order as ""a steady implementation of the agreement reached on July 22.""

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted a video clip on X showing a conversation with Akazawa where he said the order ""puts into effect the amazing, historic agreement.""

Trump's levies on global shipments have dragged down Japan's exports and hit Japanese carmakers hard.

Toyota 7203.T, which has flagged a nearly $10 billion profit hit from the tariffs, praised Trump's efforts to reach a trade deal with Japan. ""While nearly 80% of the vehicles Toyota sells in the U.S. are made in North America, this framework provides much needed clarity,"" the company said in a statement.

The United States in July agreed to lower tariffs on imports of Japanese automobiles, but the timing remained unclear as Trump had yet to sign an executive order.

Rival exporter South Korea is still waiting on an executive order covering a similar trade agreement with the U.S., including a 15% tariff on U.S. imports from automakers like Hyundai Motor 005380.KS and Kia 000270.KS, down from 25%.

A South Korean trade official said on Friday that his country was assessing the potential impact of the executive order regarding Japan.

Shares of major Japanese automakers were up slightly on Friday, while those in South Korea were slightly lower.

Billions of Dollars in Deals

Trump's order said Japan was ""working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements... and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel)"" and other U.S. products totaling $8 billion per year.

A separate joint statement released on Thursday said Japan would buy 100 Boeing BA.N planes, increase annual procurement of U.S. defense equipment ""by billions of dollars"" and explore a new Alaskan liquefied natural gas offtake agreement.

The joint statement also ensured the U.S.'s fifth-largest trading partner would always receive the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals of all the pacts negotiated by Washington.

Two-way trade between the two countries reached nearly $230 billion in 2024, with Japan running a trade surplus of nearly $70 billion.

Trump's order on Thursday also reiterated that the Japanese government has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States in projects that will be selected by the U.S. government.

The investment package, which will come in the form of equity, loans and guarantees from Japan's government-owned banks, was agreed as part of the July trade deal.

The two governments also signed a memorandum of understanding on the details of the package on Thursday, stating it would focus on investments in key sectors such as chips, metals, pharmaceuticals, energy and shipbuilding to be made by January 2029, which coincides with the end of Trump's presidential term.

Under the arrangement, available free cash flows from investments would be split in half until reaching an allocated amount, and then 90% would go to the United States.

The executive order on the tariff deal said that the United States ""may modify this order as necessary"" should Japan fail to implement its commitments under the agreement.

The agreement comes ahead of a key test for Japan's embattled Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba with his ruling party set to vote on Monday on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election that could result in his ouster.

Ishiba has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majority in elections for both houses of parliament since coming to power last year amid voter anger over rising living costs and weak economic growth exacerbated by the trade tariff uncertainty.

While finalising the trade deal gives Ishiba an argument to stay on, he is unlikely to survive the backlash from within his own party, said David Boling of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, estimating a 60% chance that he is forced out.

Synhelion's work on solar fuel is a game-changer, and the Harley-Davidson name will sit along side it in the history books.","The Harley-Davidson name has been around for over a century, and it has enjoyed such longevity for a reason. Throughout its decades at the forefront of the motorcycle world, the company has continued to innovate to a changing market. There are now several different Harley-Davidson frame types designed to meet the needs of many different styles of riding. You can also customize your Harley, as well as choose from various types of engines. Now, the motorcycle brand has become the first to use a new form of fuel that is made with solar energy.

In May 2025, a company called Synhelion revealed that it had successfully fueled a Harley-Davidson motorcycle with an energy source known as solar fuel. Ridden by ETH Zurich professor Aldo Steinfeld, who has been studying solar fuel for more than a decade, the motorcycle operated much like one powered by normal fuel. It was noted that the motorcycle didn't require any modifications to use this new solar fuel, indicating that it shouldn't be necessary to retrofit current vehicles to accommodate it as it potentially becomes more widespread. With all of that said, what exactly is solar fuel?

When you see the word ""solar-powered,"" you likely imagine solar panels soaking up energy from the sun to power a device of some kind. Yet the Harley itself doesn't have any solar-powered technology on it. Instead, it is using solar-powered fuel. This is created when the energy of the sun drives a chemical reaction between some kind of biomass, like agricultural waste, and water. In this process, these substances are converted into liquid hydrocarbons. According to Synhelion, this thermochemical reaction is able to turn the aforementioned concoction into sustainable aviation fuel, gasoline, and diesel, so it goes without saying that this tech could be revolutionary in multiple industries.

Synhelion also notes that solar fuel is nearly carbon-dioxide-neutral. This means that, as it's burned in a car, truck, or Harley, it will only release roughly as much carbon dioxide as it took to produce it, without emitting CO₂ when in use. This could be appealing in a market that is shifting toward electric vehicles and other means of transportation that emit less carbon dioxide in an attempt to mitigate the effects of climate change. Solar fuel isn't the strangest renewable energy source being explored today, but it's making headlines all the same. After this historic Harley-Davidson ride, hopes are high that solar fuel could expand its reach in the near future.

There's no denying the historical significance of the solar fuel-powered Harley-Davidson ride. It cemented the viability of this alternative fuel source and provided strong evidence that it can be used safely and effectively on existing machinery. With that said, it's just the first step in Synhelion's wider solar fuel plan.

With the success of professor Aldo Steinfeld's Harley trip, Synhelion is moving forward with more real-world applications. For example, in early August 2025, Swiss International Air Lines saw 190 liters of solar fuel integrated into Jet A-1 aviation fuel for flight use. Synhelion also successfully used the fuel in a 1985 Audi Sport Quattro, taking it for a rigorous drive through the Swiss Alps to prove the fuel's capabilities. It stands to reason that so long as Synhelion is able to keep proving its solar fuel is on par with traditional gasoline, it could soon become more commonplace. Just as renewable energy can transform your home, it may be able to transform your commute in the form of solar fuel. Synhelion's work on solar fuel is a game-changer, and the Harley-Davidson name will sit along side it in the history books.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/what-you-should-know-about-the-worlds-first-solar-fueled-harley-davidson-motorcycle/l-intro-1756812737.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 10:56:23.438041

As the energy transition accelerates and oil prices stabilize, Petrobras’ dual focus on short-term shareholder returns and long-term decarbonization could unlock significant value.","For income-focused investors seeking undervalued opportunities in the energy sector, Petrobras (PBR) emerges as a compelling case study. Despite operating in a politically charged environment and facing headwinds from volatile oil prices, the Brazilian state-controlled oil giant combines a rock-bottom valuation, a robust free cash flow (FCF) yield, and a forward-looking energy transition strategy. This analysis explores how Petrobras balances these dynamics to position itself as a dividend powerhouse with long-term growth potential.

Discounted Valuation and Sustainable Dividends

Petrobras’ financial metrics in 2025 paint a picture of a deeply undervalued asset. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 5.86 [1] and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.03 [1] suggest the market is pricing the company below intrinsic value, even as it generates a free cash flow yield of 23.75% [1]. This yield—among the highest in the global energy sector—has enabled Petrobras to maintain a disciplined dividend policy. In Q2 2025, the company distributed $8.7 billion in dividends, representing 45% of its free cash flow [4], while historical data from Yahoo Finance indicates a 90.08% payout ratio [5], underscoring its commitment to shareholder returns.

The sustainability of these dividends is further reinforced by Petrobras’ ability to generate strong cash flows even amid a 10% drop in oil prices [1]. This resilience stems from its low-cost offshore production in Brazil’s pre-salt basins and operational efficiency gains. For context, a P/FCF ratio of 4.21 [1] implies investors are paying just four times the company’s annual free cash flow, a metric that historically signals attractive entry points for value-oriented investors.

Energy Transition: A $111 Billion Bet on the Future

While Petrobras’ traditional oil and gas operations anchor its current profitability, its $111 billion CAPEX plan for 2025–2029 [1] positions it as a key player in the global energy transition. Of this, $16.3 billion (15%) is allocated to decarbonization initiatives, including renewable energy, carbon capture, and green hydrogen.

Key projects include:

- 5GW of onshore renewable energy assets (wind and solar) by 2028, achieved through partnerships with private developers [3].

- A CCS hub in Macaé, Rio de Janeiro, targeting the reinjection of 80 million tonnes of CO2 by 2025 [1].

- A $18 million green hydrogen pilot project in Rio Grande do Norte, aligning with Brazil’s growing demand for low-carbon fuels [3].

These investments are part of a broader strategy to reduce absolute operational emissions by 30% by 2030 and achieve emissions neutrality by 2050 [1]. By leveraging its expertise in large-scale infrastructure and Brazil’s abundant natural resources, Petrobras aims to transition from a traditional energy producer to a diversified energy company. This pivot not only mitigates long-term exposure to carbon regulations but also taps into emerging markets for sustainable aviation fuel (BioQAV) and renewable diesel [3].

Navigating Political and Regulatory Risks

Petrobras’ path to growth is not without challenges. The company faces political risks tied to regulatory shifts, such as the ANP’s revised oil reference price, which has raised costs for post-salt projects and reduced the economic viability of onshore operations [3]. CEO Magda Chambriard has warned that these changes could delay key projects in the Campos Basin and impact profitability [1]. Additionally, the legacy of the 2014 Lava Jato scandal, which exposed $3 billion in bribes and implicated high-profile politicians, continues to cast a shadow over governance perceptions [5].

However, Petrobras has taken steps to mitigate these risks. It has scaled back controversial local content (LC) policies that previously tied production to domestic industrial development, opting instead for market-based reforms to improve transparency [2]. While corruption allegations in 2025 are not reported in current sources, the company’s recent focus on operational efficiency and shareholder returns suggests a renewed emphasis on accountability.

Balancing Risks and Rewards

Petrobras’ investment case hinges on its ability to balance short-term political risks with long-term growth opportunities. On one hand, regulatory changes and governance concerns could pressure margins and delay energy transition projects. On the other, its discounted valuation, high FCF yield, and strategic CAPEX create a margin of safety for investors willing to navigate these uncertainties.

For context, Petrobras’ free cash flow yield of 23.75% [1] dwarfs the energy sector average of 8.2%, while its P/FCF ratio of 4.21 [1] is significantly lower than the sector median of 6.8. These metrics suggest the company is undervalued relative to its cash-generating capacity, particularly as it reinvests in high-margin renewables and hydrogen.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Bet for Patient Investors

Petrobras is not for the faint of heart. Its exposure to Brazil’s political landscape and regulatory shifts demands a high tolerance for risk. Yet, for investors who can stomach these challenges, the rewards are substantial. The company’s deep-value metrics, dividend sustainability, and aggressive energy transition strategy position it as a rare hybrid: a cash-flow generator with a clear roadmap to future-proof its operations.

As the energy transition accelerates and oil prices stabilize, Petrobras’ dual focus on short-term shareholder returns and long-term decarbonization could unlock significant value. For those who recognize the interplay between discounted valuations and strategic reinvention, Petrobras represents a compelling, albeit complex, opportunity in the evolving energy landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 11:56:48.409210

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a cleaner, eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel.
Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka SAF initiative offers a template for SAF market expansion in the Asia-Pacific region.
Key Takeaways Hawaiian Airlines has started using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on flights between Osaka and Honolulu.","Hawaiian Airlines has begun using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on its daily flights from Osaka to Honolulu. This move marks a significant milestone in the airline’s mission to cut down on climate pollution and reduce its carbon footprint.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a cleaner, eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. It is made from renewable or waste feedstocks like used cooking oil, making it a greener choice for aviation. Hawaiian Airlines has partnered with SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC, a company that produces SAF from locally sourced cooking oil. This collaboration aims to help cut emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

Why Osaka to Honolulu?

The airline chose the Osaka-Honolulu route for its SAF debut because it is a popular tourist route with steady demand, offering a reliable platform to scale this initiative. The wide-body daily flights provide an ideal opportunity to test and refine the SAF integration. Local production also minimizes the risks of fuel shortages and price fluctuations that might occur with imported fuel.

SAF Rollout Timeline and Targets

The SAF program was first announced in August 2025, and the initial deliveries of SAF began in early September 2025. The airline plans to use 1% SAF of its total fuel by the end of 2025, with a goal to reach 10% SAF by 2030. The ultimate aim is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

Process of SAF Blending and Use

Once the used cooking oil is collected and refined, it is blended with traditional jet fuel at the Kansai International Airport. The blended fuel is then used on Hawaiian Airlines’ A330-200 aircraft, operating flights HA449 and HA450 between Osaka and Honolulu. The process of fuel blending and certification ensures that the fuel meets sustainability standards like ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU.

It is the intention of the airlines to offer uninterrupted service to the patrons. While the rest of the protocol will remain the same, the fuel will be substituted for B20 blend SAF and conventional fuel. There will be no changes to the systems onboard, the layout and the boarding processes. Nevertheless, the tracking and blend processes still have to be modified.

Local Impact and Community Engagement

The SAF program integrates with local initiatives to gather used cooking oil from homes and companies. This initiative encourages recycling and deepens the community’s engagement with the sustainability process. Hawaiian Airlines recognizes the multifaceted opportunity to support sustainability and local economies.

The Role of Cosmo Oil and Other Partners

Cosmo Oil, a key partner in this program, is responsible for delivering the SAF to the airport. The company is focused on creating a domestic SAF supply chain in Japan. The Japanese government is also playing a crucial role by providing subsidies and policy support, which help lower the risks involved in scaling up this new fuel.

Addressing SAF Challenges and Future Scaling

While SAF is still a small share of the global aviation fuel market, early adoption is key to scaling up production. The main challenges to overcome include limited supply, the need for more refining plants, and the cost of SAF. However, early demand helps producers secure steady revenues and reinvest in building the supply chain.

The Annual Report anticipates that the U.S. demand for SAF products will reach 51,000 barrel equivalents per day by 2025. Although that figure seems high, it still represents less than 1% of total jet fuel consumption. Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka SAF initiative offers a template for SAF market expansion in the Asia-Pacific region. Large metropolitan centers will be able to support local SAF production.

Government Policy and Public Support

The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has been supporting the SAF initiative through public policy and financial incentives, which helps to lower initial costs for airlines. This collaboration highlights the importance of government backing in pushing forward new sustainable technologies.

Looking Ahead

Hawaiian Airlines has set its sights on expanding SAF usage to other routes as the fuel supply grows and costs decrease. The involvement of Alaska Air Group could provide additional benefits, such as shared procurement and logistics, lowering unit costs. As the SAF infrastructure improves, more airlines will be able to adopt this sustainable fuel and significantly reduce their emissions.

Key Takeaways

Hawaiian Airlines has started using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on flights between Osaka and Honolulu.

The SAF is produced from locally sourced cooking oil, reducing transportation emissions.

By 2030, Hawaiian aims to use 10% SAF, with a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040.

The program also highlights community involvement in used oil collection and regional SAF production.

Government and private sector collaboration is essential to scaling SAF and reducing aviation emissions.

Conclusion

The pioneering use of SAF by Hawaiian Airlines on the Osaka-Honolulu route is a critical milestone to further Hawaiian Airlines and the industry’s mission on emission reduction and sustainable aviation. Such an initiative can readily be replicated by other airlines interested in emission reduction and contributing to global climate action as it expands in scope.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hawaiian-airlines-3.jpg,N,,2025-09-06 05:56:12.196914

Under the proposal, all gasoline produced, blended, and sold for vehicles will be E10—gasoline with 10% ethanol. From 2031, the mandate will rise to E15 or higher ratios, depending on vehicle technology, fuel supply conditions, and energy security requirements. Until then, organizations and individuals are encouraged to produce, blend, and use biodiesel options such as B5 and B10.

Vietnam is expected to need around 1.5 million cubic meters of ethanol annually for blending, based on projected gasoline demand of 15 million cubic meters in 2024. Officials say the country already has sufficient capacity to meet this requirement.

The ministry emphasized that greater biofuel use supports Vietnam’s green growth goals, clean energy adoption, and its 2050 net-zero commitment. Studies indicate E10 can cut CO2 emissions by 3–5% compared with traditional gasoline. Applied to 10 million tons of annual consumption, that reduction could reach 640,000–800,000 tons of CO2 each year—six to eight times higher than the reductions achieved with E5.

Beyond climate benefits, biofuels lower toxic emissions such as CO, HC, and NOx, improving air quality in heavily polluted urban centers like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.

Addressing concerns over engine safety, MOIT cited automakers including Toyota, Honda, and Ford, as well as the Society of Automotive Engineers, in confirming E10 is safe for all modern engines. Vietnam’s own tests show no negative impact on engine durability when standards are met.

E10 has already been adopted successfully abroad. Thailand introduced it nationwide in 2007 and phased out pure gasoline by 2013, with no adverse effects on vehicle performance. Similarly, the US Renewable Fuels Association notes E10 has been used for over 20 years without issues.

According to recent surveys by Petrolimex, Toyota, and Honda, vehicles in Vietnam also run smoothly on E10. MOIT says the transition will protect engines, reduce maintenance costs, and extend vehicle lifespans thanks to E10’s higher octane rating.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ethanol-3.jpeg,N,,2025-09-06 05:56:19.020079

“Canada is at a critical crossroads,” said Fred Ghatala, President of ABFC. “The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has reshaped global energy markets and created a systemic imbalance, leaving Canadian producers at a severe competitive disadvantage, even in our own domestic marketplace. Today’s announcement is welcome. It gives our domestic biofuels sector the chance not only to compete, but to grow.

This new program will help restore competitiveness for domestic producers, enabling facilities to restart operations and expand capacity, and will shore up struggling feedstock markets. The clean fuels sector continues to prove it can deliver on government priorities. At full production, Canadian biorefineries contribute $19.8 billion to the Canadian economy. With the right fiscal and policy signals, Canada’s biofuels sector, already supporting over 30,000 jobs, can by 2030 expand production to generate $44.4 billion in economic output and sustain more than 60,000 jobs.

Biofuels support Canadian farmers by turning crops like canola into clean fuels to reinforce energy security, de-risk global trade headwinds, and drive clean energy investments. Biofuels connect rural fields to urban fuels, supporting Canadian farmers while building a sustainable economic and energy future for all Canadians.”

Since the July 2022 IRA announcement, ABFC has worked closely with the government and advocated for this much-needed program. ABFC will continue to provide data and analysis to support informed, evidence-based decision-making. Today’s announcement can be viewed on the Prime Minister’s website. ABFC will provide program updates on its website as details become available.

(CLMT) has positioned itself at the intersection of this shift through its subsidiary, Montana Renewables. In 2025, the company secured a $1.44 billion federal loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to expand its renewable fuels facility, a move that underscores its ambition to become a major player in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. This loan, structured with a 15-year tenor and an interest rate of the U.S. Treasury rate plus 3/8%, is a critical catalyst for scaling production to 300 million gallons annually—a step toward aligning with the Biden-Harris administration’s SAF Grand Challenge goals of 3 billion gallons by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 [1].

Strategic Positioning in the Renewable Energy Transition

Montana Renewables’ expansion is not merely a capital play but a strategic bet on regulatory tailwinds and market demand. The facility’s focus on SAF—a fuel with a carbon footprint up to 80% lower than conventional jet fuel—positions Calumet to capitalize on tightening emissions standards and corporate sustainability pledges. According to a report by the DOE, the project is expected to create 450 construction jobs and 40 operations jobs, injecting economic vitality into Montana while advancing decarbonization [2]. This dual benefit—environmental and economic—aligns with broader policy priorities, reducing political headwinds and enhancing the loan’s viability.

However, the path to growth has not been without turbulence. In early 2025, a temporary freeze on federal loans under the Trump administration delayed $782 million of the total $1.67 billion loan guarantee. Calumet’s CEO framed the delay as a bureaucratic hiccup rather than a rejection of the project’s merits, emphasizing that the company remains “on the cusp of a transformative phase” [3]. This resilience highlights management’s commitment to long-term value creation, even amid short-term uncertainties.

Financial Strength and Operational Efficiency

The financial implications of the loan are mixed. Calumet reported a net loss of $147.9 million in Q2 2025, driven by volatile commodity prices and high operational costs, despite exceeding revenue expectations by 10.96% to $1.0266 billion [4]. Its Adjusted EBITDA fell 26% year-over-year to $55.1 million, though cost-cutting initiatives saved $42 million in the first half of 2025. The Montana Renewables segment, while reporting a negative adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 million in Q2, showed progress in reducing operating costs per gallon to $0.43—a 15% improvement from 2024 [4].

The federal loan provides critical financial flexibility. Approximately $500 million of the proceeds will be allocated to debt cleanup, reducing annual cash debt service by one-third and easing liquidity constraints [5]. This deleveraging is essential for a company with a debt-to-equity ratio of -0.23 in Q2 2025—a figure complicated by a stockholder deficit but indicative of aggressive balance sheet restructuring [6]. Analysts at HC Wainwright, however, have downgraded their Q3 2025 earnings forecast to a loss of $0.57 per share, citing ongoing profitability challenges despite regulatory tailwinds [7].

Balancing Risks and Rewards

Calumet’s trajectory hinges on its ability to execute the MaxSAF project—a $1.44 billion expansion that promises to reduce capital requirements and boost production efficiency [8]. Success here would not only enhance margins but also solidify the company’s position as a top-three U.S. SAF producer by 2026. Yet risks persist: regulatory clarity on SAF credits, competition from startups leveraging advanced biofuels, and macroeconomic headwinds like interest rate volatility could test the company’s resilience.

For investors, the key question is whether Calumet’s strategic momentum offsets its near-term financial struggles. The federal loan addresses immediate liquidity needs while aligning with a $300-per-barrel carbon credit market for SAF—a structural tailwind. However, the company’s path to profitability remains contingent on operational execution and favorable policy environments.

Conclusion

Calumet Inc. embodies the dual-edged nature of the renewable energy transition: high-stakes opportunities paired with execution risks. Its federal loan is a masterstroke in accessing capital at favorable terms, but the true test lies in translating this funding into scalable, profitable operations. For now, the company’s alignment with national decarbonization goals and its progress in reducing costs provide a cautiously optimistic outlook. Yet, as with any high-growth play, patience and close monitoring of operational milestones will be essential for investors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-06 01:56:12.307139

XCFGlobal (NASDAQ: $SAFX) is positioned as one of the most dynamic participants in the rapidly expanding %SustainableAviationFuel (SAF) industry. For investors, the company presents rare exposure to a sector now breaking out as record prices, regulatory mandates, and tight supply conditions converge globally, including stunning new price records and margin expansions across the European SAF market as highlighted in recent indices. SAF Demand, Policy, and Rising Prices in Europe The SAF landscape has transformed dramatically in 2025. Europe, under new EU and UK mandates effective January, now requires 2% SAF blending with conventional jet fuel. This development, combined with supply limitations, has sent Northwest European (NWE) SAF prices to a 17-month high, with recent deals at $2,631 per ton as of August 28, a 30% increase in the past month alone. Remarkably, the SAF premium over traditional jet fuel has expanded to 3.7 times, underscoring an era of scarcity pricing and lucrative margins for flexible producers. Strategic Relevance of XCF Global's Operating Model With policy-driven demand outpacing supply, SAF spot market activity is robust. Producers like XCF Global, which utilize Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (%HEFA) technology, are positioned to benefit from these margin upswings. In Europe, the HEFA-SPK margin is now approximately $900 per ton, providing a powerful incentive for advanced SAF producers and their shareholders. Despite rising SAF product prices, waste feedstock costs (such as used cooking oil and tallow) have remained flat throughout August, allowing margins to expand further. For companies with secure feedstock contracts, such as XCF Global's 15-year agreement with Phillips 66, this environment enhances operational visibility and financial resilience even as global supply chains remain volatile. Supply Chain Realities and Arbitrage Dynamics European SAF production is capped by feedstock and refinery constraints, further complicated by import restrictions on renewable diesel from Asia. However, no such restrictions exist for imported SAF, which means U.S. and Asian producers can capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. Shipping data show SAF flows now originate not only from Asia but increasingly from the United States, confirming that global production platforms, such as XCF's scalable, modular U.S. and forthcoming Australian facilities will play an essential role in meeting global mandate-driven demand. Commercial Progress, Expansion, and Peer Benchmarking XCF Global commands a strategic U.S. supply position as one of only six active SAF facilities nationally, with additional sites in the pipeline and an international licensing strategy that has one MOU signed to develop the SAF market in Australia. XCF's flagship facility New Rise is in the critical ramp-up phase, a period of gradual optimization and testing that new facilities undergo before reaching full production capacity. During ramp-up, New Rise has switched to produce renewable diesel as it optimizes its production process to prepare for full-scale SAF production. The company's patent-pending site design, layout, and configuration supports rapid, cost-effective expansion timed to global demand inflections. This approach closely resembles the successful integration and margin-maximizing focus of benchmarks like %Calumet Inc. (NASDAQ: $CLMT), which has translated supply discipline and contract management into strong investor value in the U.S. renewable fuels sector. Industry Economics and the Investor Case With spot SAF prices in Europe well above both jet fuel and renewable diesel, and with mandates tightening globally, producers with flexible, scalable operations and guaranteed sales contracts are poised to benefit from outsized margins. Even as blending ratios lag behind regulatory targets (UK reported 1.345% vs 2% mandated Jan–Jun 2025), fueled demand will only intensify, boosting the urgency for new production and further propelling the premium for early movers like XCF Global. XCF Global is executing a clear-eyed growth plan. Through modular innovation, long-term offtake, and multi-regional expansion, the company is set to capture both regulatory-driven and spot market upside. Scarcity pricing, supply lags, and the spread of mandates suggest that investors seeking leveraged exposure to the %SAF upcycle should consider SAFX closely. Under the stewardship of CEO Mihir Dange, XCF Global delivers not only on vision, but combines capital discipline with the operational flexibility required as SAF transitions from a niche product to a global necessity.",,N,,2025-09-05 23:56:08.368060
