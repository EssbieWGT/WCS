An official from KSOP, Batam’s port authority, confirmed to Antara news agency that all passengers and crew from both ships were safely evacuated to HarbourFront Terminal in Singapore.

Batam News said that KSOP received a report of the collision between the Singapore-bound MV Horizon 9 and the Marshall Islands-flagged chemical tanker LA Digue at around 7.30pm (Singapore time).

A passenger on the Horizon 9 told the Straits Times that prior to the collision, the ferry had suddenly swerved to the left.

The 43-year-old man, identified only as Mr Junaidi, said he had he noticed the ferry heading for the side of the tanker before a loud bang was heard. ""There was a slight commotion in the ferry as we initially thought that the damage was quite serious.""

KSOP was reported as saying that the bow of the Horizon 9 suffered damage.

A car explosion near the historic Red Fort in India’s capital on Monday has killed eight people and injured at least 19 others, police in New Delhi said.

Delhi's police commissioner said the blast happened at 18:52 local time, when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light before it exploded. The owner of the car has been arrested, it was reported.

""I rushed out with my children and saw several vehicles on fire, body parts all over,” a witness, who lives near the scene of the explosion, told The Associated Press.

""We are exploring all possibilities and will conduct a thorough investigation, taking all possibilities into account,” Home Minister Amit Shah said.

CCTV footage from cameras in the area will form part of the investigation.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced on Monday (10 November) the introduction of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy.

McAfee said the company is actively seeking to expand into biogas and ethanol production in India.
RNG sales for the first nine months of the year reached 291,300 MMBtu, up from 234,800 MMBtu.","Aemetis Inc. released third quarter results on Nov. 6, reporting increased renewable natural gas (RNG) capacity and higher capacity utilization at the company’s California ethanol plant. Aemetis also provided an update of biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects.

During an earnings call, Aemetis Chairman and CEO Eric McAfee reported that the company’s RNG business significantly increased biogas production capacity at the end of the third quarter with a new multi-dairy digester that came online in September. That facility increased RNG capacity by more than 30%. According to McAfee, Aemetis remains on track to have more than 500,000 MMBtus of RNG capacity in place by the end of 2025, increasing to 1 MMBtus by the end of 2026. Aemetis is currently operating or building digesters to process waste from 18 dairies.

The California Air Resources Board earlier this year approved Low Carbon Fuel Standard pathways for seven of Aemetis’ dairy digesters, with an average carbon intensity (CI) score of -384 gCO2e/MJ. “These pathway approvals increased our LCFS credit revenue by 160% for these dairies starting in the third quarter of this year, compared to dairy digesters with the -150 default pathway score while pathways are pending approval,” McAfee said, noting four additional LCFS pathways are currently under review at CARB.

McAfee confirmed that the company’s RNG facilities qualify for the Section 48 energy investment tax credit. RNG output also qualifies for 45Z clean fuel production tax credits. “Collectively, molecule revenues, LCFS credit sales, D3 [renewable identification number (RIN)] sales and the sale of 45Z production tax credits are expected to generate strong positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of this year and expanding operating cash flow in 2026, as new dairy RNG production comes online 45Z calculations are issued by the Department of Energy and LCFS credit prices continue to rise,” he said.

Regarding operations at the Keyes ethanol plant, McAfee reported that the mechanical vapor recompression (MVR) system is completing equipment fabrication. On-site construction is expected to begin during the fourth quarter of 2025 and be complete during the second quarter of 2026. The MVR system is expected to reduce natural gas consumption at the ethanol plant by 80%, according to McAfee.

The Keyes plant reduced ethanol production during Spring 2025 in order to optimize ethanol margins. McAfee said the facility ramped up production during the third quarter due to higher ethanol demand and improved margins. Higher production is expected to continue during the fourth quarter.

Aemetis also operates a biodiesel subsidiary in India, which is targeting an initial public offering (IPO) in early 2026. McAfee said the company is actively seeking to expand into biogas and ethanol production in India.

In addition, Aemetis is working to develop the Riverbank biorefinery, a 90 MMgy SAF and renewable diesel facility in California, along with CCS capacity. According to McAfee, the company continues to engage in active discussions on financing structures for the Riverbank project, and is waiting further clarity on the 45Z production credit and biofuel mandates to support project financing. For the adjacent CCS project, Aemetis has completed initial site and installation work for its CO2 characterization well. The data obtained from the next phase of drill will support the company’s Class VI permit application.

Aemetis sold 14.7 million gallons of ethanol during the third quarter of 2025, down from 15.5 million gallons sold during the same period of 2024. For the first nine months of the year, ethanol sales reached 42.6 million gallons, down from 44.4 million gallons sold during the same period of last year.

The financing will support policy and institutional measures that facilitate implementation of Brazil’s Ecological Transformation Plan in sustainable finance, energy transition and green and resilient infrastructure.

Announcing the investment, Jin Liqun, President and Chair of the Board of Directors, AIIB, said Brazil’s reform program “couples policy ambition with practical market reforms,” adding that “AIIB’s support will help channel more private capital into sustainable finance, accelerate the energy transition, and build climate-resilient infrastructure—delivering tangible benefits for people, nature and the economy.”

“Through this CPBF, Brazil and AIIB are demonstrating that climate action and development go hand in hand,” said Tatiana Rosito, Vice Minister for International Affairs at the Ministry of Finance and AIIB Alternate Governor for Brazil. “This partnership is helping us turn policy into progress – creating markets for sustainable finance, advancing carbon market and blended-finance mechanisms such as Eco Invest Brasil, driving the energy transition, and recognizing nature as essential infrastructure for a resilient future.”

Under the CPBF, reforms are organized across sustainable finance, energy transition, and green and resilient infrastructure—three pillars that together direct public and private capital toward low-carbon growth and biome regeneration; promote competitive, sustainable bioenergy with robust value chains; and enhance the resilience of critical natural assets and infrastructure. Expected results include establishing governance for a national carbon market, mobilizing private resources for sustainable infrastructure and forest conservation, producing low-GHG sustainable aviation fuel, deploying early-warning systems for extreme heat, and strengthening forest and mangrove restoration.

The project applies AIIB’s operational policies for CPBF and will complement policy loans of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. Semi-annual program reviews will track prior actions and results, consistent with the Program’s agreed framework.

This initiative builds on AIIB’s previous analytical work – including its Nature as Infrastructure Report (2023), which reframes natural ecosystems as core infrastructure assets, and its Infrastructure for Planetary Health Report (2025), which integrates infrastructure investment with human, environmental and climate health outcomes.

But for travellers who are price-conscious, this may push them to choose another country to fly from, said Ms Kong, 55.

The Australian, who typically visits family here before continuing her travels to other parts of Asia and Europe from Changi Airport, has taken six business class flights out of Singapore for work and leisure so far in 2025.

Speaking to The Straits Times from Sydney, where she is based, she expressed surprise at Singapore’s decision to impose a levy at a time when people are increasingly conscious about costs and uncertain about the economic outlook.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) on Nov 10 announced that passengers flying out of Singapore from October 2026 will

pay a levy of between $1 and $41.60

that will go towards the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel. The levy paid will vary based on flight distance and class of travel.

It will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from Oct 1 that year.

Passengers in economy or premium economy class will pay between $1 and $10.40, depending on their destination.

Those who fly business or first class will pay between $4 and $41.60.

The travellers ST interviewed said that while the levy amount is not significant enough to change their travel habits, it is another fee added to the already-high cost of air travel.

Ms May Ng, 37, said she is resigned to paying the charge since there is no choice.

The personal assistant, who travels with her husband and two daughters in economy class, flies out of Singapore up to four times a year, usually to destinations within Asia.

While Ms Ng believes that adopting sustainable aviation fuel is good for the environment, “who wants to pay more?” she asked.

Still, the amount is not large enough to change her family’s travel plans or encourage her to book tickets earlier to avoid paying the levy.

Passengers who book their tickets before April 1, 2026, will not have to pay the levy, even if they are travelling after Oct 1, 2026.

Ms Claudine Ho, an administrator in the medical industry, flies up to 10 times a year.

The 53-year-old, who takes a mix of economy and business class flights, said more can be done to help travellers understand the importance of sustainability by making it relatable to the layperson, so that travellers can understand the reason behind imposing the levy.

Another frequent traveller, Mr Julius Toh, sees the levy as yet another example of the rising cost of living.

However, the 55-year-old bar owner, who travels up to eight times a year for work and with family within Asia and to Europe, said most travellers would probably not notice it.

A spokesman for national carrier Singapore Airlines told ST that the charge aligns with SIA Group’s commitment to gradually increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel.

He said it will continue to work with partners, including government agencies and fuel suppliers, to accelerate the development and commercialisation of green jet fuel.

Mr Sheldon Hee, regional vice-president for the Asia-Pacific at the International Air Transport Association, said the industry body for airlines welcomes the “lead time for the implementation and the industry consultations to clarify the implementation details”.

The timing of the levy roll-out – for tickets sold from April 2026 for flights departing from October that year – is based on industry feedback, giving airlines and passengers time to adjust, CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said on Nov 10.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, calculated on a per-kilogramme basis.

It will also vary based on the distance travelled.

A spokeswoman for DHL said the global logistics company is reviewing the details of the levy, and assessing the impact on its operations and customers.

An investigation by the EU Commission and the Network of Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Authorities decided that airlines’ descriptions of carbon offsets and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) gave passengers a false impression that flying was sustainable. Flight emissions ‘calculators’ and vague net-zero emissions targets were also raised as greenwashing practices.

Lufthansa, KLM, and Ryanair are among the airlines who will now revise their claims after reaching an agreement with the EU. The bloc warned that if they did not fall in line with the investigation, sanctions could follow. The 21 airlines must now use the term ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ with appropriate clarifications, and be much clearer with their carbon offsetting claims.

Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, said:

It is excellent news airlines have agreed to stop luring consumers with green promises following our complaint to the European Commission. It was high time airlines stopped painting flying as a sustainable option. Paying ‘green fares’ to plant trees can never guarantee to suck aircraft emissions out of the air.

The EU’s recommendations made clear that sustainability claims and ‘green’ terminology can only be used if backed up by comprehensive targets, strategies, and timelines. Announced on the eve of COP30, the agreement sends a strong message to all airlines, and highlights how much more needs to be done for aviation to make realistic steps towards decarbonisation and overall sustainability.

Often made from biomass waste or cooking oils, small percentages of sustainable aviation fuels are already blended with conventional kerosene fuels, with the aviation industry and travelers pushing towards larger integration.
The current corn-based sustainable aviation fuel production method chemically modifies ethanol to make aviation fuel through a process called Alcohol-to-Jet.
""A variety of factors need to be considered when planning how to produce large quantities of sustainable aviation fuels from CO₂.
Starting with CO₂ from corn ethanol fermentation promises the fastest path to scaling up this new industry,"" said Sick.","Manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel with CO₂ byproducts of ethanol production could reduce carbon intensity by more than 80% compared to fossil fuels.

The CO2 released from corn during ethanol production could actually be a valuable, underutilized resource for producing aviation fuel rather than a waste byproduct, according to a study published in the SAE International Journal of Sustainable Transportation, Energy, Environment, & Policy.

Unlike the CO₂ from coal plants or cement kilns, which requires a lot of energy to capture, fermentation to produce ethanol releases very pure streams containing 85% CO₂ by volume or higher. As the corn plants sequestered CO₂ from the air, capturing the CO₂ released from fermentation and using it as fuel would reuse CO₂ without adding more to the atmosphere.

""It is exciting to explore whether this 'waste' stream can actually become a significant asset, turning inefficiency into advantage and accelerating the real-world application of emerging technologies,"" said Stephen McCord, a research scientist in mechanical engineering at U-M and lead author of the study.

With aviation producing over a gigaton of fossil CO2 emissions annually, sustainable aviation fuel produced from non-fossil carbon stocks can help reduce these emissions. Often made from biomass waste or cooking oils, small percentages of sustainable aviation fuels are already blended with conventional kerosene fuels, with the aviation industry and travelers pushing towards larger integration.

The United States produced 15.6 billion gallons of ethanol in 2023, releasing 48 megatons of CO₂, offering a route to produce sustainable aviation fuel at scale. With several different ways to make sustainable aviation fuel from bioethanol, the research team compared pathways to determine the ones with the lowest environmental impact.

""We hope to inform future development and policy by highlighting which routes are most promising for reducing aviation's carbon footprint using existing waste resources,"" said Volker Sick, former Director of the Global CO₂ Initiative and the DTE Energy Professor of Advanced Energy Research at U-M and senior author of the study.

The current corn-based sustainable aviation fuel production method chemically modifies ethanol to make aviation fuel through a process called Alcohol-to-Jet. Although it has a high fuel yield of 90%, this route only reduces carbon intensity by about 4.5% to 20% compared to kerosene jet fuel.

The research team compared this method to two CO₂-based routes. Both methods begin by converting captured CO₂ into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H₂). The gas fermentation route uses syngas to create ethanol as an intermediate step, then uses Alcohol-to-Jet to produce fuel. The Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis route instead feeds syngas into a reactor, synthesizing the long-chain liquid hydrocarbons that make up jet fuel.

A life cycle assessment found both approaches outperformed conventional methods, with Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis projected to reduce carbon intensity by up to 90% while gas fermentation was projected to reduce it by 84%.

When considering existing bioethanol facilities and workforce skills, gas fermentation followed by Alcohol-to-Jet came out on top as the path with the smoothest transition despite a slightly lower carbon intensity reduction.

""A variety of factors need to be considered when planning how to produce large quantities of sustainable aviation fuels from CO₂. Starting with CO₂ from corn ethanol fermentation promises the fastest path to scaling up this new industry,"" said Sick.

As a follow-up, the research team assessed the economic competitiveness of these two pathways to understand which would operate best in real-world conditions and which could be deployed quickest in the US.

With electrification and hydrogen both facing significant technical and practical obstacles for long-distance air travel, hydrocarbon fuels will likely remain essential for aviation in the foreseeable future.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2019/ethanol.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 14:00:06.366061

The facility will convert used cooking oil and waste-based feedstocks into certified sustainable aviation fuel meeting international standards. Phase I will produce 125 million litres per year around 18 percent of the UAE’s 2030 target, while Phase II will double capacity to 250 million litres per year, supporting regional exports and contributing up to 36 percent of the nation’s SAF goal.

The planned investment for phase I is $200 million and additional $100 million for Phase II, making a total investment of $300 million. The project represents a major contribution and step forward in the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 Agenda.

First introduced at Adipec 2024 in alignment with the nation’s vision to expand sustainable fuel production, Mena Biofuels has since progressed from concept to implementation, moving decisively towards execution. Over the past year the company has completed a comprehensive feasibility study validating the project’s economic viability and set the foundation for progressing the project to realisation. The project has secured the lease of land, adjacent to Mena Terminals, from the Government of Fujairah, appointed Dynatron FZE, a UAE engineering consulting firm, to act as Project Manager, completed detailed topographic and hydrological surveys carried out by UAE based consulting firms, and selected an internationally recognized technology provider for the process to convert waste-based feedstocks into certified sustainable aviation fuel. Robert Wright, former CEO of the European Biofuels Association, has been contracted to provide advice on policy and regulation matters, and MUC Engineering – Fujairah Branch has been appointed to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment study as well as provide Project NOC consulting services.

At Adipec 2025, Mena Biofuels advanced its commercial implementation through the signing of strategic offtake MoU in the presence of Suhail Mohamed Al-Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, with Emirates Petroleum Company PJSC (Emarat), a pioneer in the UAE’s oil and gas industry. In addition, it is the intention to sign a similar MoU at the upcoming Dubai Air Show. The agreements set the foundation for UAE production of sustainable aviation fuel, marking a key step in advancing the nation’s SAF Roadmap 2030 and Net Zero 2050 objectives.

Building on this momentum, Mena Biofuels has launched the first of two Engineering, Procurement, and Construction and commissioning (EPCC) tender for the Fujairah SAF facility, inviting qualified international and regional contractors with proven experience in renewable fuel and industrial projects to participate. The first EPCC package will cover the receiving, storage, and distribution facilities for feedstock, SAF, and by-products, establishing the project’s logistical backbone. Within Q1 2026, Mena Biofuels will issue the second EPCC tender, covering the SAF refinery process units and associated infrastructure, marking a major step toward full-scale implementation of the UAE’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel plant. The project continues to move from vision to execution, positioning the UAE as a regional hub for sustainable aviation fuel production and ensuring SAF supply from Fujairah to the UAE, GCC, and international markets.

Ali Khalifa Al Shamsi, Chief Executive Officer of Emarat, said, “Building a home-grown SAF ecosystem requires investors, technology and distributors pulling in one direction. With Emarat’s agreement with Mena Biofuels, intent becomes supply: accelerated volumes from Fujairah, certified and locally produced, giving airlines a credible path to decarbonise. By backing a UAE-built SAF stream in FOIZ, we are creating domestic capacity that carriers can count on—advancing the SAF Roadmap 2030 and the nation’s Net Zero 2050 ambition while keeping value, jobs and know-how in the UAE.Twelve months from concept to implementation sends a clear signal that the UAE is serious about sustainable aviation fuel, and Emarat is committed to turning that momentum into dependable offtake and real emissions reductions.”

Captain Salem Al Afkham, Director, Fujairah Oil Industry Zone (FOIZ), said: “The launch of the UAE’s first SAF plant here in Fujairah marks a defining milestone for both the Emirate and the Nation. As the first project of its kind in Fujairah and the UAE, it reflects our shared commitment to the Net Zero 2050 strategy and the transition toward more sustainable energy sources. We are proud to be part of this achievement, which represents a new chapter in Fujairah’s energy journey. This project moves Fujairah closer to its strategic ambition of diversifying its energy mix beyond conventional hydrocarbons and into cleaner, higher-value fuels. It also aligns with the emirate’s and the UAE’s vision of fostering in-market value creation — bringing together investment, innovation, and industrial capacity to build long-term economic and environmental resilience.

As this and similar projects take shape, FOIZ continues to evolve from one of the world’s top three oil storage and bunkering hubs into a fully integrated energy ecosystem — one where processing capacity and advanced technologies are leveraged to convert feedstocks into higher-value, more sustainable fuels. This transformation strengthens Fujairah’s role as a vital contributor to the region’s clean-fuels landscape and underscores our ongoing commitment to supporting the UAE’s broader energy transition.”

“We are proud to see Mena Biofuels progress from announcement to implementation in just one year,” said H.E Mohamed Saeed Al-Raqbani, Chairman of Mena Biofuels. “This project directly supports the UAE’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap 2030 and embodies our commitment to advancing clean energy through industrial investment and strategic partnerships.”

“By leveraging Fujairah’s infrastructure and aligning with the UAE’s SAF Roadmap, Mena Biofuels is aiming to become a regional leader in clean aviation fuel,” added Gati Al-Jebouri, Chief Executive Officer of Mena Biofuels.","https://imgengine.khaleejtimes.com/khaleejtimes-english/2025-11-10/n5a2a5rl/Mena.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&format=auto&ogImage=true&mode=crop&rect=0,0,4160,2773",N,,2025-11-10 13:01:23.382439

Zach Nunn on the harms of the ""catastrophic"" Schumer Shutdown and ...",Matthew Foldi,,,,,https://washingtonreporter.news/p/interview-rep-zach-nunn-on-the-harms,"“We’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families,” Nunn said, discussing a facility that he recently visited.
In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets.” Trump, Nunn said, has “done two things.
Rep. Zach Nunn: We’ve offered a very clean pathway to end the shutdown.
Rep. Zach Nunn: Well, first and foremost, we’ve gone out to our first responder groups across the 3rd District in Iowa.
Rep. Zach Nunn: Every single day of September, October, and now going in November, has been ruined by the Schumer shutdown.","While the Schumer Shutdown has devastated Americans across the country, Rep. Zach Nunn (R., Iowa) has spent the past few weeks meeting with constituents who have been devastated by what he categorized as the Democrats’ “partisan, extreme primary politics” that have ground America to a halt.

The Washington Reporter previously covered Nunn’s latest tour of Iowa’s 3rd District; now Nunn, in his latest interview with the Reporter, shared his thoughts on how Democrats are abandoning their roots in states like Iowa and how President Donald Trump scored a major win for farmers, manufacturers, and rural Americans during his most recent trip to Asia.

Nunn, a self-described “common sense conservative” who represents one of the most competitive districts in America, painted a bleak picture of how the Schumer Shutdown has devastated districts like his.

The “harvest is ongoing. The Department of Agriculture’s offices are closed. We’ve got guys who are having their hardest farm year ever, and it’s coming on the back of the fact that the president has gone above and beyond to try and open up new markets, particularly in Asia, for things like soybeans, corn, and beef. All good news.”

“But,” Nunn noted, “this also come off the heels of four years of the Biden administration being a complete failure on moving forward with domestic production as well. That’s things like biofuels, including E15, 45Z tax credits, really looking at the sustainable aviation fuel. These are two things that farmers are looking for now, and until we can win just five holdouts the Democratic caucus, Democrats have decided to hold the entire country hostage, hold the Midwest hostage on this issue.”

The other issue that Nunn focused on was cuts to SNAP and WIC. Nunn, who was “at both the food bank that collects all this and the food pantry that distributes all this,” has seen the consequences firsthand.

“We have seen record requests coming in from Iowa families who don’t know whether they should save their money to fill up the minivan, save their money to fill up the refrigerator, or save their money because they have no idea when they’re going to get paid again,” he explained. “I just talked to TSA guys on this and a number of them are on SNAP. They’re barely making it by in their front line position that protects us all, but now they’re also in the third missed pay period. This is putting a real stress on men and women who are being asked to show up on shift to protect all of us.”

Nunn explained that the consequences extend to Head Start programs as well, even though several in Iowa had not suffered from the shutdown.

“We’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families,” Nunn said, discussing a facility that he recently visited. “We’re talking about two, three, and four year olds that I spent time with, hearing it directly from both the staff at Head Start, the educators, as well as the parents who, if Head Start, runs out, not only do they not have WIC, they do not have SNAP, but now they can’t even go to work because they don’t have the opportunity for child care. It’s a triple strike for these families, and they’re going to be out big time if these programs aren’t able to be funded.”

But there are also unintended consequences that policymakers had clearly been ignoring, and he saw that firsthand when he met with law enforcement officers.

“When it comes to our sheriffs and our county law enforcement here, these guys are seeing an uptick in the number of challenges that are coming from domestic situations related to not getting the assistance that families need, and it puts a lot of stress on the community, particularly a rural community, when it doesn’t have a food bank up the street, but it depends on things like SNAP and WIC to take care of kiddos, to take care of senior citizens, so these are the unintended consequence of a shutdown, but it’s the totally foreseeable result of bad policy management in D.C,” Nunn explained.

“When Washington doesn’t pay its bills with taxpayer dollars that we sent from Iowa, Iowans end up getting hurt by this,” he added.

While a deal seems imminent that could end parts of the shutdown, Nunn stressed that “the longest shutdown in government history [is] a shutdown of choice by the Democrats, a shutdown that’s never happened over a simple clean funding bill.” He called it “a reflection of a Democratic Party that has not only lost touch with its roots in places like Iowa, but it is clearly putting partisan, extreme primary politics ahead of the entire country.”

While most federally elected Democrats were content to abandon the communities that Nunn spent the shutdown visiting, Trump struck major deals across the world.

Nunn said that Trump’s Asia trip in particular is welcome relief for his district.

“For farmers, manufacturers and, candidly, for rural America, this is huge,” Nunn said. “For the last four years, under the Biden administration, we went from trade parity to a $50 billion trade deficit just in the ag sector alone. In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets.”

Trump, Nunn said, has “done two things. He’s done, first of all, not just a great deal with China to get them to open back up, but he’s worked the entire region, everywhere from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, specifically, a 95 percent reduction on tariffs for Iowa ag, in the course of 24 hours. This is huge. This is what we need. We need Iowa farms to be successful, because they can’t just be the big farms that can sell overseas. It’s got to be the hometown farms that can have a market for this.”

The other aspect, which he has discussed with both the White House and with the Treasury Department, is that “we’ve got to have the opportunity to have a better domestic market here for being able to sell our commodities,” he said. “That’s everything from our beef market to our biofuels market. And I’m happy to say the administration is hearing us on that, and that is something that helps out not just rural America be successful, but it drives down the cost of food and fuel for the entire country.”

“Affordability in all of its aspects is going to come in those two areas, where, if we can drive down the cost of people being able to purchase goods at a cheaper and feed their families at cheaper rate, we’re moving in the right direction,” Nunn said.

Below is a transcript of our interview with Rep. Zach Nunn, lightly edited for clarity.

Washington Reporter:

Congressman Nunn, can you walk us through how the past several weeks of unprecedented and historic obstruction from your Democratic colleagues is harming states like Iowa and districts like yours specifically?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Let me just begin by saying I’m a common sense conservative, and I think that that goes a long way when I have one of the most competitive congressional districts in the entire state. We just had an election that showed that people were really frustrated with the dysfunction of D.C., and they want to see people who are going to be change agents delivering on things from affordability to housing to what we’re doing in the ag sector, particularly for both domestic and for the export market. Just this week, we spent a lot of time with farmers. This is the big thing. Harvest is ongoing. USDA, the Department of Agriculture, their offices are closed. We’ve got guys who are having their hardest farm year ever, and it’s coming on the back of the fact that the president has gone above and beyond to try and open up new markets, particularly in Asia, for things like soybeans, corn, and beef. All good news. But this also come off the heels of four years of the Biden administration being a complete failure on moving forward with domestic production as well. That’s things like biofuels, including E15, 45Z tax credits, really looking at the sustainable irrigation fuel. These are two things that farmers are looking for now, and until we can win just five holdouts the Democratic caucus, Democrats have decided to hold the entire country hostage, hold the Midwest hostage on this issue. So that’s my farmer issue. The second issue that we’ve really talked to here are the folks who depend on farmers. That is young families and women and independent children. SNAP and WIC are having big time impacts. I’ve been out at both the food bank that collects all this and the food pantry that distributes all this. We have seen record requests coming in from Iowa families who don’t know whether they should save their money to fill up the minivan, save their money to fill up the refrigerator, or save their money because they have no idea when they’re going to get paid again. I just talked to TSA guys on this and a number of them are on SNAP. They’re barely making it by in their front line position that protects us all, but now they’re also in the third missed pay period. This is putting a real stress on men and women who are being asked to show up on shift to protect all of us. But Democrats, again, thought that their liberal, progressive base deserved first priority on Election Day, versus 350 million Americans. And Foldi, I’ll also highlight this; I’m in a +1 Democrat district. And I get that. I work with people who are Republicans, people who are independents, and people who are Democrats, but I am hearing across the board here from these folks that they blame the Senate for this. They see they’re on the same side here now as the air traffic controllers union, the teamsters union, the hardcore federal union guys who are saying that Senate Democrats need to pass what the House Republicans passed back in September because now it’s crushing their own workforce. They can’t even be out there lying trying to justify this thing anymore. This is hopefully a wake up call to folks that if Democrats have lost everybody, from, Fetterman to union workers in Des Moines, Iowa, they’re in real trouble.

Washington Reporter:

You were mentioning the election results; how do you think that those are going to impact the Democrats’ approach to ending the shutdown? And how do you think it’s changing your approach here as you think about how to get out of the shutdown?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

We’ve offered a very clean pathway to end the shutdown. It should have been done two months ago, and every day that goes by, it hurts more and more Iowans. That’s unacceptable. I’ve been so aggressive as to say it’s catastrophic, not just for our food banks, not just for our farmers, but for the 2,000 National Guardsmen from Iowa who are currently deployed to Iraq who are going to go through a second month without their pay, that is unacceptable, particularly as somebody who continues to serve and fight with our armed forces. This should never have happened. The second part of this is, I am afraid the Democrats are taking the wrong lesson away from this. There is a handful of folks who are on the far left who think that the success of a Democratic socialist communist in New York is an indication that holding America hostage is how they get the things that they’re crying about. But as we heard from Schumer himself, you don’t throw a tantrum and shut down the government when you don’t get your way. That’s what he said six months ago. Here we are, beyond six weeks and the man hasn’t been able to find an off ramp with his own base to get the government open, and so while Democrats on the far coasts are talking about how we can continue to leverage this independents, and what I would call old school Democrats back home in Iowa have said, this is enough, and it’s hurting people who are the least able to bear the brunt of the Democratic shutdown operation. And as a result, just like with union Democrats, just like with old school Democrats, they went over to Trump in waves, I think we’re seeing a second coming of this, at least in the Midwest, of folks who are done with the shutdown and they don’t see liberal elites taking them into consideration.

Washington Reporter:

I’m particularly curious what you learned from your law enforcement roundtable and your Drake University Head Start visit, because you already touched on the farmer aspect and the TSA aspect. How does the shutdown impact law enforcement in the Midwest and Head Start and university programs?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Well, first and foremost, we’ve gone out to our first responder groups across the 3rd District in Iowa. That means meeting with multiple police departments and sheriff’s offices, as well as both our full time and our volunteer firefighters and EMS. For the volunteers, this is just crushing; all of their SAFER grants are now on hold, and this is major equipment purchases. I talked with the Crescent Fire Department that wants to buy a multimillion dollar fire truck that helps protect them, particularly during the harvest season, when we have a lot of heavy operations going on, and they need to be able to respond both with the ambulance and the hook and ladder truck, and they can’t get it. When it comes to our sheriffs and our county law enforcement here, these guys are seeing an uptick in the number of challenges that are coming from domestic situations related to not getting the assistance that families need, and it puts a lot of stress on the community, particularly a rural community, when it doesn’t have a food bank up the street, but it depends on things like SNAP and WIC to take care of kiddos, to take care of senior citizens, so these are the unintended consequence of a shutdown, but it’s the totally foreseeable result of bad policy management in D.C. When Washington doesn’t pay its bills with taxpayer dollars that we sent from Iowa, Iowans end up getting hurt by this. The other side of the story, which is really tragic here, is we’ve got a Head Start program that does phenomenal work, particularly for little kiddos and young families. We’re talking about two, three, and four year olds that I spent time with, hearing it directly from both the staff at Head Start, the educators, as well as the parents who, if Head Start, runs out, not only do they not have WIC, they do not have SNAP, but now they can’t even go to work because they don’t have the opportunity for child care. It’s a triple strike for these families, and they’re going to be out big time if these programs aren’t able to be funded. I’m happy to we’ve been able to lead some good legislation on this, getting our SAFER grants, our cops grants, and Head Start in Des Moines effectively supported. We’ve gone out of the way to make sure that we worked with the White House on getting our troops paid through October. But this is not forever, and while SNAP and WIC are going to be able to be extended, we’ve got to get to a solution. The longest shutdown in government history, a shutdown of choice by the Democrats, a shutdown that’s never happened over a simple clean funding bill, is a reflection of a Democratic Party that has not only lost touch with its roots in places like Iowa, but it is clearly putting partisan, extreme primary politics ahead of the entire country.

Washington Reporter:

Iowa and Oklahoma don’t have any federally elected Democrats. Over in Oklahoma, Stephanie Bice was telling me that the shutdown shows that Democrats don’t care about rural America. Is that what’s going on here?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

When two guys from an extreme leftist state like New York are more worried about if they are going to have to try and get the endorsement of the new communist Mayor than they are the guys like Fetterman, who basically said that Democrats need to get their shit together if they can’t help feed the people who are poorest in this country, not only are you no longer championing what Democrats say they’re going to do, but you’re hurting the people, regardless of political party, who are the Americans on the front line of facing a Thanksgiving without food, without fuel, and without a future.

Washington Reporter:

I was struck by your point on Trump earlier, and obviously he spent a lot of the shutdown getting trade deals while Democrats in D.C. were doing no deals. Can you give us a sense of how the Asia trip, for example, is being received, especially by farmers in your district and in your state?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

For farmers, manufacturers and, candidly, for rural America, this is huge. For the last four years, under the Biden administration, we went from trade parity to a $50 billion trade deficit just in the ag sector alone. In my home state of Iowa, half of soybeans go to export markets. And the president’s done two things. He’s done, first of all, not just a great deal with China to get them to open back up, but he’s worked the entire region, everywhere from Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, specifically, a 95 percent reduction on tariffs for Iowa ag, in the course of 24 hours. This is huge. This is what we need. We need Iowa farms to be successful, because they can’t just be the big farms that can sell overseas. It’s got to be the hometown farms that can have a market for this. And then the other aspect of this, and one of the areas where I’ve been very vocal with both the White House and with the Treasury Secretary, is that we’ve got to have the opportunity to have a better domestic market here for being able to sell our commodities. That’s everything from our beef market to our biofuels market. And I’m happy to say the administration is hearing us on that, and that is something that helps out not just rural America be successful, but it drives down the cost of food and fuel for the entire country. Affordability in all of its aspects is going to come in those two areas, where, if we can drive down the cost of people being able to purchase goods at a cheaper and feed their families at cheaper rate, we’re moving in the right direction.

Washington Reporter:

Do you think that people’s Thanksgiving plans are going to be ruined by Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries?

Rep. Zach Nunn:

Every single day of September, October, and now going in November, has been ruined by the Schumer shutdown. Hakeem and Schumer has the opportunity to end this tonight. They’ve had 14 times to end it prior to this. And I’ll be very clear here, there are five individuals who make the decision for the entire country right now. Republicans have been clear in the House. Republicans have been clear in the Senate, and the majority of both chambers want this. But more importantly, the majority of Americans, regardless of party, want this. Five people can do the right thing. It’s up to them to decide whether families are going to get to have the Thanksgiving and the Christmas they deserve.

Washington Reporter:

The European Commission has reached an agreement with 21 airlines to revise or remove environmental claims deemed misleading, following a coordinated investigation by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network.

The agreement concludes months of dialogue that began after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023, accusing major carriers of “greenwashing.”

EU secures agreement with airlines to end misleading environmental messaging

The airlines involved include Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, SAS, EasyJet, Norwegian, SWISS, TAP Air Portugal, Austrian Airlines, and Vueling. All have committed to eliminate or clarify claims suggesting that a specific flight could be made “carbon neutral” or “sustainable” through the purchase of offsets or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“Consumers are the firepower of our economy. Time and time again, Europeans have shown their readiness to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future,” said Michael McGrath, Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, the Rule of Law and Consumer Protection.

“It is now important that the industry match these efforts by ensuring transparency and honesty in environmental claims. Consumers deserve clear and accurate information about the true impact of air travel and the real efforts that can be made to increase sustainability.”

“This dialogue is an encouraging acknowledgement of the responsibility we share to provide consumers with truthful information and to work toward genuine improvements in reducing the environmental impact of aviation,” said Henna Virkkunen, Executive Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy. “I welcome the commitment made by the airlines to change their practices.

What airlines must change in their messaging

The Commission and national authorities said that many airline marketing practices violated the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which prohibits vague or unverifiable environmental promises. Under the new agreement, carriers will:

Remove or reword claims implying individual flights can be carbon neutral through offset schemes or SAF purchases.

Avoid using generic language like “green,” “eco-friendly,” or “sustainable travel” without providing scientific evidence.

Clarify the actual share of SAF used and the lifecycle methodology behind emissions-reduction figures.

Provide transparent assumptions in flight-emission calculators and ensure comparisons are scientifically supported.

The Commission emphasised that this was a compliance commitment, not a fine, but warned that enforcement could follow if the airlines fail to update their marketing.

The KLM “greenwashing” case: a win for environmental groups

In March 2024, the District Court of Amsterdam ruled that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines misled consumers with sustainability-related advertising, marking the first successful greenwashing lawsuit against an airline.

Environmental group Fossielvrij NL filed the case in 2022 with legal backing from ClientEarth, targeting KLM’s “Fly Responsibly” campaign. The plaintiffs argued that the airline’s claims about offsetting and sustainable aviation fuel created a false impression that passengers could fly “responsibly” without contributing to climate change.

The court found that 15 out of 19 marketing statements were misleading or insufficiently substantiated, including language implying KLM’s flights were sustainable or that purchasing offsets or SAF could neutralise emissions. In its ruling, the court said KLM had painted “an overly rosy picture” of sustainable aviation fuel and overstated the effectiveness of its measures, as reported by The Guardian.

Although the court did not require corrective advertising, it ordered the airline to ensure future claims are concrete, transparent, and evidence-based. KLM removed the contested materials.

Other airlines under fire for sustainability claims

Other airlines have also faced challenges from environmental groups and consumer protection agencies over their sustainability claims, not only in Europe but in the US as well. However, the US courts have generally favoured airlines.

Austrian Airlines: “carbon neutral to Venice”

In Austria, consumer group VKI filed a lawsuit against Austrian Airlines over a 2023 campaign claiming passengers could fly “carbon neutral to Venice” thanks to SAF. The court ruled that the claim was misleading because the airline used only a small fraction of SAF—nowhere near enough to offset the flight’s actual emissions.

Ryanair: “Europe’s lowest emissions airline”

The UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Ryanair’s 2020 ads that described it as “Europe’s lowest emissions airline.” Regulators said the claim relied on outdated data and failed to account for other carriers.

Delta Air Lines: “world’s first carbon-neutral airline”

In the United States, Delta Air Lines is facing a proposed class-action lawsuit (Berrin v. Delta Air Lines Inc.) filed in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The suit alleges that Delta misled passengers by marketing itself as “the world’s first carbon-neutral airline.”

The plaintiff, represented by environmental counsel, argued that Delta’s carbon-neutral claim relied on offsets that were “manifestly and provably false.” The lawsuit claimed that Delta overstated the impact of its carbon offsets, many of which, it said, were overcredited or unverifiable. Delta denied wrongdoing and filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the advertising was aspirational and that carbon offsets were certified by third-party verifiers.

United Airlines: SAF and carbon offsets claims

Also in the US, a class-action lawsuit (Zajac v. United Airlines Inc.) accused the airline of misleading consumers about its use of sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsets. The Maryland court dismissed the case in 2024, ruling that it was pre-empted by the Airline Deregulation Act, which limits state-level consumer actions against airlines.

Europe requires proof of airline ‘green’ claims

The EU’s coordinated action on airlines follows broader regulatory reforms, not all of which have been successful. The Green Claims Directive, for example, was withdrawn in June of this year. It would have required companies to substantiate any environmental marketing statements with scientific evidence.

At the same time, regulatory requirements are providing firm numbers that airlines can cite in their messaging to specify their sustainability progress. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which took effect in 2024, requires European airlines to blend set proportions of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030. Airlines can publish their current blend compared to the target percentage required.

Airlines’ sustainability messaging agreement is only the beginning

Consumer groups say the new airline commitments are only the start.

“It is great news that authorities from across Europe acknowledge consumers have been fooled by airlines’ greenwashing. It is unacceptable that airlines have freely lured consumers into offsetting their flight’s emissions, sometimes at a high price. One can never be sure that the trees planted to compensate a flight’s high emissions will capture the carbon back into the ground – if they are planted at all,” said Monique Goyens, BEUC’s Director General.

“The fact that European consumer protection authorities are calling on airlines to get their act together shows there’s a wind of change. Greenwashing is no longer acceptable, and the fact that aviation is one of the most highly polluting sectors makes it even more intolerable. Today’s crackdown on greenwashing is encouraging at a time when consumers are expected to shift to more sustainable lifestyles.”

The combined effect of regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and public pressure will reshape how airlines talk about sustainability. Airlines now know that marketing slogans like “carbon-neutral flights” or “fly responsibly” can expose them to legal liability. The agreement does not mean airlines should stop promoting their sustainability initiatives, but rather that they should communicate measurable, verified progress rather than aspirational claims.

The initiative, named Project Speedbird, represents a joint development between LanzaJet and British Airways. Fluor will recognise the undisclosed contract value in the third quarter.

Mike Alexander, group president of Project Execution at Fluor Corporation, characterised Project Speedbird as marking pivotal advancement in global efforts to decarbonise aviation. He stated that by accelerating adoption of sustainable fuel technologies, the project will help redefine the future of flight, with Fluor proud to bring engineering and design expertise to the visionary initiative.

The project will leverage LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to transform second-generation ethanol, sourced from agricultural residues and woody biomass, into sustainable aviation fuel. British Airways will utilise this SAF to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 230,000 tonnes annually, equivalent to emissions from 26,000 domestic flights.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, stated that Project Speedbird represents the next commercial-scale facility in LanzaJet’s development portfolio, working closely with British Airways. He characterised it as an important step in continued scale-up of the company’s leading sustainable fuels technology. Samartzis noted that partnering with globally recognised engineering, procurement, and construction company Fluor Corporation demonstrates commitment to highest standards in project execution.

Located in Teesside, UK, the facility will produce more than 90,000 tonnes (30 million gallons) of SAF and renewable diesel annually. The site was selected for strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and access to skilled workforce.

Front-end engineering and design establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, site layouts, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions and subsequent detailed engineering for construction. FEED work bridges conceptual design and full engineering, procurement, and construction execution, addressing technical uncertainties and refining project scope.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology converts ethanol into jet fuel through catalytic processes producing hydrocarbons meeting aviation fuel specifications. The technology’s use of second-generation ethanol derived from agricultural residues and woody biomass addresses sustainability concerns about first-generation biofuels competing with food production.

British Airways’ commitment to offtake the facility’s SAF production provides commercial foundation supporting project financing. Long-term purchase agreements from creditworthy airlines enable project developers to secure debt financing and proceed with capital-intensive facility construction.

The 230,000-tonne annual emissions reduction represents substantial carbon abatement for British Airways’ operations, supporting the airline’s decarbonisation objectives. Aviation faces limited near-term alternatives to liquid fuels, making SAF a primary pathway for emissions reduction whilst maintaining existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Teesside’s selection reflects the region’s industrial heritage, existing energy infrastructure, port facilities, and workforce with relevant skills from petrochemical and process industries. The UK government has supported development of low-carbon industries in Teesside through various policy initiatives and funding programmes supporting industrial transformation.

The facility’s dual production of SAF and renewable diesel provides operational flexibility and revenue diversification. Renewable diesel serves road transport markets, providing additional offtake opportunities beyond aviation applications. Production processes for SAF and renewable diesel share technological similarities, enabling integrated facilities producing both products.

Project Speedbird advances UK objectives for developing domestic SAF production capacity supporting aviation sector decarbonisation whilst creating industrial jobs and supply chain opportunities. The UK government has established mandates requiring SAF blending in aviation fuel, creating policy certainty supporting production investments.

The 90,000-tonne annual SAF production capacity represents meaningful scale for European markets, where SAF availability currently falls well short of demand created by regulatory mandates and airline sustainability commitments. Commercial-scale facilities like Project Speedbird prove essential for closing this supply-demand gap.

Fluor’s role in FEED positions the engineering firm for potential EPC contract award following final investment decision, though FEED contracts don’t guarantee subsequent construction phase awards. The company’s project execution expertise in process industries supports complex facility development requiring integration of novel technologies with proven engineering practices.

LanzaJet operates the world’s first ethanol-to-SAF production facility in Georgia, United States, providing operational experience informing subsequent project development including Project Speedbird. Scaling from demonstration to multiple commercial facilities requires proven technology, experienced partners, and creditworthy offtake agreements—elements converging in the British Airways partnership.",https://storageterminalsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LJ-FPF-Approved-18-scaled-e1762763461613.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 13:01:48.047769

The vast majority-71.74%-traveled by car last year. While owning and driving cars will continue to be a fundamental mode of transport for the foreseeable future, Thanksgiving traffic might look much more sustainable in the not-too-distant future, CANOPY reports.

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

About the GBTA Foundation The mission of the GBTA Foundation, the US 501c3 charitable arm of the Global Business Travel Association, is to help the global business travel industry create a positive impact and better future for people and the planet.","Hamburg, Germany ─ The GBTA Foundation, the cause-led arm of the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), today released the second-year findings from its Sustainability Acceleration Challenge, a global benchmark assessing the state of corporate action to decarbonize business travel programs.

Input from 285 companies across the globe – representing an annual business travel spend of $22 billion USD – reveals that companies are still committed to tracking and managing carbon emissions from their employee travel programs, with measurable gains in maturity and more organizations joining the effort. Progress, however, remains limited in certain high impact areas, underscoring the need for faster, collective action to invest in low-carbon travel solutions.

Year two of our benchmark shows real engagement and growing commitment. But despite progress, greater urgency is needed. To future-proof business travel, companies must accelerate adoption of sustainable procurement practices and carbon management strategies to send a real signal to the market. Delphine Millot, Senior Vice President, Advocacy and Sustainability, GBTA, and Managing Director, GBTA Foundation

The 2025 results from the global benchmark developed in collaboration with Accenture were released today at the GBTA + VDR Europe Conference in Hamburg and can be downloaded here.

Key findings from the 2025 GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge include:

Participation continues to grow: 285 companies participated in the 2025 assessment, marking a 20% increase compared to 2024. Across the two years, participants represent approximately $31 billion in annual business travel spend and include one-quarter of BTN’s Top 100 corporate travel programs.

Incremental maturity gains: The global average score is now 1.4 compared to 1.3 in 2024 (out of a maturity scale from 0 showing “no activity” to 5 being “leading practice”), reflecting limited overall improvement.

Regional shifts: Global and APAC travel programs improved slightly, while regional and local programs in Europe and North America dipped marginally, likely due to regulatory changes and economic uncertainty.

Program size correlation: Smaller (<$5M) programs have made notable progress this year, while the largest (>$500M) programs have regressed overall, perhaps demonstrating that while companies under intense public scrutiny may be slowing their sustainability efforts, smaller companies may be using sustainability leadership as a way to differentiate themselves.

Leading industry sectors: The Financial, Banking and Insurance sector continues to lead (maturity score of 1.9 out of 5), followed by the Professional Services and Consulting sector (score of 1.7). These sectors traditionally have a large share of their emissions coming from their business travel programs.

Where companies are making progress:

Cost-positive sustainable practices are accelerating. Sustainable Travel Policies (2.2 score in 2025 versus 1.8 score in 2024) and Carbon Budgets (0.7 score in 2025 versus 0.5 score in 2024) show strong year-over-year improvement.

Reporting and targets setting are becoming standard. Reporting (2.7 score in 2025 versus 2.1 score in 2024) and Targets Setting (1.7 score in 2025 versus 1.4 score in 2024) are increasingly built into travel programs – although the largest companies show some regression.

Where acceleration is urgently needed:

Shaping travel decisions. Tools that influence booking choices – Carbon Fees (score of 0.4 in 2025) and OBT (online booking tool) Features (score of 2.4 in 2025), have stalled. Embedding these mechanisms is key to enforcing sustainable travel policies.

Sending a unified demand signal: While supplier sustainability assessments are increasing, advanced levers such as the GBTA Sustainable Procurement Standards and sustainability clauses in Contracting (score of 1.2 in 2025), show no movement – likely hindered by limited guidance and technology enablement.

Investing in emissions abatement: The use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) to decrease emissions from business travel is growing (15% of corporates purchasing SAF certificates in 2025, up from 12% in 2024), but adoption remains low. Corporates can leverage GBTA SAF Corporate Connect for best practices on SAF implementation.

The GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge provides a roadmap for the future. With more companies participating, we’re seeing where the industry is moving forward, and where further collaboration can close the gap between ambition and action.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location.
This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.
Alfanar UK country head, Noaman Al Adhami, said: “The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.
Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.","Global project development, manufacturing and engineering group Alfanar has confirmed a move to a larger, more enhanced site for its Lighthouse Green Fuels (LGF) SAF project. During a keynote to aviation leaders at the Airlines 2025 conference in London, UK Country Head of Alfanar Noaman Al Adhami also unveiled a new dedicated brand and website for LGF – LGF Projects Ltd – which is wholly owned by Alfanar.

The £2 billion (€2.28 billion) LGF project will convert 1.5 million tonnes of sustainably sourced biomass feedstocks – including forestry, sawmill, and agricultural residues in line with the UK SAF Mandate – into more than 180 million litres of second-generation SAF, offsetting the equivalent carbon emissions of 4,500 transatlantic flights from London to New York.

The new site in Seal Sands, on land where the former INEOS Nitriles facility was located, sits just 500 metres from the previous Billingham location.

It offers closer access to critical infrastructure, including rail and shipping links, and enables the entire conversion process to take place on one site, from feedstock pre-treatment to storage.

It is also even closer to carbon capture and storage infrastructure, providing the opportunity for seamless integration into the network when online. This would enable SAF to be produced with a 200% lifecycle emissions reduction compared to conventional jet fuel – enough to meet 11% of the UK’s 2030 SAF Mandate.

Alfanar UK country head, Noaman Al Adhami, said: “The move to our new site means we are now even better placed to become a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production. Our project was already the most advanced dedicated SAF project in the UK, and the largest of its kind anywhere in the world.

“This relocation drives further operational and supply chain efficiencies and means we are better placed to increase production capacity in the future once the first phase of the project is underway.”

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, who visited Alfanar’s London HQ, said: “Teesside is leading the charge in the industries of the future, and Alfanar’s £2 billion investment to build the world’s biggest sustainable aviation fuel plant of its kind is a clear sign of that leadership.

“We’re proud to welcome further enhancements to this landmark project, which will bring thousands of top-quality jobs and opportunities for local firms. Having a project of this scale built right here shows what we already know - that Teesside has the people, skills and drive to deliver groundbreaking projects like this.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lighthouse-Green-Fuels-pic-Biofuel-10-11-768x432.png,N,,2025-11-10 11:00:24.624877

The start of these fuel deliveries in October marked the company’s second and third deployments of blended SAF at a major U.S. airport in six months. In May, FedEx announced its first major U.S. SAF deployment at Los Angeles International Airport.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help to scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by the early signs of increased SAF production globally this calendar year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a blend to include a total of 1 million gallons of neat SAF at a minimum 30% blend from Air bp. With its first fuel delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at Chicago-O’Hare International Airport.*

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis added.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started to take delivery of around three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% blend minimum from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and demonstrates to our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in countries like Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we’re embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and actively contributing to the corporation’s global sustainability strategy.”

SAF: Part of a holistic aviation sustainability strategy

Under current fuel standards, neat—or unblended—SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use in an engine. Blended SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning airlines do not need to make changes to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure to use it. By 2030, FedEx aims to obtain 30% of its fuel supply from alternative sources, on a blended basis.

Deploying SAF is just one component of a broader FedEx aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. Though the emissions profiles of SAF and traditional jet fuel are similar when burned, the production of sustainable aviation fuel can result in up to 80% fewer lifecycle emissions compared with the extraction of conventional fuels.^ However, this technological reality means that reducing overall fuel consumption and increasing operational efficiency must go hand-in-hand with alternative fuel uptake in order to reach emissions goals as an industry.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel savings initiatives enabled FedEx to avoid the use of 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, resulting in $400 million in savings for the company. In FY 2024, FedEx achieved its previous goal of a 30% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. Upping its ambition, FedEx has since expanded that goal to target a 40% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity by 2034.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment.
Germany is one of the largest aviation markets in Europe, yet it has underperformed in comparison to other major ones.
*Austrian, Cargolux, Chair Airlines, Condor, Discover Airlines, Edelweiss Air, European Air Transport, Eurowings, German Airways, Hahnair, Lufthansa, Lufthansa Cargo, Lufthansa CityLine, Luxair, SWISS, TUIfly.","In a post-pandemic context with flaring geopolitical tensions, growing regulatory challenges, as well as intensified efforts to deliver on aviation’s Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment, we interviewed Mathias Jakobi, who oversees Central Europe (Austria, Germany, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, and Switzerland), and serves all our member airlines* in these markets to share firsthand insights on the short and medium-term prospects for the cluster.

How has policy focus evolved in your markets since the pandemic?

Location cost for airlines have increased dramatically, particularly in Austria and Germany. In Vienna, for example, the increase between 2019 and 2024 nearly reached 80%! The German aviation tax rose 25% in May 2024 and January 1, 2025, aviation security fees increased up to 50%. The excessively high fees represent the main reason why air traffic recovery massively lags other European countries. This development is extremely worrying. Connectivity is essential for economic growth. According to earlier research conducted by IATA and Oxford Economics among EU countries, a 10% increase in the level of connectivity, relative to the GDP size, can increase long-run GDP by 1.1%.

In 2013, Germany ranked first among all European countries in terms of air connectivity – that is, passenger capacity weighted by the economic importance of all served destinations. Since then, both the United Kingdom and Spain have overtaken Germany.

Austria has also slipped in recent years. In 2014 it was ranked 27th, compared to 33rd in 2024.

Switzerland – comparable in size to Austria – ranked 22nd in 2014 and 2024.

It is important to stop and reverse these negative trends. The importance of air transport for societies and economies is vital. In Germany, around 400,000 people work directly in the aviation sector, 50,000 in Austria, 66,000 in Switzerland, and 8,5000 in Luxembourg. These are impressive figures! Air transport connects the world, building important bridges to other countries and cultures. It is also critical for trade, as the rapid transport of important production goods is an indispensable location factor.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment. What updates can you provide from your markets, notably on the required sufficient availability and ‘affordable’ pricing, as well as the book and claim system?

Since 1st January 2025 there has been a blending mandate of 2% SAF in Europe. The positive message is that the airlines will fulfill this mandate, despite the challenges of SAF inaccessibility in many airports, and high prices.

Germany has always showed a penchant for eSAF. A few months back, the world’s largest Power to Liquid (PtL) plant from Ineratec opened in Frankfurt. While this is promising, its yearly kerosene production does not suffice to operate a single flight from Frankfurt to Palma de Mallorca. Regarding eSAF, availability is scarce. Regulators must not ignore this fact. In Germany, a law in place requires a PtL sub-quota from January 1, 2026. Absurdly, airlines are thus legally obliged to buy a product which practically does not exist. A few weeks ago, the Federal Ministry of the Environment informed the aviation industry that the law would not be enforced – far too late.

Switzerland is also quite active in non-fossil SAF R&D – Metafuels/Evos and Synhelion, just to name two promising projects. The country has introduced the same SAF mandates as in the European Union, effective 1st January 2026.

The Austrian fuel producer OMV produces biogenic SAF in Vienna, and are currently building a large plant in Romania, where 250,000 tons of fuel will be produced annually from 2028, the delocalization being mainly cost-driven, with overall costs in Central Europe too high.

Despite excellent research and pioneering projects, industrial scale production will not see daylight in Central Europe. A “Book and Claim” of “SAF Accounting” system would facilitate SAF purchase anywhere worldwide for our airlines. It should be politically supported and quickly introduced.

In past years, we have been witnessing increasing greenwashing measures from Governments. What actions have you or will you put in place to counter this trend?

Germany and Austria have new governments in place since spring, both of which have a much better understanding of air transport and its benefits. However, half of parliament members are new, requiring us to expose and explain this value. IATA is known for fact-based discussions and industry expertise, offering extensive data and economic reports for leading politicians and key stakeholders. This includes policy recommendations developed for Germany and Austria, where our Association plays an active role as member of the governmental SAF working groups in support of the sustainable transition.

Germany is one of the largest aviation markets in Europe, yet it has underperformed in comparison to other major ones. How do you explain it, and what can be done to address this?

The location cost increase is extremely harmful, lowering airline competitiveness. Comparing 2024 with 2019 (pre-pandemic), domestic flight connections have plummeted an astonishing 50%. Outside major hubs such as Frankfurt and Munich, the situation is even more dire, reaching declines of up to 75%! Many airlines are withdrawing their aircraft from Germany to operate from more economically favorable locations instead. This is detrimental to connectivity and mobility in the country and is already leading to job losses. Aviation bears a very high tax burden that other transport modes do not have. In 2024 alone, the aviation tax amounted to more than €2 billion Euro.

Aviation needs fewer, not more, government-induced burdens to avoid further widening the gap with the competition. Specifically, this means:

abolition of aviation taxes in Austria and Germany. More taxes mean less value creation in the countries, and the endangerment of many thousands of jobs;

reduction of air traffic management costs;

reduction of security costs and other state location costs, to reach competitive levels again.

Those flying in premium cabins will pay between S$4 and S$41.60.
“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.
Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.
The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds.","SINGAPORE, Nov 10 — Passengers departing from Singapore will soon be footing part of the bill for the country’s shift to greener skies, with a new levy of between S$1 (RM3.20) and S$41.60 to support the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), The Straits Times reported today.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced today that the charge will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from October that year.

The levy, which airlines must list as a separate line item on air tickets, will be based on flight distance and travel class — with business and first-class passengers paying up to four times more than those in economy.

For economy or premium economy travellers, the levy will range from S$1 for a flight to Bangkok to S$10.40 for one to New York. Those flying in premium cabins will pay between S$4 and S$41.60.

CAAS said the charges were lower than previously forecast due to a drop in green jet fuel prices.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.

The roll-out is timed to give airlines and travellers room to adapt, according to CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

“If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond October 1, 2026,” he said.

The fee will also not apply to transit passengers, training flights or humanitarian operations.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Despite volatile fuel prices, Han said the levy will remain fixed until the SAF target changes.

The levy will come on top of existing airport fees, bringing total charges for an economy passenger flying to New York to S$75.60 in 2026, and S$106.80 for a premium passenger.

Changi’s current S$65.20 passenger fee is set to rise gradually to S$79.20 by 2030 to help fund airport upgrades and higher operating costs.

The new charge will also apply to cargo shipments, private jets and chartered flights, with rates adjusted for aircraft size and distance.

The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds. The fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied at both of Singapore’s airports.

Under the country’s sustainable air hub blueprint launched in February 2024, the government and industry aim to cut airport emissions by 20 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030 and reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.",https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2025/11/10/309079.JPG,N,,2025-11-10 09:17:07.015747

“The next generation of aviation is now real that people can see it.
The supply chain and the infrastructure around aerospace hasn’t recovered as quickly as anyone would have would have hoped.
Flying in formation At the same time, other aviation investors are clubbing together to invest in capital-heavy areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.
Sees.ai recently raised a £3.65m round from investors including Boeing and Hearst Ventures.","It is the best of times and the worst of times for aerospace innovation. On the one hand, the pace of innovation is rapid, with electric air taxis such as Joby moving closer to safety certification and drone developments accelerated by warfare. At the same time, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, still recovering from the after-effects of the covid pandemic, are working on precarious finances and are ill-placed to make heavy bets on their innovation arms.

“Aerospace is in that transformational stage,” says Nichola Bates (pictured, above), founder of XeleratedFifty, the innovation and investment group that recently spun out of aerospace company Boeing. “The next generation of aviation is now real that people can see it. We can see drones and air taxis flying around. It’s actually real. Financial investors are saying, ‘okay, now it’s ready for us’. I think we’re in that stage where these new things are growing, and there is potential to be really disruptive.”

But it is hard to focus on innovation when more immediate business issues need attention. “The recovery from covid has been a lot more difficult than expected. The supply chain and the infrastructure around aerospace hasn’t recovered as quickly as anyone would have would have hoped. All of that leads to a different focus. The fear around the bottom line becomes more acute,” says Bates.

Both JetBlue and Boeing have posted heavy losses – JetBlue reported a net loss of $208m in the first quarter of this year, while Boeing posted a loss of $11.8bn in 2024. Both companies’ innovation arms spun out to become independent operations earlier this year.

Bates took the startup accelerator and investment programme she had built at Boeing outside the organisation earlier this year, making it into a part of FiftyGroup, an investor in the industrial sector. The move came soon after JetBlue Ventures, headed by Amy Burr, spun out of US airline JetBlue, turning it into part of aviation investor Sky Leasing.

Flying in formation

At the same time, other aviation investors are clubbing together to invest in capital-heavy areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.

United Airlines Ventures set up a sustainable aviation fuel fund that has brought in money from more than 22 external investors, providing extra firepower and a measure of independence to the fund.

Another group of airlines linked to the Oneworld Alliance, including American Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and International Airlines Group (IAG), parent company of British Airways, have jointly backed a $150m SAF fund that will be managed by venture capital firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

“Any individual airline’s CVC faces an uphill battle when investing in deeply technical sectors like SAF. Seed investments in this sector are completely a different proposition to something like software, they are much more capital intensive,” says Matt Ridley, director of sustainability and innovation at IAG.

“A single CVC team can’t hire 10 SAF specialists, but by investing together we can draw on a talent pool that effectively gives us that.”

Investing through an external fund run by a third party also allowed the investments in SAF, which require a long-term capital commitment, to be protected from short term priority shifts at the airlines.

“CVC investing can also be subject to pendulum swings, alternating between almost total independence and being closer to the core corporation. Having seven or eight airlines oscillating between different degrees of strategic and financial focus in the investments wouldn’t have allowed the same kind of long-term benefit. Investing through this fund insulates the decision-making on investments from those corporate swings,” says Ridley.

Taking a broader approach

While these moves — spinning out or investing together — have been responses to constrained budgets, they can also be an opportunity to broaden the scope of the investment team’s activities.

“The restrictions are gone now,” says Bates. Her team — which had a heavily hands-on approach in helping startups build and scale their businesses — had always fielded requests from companies in other sectors to deliver projects for them.

“There was such a crossover in the companies that we worked with, whether it was from the aerospace, oil and gas, or automotive sectors, we were always asked if we could do this for them. We could only do that if it was a strategic benefit to Boeing. Now we don’t have that restriction. We can work across different verticals, which is really positive.”

Bates and her team supported more than 40 startups in 14 countries while part of Boeing, including supporting Sees.ai, a company developing autonomous drone inspections for critical national infrastructure such as power lines, pipelines and railways. Sees.ai recently raised a £3.65m round from investors including Boeing and Hearst Ventures.

But now Bates is seeking to apply the model to other sectors such as energy, defence, space and shipping. “We’re looking for things that can be really transformational to these hard to disrupt industries,” she says. “The reality was that there are things that I could do at Boeing because of that profile, that platform, the access that [that brand] gives you. However, it needs to be bigger. It doesn’t happen with one organisation. It takes a community to come together, to really start pushing forward,” says Bates. “My dream for this was always that we build that neutral platform where organisations can come together.”

Benefits for outside collaborators

There are benefits, too, for the outside groups working with these corporate investors.

“For Breakthrough the benefit is that you have customers representing about a third of the 2024 SAF market in this fund and you get all the strategic benefits of that. The potential customers of SAF are all in this fund,” says Ridley.

Meanwhile, for London-headquartered Fifty Group, the addition of XeleratedFifty brings more early-stage investment capability to an organisation that has typically invested in much later-stage financing and large infrastructure projects that can take decades to realise.

“The LPs that they’re working with are all very excited about now having us support what they’re trying to do at earlier stages, helping them identify the innovation coming through. We are making sure that they’re innovative and challenging them with some of the things that we’re seeing in the portfolio. We’re holding their feet to the fire to say, here’s how the technology has changed the 10 years since you started this project,” says Bates.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/10/Nichola-Bates-airline-background.png,N,,2025-11-10 09:17:37.453657

The initiative, named Project Speedbird, represents a joint development between LanzaJet and British Airways. Fluor will recognise the undisclosed contract value in the third quarter.

Mike Alexander, group president of Project Execution at Fluor Corporation, characterised Project Speedbird as marking pivotal advancement in global efforts to decarbonise aviation. He stated that by accelerating adoption of sustainable fuel technologies, the project will help redefine the future of flight, with Fluor proud to bring engineering and design expertise to the visionary initiative.

The project will leverage LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology to transform second-generation ethanol, sourced from agricultural residues and woody biomass, into sustainable aviation fuel. British Airways will utilise this SAF to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 230,000 tonnes annually, equivalent to emissions from 26,000 domestic flights.

Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, stated that Project Speedbird represents the next commercial-scale facility in LanzaJet’s development portfolio, working closely with British Airways. He characterised it as an important step in continued scale-up of the company’s leading sustainable fuels technology. Samartzis noted that partnering with globally recognised engineering, procurement, and construction company Fluor Corporation demonstrates commitment to highest standards in project execution.

Located in Teesside, UK, the facility will produce more than 90,000 tonnes (30 million gallons) of SAF and renewable diesel annually. The site was selected for strategic location, advanced infrastructure, and access to skilled workforce.

Front-end engineering and design establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, site layouts, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions and subsequent detailed engineering for construction. FEED work bridges conceptual design and full engineering, procurement, and construction execution, addressing technical uncertainties and refining project scope.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet technology converts ethanol into jet fuel through catalytic processes producing hydrocarbons meeting aviation fuel specifications. The technology’s use of second-generation ethanol derived from agricultural residues and woody biomass addresses sustainability concerns about first-generation biofuels competing with food production.

British Airways’ commitment to offtake the facility’s SAF production provides commercial foundation supporting project financing. Long-term purchase agreements from creditworthy airlines enable project developers to secure debt financing and proceed with capital-intensive facility construction.

The 230,000-tonne annual emissions reduction represents substantial carbon abatement for British Airways’ operations, supporting the airline’s decarbonisation objectives. Aviation faces limited near-term alternatives to liquid fuels, making SAF a primary pathway for emissions reduction whilst maintaining existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Teesside’s selection reflects the region’s industrial heritage, existing energy infrastructure, port facilities, and workforce with relevant skills from petrochemical and process industries. The UK government has supported development of low-carbon industries in Teesside through various policy initiatives and funding programmes supporting industrial transformation.

The facility’s dual production of SAF and renewable diesel provides operational flexibility and revenue diversification. Renewable diesel serves road transport markets, providing additional offtake opportunities beyond aviation applications. Production processes for SAF and renewable diesel share technological similarities, enabling integrated facilities producing both products.

Project Speedbird advances UK objectives for developing domestic SAF production capacity supporting aviation sector decarbonisation whilst creating industrial jobs and supply chain opportunities. The UK government has established mandates requiring SAF blending in aviation fuel, creating policy certainty supporting production investments.

The 90,000-tonne annual SAF production capacity represents meaningful scale for European markets, where SAF availability currently falls well short of demand created by regulatory mandates and airline sustainability commitments. Commercial-scale facilities like Project Speedbird prove essential for closing this supply-demand gap.

Fluor’s role in FEED positions the engineering firm for potential EPC contract award following final investment decision, though FEED contracts don’t guarantee subsequent construction phase awards. The company’s project execution expertise in process industries supports complex facility development requiring integration of novel technologies with proven engineering practices.

LanzaJet operates the world’s first ethanol-to-SAF production facility in Georgia, United States, providing operational experience informing subsequent project development including Project Speedbird. Scaling from demonstration to multiple commercial facilities requires proven technology, experienced partners, and creditworthy offtake agreements—elements converging in the British Airways partnership.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:03.820947

The Tourism Authority of Thailand, in partnership with VietJet and PTT OR, has launched a groundbreaking Green Route flight between Bangkok and Phu Quoc, powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a significant step toward a more eco-friendly aviation sector in ASEAN. This collaboration is a direct response to the increasing global demand for sustainable travel solutions and Thailand’s ambitious goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. By introducing this SAF-powered service, Thailand is not only promoting responsible travel but also positioning itself as a regional leader in sustainable tourism. The Green Route flight aligns with the broader efforts of the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint, making this partnership a key milestone in the transition to low-carbon air travel.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has teamed up with VietJet Thailand and PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited (PTT OR) to launch the first-ever “Green Route” flight connecting Bangkok and Phu Quoc. This marks a milestone in Thailand’s aviation industry as the inaugural service on this route is powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership underscores Thailand’s commitment to advancing sustainable tourism and supporting the aviation industry’s transition towards cleaner, low-carbon operations throughout the ASEAN region.

VietJet Thailand’s move to incorporate SAF into its operations sets a significant example for the aviation industry. By launching the Green Route, the airline demonstrates its commitment to sustainability and responsible travel. The collaboration aligns with Thailand’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050 and showcases how aviation can contribute to promoting responsible tourism. With the Green Route flight, Thailand takes a meaningful step towards a low-carbon society while positioning itself as a leader in sustainable tourism in the region.

The inaugural Green Route flight took off on November 6, 2025, from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, with officials from the public and private sectors attending to mark the occasion. The ceremony included representatives from both the tourism and energy sectors, underscoring the cross-sector collaboration necessary to achieve long-term sustainability goals. By working together, these sectors are accelerating the transition to more environmentally responsible travel options.

VietJet Thailand’s Green Route flight is part of its “Fly Green” program, which aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. VietJet Thailand made history as the first low-cost carrier in the country to operate flights using SAF. The Bangkok–Phu Quoc route is the airline’s second Green Route, following the successful launch of the Bangkok–Da Nang route in 2024. This collaboration between VietJet, PTT OR, and Bangkok Aviation Fuel Services (BAFS) illustrates the airline’s long-term commitment to reducing emissions and embracing sustainable aviation practices.

The airline’s goal is to achieve a five-percent SAF blend across all its flights by 2030. The Green Route flights are a critical step toward reaching this target. Each SAF-powered flight on the Bangkok–Phu Quoc route will reduce CO₂ emissions by around 250 kilograms, resulting in a reduction of up to 80 percent in total emissions per flight. VietJet aims to cut over 153,000 tonnes of CO₂ within the next six years, contributing significantly to Thailand’s overall carbon-reduction goals.

VietJet’s Chief Executive Officer emphasized that the airline’s integration of SAF into its routine operations is a clear demonstration of its commitment to balancing business growth with environmental responsibility. He pointed out that this collaboration highlights the vital role that synergy between the aviation and energy sectors can play in accelerating the transition to greener, more sustainable travel. This initiative shows how strategic partnerships can help transform the aviation sector into a more sustainable industry, benefiting both businesses and passengers.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas. It adheres to ASTM D7566 international standards, ensuring it performs just like conventional Jet A-1 fuel without compromising on safety or efficiency. SAF offers a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, with the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Thailand is well-positioned to become a leading producer of SAF due to its abundant bio-based resources and growing circular economy infrastructure. With continued public–private collaboration, the production of SAF can be scaled up to meet both national and regional carbon-reduction targets, while improving cost efficiency.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand continues to advance sustainable tourism by promoting initiatives like the Thailand Tourism Awards, CF-Hotels, and the Sustainable Tourism Acceleration Rating (STAR). These programs guide tourism operators toward adopting greener practices and reinforce TAT’s mission to position Thailand as a responsible destination for eco-conscious travelers. The Green Route initiative between VietJet and PTT OR exemplifies how cross-sector partnerships can drive sustainable mobility and help enhance Thailand’s reputation as a global leader in low-carbon tourism.

Vietnam remains one of Thailand’s most important short-haul markets, with over 600,000 Vietnamese visitors expected in 2025. Travelers from Vietnam continue to visit Thailand for its cultural, leisure, and wellness offerings. With a growing interest in new destinations, TAT aims to strengthen its presence in the Vietnamese market by continuing to collaborate with airlines and digital travel partners. This collaboration includes initiatives like the Thailand Summer Blast campaign and the Krabi Prototype project, which focus on highlighting sustainable routes and certified operators under CF-Hotels and the Thailand Tourism Awards.

The Tourism Authority of Thailand, in collaboration with VietJet and PTT OR, has launched the first SAF-powered Green Route flight between Bangkok and Phu Quoc to support Thailand’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 and drive sustainable tourism in ASEAN.

At a briefing on 10 November, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said the new levy will be imposed on all passengers with tickets bought from 1 April 2026 for all flights departing from 1 October.

Singapore is the first in the world to impose a blanket levy on all departing flights, with the funds going towards bulk procurement of SAF.

The levy will cover not just passenger services but also cargo, as well as business and general aviation flights. It will also increase according to the distance travelled and cabin class of travel, states CAAS.

An economy-class (or premium economy-class) passenger travelling within Southeast Asia will pay a levy of S$1 ($0.77), while economy-class passengers travelling to the USA will pay an additional S$10.40.

Business- and first-class passengers travelling within Southeast Asia will be charged S$4, with the levy rising to S$41.60 for travel to the USA.

CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan says the levy is lower than previously indicated because the price of SAF has “moderated”.

“We are also giving time for passengers to adjust to the SAF levy,” Han says.

In 2024, the CAAS gave examples on how much the levy could cost: an economy-class passenger flying to Bangkok could pay S$3, while those flying to London could pay S$16.

For cargo flights, the levy will be imposed on shippers – instead of aircraft operators – with charges varying according to geographical distance. For example, for shipments to Northeast or South Asia, the levy stands at S$0.04 per kg.

CAAS says the levy for business and general aviation flights will be charged on a per-aircraft basis, based on distance travelled and aircraft size. Certain flights – including training and humanitarian flights – will not be subjected to the levy.

The imposition of the levy comes as Singapore targets a 1% uplift of SAF from 2026, with the aim of increasing it to between 3% and 5% in 2030.

In late-October, CAAS announced the setting up of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), a government-owned non-profit company that will oversee the acquisition and distribution of SAF, as well as implementation of the country’s SAF policies.

Han says Singapore’s procurement of SAF will be done with a fixed-cost envelopment model, where the levy – and the central funds – will be at a fixed rate regardless of the price of SAF.

Asked if the levy will be subject to regular review, Han points to the pricing model, noting: “[The] levy will be fixed in achieving this 1% [uplift] target, so we would… expect the levy to be fixed for [a] period of time. When [our uplift targets are] 3-5%… then the levy would have to be adjusted to achieve [the target].”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/6/5/113765_singaporechangiairportandjewelaugust2024_923771.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:14.005944

But the 42nd ICAO Assembly, held in Montreal over two weeks and concluding in early October, saw ­sustainability take something of a back seat to ­security, safety and geopolitical issues.

That perhaps says much about the agreements that have already been reached within ICAO, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) for aviation to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

“For the last four assemblies, it’s really been ­focused on climate change and sustainability,” says Haldane Dodd, executive director of cross-aviation industry grouping the Air Transport Action Group.

“We had CORSIA agreed in 2016, we had the long-term goal agreed in 2022. Those have all been adopted,” he adds. “We want to make sure they don’t get watered down in an assembly like this or that we don’t see any sign from governments of pulling away from that.

“And we didn’t. In fact, we saw a lot of support for the work ICAO has been doing, both on the policy framework vision-side as well as the capacity building and assistance to states to make sure they were ready to face these big challenges.”

Notably, ICAO in its post-assembly communications on sustainable development highlighted ­“unprecedented unity”, noting that all member states supported environmental resolutions without any reservations for the first time.

Both Dodd and Asia-Pacific Airlines Association director general Subhas Menon flag the ­significance of China’s approach, given it has previously ­expressed reservations related to the LTAG and CORSIA resolutions.

“They agreed to discuss with ICAO states on ­implementing CORSIA as well as the long-term ­aspirational goal,” says Menon. “They have become very much more collaborative than they were in the past. So that was a very important development, with China being such a big market.”

Menon also took encouragement from the ICAO Assembly as a whole. “There was a reaffirmation of the long-term aspirational goal, recognition that production of SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] is still not enough, and that governments will have to come up with enabling policies, as well as ensuring that the other elements of the roadmap – like technology – should also be ramped up. And [there was] a recognition that supply chain problems are also a drag when it comes to environmental goals.

“We left in a good position because China joined the party and there was recognition of some of the problems we are facing as an industry.”

However, Aoife O’Leary, founder and chief ­executive of environmental NGO Opportunity Green – which has a focus on sectors where emissions are not yet coming down – was less impressed. “The lack of acknowledgement of climate reality I found really discordant,” she says. “It’s very ‘well we have CORSIA so we couldn’t possibly push it or do anything else’, meanwhile talking down any efforts coming from anywhere else.”

Unsurprisingly, given its importance to achieving net-zero and the challenges around ramping up production, SAF remains a key concern within the industry – particularly next generation SAF solutions. States had in November 2023 at ICAO’s third Alternative Aviation Fuels meeting agreed a framework targeting a 5% reduction in emissions from aviation by 2030, with this endorsed at the assembly.

However, IATA says that while it expects SAF ­production to double this year, that will still account for less than 1% of aviation fuel. “We’re disappointed at the progress that has been made in relation to the production of SAF. It’s not where we need it to be,” IATA director general Willie Walsh said ahead of the assembly.

“The demand exists, and I think the evidence for that is the number of airlines who have entered into agreements for the future purchase of SAF. But we need to see greater production.”

One fresh development was the launch of the Finvest ETAF portal on the eve of the assembly. This is an initiative between ICAO and the International Renewable Energy Agency aimed at accelerating production of SAF by helping connect project developers with potential financers.

“The message I had for the assembly… is the urgency of setting the right policy environment for us to do the scale-up in an expedited way,” Dodd says. “I’m not massively concerned about the 2030 timeframe. My concern is more for the 2030-2050 timeframe. That scale-up is going to have to be really steep in terms of SAF supply, so the next five years are really crucial to make sure you’ve got the right policies in place to set the trajectory for where we need to get to in 2050.”

MANDATES INTRODUCED

This year has seen the start of mandates in both the EU and the UK. This has begun with a 2% SAF requirement of total fuel this year, with the threshold levels in both schemes rising – and ­crucially including initial requirements around SAF that is not produced from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), such as used cooking oil.

“This has led to a significant increase in fuel costs for airline operations in the EU and in the UK, but is not translated into a significant increase in the production of SAF,” complains Walsh.

IAG group sustainability officer Jonathon ­Counsell says: “We’re always very clear that ­mandates on their own will not deliver SAF investment. They ­create a demand signal, but you will not get ­investment on mandates alone. You do need ­complementary policy initiatives.”

South Korea in September announced the introduction of SAF requirements, which will make it mandatory for 1% of fuel on international flights to be SAF from 2027, rising to 3-5% in 2030. It is one of several countries in the region that have outlined SAF requirements. Menon though notes that such policies in Asia are “more about targets and governments coming up with the policies to provide the necessary SAF”.

INCENTIVE SCHEMES

Seoul’s SAF Blending Mandate Roadmap, for example, includes the creation of an industry-wide SAF Alliance to support development, as well as incentives and tax credits.

“We are seeing a lot more of that happening in the Asia-Pacific region,” says Menon.

CORSIA was one of the first major sustainability initiatives developed through ICAO, a global offsetting scheme agreed in the standoff when the EU pushed to include international aviation within its Emissions Trading System (ETS). When CORSIA was agreed, the EU limited the scope of aviation within its scheme to intra-European Economic Areas flights only.

Airline bodies have backed CORSIA as a means of avoiding a “patchwork” of regional schemes, but have flagged a lack of availability of CORSIA eligible emissions units (EEUs). IATA led the call for governments to issue letters of authorisation to help airlines access EEUs. IATA forecasts airlines will require between 146 and 236 million EEUs during CORSIA’s first phase from 2024-2026, but the current supply is limited to the 15.8 million credits made available by Guyana.

Environmental groups though criticise the ­effectiveness of CORSIA, which remains voluntary until 2027. Transport & Environment (T&E) and Carbon Market Watch issued analysis estimating that CORSIA will offset only 26% of EU aviation’s CO2 emissions by 2035 – because it is largely focused on aviation growth.

The effectiveness of CORSIA will come under renewed focus as the EU next year considers whether to extend the scope of aviation within its ETS to ­cover fights operating beyond Europe.

T&E and Carbon Market Watch argue that relying on CORSIA and not extending the EU ETS will cost Europe billions in lost revenues. Carbon Market Watch says its analysis shows a scope extension from 2027 could raise an extra €147 billion ($170 billion) by 2040.

ICAO says 130 states are now participating in ­CORSIA. However, that does not include key ­markets such as Brazil, China, India and Russia. And while there are more positive noises from China on ­CORSIA, there is unpredictability around the US ­approach under the Trump Administration.

Opportunity Green’s O’Leary questions whether the USA will actually implement CORSIA. “Under Trump I can’t imagine that scenario. For all the lobbying powers of airlines, I don’t think they are going to manage to get that through the US.” She says this adds to the reasons the EU should expand the scope of its ETS.

“Even though we have been talking about climate, which has been a public issue for at least 10 years, we haven’t done anything about aviation other than within Europe,” she says. “I’m hopeful that this time we might actually put international flights in the ETS. That is about a billion tonnes of CO2 a year, so a huge amount of emissions that you immediately start to regulate.”

Premium travel is also under the microscope after a group of countries, including Barbados, France and Kenya in 2023 established the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF). The task force has said it will conclude its work at November’s COP30 event in Belem, Brazil, with an announcement by its co-chairs on “options for implementing progressive international levies”.

US transportation secretary Sean Duffy, in a speech at the assembly, said that airspace was not something “to be monetised or leveraged as an economic cudgel”, adding that “new taxes and illegitimate user charges are not only at odds with ICAO principles” but would open up a domino effect of “disproportionate, unjust, or duplicative economic costs”.

These comments appear primarily directed at the GSLTF, opposition to which the USA outlined in a working paper submitted at the assembly – and which did not mention CORSIA.

Crucially, efforts to decarbonise aviation are set against political shifts in the net-zero debate, notably in the USA, whose Inflation Reduction Act policies have been lauded within the industry as a catalyst for sustainable aviation investment.

“There are some headwinds in this space and they are not just coming from governments,” says Dodd. “They are also coming from the traditional energy industry pulling back on their ­climate ­commitments. Some of the finance institutions have been pulling back on things they have been talking about on sustainability.

“We look at it from a fundamental perspective and that hasn’t changed. We know the science is telling us the climate is changing. We know as an industry we are going to continue to grow. So we need to have a response to that.”

ONGOING CONCERN

IAG’s Counsell adds: “The underlying problem doesn’t go away. This is not like a business fad. And I think it is very clear to us as a business that we will continue to address this problem. Politics is politics, it’s cyclical and we’ll ride through it. But you can’t deny the issue still needs to be resolved.”

While O’Leary is “pretty concerned” at the current political direction, she also believes these shifts are cyclical – pointing to it only being a few years since the Green Deal was the centrepiece of the European Commission legislative programme.

“For the climate, the science doesn’t change. So the longer we leave it, the worse it is. We are progressing – slowly, but surely. But we do need to speed it up,” she says. “I remain hopeful this is a phase and not a complete turn. But I guess that remains to be seen.”

How Oneworld-led initiative will fuel SAF advance

Moves led by Oneworld partners to establish an investment fund intended to kickstart development of next generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) signal that demand is there among airlines, executives say.

In September, Alaska Airlines and American Airlines announced they were cornerstone investors in the new fund, which is also supported by their Oneworld partners Cathay Pacific, IAG and Japan Airlines, plus Star Alliance member Singapore Airlines.

An initial $150 million allocation is being managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), a fund founded by Bill Gates and other business leaders to support less-pollutive energy technologies.

“[The initiative is about] making sure the next generations of technology are funded and available,” explains Oneworld director of sustainability and innovation Matt Ridley.

“This is an area Breakthrough has got 10 years’ experience of actually bringing technologies out of the university environment and then scaling them up,” he says. The airlines have already worked with BEV investments like propulsion developer ZeroAvia and SAF producer LanzaJet.

IAG group sustainability officer Jonathon Counsell points to the importance of tackling the longer-term supply of next-generation SAF, particularly given the feedstock limitations of first generation (1G) HEFA-based fuels.

“When we look out to 2050, industry targets are for around 70% SAF. It’s quite clear to us that only a relatively small proportion of that will come from 1G [SAF]. Therefore, you really do need to start catalysing development of 2G and 3G [SAF]. There’s no production of either of those anywhere today.”

Ridley adds: “I think it has already sent a message that airlines are serious about SAF, airlines are serious about backing the entrepreneurs and technologies that will bring this technology forwards. There are going to be others that join over the next few months… from Oneworld and from other areas.

“We’ve done the hard work putting the fund together, working on how it will work and what it will invest in. But this was never meant to be constrained to just Oneworld airlines – and I think Singapore Airlines joining really early on is testament to that.”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/8/7/113687_a350airchinacairteamimages_555578.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 09:18:19.734814

Just as importantly, ministers drew a line: no burning food crops, only fuels from real wastes, residues or new electrofuels (e-SAFs).
The fuels industry says aviation could be the new home for UK-grown ethanol.
The UK has a real chance to lead in advanced aviation fuels, especially electrofuels made from renewable power and captured CO2.
With a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill out for consultation, now is the moment to hold the line.","For 20 years the UK government has talked itself in circles about aviation’s climate problem while emissions kept rising. When a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate was set last year, it looked like a breakthrough. From 2025, fuel suppliers must start blending in cleaner alternatives, with the share growing over time. Just as importantly, ministers drew a line: no burning food crops, only fuels from real wastes, residues or new electrofuels (e-SAFs).

This is one of the climate policies the UK can genuinely be proud of, so no wonder industry is already circling to tear it down. It aligned with public common sense: flying should be greener, but at the same time never compete with food on our plates. While protecting crops like wheat and oats from fuel tanks, it gave investors confidence that the UK was backing genuinely sustainable and advanced fuels. Brussels reached the same conclusion, banning food-based fuels – and promoting eSAFs – for exactly the same reasons.

And the kicker? It was working. In just six months, cleaner fuels hit 1.3 per cent of supply, in some months spiking to nearly 3 per cent. The 2 per cent goal for 2025 will be met without any weakening, just as car makers once claimed electric quotas were impossible, till they smashed through them under the ZEV mandate. The truth is clear: tough rules deliver.

But before the ink was even dry, parts of the aviation industry – led by the likes of British Airways and Boeing – joined forces with the oil lobby, including Shell pushing to weaken the rules by demanding inclusion of food-based biofuels. After 20 years of empty promises, the risk is clear: if the UK government bends now, real progress will be dumped in favour of greenwash in the skies. What stalls change isn’t technology; it is politicians caving in to special interests who are desperate to keep the era of fake fixes alive.

Loud voices in the aviation and fuels sector insist today’s safeguards are too rigid. They warn that sticking to genuine waste oils and residues risks bottlenecks and higher prices. They argue that letting British farmers grow crops for fuel on “marginal” land or as cover rotations would add flexibility, smooth volatility and “diversify feedstocks” until e‑fuels arrive in scale.

We’ve seen this story before. The last time governments fell for the biofuels pitch, food crops were poured into car fuel tanks and global prices skyrocketed. The World Bank and OECD highlighted the contribution of crop-based biofuels. The UN warned of food riots as millions were priced out of bread and cooking oil. Families paid the price once and the danger hasn’t gone away.

Saying, “but these would be British crops” is no defence. Markets don’t reward patriotic intentions. Even with a 19 per cent tariff, almost half the bioethanol burned on UK roads last year was imported from the US undercutting local producers. Now the UK‑US trade deal swings the door wide open to 1.4 billion litres of tariff‑free American ethanol, equal to all the road bioethanol the UK uses. The fuels industry says aviation could be the new home for UK-grown ethanol. But what’s stopping US agribusiness giants from taking over there too? Once crops are made eligible, you don’t control who floods the market. And that also risks imports from countries where biofuels drive deforestation.

This isn’t just an environmental risk – it’s an industrial one. The UK has a real chance to lead in advanced aviation fuels, especially electrofuels made from renewable power and captured CO2. Projects including those already planned in Teesside and Aberdeenshire, backed by tens of millions in government funding, could anchor hundreds of skilled jobs and boost energy security in an age of volatile geopolitics.

But all of that rests on one thing: policy certainty. Increasingly, net zero is being twisted into a weapon used by parts of industry not to drive ambition but to roll it back. The moment ministers water down the rules to make room for crop fuels, the signal to innovators is clear: don’t waste your time competing with the cheapest, dirtiest option.

This isn’t just about perception, it cuts straight to government credibility on new industries. Britain claims it wants to lead in clean technologies, pulling in global investment, creating green growth and future‑proof jobs.

If the UK blinks first and defaults to the cheapest option of burning food, it will send a simple message to investors: we’re not serious. A country that can’t defend its own cornerstone industrial policy – the SAF mandate – won’t lead the energy revolution; it will watch others seize the prize.

And while ministers preach leadership, they’re quietly signing off the biggest wave of airport expansion in decades: Gatwick’s second runway, Luton’s capacity boost, and Heathrow’s long‑debated third runway. By the 2040s, aviation is set to be the UK’s single biggest source of climate pollution. Expanding airports with one hand while weakening aviation policy with the other isn’t leadership; it’s sabotage dressed up as growth.

If ministers want Britain to lead aviation’s future, the choice couldn’t be clearer. With a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill out for consultation, now is the moment to hold the line. Why shy away from a new industrial revolution when this country has the talent and the technology to lead it? Ministers must resist pressure to dilute ambition by including outdated biofuels and instead back cutting‑ edge e‑SAF. If we want national pride, let’s earn it through being bold, energetic, and leading the way to a stronger, more prosperous future.",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/11/10/adobestock_210884092_imresizer-800x418.jpg?1762771700,N,,2025-11-10 06:16:40.361633

Fuel Diversity: Ensuring Technology-Neutral SAF Support The issue of technological neutrality in SAF production support is considered a key factor in ensuring a diversified and scalable supply across Europe.","IATA Urges EU For Policy Coherence, STIP Enhancement And Immediate Book-And-Claim Implementation For SAF Supply

The release of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) by the European Commission was noted as a momentous stride in acknowledging the imperative need to accelerate the decarbonisation of air transport. This formal recognition by a key regulatory body was deemed significant, as it addressed several enduring systemic weaknesses that had been observed within the European Union’s existing aviation sustainability framework. While the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expressed welcoming sentiments regarding this progression, a clear message was simultaneously conveyed: supplementary, robust action is still considered essential for the successful achievement of the industry’s net zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal.

It has been formally stated by Willie Walsh, the Director General of IATA, that the acknowledgement of market challenges stemming from initial design flaws in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates was appreciated. Specifically, the persistent and substantial price gap between sustainable and conventional jet fuels, coupled with the need for strong, tangible investment support, were highlighted as pivotal areas where the STIP demonstrated positive recognition. The proposed extension of SAF support under the EU ETS, the consideration of tradable SAF and Book-and-Claim mechanisms, the simplification of operator reporting procedures, and the planned improvement of access to sustainability certificates through the Union Database (UDB) were all identified as constructive developments. Furthermore, the advancement of dual conformance for SAF under both EU RED and CORSIA was regarded as a crucial step toward fostering global regulatory harmonisation. The goal of this harmonisation is to ensure that fuels certified under one system can be recognised under another, thereby streamlining international operations and reducing administrative burdens for aircraft operators. This focus on global alignment is considered vital, given the inherently international nature of air transport.

Catalyzing Supply: The Urgency of SAF Book-and-Claim Mechanisms

The European Commission‘s formal recognition regarding the considerable potential of mechanisms that facilitate tradable SAF certification, including various Book-and-Claim options, was a particularly encouraging development noted by IATA. These mechanisms are explicitly intended to directly address the critical supply barrier that currently constrains SAF availability across many European airports. The challenge is primarily geographical, as SAF production facilities are not uniformly distributed across the continent, leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in distribution. The implementation of such a system is acknowledged as a vital enabler for attracting necessary investments into SAF production facilities, as it decouples the physical delivery of the fuel from the environmental claim. Investors are granted greater certainty when a mechanism exists to monetize the environmental attributes regardless of where the physical fuel is uplifted.

Market Structure: Prioritising Demand-Side Considerations

A central tenet for the successful materialisation of the STIP involves the appropriate acknowledgement of the role played by aircraft operators as the ultimate end-users of SAF. Giving due and prominent consideration to their operational and economic issues is argued to be a top priority. Airlines are the commercial driver for SAF production, and their financial viability must be protected as they take on the considerable costs of the energy transition. For aircraft operators to effectively plan the seamless integration of SAF into their daily flight operations, a market characterized by predictability and clear price transparency is an absolute requirement. This stable market environment allows for long-term planning, hedging strategies, and secure procurement contracts, which are essential given the massive capital investment cycles and high operational costs within the aviation sector.

Fuel Diversity: Ensuring Technology-Neutral SAF Support

The issue of technological neutrality in SAF production support is considered a key factor in ensuring a diversified and scalable supply across Europe. While the STIP does acknowledge the role that biofuels can play, it has been observed that the document continues to unduly prioritize e-SAF, with the primary reasoning cited being perceived feedstock constraints. E-SAF, or electro-fuel, requires significant renewable electricity and captured carbon, representing a crucial long-term pathway, but the current production capacity is limited. This specific approach is viewed with concern by the industry, which argues for a broader perspective that capitalizes on all available, certified SAF technologies.

A recent report commissioned by IATA on feedstock availability has conclusively demonstrated that Europe possesses significant untapped potential for sustainable feedstocks. This available resource base includes substantial advanced residues and various waste streams that can be ethically and efficiently converted into high-quality biofuels. Therefore, a truly technology-neutral approach—one that actively supports both biofuels and e-SAF—is deemed absolutely essential. This dual focus is necessary to maximize the full potential of all available SAF pathways, as every variant will be required if the ambitious target of 500 Mt in 2050 is to be successfully reached. Biofuels, derived from waste fats, oils, and agricultural residues, offer a more immediate scalability solution that can bridge the gap until e-SAF production reaches maturity.

Path to Net Zero: A Call for Coherent and Timely Policy

The International Air Transport Association stands prepared to engage constructively with the European Commission to methodically address the identified policy gaps. The paramount objective of this collaboration is to ensure that the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is ultimately transformed into a coherent, fully investment-ready framework that can deliver the necessary market certainty and volume of SAF required. This is a crucial partnership, as regulatory certainty is the bedrock upon which billions in private investment will be committed.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Air-Travel-8.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:16:58.805888

In particular, the sides discussed the construction of a plant for eco-friendly jet fuel production in Rudnyi, Kostanay region.

LanzaJet is the developer of the technology for producing environmentally friendly SAF from ethanol derived from various types of feedstock, including organic materials (grain, corn, potatoes, etc.). The future plant will have an annual capacity of 54,000 tons of aviation fuel and will process up to 100,000 tons of bioethanol per year. The company has already completed the feasibility study for the project.

The project aims to promote the development of “green aviation” and enhance value-added processing in the agro-industrial sector. The production of biofuel will also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with Kazakhstan’s climate and energy agenda priorities.

“President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has tasked us with creating an international air hub in Kazakhstan. Alongside expanding airports' capacities and building infrastructure, it is crucial to ensure the industry is supplied with high-quality, environmentally friendly jet fuel. We are ready to deepen cooperation, and the Government will provide comprehensive support for this project,” stressed Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov.

During the meeting, participants reviewed key aspects of the SAF production project in detail. LanzaJet’s leadership proposed establishing an integrated structure for jointly implementing the initiative.

Tickets with the levy included will be applied to those sold from Apr. 1, 2026 for flights leaving Singapore from Oct. 1, 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said on Nov. 10.

Levy paid to be itemised line on ticket

Airlines are required to state the levy amount as an itemised line on the air ticket sold.

Passengers will pay the fee together with the ticket price.

How much?

A passenger in economy or premium economy will pay a levy of S$1 for a flight to Bangkok (Band 1), S$2.80 to Tokyo (Band 2), S$6.40 to London (Band 3), and S$10.40 to New York (Band 4).

Premium cabins will see higher amounts charged.

Passengers in business or first class are set to pay up to four times more than those in economy class.

This is based on industry norms for calculating the carbon emissions of passengers in different cabin classes, CAAS said.

A passenger in business or first class will pay a levy of S$4 to fly to Bangkok, S$11.20 to Tokyo, S$25.60 to London, and S$41.60 to New York.

Geographical bands

Destinations around the world are divided into four geographical bands.

The levy amount goes up with each successive band, based on the distance travelled.

Band 1: South-east Asia

Band 2: North-east Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, Middle East, Pacific Islands and New Zealand

Band 4: The Americas

The levy paid for flights with multiple stops will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Projected levy higher previously

The current levy applied is lower than previously projected.

For economy class, CAAS estimated in early 2024 that a S$3 levy applied to short-haul flights, a S$6 levy for medium-haul flights and S$16 for long-haul flights.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” the CAAS director-general, Han Kok Juan, told reporters, according to The Straits Times.

Adjustment period

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore.

The start date from April 2026 is to give consumers time to adjust.

Buying a ticket now for a trip planned for after Oct. 1, 2026 will not see the levy included.

Sustainable aviation fuel

Singapore is targeting sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026 and is set to go up to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030.

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights, such as private jets and chartered services, departing Singapore.

The levy will be added on top of the S$65.20 fees that departing passengers pay when they start their trips at Changi Airport.

This fee applied during departure will increase from April 2027, reaching S$79.20 in April 2030, which is a 21 per cent increase.

Bhd., a joint venture between Malaysia’s PETRONAS, Italy’s Enilive S.p.A., and Japan’s Euglena Co., Ltd, has officially broken ground on a new biorefinery complex within the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Johor. Once operational in the second half of 2028, the facility will process up to 650,000 tonnes of renewable feedstocks annually to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO), and bio-naphtha. Feedstocks will include waste oils, animal fats, and residues from vegetable oil processing.

The project positions Malaysia as a key regional hub for advanced biofuel production at a time when Southeast Asia’s aviation and transport sectors are under growing pressure to decarbonize. The refinery will leverage PIC’s strategic location near major international shipping routes to distribute biofuels efficiently across Asia.

PETRONAS Executive Vice President and Downstream CEO Datuk Sazali Hamzah described the project as central to the company’s strategy of developing a “holistic bio-based value chain,” reinforcing PETRONAS’ ambition to become an integrated energy leader by the next decade.

For Enilive, the facility extends its global biofuel footprint, which already includes biorefineries in Italy and the U.S., and projects under development in Italy and South Korea. CEO Stefano Ballista said the new site would contribute toward Enilive’s target of over 5 million tonnes of bioproducts and 2 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030.

Euglena’s President Mitsuru Izumo highlighted the venture as a milestone in the company’s broader efforts to commercialize algal biofuels and expand decarbonization solutions in the ASEAN region. He noted that the project’s evolution reflects the “rapidly changing energy landscape” and the shared goal of advancing a sustainable energy supply chain.

Located within the Pengerang Integrated Complex—Malaysia’s largest downstream oil and gas facility—the new biorefinery will benefit from established infrastructure, logistics, and feedstock supply networks. The investment underscores Malaysia’s broader push to attract green industry development while positioning Johor as a regional leader in clean fuels manufacturing.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced today that the charge will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights leaving Singapore from October that year.

The levy, which airlines must list as a separate line item on air tickets, will be based on flight distance and travel class — with business and first-class passengers paying up to four times more than those in economy.

For economy or premium economy travellers, the levy will range from S$1 for a flight to Bangkok to S$10.40 for one to New York. Those flying in premium cabins will pay between S$4 and S$41.60.

CAAS said the charges were lower than previously forecast due to a drop in green jet fuel prices.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” said the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan at a press conference.

The roll-out is timed to give airlines and travellers room to adapt, according to CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

“If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond October 1, 2026,” he said.

The fee will also not apply to transit passengers, training flights or humanitarian operations.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Despite volatile fuel prices, Han said the levy will remain fixed until the SAF target changes.

The levy will come on top of existing airport fees, bringing total charges for an economy passenger flying to New York to S$75.60 in 2026, and S$106.80 for a premium passenger.

Changi’s current S$65.20 passenger fee is set to rise gradually to S$79.20 by 2030 to help fund airport upgrades and higher operating costs.

The new charge will also apply to cargo shipments, private jets and chartered flights, with rates adjusted for aircraft size and distance.

The announcement follows Singapore’s creation of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage fuel purchases using levy proceeds. The fuel will be blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied at both of Singapore’s airports.

These amounts are lower than initially estimated.

CAAS estimated in early 2024

that economy class passengers would incur a $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights.

This reflects the lower cost of the green jet fuel than when the initial estimates were made.

“Sustainable aviation fuel prices have since moderated,” CAAS director-general, Mr Han Kok Juan, told reporters at the press conference.

Those who fly in business or first class will incur a levy of $4 to fly to Bangkok, $11.20 to Tokyo, $25.60 to London, and $41.60 – the maximum amount – to New York.

Mr Han said the timing of the roll-out – for tickets sold from April 2026 for flights departing from October that year – is based on industry feedback, to give airlines and passengers time to adjust.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. It will also not be imposed on training flights and flights for charitable or humanitarian purposes, CAAS said.

With the levy applying only to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, Mr Ng said: “If you go out and buy a ticket today, the levy will not apply, even if you travel beyond Oct 1, 2026.”

Levy won’t be raised, even if cost of fuel goes up

Singapore’s target is for sustainable aviation fuel to form 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

The goal is to raise this target to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030, depending on global developments and the availability of the green jet fuel , which is mostly made from waste materials, such as used cooking oil.

It has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without costly modifications.

Mr Han said the levy amount will not change even if the price of sustainable aviation fuel goes up.

The amount will be relooked only when the current 1 per cent target is adjusted in future, he added.

The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption. Such fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

Mr Ng said the volume of sustainable aviation fuel that Singapore buys will depend on the prevailing prices of such fuel. “We’ll buy what we can afford... (using) the levy we collect,” he added.

The levy amounts, said CAAS, were calculated based on the volume of fuel needed to meet Singapore’s 1 per cent target for 2026, and the projected price of the fuel.

Mr Han said on Nov 10 he is “very confident” that Singapore will be able to secure a supply of fuel to meet its 1 per cent target.

The levy will be applied on top of a total of $65.20 in fees that departing passengers who start their trips at Changi Airport already pay. This fee will go up in stages from April 2027, reaching $79.20 in April 2030 – a 21 per cent rise .

CAAS and airport operator Changi Airport Group said in November 2024 that the increase in fees is necessary to

fund infrastructural projects and offset rising costs

in areas such as energy and labour.

This means that when the levy kicks in, a passenger travelling to New York in economy or premium economy class will pay a total of $75.60 in charges in 2026 . A business or first class traveller on that flight will pay $106.80 in all.

Levy also applies to cargo shipments, chartered flights

The levy will also apply to cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights – such as private jets and chartered services – departing Singapore.

The levy on cargo shipments is calculated on a per-kilogramme basis, and varies based on the distance travelled and according to the four geographical bands.

For general and business aviation flights, the levy is charged on a per-aircraft basis.

It will be determined by the aircraft’s wingspan, which serves as a proxy for aircraft size, CAAS said, and will be tiered according to the same four geographical bands.

The authority’s announcement on Nov 10 came nearly two weeks after it announced the

set-up of the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company

(SAFCo), which will buy and manage a supply of sustainable aviation fuel for Singapore’s air hub.

The SAFCo will use the levy collected from passengers to buy the green jet fuel, which will be blended with traditional aviation fuel and used to refuel planes at Changi and Seletar airports.

Under Singapore’s sustainable air hub blueprint, launched in February 2024, the Republic will work with the aviation industry to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels in 2030, and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/0805a512a78effad6a9ab3af9b80db68f35f0f32bf19187d6f9525ca9d41391e,N,,2025-11-10 05:16:57.626581

The levy will apply to tickets sold from Apr 1, 2026, for flights departing from Singapore on or after Oct 1, 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Monday (Nov 10).

This means that if a ticket is bought before Apr 1 for a flight departing after Oct 1, the levy will not apply. Likewise, if a ticket is bought after Apr 1 for a flight before Oct 1, there will be no levy.

All destinations from Singapore will be grouped into four geographical bands:

Band 1: Southeast Asia

Band 2: Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia and Papua New Guinea

Band 3: Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands and New Zealand

Band 4: the Americas.

Passengers travelling to Band 1 destinations will pay S$1 if travelling in an economy cabin, which includes economy class and premium economy, and S$4 for a premium cabin, which includes business class and first class.

Band 2 passengers will pay S$2.80 and S$11.20 for an economy cabin and a premium cabin, respectively.

Band 3 passengers will pay S$6.40 and S$25.60, and Band 4 passengers will pay S$10.40 and S$41.60 for an economy cabin and premium cabin respectively.

The levy will not apply to passengers transiting through Singapore. For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

The announcement of the levy amounts comes after CAAS said last month that it had set up a new entity to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and secure a more affordable and stable supply for Singapore and the region.

Levies collected from passengers will go into a fund used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel.

The airline will collect the levy and must display it as a distinct line item on the air ticket sold, said CAAS on Monday.

LEVIES COULD BE REVISED AS SUSTAINABLE FUEL TARGET SHIFTS

CAAS had estimated last year that the levy would be around S$3, S$6 and S$16 for a passenger in economy class travelling to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

The lower levy amounts announced on Monday reflect “the lower prevailing cost of sustainable aviation fuel compared to when the initial estimates were made”, said CAAS.

The levy amounts could be revised in future as Singapore’s sustainability fuel targets shift, said director-general of CAAS Han Kok Juan at a media conference on Monday.

Singapore aims for sustainable aviation fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

“When (the target) is 3 to 5 per cent, then the levy will have to be adjusted to achieve the 3 to 5 per cent,” said Mr Han.

“But insofar as we have set the target to 1 per cent (for 2026), the levy will be fixed regardless of the sale prices.”

He added that he expects the sustainable air fuel (SAF) levy to remain at the current level “for a few years”, before a review is done “some years down the road”.

When asked about the absolute volume of sustainable aviation fuel needed to hit the 1 per cent target, Mr Han said that the target will depend on the passenger volume for that period of time, and so an estimate cannot be provided now.

""The introduction of the SAF levy marks a major step forward in Singapore's effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,"" he said.

""It provides the mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.""

LEVIES FOR CARGO SHIPMENTS, GENERAL AND BUSINESS AVIATION FLIGHTS

A levy for cargo shipments is being set on a per kg basis and varies based on the distance travelled, following the same geographical bands as for passenger flights.

For Band 1, the levy will be 1 cent per kg, for Band 2 it is 4 cents per kg, 9 cents per kg for Band 3 and 15 cents per kg for Band 4.

The aircraft operator will collect the levy and must display the levy as a distinct line item on the air cargo contract.

For general and business aviation flights, which are civil aviation flights that operate outside of commercial airline services such as corporate aircraft and private jets, the levies are broken down according to their geographical bands and the aircraft’s size.

For example, for small aircraft such as a Cessna 404 Titan, the operator has to pay between S$40 and S$390, depending on the geographical band.

For medium- to wide-body aircraft such as the A310-200 or the B767-300, the operator has to pay between S$380 and S$3,900.

For very large, long-haul wide-body planes like the A380 or B747-8, the levy will be between S$630 and S$6,500.

Training flights and those for charitable or humanitarian purposes will be exempt from the levy.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--IJ0szXXq--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-06-30t133925z_1_lynxmpel5t0nn_rtroptp_3_emirates-aviation.jpg?itok=ie7M5mPe",N,,2025-11-10 04:16:35.157333

For cargo, the levy ranges from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogramme.

First announced in 2024, the levy is part of the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint for how to reach net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.

At a media briefing on Monday, CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan said: “As a global air hub and a council member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Singapore takes its environmental responsibilities seriously.

“We are taking firm, considered steps to play our part while maintaining the competitiveness of the Singapore air hub.”

The levy is higher for longer flights, as those consume more fuel. Destinations are categorised into four groups for simplicity and ease of administration, said CAAS.

For flights with multiple stops, the levy will be calculated based on the aircraft’s next immediate destination. Passengers transiting through Singapore will not face the levy.

For an economy or premium economy ticket, the levy ranges from S$1 for South-east Asia to S$10.40 for the Americas.

The levy for premium cabin travel – Business or First class – is four times that of economy class for the same area of travel. This is based on International Air Transport Association data for calculating carbon emissions of passengers in different cabins of travel, said CAAS.

These rates are lower than previous estimates by CAAS, as the price of sustainable aviation fuel has since decreased.

Airlines will collect the levy for passengers and aircraft operators will collect for cargo shipments. The levy must be displayed as a “distinct line item” in the air ticket or cargo contract, said CAAS.

Controlled cost

Besides commercial flights, the levy also applies to general and business aviation. General aviation refers to flights for private, non-commercial purposes including leisure; business aviation includes private jets or charters.

For these flights, the levy amount depends on the destination and size of the aircraft.

For example, a small aircraft like the Cessna 404 Titan flying to South-east Asia has to pay a levy of S$40, while a very large aircraft like the Airbus A380 flying to the Americas has to pay a levy of S$6,500.

Certain flights, such as training flights or those for humanitarian purposes, will not face the levy.

The levies collected will go into a fund for the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel or related offsets, and to cover associated administrative costs.

Unlike green fuel mandates or incentives used elsewhere, the levy works on a “fixed cost envelope”. It has been calculated based on the price of sustainable aviation fuel needed to supply one per cent of total fuel use for flights departing from Singapore.

“For example, in 2026, if (sustainable aviation fuel) prices were to change, the levy that we’ve announced earlier will remain unchanged,” said Han.

“If the sustainable aviation fuel prices are higher than what we have estimated, what it means is that we will be achieving slightly less than the one per cent target,” he added – as less fuel can be purchased using the previously estimated levy collected.

“The fixed cost envelope approach is important because it allows us to manage the cost, and it allows us to provide certainty to aircraft operators as well as to passengers. They know how much they are paying when they buy a ticket.”

CAAS will not review the levy annually, but will do so in the future after deciding on updated sustainable aviation fuel targets, said Han.

Singapore’s one per cent target for sustainable aviation fuel will rise to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030, subject to global developments and wider adoption of the fuel, he noted.

Turkey declared its desire to host the COP31 climate talks in June 2023 and, until now, Australia has insisted it had “overwhelming” backing for its bid.","Australia and Turkey are locked in a Mexican stand-off over hosting next year’s United Nations climate change summit.

The Albanese government wants to stage COP31 in Adelaide, but Turkey’s entry as a candidate has put increasing pressure on the leaders’ segment of COP30, which starts this week in the Brazilian city of Belém, to settle on a host.

The Herald’s advice to the Albanese government: walk away now.

These climate change conferences theoretically have the serious and noble intent of saving the planet, but high-minded ideals have been swamped by a crass commercialism that exists simply to drum up investment. They have been turned into trade shows and public relations opportunities.

The COP26 in Glasgow in 2021 is a case in point. Meant to be a serious gathering of world leaders and their negotiators, it was as though hijacked by a grotesque mix of rent seekers, hangers-on and political wannabes.

The vast majority of the 30,000 attendees did not need to be there. And some who did attend displayed a remarkably tin ear for climate change, with some 400 choosing to arrive by private jet. Then Prince Charles, a longstanding campaigner for the environment, was one of them, flying in from Rome, with Buckingham Palace assuring the media that he flew on a private jet using sustainable aviation fuel.

Australia began campaigning to host the COP after the Albanese government won office. The bid has been seen as a mechanism to increase Australia’s impact on climate diplomacy and strengthen ties with Pacific neighbours threatened by climate change and courted by China. The conference also allows Labor to display its climate change credentials as the Coalition continues to bicker on the issue.

Meanwhile, The Australian Financial Review reported that hosting the COP would cost $1 billion, citing government sources, and cabinet is known to be divided on the potential benefits and costs.

Belém is the 30th conference under the UN framework convention on climate change since it was signed at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and will focus on the developing world over the next two weeks. Even if delegates manage to sort out the impasse between Australia and Turkey, it will probably be too late.

Previously, host nations have had a couple of years to organise and rally international support for the sort of outcomes they hope will flow from the conference.

Turkey declared its desire to host the COP31 climate talks in June 2023 and, until now, Australia has insisted it had “overwhelming” backing for its bid. But Canberra cannot secure hosting rights unless Turkey withdraws, and it is now being forced to recalibrate its pitch to stage the conference at five minutes to midnight.

Even if Turkey threw in the towel, the short run-up makes it difficult for Australia to adequately prepare. And without all our ducks in a row, there is potential for embarrassment.

Better to let Turkey have it. It is clearly no longer worth the cost or the effort.

The facility will use Enerkem gasification technology to produce 240 KTA of methanol

Clariant will supply catalysts for feed purification and its highly active MegaMax™ for methanol synthesis

MUNICH, November 10, 2025 - Clariant, a sustainability-focused specialty chemical company, today announced its collaboration in Repsol’s pioneering methanol plant in El Morell near Tarragona, Spain. The Ecoplanta project will be the first of its kind in Europe to convert municipal waste into renewable methanol. The facility will operate using Enerkem’s advanced waste gasification process, supported by a range of Clariant’s syngas purification catalysts and its highly active MegaMax methanol synthesis catalysts. Scheduled for completion in 2029, the plant will use 400,000 tons of non-recyclable solid municipal waste annually to produce 240,000 tons of methanol.

Georg Anfang, Vice President Syngas and Fuels at Clariant Catalysts, commented, “We are proud to collaborate with Repsol and Enerkem in the prestigious Ecoplanta project to support Europe’s energy transition. Leveraging our decades of innovations in methanol synthesis catalysts, Clariant is uniquely positioned to drive the large-scale deployment of low-carbon methanol technologies that will play a decisive role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries.”

Michel Chornet, CEO of Enerkem, added, “We are excited to contribute to the Ecoplanta project and set an inspiring example for others on the path to decarbonization. Our technology not only enables large-scale production of low-carbon methanol and the reduction of waste in landfills but also avoids substantial greenhouse gas emissions. According to estimates, abatement will be equivalent to 3.4 million tons of CO2 in the first 10 years of operation.”

Founded in 2000, Enerkem is a global technology provider enabling the production of low-carbon fuels and chemicals from waste. Its solutions tackle the challenges of waste management and decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors, such as aviation, marine transportation, chemicals and off-grid energy.

Clariant’s catalytic technologies are perfectly suited to the Ecoplanta process. After gasification of municipal waste, the trap and guard catalysts will be used to efficiently remove all types of impurities, such as metals, halogens, and sulfur species. The purified syngas will then be converted to methanol using the MegaMax series catalysts. Due to its high activity, the catalyst can optimize methanol yield while significantly reducing operating costs. MegaMax also offers enhanced selectivity, which greatly reduces the formation of by-products and thus improves the sustainability and economics of bio-methanol production.

Renewable methanol offers a highly adaptable pathway to support decarbonization across a broad range of industries. It can be utilized as a drop-in fuel for maritime and road transportation and as a feedstock for chemical and sustainable aviation fuel production.

The company is guided by its recently launched Strategy 2030, marking a full year of an ambitious plan. CEO for Asia Pacific, Ken Lee, explains that the strategy focuses on harnessing key strengths such as a robust and resilient network, deep industry know-how, and a dedicated workforce. Simultaneously, it emphasizes proactive investments in infrastructure, digital transformation, and sustainability in order to capture opportunities in high-growth sectors.

Strategic Highlights

Strategy 2030 outlines five primary areas of growth: capitalizing on geographic advantages, targeting life sciences and healthcare, focusing on new energy, bolstering e-commerce, and enhancing digital sales. Additionally, it introduces a new “fourth bottom line” aimed at making DHL the preferred choice for green logistics, reflecting the company’s commitment to leading in low-carbon logistics.

DHL’s investments in infrastructure, including expanding air hubs in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur as well as modernizing the Air Hong Kong fleet, aim to increase resilience, enhance capacity, and offer seamless connectivity across its global network. These tangible improvements are reinforced by innovations in digital technology, robotics, automation, and strategic partnerships to increase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage and develop carbon-neutral facilities. These efforts have led to DHL being recognized as the first-ever Sustainability Advocate of the Year at the 2024 Payload Asia Awards.

Resilience amidst Global Trade Dynamics

Global trade continues to be influenced by changing supply chain patterns, geopolitical tensions, and economic uncertainty. However, DHL maintains a robust position as a logistics leader and trade enabler, underpinned by three core strengths: a complete portfolio spanning air, road, and ocean transportation; a presence in over 220 countries and territories; and a seasoned, committed workforce.

Lee acknowledges the uncertainty of the current trade environment but stresses DHL’s ability to navigate it, citing their agility and flexibility in adapting to shifting customer demands and trade regulations. This resilience bolsters DHL’s capacity to make bold, forward-looking infrastructure investments across the region.

Expanding Hubs and Modernizing Fleet

DHL’s role as a trade facilitator involves assisting customers in expanding internationally. This necessitates a network of hubs and gateways at critical airports, backed by service centers and state-of-the-art ground facilities. In recent years, DHL has consistently invested ahead of demand to accommodate rising shipment volumes.

Significant developments include the second expansion of the Central Asia Hub in Hong Kong in 2023 to meet growing shipment demand within and outside Asia. DHL also opened an expanded gateway in Kuala Lumpur and upgraded its South Asia Hub in Singapore. These improvements cater to expected growth from e-commerce and the region’s increasing importance as a global trading partner.

Additionally, DHL has modernized its fleet, upgrading the Air Hong Kong-operated fleet with 14 new A330 freighters and retiring the older A300-600 aircraft. Lee notes that companies are increasingly requiring their suppliers to diversify sourcing options to minimize operational risks, and this is where DHL’s expertise comes into play.

Operational Excellence and Customer Flexibility

DHL’s success is not solely defined by its physical infrastructure. The company is also deeply integrating advanced digital technologies into its operations to streamline workflows, enhance service quality, and create a safer, more efficient working environment.

In warehouses, AI-based tools and robotics platforms are reducing travel distances for staff and speeding up robot integration. Automated guided vehicles transport shipments and cargo pallets safely, improving productivity while relieving employees from strenuous tasks.

The introduction of On-Demand Delivery (ODD) offers customers the flexibility to reschedule contactless deliveries at their convenience. This not only optimizes operational and cost efficiencies but also enhances the overall customer experience.

Green Logistics and Decarbonization

DHL Express’ commitment to sustainability is evident in its recognition as the first-ever Sustainability Advocate of the Year at the 2024 Payload Asia Awards. With a clear target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, DHL is advancing initiatives such as fleet electrification, carbon-neutral building design, and scaling of SAF adoption.

However, the scaling of SAF does pose its challenges. Lee acknowledges that supply has not yet reached economies of scale, which is why DHL is investing in SAF and other areas that can significantly reduce GHG emissions. DHL is also aiming to electrify two-thirds of its pickup and delivery fleet by 2030, although progress in some markets is limited due to the lack of mature charging infrastructure.

Future Growth and Employee Contribution

Looking ahead, DHL is focusing on 20 markets worldwide that exhibit strong geographic and economic advantages, two-thirds of which are in Asia. These markets are expected to benefit from increasing domestic and foreign investment, reshoring, and nearshoring strategies.

Life sciences and healthcare logistics remain a top priority, with DHL expanding its Health Logistics division and strengthening its pharmaceutical capabilities. Growth in e-commerce, particularly in emerging markets, also shows no signs of slowing down. “With more SMEs turning to e-commerce to engage more customer segments, we continue to put resources into capturing these opportunities,” Lee says.

Lee emphasizes that DHL’s ability to execute these ambitious plans relies on its people. Hence, the company offers training programs to ensure staff alignment with DHL’s culture and equips them with tools for continuous improvement. Emphasizing the importance of employee contribution, Lee encourages team members to contribute ideas and solutions, thereby fostering a sense of ownership over initiatives.

Shaping the Future of Logistics

Beyond its network, DHL engages with partners, regulators, and governments to strengthen the logistics ecosystem. Lee underscores the importance of public forums, workshops, and seminars to identify sector challenges and encourage collaboration. Despite global uncertainties, Lee remains optimistic, attributing DHL’s competitive edge to the strength of its group and its presence in many markets worldwide.

Taking to the skies in its unmistakable white and orange aircraft, EasyJet is celebrating 30 years since its first ever flight from Luton Airport to Glasgow.

Since 1995, the budget airline has massively grown its business and brand – in part thanks to the TV documentary Airline.

""Few recent moments in travel have been more important than the explosion of mass travel, brought about by the rise of budget airlines like EasyJet,"" said Cathy Adams, travel news features editor of the Times and Sunday Times.

Former EasyJet pilot George Hibberd said although the company has ""done some good by making flying a lot more accessible for the average person, unfortunately that has come at a cost"" to the climate.

So what are the airline's big milestones, and where is it heading in the coming decades?

Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou founded EasyJet after carrying out research in the USA.

""I learned if you really want to make money in this area, you should start a low cost airline,"" he said.

He came up with the name by ""scribbling on a napkin"".

""I tried Stel-Air, CheapJet, Lite Jet, then the word 'Easy' came up and I thought, 'This is it',"" he said.

Making Luton Airport its base was ""a risky selection"" that paid off.

""Luton was considered in the middle of nowhere back then - we chose the cheapest of the London airports,"" he said.

Sir Stelios recalls the ""cold and wet November morning"" when EasyJet's first flight took off from Luton to Glasgow at 07:00 GMT on 10 November 1995.

At the time, the company owned one aircraft and employed 77 people.

Now it is the UK's largest airline with 356 aircraft, more than 1200 routes, and employs 19,000 staff – including 3,847 in Luton.

'Easy and simple'

Its fame grew through stunts such as the time its founder and friends boarded a rival's plane wearing EasyJet orange boiler suits, and the ITV series Airline.

""Letting the cameras in to a small airline - it was a free audience. That put EasyJet into every home in Britain,"" Sir Stelios said.

Jane Boulton, one of the stars of Airline, joked that the TV documentary led to the ""misconception that a lot of people missed their flight"".

""But it took a year to film six episodes.

""For the most part, we were having a great time with passengers – not telling people they'd missed their flight.""

She recalled the phone sales lines lighting up after each episode.

""Stelios is a very clever man, he couldn't have had a better marketing strategy,"" she said.

Ms Boulton remembers the heady days of working as EasyJet's check-in supervisor at Luton Airport.

""From the time the aircraft landed and took off again, we only had 20 minutes to get everybody off, people and bags back on, and refuel if necessary.

""Safety was always the priority. The passengers didn't know, but behind the scenes it was a hive of activity.""

She said the brand lived up to its name, as ""everything was easy and simple"".

""We didn't have printed boarding cards, we had plastic ones that we reused. It was much quicker to check in and board people.""

Ms Boulton said many other airlines were more ""prim and proper"", but EasyJet ""made it more casual"".

""We wore denim jeans and bomber jackets. I think they were the first of their kind.""

'Reshaped travel'

Cathy Adams said the rise of low-cost airlines like EasyJet had ""reshaped our expectations around travel"".

""I grew up in the EasyJet and Ryanair generation, where it was entirely normal to hop on £2.99 return flights to an obscure capital on the continent.

""Before budget carriers arrived, air travel was an elite pursuit for the very few, but now for millions it's possible to travel multiple times a year.""

MP for Luton South Rachel Hopkins agreed that cheap flights had ""made the opportunity to travel a real possibility for hardworking local people in Luton – when you could get a flight for less than a pair of Levi 501 jeans!""

Hopkins said it was ""a huge moment"" when EasyJet chose Luton as their base.

""They have grown significantly, becoming a key local employer in our town and providing thousands of job and apprenticeship opportunities,"" she added.

'Wrong flight path'

For all those celebrating, others are concerned that mass aviation has added millions of tonnes of excess carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

George Hibberd, 32, left his job as an EasyJet pilot to co-found Safe Landing, a community of aviation workers concerned about climate change.

""Aviation has connected cultures all around the world, it's a true gift.

""I'm glad it's no longer a privilege to fly, but the majority of emissions are made by a small minority of very frequent fliers.

""The direction the industry is going is on the wrong flight path,"" he said.

EasyJet emitted eight million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2024 – more than the total emissions of Albania or Sierra Leone.

It has launched a plan to reach net zero by 2050, admitting its ""operations are negatively contributing to climate change"".

However, Mr Hibberd said it relied too heavily on unproven technologies, and that planned passenger growth would cancel out any success.

""They're getting more efficient, but if you plot it against the projected growth overall, [emissions are] going up and up.""

He added that EasyJet's net zero pathway graph was ""quite misleading"".

""That downward line looks like their total emissions, but it's actually the 'emissions intensity' which is per passenger.""

Captain David Morgan, EasyJet's chief operating officer and one of their pilots, said: ""It's widely known that aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, because of the energy you need to power a commercial aeroplane.

He said the airline, which runs almost 2,000 flights per day in the summer, hopes to continue growing.

Having opened a new base in Southend in 2025, it will open ones in Newcastle and Marrakech in 2026.

""We're always looking to what's next, what places are popular - such as North Africa and Iceland. Markets are emerging all the time.

""Our mission is to be Europe's most loved airline,"" he said.

Currently, air and sea transport is largely fossil-fueled and accounts for more than one-quarter of all EU transport emissions. The Commission estimates that around 20 million metric tons of alternative fuels such as biofuel will be required by 2035 to meet green targets in those two sectors, which will require an extra investment of around 100 billion euros ($115 billion). The latest proposals will provide an additional 3 billion euros' worth of funding.

""The package is about strengthening Europe's competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future,"" said Apostolos Tzitzikostas, commissioner for sustainable transport and tourism. It showed, he continued, ""the Commission's firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport.

""Success will depend on close cooperation among member states, industry, financiers and civil society to turn this challenge into a strategic opportunity for Europe.""

The Euronews website reports that from 2035 onwards, EU airports should have 20 percent of their fuel supply coming from sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, which takes in products derived from things like used cooking oil or agricultural waste. Five percent needs to be another variant called eSAF, a type of synthetic fuel made from renewable electricity and others.

By the year 2050, the green share of aviation fuel should be 70 percent, of which half should be eSAF, but despite more than 40 projects of eSAF production being at various stages of planning, none is yet at a stage where a decision can be made about investment, and progress towards those targets is behind schedule.

The maritime sector is currently working towards a short-term target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from 2020 to 2025 by two percent, and by 2050, the figure is 80 percent.

Jim Corbett, the World Shipping Council's environmental director for Europe, said his group welcomed the investment, adding that it ""sets out a framework for financing to unlock investments and scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Now the strategy must be taken forward in ways that deliver real impact on maritime decarbonization"".

Sotiris Raptis, secretary-general of the European Community Shipowners' Associations, also responded positively, saying that the addition investment in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, or STIP, was ""putting investments in clean fuels at the center of the competitiveness agenda"", which could enable his group's decarbonizing ambitions to become reality.

""These investments are necessary for retaining industrial capacity, for enhancing competitiveness, for reducing energy dependencies and for getting to net-zero,"" he added.

FedEx (FDX): Valuation Through an Operations Lens After Moves in Sustainability and AI

FedEx has been busy. Early adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), upgrades to AI-driven operations, and a disciplined response to regulation are showing up in performance metrics and market sentiment.

The stock gained 9.2% in the past month and 14.9% over the last quarter. It's still down 4.4% year-to-date, but the three-year total shareholder return sits near 59.5%-clear payoff for patient holders despite short-term noise.

A widely followed view pegs fair value at $267.71 versus a recent close of $262.09-about 2.1% under. It's a tight gap, which says the market is watching execution more than headlines.

The Operating Levers Behind That Valuation

Structural cost-out: The DRIVE program targets $2.2B of savings in FY '25 and $4B versus the FY '23 baseline. That compounds into net margin gains if the cuts stick.

AI in the workflow: Smarter sortation, dispatch, ETA accuracy, and exception handling reduce rework and cost per stop. The bigger the network, the bigger the payoff from small accuracy improvements.

Sustainable aviation fuel: Early SAF adoption hedges against carbon costs and future rules. It also pressures competitors to catch up on fuel strategy and supplier contracts.

Regulatory posture: Proactive alignment with emissions and safety standards lowers surprise costs and keeps the network fluid under shifting rules.

What the Numbers Imply

Fair value marker: $267.71 vs. $262.09 suggests modest upside if cost savings flow through and volumes stabilize.

Margin setup: Structural reductions (not just headcount) are the difference between a one-off quarter and a durable reset. DRIVE points to the latter.

Sensitivity: Yields, fuel, and network utilization do most of the valuation work now. A slight miss on utilization can erase 2% quick.

Metrics Ops Leaders Should Track (and Act On)

On-time performance by lane and product (priority vs. economy).

Cost per stop and cost per piece (ground vs. air).

Sort productivity per labor hour and peak vs. off-peak variance.

Linehaul and aircraft utilization; empty miles and mix shift.

SAF blend percentage and per-gallon premium vs. conventional jet fuel.

Fuel surcharge lag and recovery rate.

Automation uptime (sorters, vision systems, robotics) and mean time to repair.

Exception rate, first-attempt delivery rate, and rework percentage.

Cycle time through major hubs and dwell time on trailers/containers.

Execution Risks (and Practical Mitigations)

Soft freight demand: Flex staffing, cross-training, and dynamic linehaul plans. Tie labor hours to real-time volume signals.

Key account churn: Quarterly ""red list"" reviews, executive coverage on top 20 contracts, and shared forecasting with customers.

AI model drift: Monitor feature drift, A/B guardrails, and rollback playbooks. Track ETA error bands, not just averages.

SAF supply and price volatility: Dual-source, long-dated contracts, and blend flexibility by lane.

Labor and safety: Ergonomics, near-miss tracking, and incentive structures that reward throughput without cutting corners.

Cyber and network resilience: Segment critical systems, run tabletop outages, and measure recovery time to SLA.

Operator Playbook: Convert Strategy Into P&L

Lock in DRIVE gains with standard work, checklists, and weekly variance reviews by site.

Put AI where it pays now: forecasting, dynamic routing, sortation sequencing, and exception prevention.

Clean the data: unique IDs, scan compliance, and event time-stamping. Bad scans cost more than slow conveyors.

Shift the air-ground mix with lane-level profitability, not averages. Kill sacred routes if they miss hurdle rates.

Stand up a control tower: one view of network health, with alerts tied to actions-not just dashboards.

Make SAF a sourcing program, not a press release. Blend targets, contracts, and unit economics in the same plan.

Why This Matters for Valuation

At a 2.1% discount to a widely cited fair value, the market is saying ""prove it."" The proof is operational: capture the $2.2B FY '25 savings, hold service levels, and keep capex disciplined.

If those hold while demand stabilizes, the spread can close. If freight stays soft or a major contract rolls off, the gap can widen fast.

What to Watch Next Quarter

Sequential change in cost per stop and sort productivity.

ETA accuracy and exception rate trend during peak windows.

Air-to-ground mix shift and utilization improvements in core lanes.

SAF blend percentage and any disclosed fuel cost deltas.

Since its introduction in the late 1990s, it has bridged the gap between the smaller 767 and the heavier 747, becoming the workhorse for major intercontinental routes. Airlines valued its balance of range, capacity, and operating efficiency, enabling nonstop links between continents with unprecedented reliability. Now, nearly three decades later, the industry is preparing to retire the type in favor of newer, more efficient successors. The question is which modern aircraft will inherit the 777-200ER’s global footprint.

The shift to these newer aircraft reflects the broader evolution of long-haul air travel. Passenger expectations have grown alongside environmental standards, forcing airlines to adopt cleaner, quieter jets. The 777-200ER set a high benchmark for dependability, but modern aviation requires higher fuel efficiency and shorter maintenance cycles. New materials, lighter structures, and digital systems now define success in this category. The following sections outline how each successor meets the needs of today’s airlines while respecting the legacy of Boeing’s original widebody workhorse.

A Legacy Of Long Range And Reliability

When Boeing introduced the 777-200ER in the late 1990s, it marked a new era of twin-engine intercontinental flight. Airlines appreciated its ability to operate ultra-long routes without relying on four-engine designs. It became a favorite for transpacific and transatlantic operations, offering impressive reliability and fuel capacity. According to Airliners.net, aviation enthusiasts and pilots consistently praised its balanced performance and ease of handling on long-range missions. This reputation solidified its place as one of Boeing’s most successful widebodies.

Over its service life, the 777-200ER was adopted by major carriers including British Airways, United, and Japan Airlines. The aircraft’s combination of high thrust and extended range allowed airlines to streamline operations and reduce fleet complexity. Passengers benefited from the cabin’s spacious layout and dependable schedules that defined early long-haul travel comfort. The aircraft’s twin-engine design became a proof point for ETOPS reliability across multiple oceanic corridors. Its commercial longevity shows how well Boeing balanced technology, performance, and passenger appeal.

Even so, aviation has moved on to a new generation of aircraft that prioritize sustainability and digital optimization. Airlines now favor widebodies that use composite materials and produce lower carbon emissions. The 777-200ER’s retirement from major fleets has opened the door for the 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A350, and upcoming 777X to take its place. Each successor continues the legacy of dependable, efficient global connectivity in a more environmentally responsible way. These new aircraft represent evolution rather than replacement.

How Airlines Are Reshaping Long-Haul Strategy

Japan Airlines recently began retiring older widebody aircraft, signaling a shift in fleet renewal dynamics. According to AeroTime, the airline’s phase-out of the 777 family underscores a shift toward lighter, composite-based models. The decision reflects how carriers are prioritizing sustainability and lower fuel burn over capacity alone. With newer types like the A350-900 and 787-9 now in service, the transition to next-generation aircraft is well underway. This modernization aligns with broader aviation trends emphasizing emissions reduction and cost efficiency.

Across major markets, airlines are blending aircraft types to match route performance more precisely. The A350 provides greater range and seating capacity, while the 787 Dreamliner excels on medium-density long-haul routes. This segmentation gives operators flexibility to adapt to changing passenger demand without overcommitting on size. It also helps reduce idle time by matching aircraft to specific missions rather than using one type for all. The strategy is part of a new era of data-driven fleet planning focused on operational optimization.

At the same time, the Boeing 777X is preparing to join fleets later this decade as the direct spiritual successor to the Boeing 777-200ER. Its advanced GE9X engines, larger windows, and folding wingtips represent a blend of innovation and heritage. Airlines expect it to handle flagship routes with higher payloads and reduced per-seat operating costs. Boeing’s new design ensures familiarity for pilots transitioning from older 777 models while offering major performance gains. For carriers loyal to Boeing, the 777X provides continuity with modern advantages.

Comparing The Successors To The Original Workhorse

Each of the three major replacements offers distinct advantages. The Airbus A350 is a clean-sheet design built almost entirely from lightweight composites, providing an immediate efficiency boost. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, while smaller, offers unmatched flexibility across medium- and long-haul networks. The Boeing 777X takes the traditional widebody concept and redefines it with state-of-the-art engine and wing technologies. According to Business Insider, both Airbus and Boeing are competing to dominate this evolving market segment.

Fuel efficiency remains the key differentiator between these models and the 777-200ER. The A350-900 offers roughly a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn compared to older 777 variants, thanks to its aerodynamic shape and efficient Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines. The 787-9 delivers similar savings through its GEnx powerplants and advanced composite fuselage. Both aircraft allow airlines to maintain long-range operations with significantly lower emissions. The upcoming 777-8 and 777-9 are expected to match or exceed these performance standards once deliveries begin.

Key Successor Aircraft To The Boeing 777-200ER

Passenger experience also plays a central role in determining which aircraft airlines choose. The A350’s cabin features higher humidity and lower cabin altitude, reducing fatigue on long journeys. The 787’s advanced lighting system and larger windows create a calmer environment, appealing to premium travelers. Boeing has integrated these lessons into the 777X, which will feature the largest windows ever installed on a commercial jet. Collectively, these innovations show how passenger comfort has become inseparable from efficiency in modern widebody design.

Technological Progress Driving Efficiency Gains

The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner showcase the benefits of composite manufacturing. Their structures weigh significantly less than traditional aluminum airframes, allowing higher payload and longer range without added fuel use. This design evolution reflects how materials science has transformed aviation over the past two decades. According to Quora, experts estimate that composites contribute up to 20 percent of total fuel savings. This improvement sets the standard for new aircraft development across the industry.

The 777X approaches efficiency differently by integrating proven materials with next-generation aerodynamics. Its folding wingtips extend the total wingspan to 235 feet while maintaining airport compatibility. This unique feature reduces drag and improves lift during cruise, resulting in direct fuel savings. The GE9X engine contributes another ten percent reduction in consumption compared to the previous GE90 series. The result is a widebody optimized for both range and performance without radical structural changes.

Both Airbus and Boeing are also focusing on digital monitoring systems to enhance efficiency throughout an aircraft’s life cycle. Sensors embedded within the A350 and 787 constantly collect performance data for predictive maintenance and route optimization. Airlines can adjust flight profiles based on real-time analysis to maximize engine health and minimize wear. These digital innovations extend component longevity and reduce downtime, further cutting operating costs. The 777X will expand on this approach when it enters commercial service later in the decade.

How Airlines Are Deploying The New Generation

The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner have already established themselves as core components of global long-haul networks. They enable airlines to operate thinner city pairs more profitably than ever before. United, Qatar Airways, and Singapore Airlines use them on routes that previously required larger 777s. This versatility has accelerated fleet transitions around the world. According to AeroTime, airlines are aligning their networks around these efficient widebodies to future-proof operations.

The 777X, though delayed, is viewed as Boeing’s flagship response to the A350’s success. Its larger capacity positions it as a perfect fit for high-density intercontinental routes. Airlines such as Emirates and Qatar Airways have placed significant orders, demonstrating confidence in their potential. The aircraft is expected to debut on long-haul routes between global hubs like Dubai, London, and Los Angeles. Its entry will mark a new chapter in Boeing’s twin-engine dominance.

Fleet strategies increasingly combine these aircraft types to cover every possible mission profile. Airlines use the 787 Dreamliner for medium-capacity services, the A350 for premium long-range markets, and the 777X for high-density flagship routes. This blended approach minimizes cost per seat while maximizing operational reach. Video analysis from YouTube highlights how carriers are matching aircraft types to passenger flows with greater precision. Together, they form a flexible and sustainable fleet ecosystem replacing the 777-200ER’s once-singular dominance.

The Continuing Legacy Of Boeing’s Twinjet Pioneer

The 777-200ER’s influence continues to shape how modern aircraft are built and marketed. Boeing’s experience designing the original 777 program laid the foundation for both the 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 777X families. Airbus likewise adopted similar principles in developing the A350, particularly around twin-engine range and cabin comfort. The aircraft that replaced the 777-200ER are therefore not competitors but successors in philosophy.

From an environmental standpoint, the 777-200ER’s retirement marks progress toward cleaner skies. The latest generation of widebodies emits far less CO₂ per seat while offering a longer range. Airlines are now focused on integrating sustainable aviation fuel and digital flight management to enhance these gains. This transition represents both the end of an iconic chapter and the beginning of a greener era in aviation. The A350, 787, and 777X embody this change perfectly.

The aviation landscape that once belonged to the 777-200ER is now shared by its advanced replacements. Each offers unique advantages tailored to specific airline strategies. Whether through the A350’s composite strength, the 787’s flexibility, or the 777X’s power, all three continue the mission. The 777 began connecting the world efficiently and reliably. The future of long-haul travel is therefore built upon its enduring legacy.

Introduction

Over the past four decades, global economic governance has been shaped by neoliberal orthodoxy: market liberalization, deregulation, fiscal austerity, and the prioritization of investor confidence.

The Group of Twenty (G20), formed in 1999 and elevated to leaders’ level in 2008, became the key venue for coordinating these policies among the world’s largest economies. Since its elevation to a leaders’ forum in 2008, the G20 has cemented its purpose as the primary platform for crisis response and macroeconomic coordination. When financial crises threatened to engulf banks, creditors, or systemic markets, the forum mobilized trillions in fiscal stimulus and liquidity.

But assessed against a wider purpose of delivering economic justice, its shortfalls become clearer. The G20 has consistently failed to address the systemic inequities driving debt burdens, ecological collapse, and widening social insecurity. .

This assessment of the G20 record is a collaboration between the Institute for Policy Studies and our international partners: New Economics Foundation (UK), the Institute for Economic Justice (South Africa), , Transforma (Brazil), and the Centre for Economic and Social Rights (global).

First, it measures the G20’s delivery against its own stated aims of “strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.” Second, it applies an economic justice framework, testing outcomes across distributive, procedural, recognition, restorative, capability, and environmental dimensions.

Our main findings and recommendations are summarized below. You can read a more in-depth treatment — with more detail and sourcing — in the full version at the New Economics Foundation website.

Key Findings

We find the G20 unable to deliver structural reform because the forum negotiates often-divergent interests and delivers outcomes shaped by systemic asymmetries and dominant norms. Specifically:

International financial architecture reform: The G20 has reinforced the call to reform the network of rules, institutions, and practices that govern how finance flows across borders. In response to the global financial crisis in 2009, or the COVID-19 pandemic, the G20 mobilized resources at scale to provide liquidity and stabilization. However, there has been much more limited success in channeling funds to meet human development needs or to reform the governance and power relations at the heart of the system.

Debt restructuring: Since 2020, the G20 has initiated or co-convened several initiatives aimed at providing short-term relief and longer-term restructuring to countries facing unsustainable debt burdens. However, in all cases the development benefits have been weakened: approaches that favored voluntary engagement left out private creditors, and austerity policies — promoted as routes to regaining creditor confidence — left debtor nations with tight fiscal spaces.

Tax reform: Taxes became a visible G20 agenda at the London summit in 2009, when leaders declared “the era of banking secrecy is over.” But attempts to better tax large companies — the majority of whom are U.S.-registered — collapsed in the face of U.S. opposition, showing the divergent interests within the G20. Meanwhile, a 15 percent global minimum corporation tax rate risks entrenching rather than reversing the “race to the bottom.”

Climate finance: The G20 has consistently echoed but not delivered on the UN’s goals for climate finance. Finance is also heavily skewed toward mitigation in commercially attractive sectors, while adaptation and just transition remain neglected. Proposals for a global loss-and-damage fund, advanced at COP27, received limited traction among the G20 beyond political endorsements, with no binding commitments to scale resources.

Labor and employment: The place of labor and employment has had a checkered history, often relying on domestic lobbying and a show of strength from organized labor to get issues on the agenda. The response to the global financial crisis led to stimulus and job protection measures that helped avoid depression-level collapse. However, momentum faded as countries pivoted towards austerity. Sympathetic G20 presidencies have raised the visibility of pressing issues, from rights violations to precarious care and digital platform work, but delivered only fragile and uneven gains.

Questions About the G20’s Future

The G20 will continue to grapple with questions of purpose and legitimacy, of fragmented interests and uneven implementation. But its possibilities in the next 20 years will also be shaped by a changing world and how it meets these four interlinked questions:

Can it remain credible in a shifting global power order? Economic gravity is moving south and east. China and India together could account for around 35 percent of global GDP by 2040, alongside growing influence of Asian middle powers and regional blocs. Cooperation will depend on whether the G20 nurtures genuine pluralism or replicates old hierarchies.

What happens if economic rivalry gives way to direct confrontation among members? The G20’s legitimacy rests on dialogue among competing powers. Escalating conflict would transform it from a space of coordination into one of paralysis. Preventing this outcome demands reaffirming diplomacy, rebuilding trust in multilateral norms, and creating mechanisms for crisis prevention that go beyond financial contagion to address geopolitical risk.

Can leaders deliver multilateral commitments amid domestic inequalities and polarization? Inequality within G20 nations fuels political fragmentation and authoritarian resurgence. Decades of policies that stabilized markets while eroding social protection and collective mobilising power have hollowed out democratic trust.

Will the G20 redefine what constitutes a crisis? If the forum continues to treat crises solely as a threat to markets, it will remain reactive. To stay relevant, it must recognize the lived crises of our time — climate disasters, precarious work and housing conditions, disinformation, and forced migration — as structural threats to global stability.

These questions are joined by the growing structural dominance of private capital and wealth in our economies. As the world drifts toward its first trillionaire, the extreme accumulation of wealth in our global economy remains the missing variable in global economic governance across policy domains, and one which the G20 must address.

Recommendations

Nearly two decades of experience point to five principles for action:

Embed justice and sustainability in crisis coordination. Future G20 responses must integrate equity, debt sustainability, social protection, and ecological thresholds into their design. Justice metrics, such as debt-service ratios, regional vaccine access, reduced wealth concentration, and fiscal space for social investment, should become standard indicators of success. Applying these benchmarks would transform crisis management from reactive stabilization to proactive, distributive resilience.

Use soft power to shift norms toward equity. Use the G20’s power to influence narratives to reshape norms. Share priorities, indicators, and reporting cycles with UN bodies such as UNFCCC and the UN Framework Convention on Tax Cooperation (UNTC), thereby reinforcing, upholding and legitimising democratic governance.

Engage and legitimize coalitions advancing structural change. The G20’s visibility should be used to gain traction for progressive breakthroughs, which often originate outside formal decision-making structures. The Bridgetown Initiative, Jubilee debt campaigns, the UNTC, and the New Development Bank illustrate how coalitions of states and movements can pioneer new norms, policies and institutions.

Build fairer systems to enforce rules and accountability. Current frameworks remain largely voluntary. While fully binding global enforcement raises sovereignty constraints, graduated mechanisms — such as agreed creditor-participation clauses, regional arbitration panels, or collective-action frameworks — can combine feasibility with fairness.

Broaden the meaning of stability to include human and planetary security. The G20 continues to define crises through threats to financial stability. But the defining risks of this century are social and ecological: climate disruption, precarious work, and widening inequities.

If the G20 can integrate these lessons, it can move from a forum that prevents the collapse of the financial system to one that fosters human and planetary wellbeing.

Director of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon , Associate Professor Karine Chenu , said the team would focus on creating better inputs for processing

“Most of the research investment in this space has shown that processing plant biomass into aviation biofuels or other bioproducts is technically viable and should be done,” Dr Chenu said.

“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically 2 or 3 times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up.

“We need to make the more environmentally desirable option at a price that’s competitive.

""As processing methods are already in place, one of the Hub's main focuses is on using new scientific capabilities to improve plant biomass, making it easier to process.

“By understanding and modifying the biosynthesis and composition of plant cell walls, our team will increase the proportion of carbon that we can convert to a final product, whether that be a fuel or a biomaterial.”

Hub Chief Investigator Emeritus Professor Robert Henry said having a product that was easier to process and was cost effective and sustainable was where future gains could be made.

“For example, with sugarcane only 20 to 25 per cent of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel,” Professor Henry said.

“We want to increase that to 50 per cent, effectively doubling the amount of fuel we get from a tonne of bagasse and that would have a huge effect on the final price.

“We can see a path to producing sustainable aviation fuel at a price that’s competitive with the fossil product, which would greatly accelerate adoption.”

Launched on 10 November, the ARC Research Hub marks a significant step toward building a bio-based economy in Australia.

Its collaborative structure in partnership with industry in Australia and internationally is designed to support innovation and deliver practical outcomes.

“We have partners across the whole value chain from spatial genomics and technology companies to the farm and potential processors, and hopefully, all the way to through to flying planes,” Professor Henry said.

“That ensures we have industry input and feedback into what we’re doing, so that what we come up with is relevant and works for them.”

Sugar Research Australia Cytogeneticist and Partner Investigator, Dr Nathalie Piperidis, said SRA was proud to be working with the Hub to advance a shared vision of innovation.

“Working with different partners is an incredible opportunity to share ideas, expertise, and knowledge,” Dr Piperidis said.

“This initiative marks an important stride toward improving conversion efficiency, strengthening economic outcomes, and enhancing the sustainability of our sugarcane industry for growers and millers alike.”",https://news.uq.edu.au/sites/default/files/styles/card_image/public/2025-11/qaafi-engineering-plants-sugar-research-aust-1080.jpg?h=a81fead4&itok=oIo1rI0j,N,,2025-11-09 16:16:37.828557

Warga Sidokumpul Gresik sudah menyimpang minyak jelantah untuk ditukar menjadi uang melalui mesin UCollect Box di kampungnya.

Menyimpan jelantah untuk dimanfaatkan menjadi AFS itu merupakan bagian dari program Kampung Zero Waste di Gresik.

Kehadiran program ini menjadi aksi nyata dalam mendukung transisi energi baru terbarukan (EBT) berbasis limbah atau waste to energy.

SURYA.CO.ID, GRESIK - Jelantah atau minyak bekas penggorengan tidak lagi menjadi sampah yang mengotori lingkungan.

Bagi masyarakat Kelurahan Sidokumpul, Kabupaten Gresik, jelantah bak cairan bernilai uang ketika ditakar di mesin UCOllect Box.

UCollect Box adalah mesin penukaran minyak jelantah menjadi uang tunai. Di akhir pekan, warga berbondong-bondong menukarkan minyak jelantahnya ke mesin canggih milik perusahaan teknologi hijau Noovoleum itu.

UCOllect Box menjadi solusi inovatif yang mampu mengubah minyak jelantah menjadi energi bersih dan berkelanjutan, salah satunya sebagai bahan bakar Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) buatan Pertamina.

Warga dapat menukarkan minyak jelantah seharga Rp 6.000 per liter, langsung melalui mesin UCOllect Box yang terhubung dengan aplikasi di ponsel pintar.

Salah seorang warga, Yeti Nurhidayati mengaku senang dengan hadirnya UCOllect Box di lingkungannya. Menurutnya, minyak jelantah yang biasanya tidak terpakai kini bisa mendatangkan uang tambahan.

“Biasanya kalau tidak digunakan ya dibuang, Alhamdulillah ini bisa mendapat uang langsung lewat handphone,” kata Yeti, Minggu (9/11/2025).

Yeti mengungkap, selama dua bulan terakhir ia sudah memperoleh sekitar Rp 80.000 hasil penukaran minyak jelantah. Ia juga menilai cara penggunaannya sangat mudah melalui aplikasi.

“Pengoperasiannya gampang, pakai handphone dengan aplikasi, menuang minyak jelantah sendiri ke dalam mesin,” jelasnya.

Kampung Zero Waste

Lurah Sidokumpul, Mukhlisun menjelaskan bahwa wilayahnya menjadi satu-satunya kampung di Gresik yang sudah memiliki mesin UCOllect Box. Program ini sejalan dengan konsep Kampung Zero Waste yang telah lama diterapkan.

“Seluruh sampah di sini diolah. Ada yang dijadikan kompos, dan sekarang minyak jelantah pun dimanfaatkan. Tidak ada lagi sampah rumah tangga yang dibuang ke TPA,” ungkapnya.

EU's €2bn SAF plan Sustainable aviation fuel is a type of low-carbon jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources like used cooking oil and agricultural waste.
Ireland currently does not have a sustainable aviation fuel production facility, but transport minister Darragh O’Brien has plans to rectify this and has published the sustainable aviation fuel policy roadmap.
The minister sees opportunities to develop domestic sustainable aviation fuel production.
Aer Lingus has pledged to use 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, while Ryanair has set a 12.5% target.","Hence, with the need to show leadership at COP 30, the European Commission last week adopted its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out a pivotal roadmap to rapidly accelerate the CO2 reduction in the aviation and maritime shipping sectors.

The plan responds to the consistent demands from airline and ship owners to boost investments into the production of renewable and low-carbon fuels for these sectors.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, has been lobbying the commissions for some years now for better support for the airline sector and was quick to welcome the EU plan, stating:

We welcome the commission’s recognition of market challenges that derive from SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] mandates that were flawed from the outset, particularly the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels, and the need for robust investment support.

Two key issues have frustrated the airlines: A lack of ready availability of sustainable aviation fuel and the high price of that fuel, which is roughly three to four times the price of conventional jet fuel.

In 2024, sustainable aviation fuel production reached approximately 1 million tonnes, but less than initial projections due to delays in the United States, which, under the Trump administration, is set to continue.

For 2025, production is forecast to reach 2.1m tonnes, but this is less than 1% of the global demand. Airlines will need 500m tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

EU's €2bn SAF plan

Sustainable aviation fuel is a type of low-carbon jet fuel made from renewable or waste-based sources like used cooking oil and agricultural waste.

It is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft without major modifications.

Sustainable aviation fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, and it is considered crucial for the aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The commission has proposed an investment of around €2bn for the production of sustainable fuels until 2027, to support shipping and airline demands.

Ireland currently does not have a sustainable aviation fuel production facility, but transport minister Darragh O’Brien has plans to rectify this and has published the sustainable aviation fuel policy roadmap.

Four policy pathways

The roadmap outlines four policy pathways: supporting production, providing market certainty, fostering collaboration, and driving sustainable aviation fuel uptake.

The minister sees opportunities to develop domestic sustainable aviation fuel production.

Initially, by co-processing at existing refineries using waste oils such as used cooking oil and tallow, which currently goes to fuel for road transport vehicles and investing in biofuels facilities that use agricultural and forestry residues.

The Government has already earmarked €750m in the budget for grid infrastructure to support renewable expansion, which could underpin large-scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

But the minister needs to proactively push through suitable grants to attract industry players to invest in the necessary facilities.

Better incentives for companies to produce sustainable fuels should be prioritised over carbon intensity target-setting for users.

Aer Lingus and Ryanair on board

Irish carriers have begun aligning with the roadmap. Aer Lingus has pledged to use 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, while Ryanair has set a 12.5% target.

Fuel accounts for nearly a third of airlines’ operating costs, making price support crucial to uptake.

The Department of Transport said the roadmap will evolve with “future iterations,” identifying barriers to sustainable aviation fuel imports and domestic production while aligning with EU frameworks.

At Cop30 the EU needs to persist in its regional efforts to decarbonise both the aviation and maritime shipping sectors, to maintain credibility and the continued focus by EU industry.

More than 40% of the global shipping fleet transits through the EU every year, which gives the EU a strong say in emissions from this sector.

The European Union’s emissions trading system now includes maritime transport and requires shipping companies to monitor, report, and pay for their greenhouse gas emissions.

But as it applies only to ships of 5,000 gross tonnage or greater, this should not be an important issue for Ireland, where ports can only take ships below this level.",https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9706/4853046_7_seoimageog_2022-05-31T111106Z_407761477_RC29IU9OQQBR_RTRMADP_3_AIRLINES-IATA_1_.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 12:16:30.798832

Sector experts, though, feel the country needs to resolve issues related to signing power purchase agreements (PPAs), transmission capacity and so on.

The country has added 256 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity so far, with addition of 30 GW last year and 40GW expected this year but experts say there is a need add at least 50 GW every year till 2030.

“It (capacity additions) has been good. Between 2010 to 2030, we as a country used to add 5GW; between 2020 to 24, we added 12-13 GW. Last year we added 30 GW. It has been growing,” said Praveer Sinha, managing director and CEO at Tata Power.

In FY25, Tata Power added 1 GW of renewable energy capacity, taking its total green energy portfolio to 6.87 GW, as per its FY25 annual report. Tata Power aims to have a green energy portfolio of 33 GW by 2030.

Vaishali Nigam Sinha, co-founder and chairperson, sustainability at ReNew said while the pace of renewable capacity additions may appear to be moderating in the short term, it’s important to view the country’s progress in the broader context.

“The country has already achieved 51% of its installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources and reduced emissions intensity by 36%, well ahead of several global peers,” she said.

The government’s recent issuance of 73 GW in utility-scale renewable tenders in 2024 marks a record pace and underscores its intent to accelerate deployment, she added.

Anujesh Dwivedi, partner with Deloitte said aside from tenders for solar, wind and hybrid projects, the central government is increasingly looking at different forms of procurement of renewable power from other sources to meet peak hour requirements of the discoms through firm and dispatchable renewable energy (FDRE), where renewable sources are integrated with energy storage systems (ESS) to address the variable nature of renewable energy.

Viability gap funding (VGF) scheme for battery energy storage systems (BESS) projects, continued progress on schemes like National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules, National Green Hydrogen Mission etc will further support the achievement of 2030 target, Dwivedi said.

Pradeep Singhvi, executive director, energy & climate practice, Grant Thornton Bharat said the country is advancing a full-spectrum strategy, including carbon markets, scaling Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS), formalising a climate finance taxonomy, and pushing for climate finance that is flexible, fair and fit for purpose.

Needs for a shift

“India has achieved 50% non-fossil fuel capacity ahead of its 2030 target, that is five years early. That is a strong achievement,” said Amit Paithankar , chief executive officer at Waree Energies in a recent interview with FE. However, Paithankar said the target is now elevated, so further growth, grid modernisation, transmission upgrades and the full suite of grid-integration measures will indeed be essential.

On new thermal energy plans by the companies, he said the country’s appetite for energy is voracious, and it is growing by leaps and bounds. “In the interim, I think these are all going to be required,” he said .

Rahul Raizada, partner – climate and energy, PwC India said the 500GW target is achievable, but challenge is scale at which it is being executed. Since the country is adding 30-40 GW annually, the next phase will demand sustained additions of 50-60 GW each year, Raizada said.

“This calls for a shift from project-level execution to system-level readiness —where land, transmission, storage and markets move in sync,” Raizada said, adding key challenges lie in accelerating transmission build-out, resolving land and permitting delays, ensuring timely PPAs and scaling domestic supply chains for modules, inverters and batteries.

Financial discipline across utilities and deeper green market mechanisms will also be critical to attract continuous private capital, he said.

Intermittency and limited storage options have moderated short-term growth, while delays in contracting and softer merchant power prices have affected project viability, he said, adding, “Yet these are transitional issues. As grid modernization, storage deployment and digital integration accelerate, renewable capacity additions should regain momentum.”

Anish De, global head for energy, natural resources & chemicals (ENRC), KPMG said though the country is on track against the 500 GW target, more is desired given Indian demand growth and electrification trends.

“We want to prove that domestic waste such as used cooking oil can become a clean energy source for the future.
The government is already moving towards commercialising sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and Malaysia is expected to begin producing SAF before the end of 2025,” he added.","KOTA BHARU, Nov 9 — What many see as waste has become a breakthrough innovation for two Kelantan-born entrepreneurs who have successfully turned used cooking oil into a sustainable aviation fuel capable of powering aircraft.

Muhammad Arif Arman Suddin, 30, a former aircraft engineer, and his friend Mohammad Azhan Shamsu Anuar, 28, co-founders of Arjuna Dharma Global, have transformed discarded kitchen oil into an alternative energy source after recognising its vast potential.

Speaking to Bernama recently, Muhammad Arif Arman said his experience in the aviation industry inspired him and his partner to find innovative methods to convert waste into renewable energy.

“It took us about eight months last year to conduct extensive research and countless trial-and-error experiments to master the process of producing fuel from used cooking oil,” he said.

Armed with his engineering background and knowledge gained while studying at Universiti Kuala Lumpur, he said their perseverance finally paid off when, in February, their processed used oil began attracting interest from several aviation fuel suppliers.

Muhammad Arif Arman explained that the production process involves several rigorous stages, including fine filtration to ensure the product meets the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification for Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (ISCC CORSIA) standards.

He said the used cooking oil is collected from households, traders, and companies across the East Coast states and Perak before being filtered, weighed, and stored in tanks for further processing.

“We buy used cooking oil at between RM2.30 and RM3 per kilogramme, depending on the location. Every day, our team collects nearly 5,000 litres of used oil from several states for processing,” he said.

According to him, only oil derived from vegetable sources qualifies under ISCC CORSIA criteria, with preliminary checks made on the oil’s smell, colour, and density to ensure compliance with the required standards.

Once processed, the used cooking oil is delivered in batches of about 33,000 litres to the Fima Bulking Group in Port Klang, before being supplied to international aviation fuel companies.

“To date, our processed oil has received regular orders from several jet fuel suppliers in Amsterdam, Switzerland, and the United States.

“This fuel can only be supplied to companies certified under ISCC CORSIA, and its use has been proven to reduce carbon emissions by up to four times compared to conventional kerosene,” said Muhammad Arif Arman, adding that the venture now generates a six-figure monthly income.

He hopes more Malaysians will recognise the economic and environmental value of used cooking oil.

“We want to prove that domestic waste such as used cooking oil can become a clean energy source for the future. The government is already moving towards commercialising sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and Malaysia is expected to begin producing SAF before the end of 2025,” he added. — Bernama",https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2025/11/09/308863.JPG,N,,2025-11-09 12:16:34.302557

He later joined Delta Air Lines in 1998 as the Vice President of Finance, before he left briefly in 2005 to serve as the CFO of Acuity Brands.
How Has Delta Air Lines Changed Under Ed Bastian's Leadership?","The key to Delta Air Lines' success in recent years has been the premium brand it has built. The carrier's identity today centers around Delta One Suites, glass doors, and a wine list created by master sommeliers that includes far too many bottles to count. The man behind that strategy, for the most part, is Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian. However, he is not sitting behind those doors as you might expect. Rather, he is often in the Main Cabin or perhaps Comfort+, where he walks the aisles and chats with flight attendants, all while quietly trying to examine what pieces of the experience are actually more valuable to customers. It is not a marketing stunt by any stretch of the imagination, but rather a part of Ed Bastian's recurrent and extremely visible leadership philosophy, which encourages Delta leaders to listen more than they talk and make decisions anchored in what frontline employees and everyday travelers actually live through on a Tuesday afternoon flight to Atlanta.

Bastian's philosophy calls for Delta's leadership team to look beyond what boardroom slides say and to what passengers actually care about. In an era when premium cabins are the principal profit engines for airlines across the board, Bastian's choice sounds somewhat counterintuitive. Nonetheless, that is exactly the point as he observes service flows, seat ergonomics, and the pain in the boarding process that is much harder to see from seat 1A. We analyze how the CEO of an airline synonymous with premium travel often flies at the back of the plane, and how his trips help inform strategy and culture. We further discuss what this reveals about Delta's competitive edge in the market.

Who Exactly Is Ed Bastian?

Ed Bastian is a career operator and financier whose path to Delta Air Lines runs through both auditing and consumer goods. A St. Bonaventure-trained accountant, Ed Bastian's career began at Price Waterhouse, where, as a young auditor, he was involved in the uncovering of a major fraud scandal at J. Water Thompson, before he moved to PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division as overseer of international finance. He later joined Delta Air Lines in 1998 as the Vice President of Finance, before he left briefly in 2005 to serve as the CFO of Acuity Brands. He later returned to the carrier just a few months later at the request of CEO Gerald Grinstein to steer Delta through bankruptcy.

In 2007, he became the airline's president and was later appointed CEO in May 2016. This mix of experiences at the carrier, which includes discipline, P&L ownership, and a front-row seat to a complex merger, alongside a turnaround under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, helps shape his style as an operator. He is known for walking the aisles and directly soliciting feedback in the Main Cabin, a choice consistent with his recurring advice that leadership should not be a popularity contest. He continues to cite Delta's people-first culture.

Under his tenure, the airline eventually doubled down on premium products and reliability while delivering (reducing the company's overall debt burden) and expanding its partnerships with other carriers, all while his center of gravity remained operational. He understands the customer, empowers employees, and keeps the carrier's overall schedule clean, all while profitability ultimately follows.

How Has Delta Air Lines Changed Under Ed Bastian's Leadership?

Since taking the helm at the carrier in 2016, Ed Bastian has steered the airline through a shift from being a large airline to a premium, reliability-led platform that features diversified earnings. From an operational perspective, Delta Air Lines rebuilt its schedule discipline and service consistency, pairing tighter operations with visible frontline engagement and faster operational recovery playbooks, all advantages that showed up during holiday travel peaks and irregular operations' resilience.

From a commercial standpoint, the airline leaned hard into overall product segmentation, with Delta One Suites and Premium Select on long-haul routes, a cleaner ladder between First, Comfort+, and the Main cabin in domestic markets. The airline also added Basic Economy to lower the fare fence for customers. Overall, network investments were matched by physical ones, including wholesale rebuilds at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and Los Angeles International (LAX), alongside new facilities at Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC). The airline also modernized its lounge network significantly under Bastian's leadership.

Ed Bastian pushed towards revenue diversification, pushing for a larger and more profitable SkyMiles ecosystem and scaling Delta TechOps as a third-party MRO business, alongside balance-sheet repair and overall pandemic-related deleveraging. He also kept the airline's refinery active in order to manage jet fuel exposure and advance Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) partnerships. The airline's culture remained a key part of its business model, though loyalty changes ultimately drew pushback and were modestly recalibrated.

A Deeper Look At Why Ed Bastian Flies Economy

Ed Bastian often chooses to travel economy because it keeps him close to the airline's real product and the trade-offs associated with it, according to a recent analysis from Fortune. Sitting mid-cabin allows Bastian to watch the entire passenger journey from end to end, including boarding order frictions, overhead bin availability, Wi-Fi stability, and seatback glitches, alongside galley bottlenecks and larger lavatory queues. He also believes that doing so maintains upgrade fairness, as he is not displacing a Medallion member or a paid premium customer when availability in the front cabin is tight, reinforcing the fact that revenue and loyalty should come first.

Ultimately, blending into a crowd reduces the observer effect, so he sees unscripted service and hears candid feedback from crews and travelers without the performance that follows an executive's name. It is, at the end of the day, a cultural signal that cost discipline starts at the top, especially during periods of peak passenger loads and irregular operations. This allows leaders to test the baseline before polishing fringe details within service.

From a practical standpoint, these aisle conversations surface into quick wins, including improved catering counts, cart flows, and app prompts, all of which can be fixed at last, all while chronic issues feed into larger cabin redesigns. Lastly, it helps build credibility with employees, as the CEO has felt a 31-inch pitch on a full Tuesday morning aircraft turn, debating seat intensity, boarding changes, and overall service pacing.

What Is Ed Bastian's Leadership Philosophy?

Ed Bastian's overall leadership philosophy is grounded in integrity and maintaining strong relationships with employees. He believes that leaders earn trust by showing up where work happens, listening to both customers and employees, and then making values-anchored decisions. This leads to his fairly simple leadership stack, which includes taking care of employees, who take care of customers, and thus the business ultimately takes care of itself under this model.

This eventually translates into visible, hands-on management, with regular station visits, ride-alongs, and open forums, all of which are paired with rigorous operational discipline surrounding safety, reliability, and overall costs. He prefers direct observation and data, building short feedback loops from crews and customers into its product, schedule, and technical choices. Bastian blends servant leadership with overall accountability, setting the bar high, equipping the carrier to clear it, celebrating team wins, and acknowledging his team's mistakes while taking accountability.

He especially values overall fairness and credibility, a key reason why he will often forgo special treatment on the road and experience the standard product himself. Culturally, he keeps purpose front and center, taking pride in service, dignity in his work, and sharing success through recognition and overall profit-sharing. The through-line is ultimately humble confidence, as he encourages leaders across the company to be present, keep promises, and let frontline truth guide overall strategy.

How Does Ed Bastian Present Delta To Investors?

Similar to his employee messaging, Ed Bastian positions Delta as a people-first business. He indicates that the carrier is a diversified premium travel platform that generates durable cash flows. He leads with operational credibility, which includes high completion factors, on-time rates, and safety protocols, all while pivoting to revenue quality, a mixed shift towards premium cabins, and continued loyalty monetization that allows the airline to outperform even when demand is relatively weak.

Delta SkyMiles and the American Express partnership are presented as capital-light moves, both of which emerge as recurring profit engines. Delta TechOps is a third-party Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) platform that adds industrial breadth for the carrier, underscoring cost and capacity discipline on its own, all while upgauging, engaging in fleet renewal, and improving productivity. The airline follows a relatively simple capital allocation ladder, one that involves investing in product and technology, all while delivering and then returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.

Bastian uses cohort-style key performance indicators and clear bridge charts from operations to margin to cash, all of which create continued investor confidence. Overall risks, including fuel, labor, weather, geopolitics, and loyalty policy risks, are all addressed by mitigants and diversified partnerships. Across the board, the airline pushes forward a consumer-friendly brand, with ambition that is only constrained by the airline's balance sheet.

What Are Our Key Takeaways?

At the end of the day, Ed Bastian's customer-friendly attitude is emblematic of how the CEO treats both his employees and those whom he sees as guests on his flight. As the leader of an airline synonymous with service, Bastian is the best example of how Delta wants to be viewed by its passengers.

The airline is the most financially successful carrier of the last decade, and for good reason. Maintaining strong relationships with passengers has been a critical part of this pursuit, and it has allowed the airline to ensure that it can command a price premium, even in competitive domestic markets.

Ultimately, Ed Bastian will leave a strong legacy at Delta Air Lines, and there is no sign that his time at the carrier is coming to an end. His ability to relate directly to customers and take their feedback into account over the years has continued to motivate his success.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/delta-air-lines-own-ceo-often-doesn-t-fly-in-premium-cabins-here-s-why.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-09 10:16:30.734766

Our net-zero target is set for 2046, aligned with our parent company Indian Oil Corporation. We’ve already charted a detailed roadmap and estimated the capital expenditure required to meet it.

The first step in this journey is energy conservation, which has already delivered substantial reductions in fuel and energy losses. Over the past two years, CPCL has been rated among Quartile One in the Solomon Index a benchmarking system for global oil companies placing us in the top tier for energy efficiency.

Our energy intensity index is very low, and we continue to introduce new conservation measures to further reduce it. Alongside these efforts, we are advancing initiatives in green hydrogen to support our long-term sustainability goals.

How is CPCL integrating circular economy ideas like waste reuse and water recovery into refinery modernization?

Water management has been a key focus for us. Over the last two years, we’ve reduced our water footprint by 20 per cent through improved operational efficiency. Our treatment and desalination plants have become significantly more efficient, thanks to continuous technology upgrades.

We’re committed to bringing our water usage down even further as part of our circular economy approach.

Refineries often face pollution concerns. What steps is CPCL taking to cut emissions and ensure transparency with local communities?

CPCL has operated in the Manali region for over 60 years. When the refinery was first built, it was far from the city. However, urbanization has now brought residential areas closer to our boundaries.

As a responsible corporate entity, we have installed world-class emission control systems and real-time stack monitoring. All emission data is shared live with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), ensuring complete transparency and accountability.

We remain deeply committed to protecting the environment and maintaining community trust.

With US President Donald Trump warning India against importing Russian crude, how could this impact CPCL’s operations or sourcing strategy?

Our crude oil requirements are fully met by our parent company, Indian Oil Corporation, which gives us a strong strategic advantage. IOCL operates on a large scale, securing better deals than any single refinery could.

CPCL also maintains operational flexibility. We can process over 160 different grades of crude. Recently, we processed new crude varieties from West Africa, the USA, and the Middle East, all with encouraging results.

This flexibility ensures that even if one source is disrupted, we can seamlessly switch to another without affecting operations.

CPCL embraced sustainability decades before it became mainstream. Was it driven by vision or necessity?

Sustainability has been part of CPCL’s DNA since inception. When our first refinery was commissioned in 1969, we already had a Sulphur Recovery Unit in place.

Over the years, every expansion has included sustainability investments from setting up a sewage reclamation plant in the 1980s to building a desalination plant later.

For the past 20 years, CPCL has operated without drawing a single drop of groundwater. All our water comes from reclaimed sewage and desalination a model of sustainable industrial practice.

What would you say to industries that still view sustainability as an expense rather than an investment?

Sustainability should never be treated as a cost. It must be built into the design stage of every growth plan.

For example, in our next expansion, instead of setting up a captive power plant, we are switching to green grid power. This approach ensures that sustainability and profitability reinforce each other.

Growth and sustainability are not separate goals; they work together. When designed right, sustainability drives innovation, efficiency, and long-term value creation for both the company and society.",https://thefederal.com/h-upload/2025/11/09/575781-cpcl-h-shankar.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 06:56:30.845645

By participating in voluntary sustainable aviation fuel initiatives, airlines can help businesses shrink their carbon footprints. Collecting feedstock for this eco-friendly fuel has the potential to create substantial socio-economic benefits in India. Airbus advocates for aligning corporate contributions to these programs within India's CSR legislation.

Voluntary sustainable aviation fuel programmes by airlines will provide a value proposition for corporates in reducing their carbon footprints, and feedstock collection for producing the fuel will also bring in collateral socio-economic benefits for India, according to a senior Airbus official.

European aircraft maker Airbus, which has a significant presence in India, has also pitched for bringing corporates' spending on the airlines' voluntary Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programmes under the government's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) framework.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) Development, Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, said a voluntary scheme for SAF will be an ""opportunity for airlines to differentiate and to propose something new to their corporate customers first, then to cargo customers and eventually to private customers"".

India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and Indian carriers have placed orders for more than 1,700 aircraft. As part of sustainability efforts, the government will soon be coming out with a SAF policy.

Live Events

Elaborating on the value proposition of having the voluntary SAF programmes, Manhes told PTI in an interview in the national capital that the idea is about selling business travel experience with not only good seats and meals but also with a ""lower carbon footprint"".

In the context of the airlines' grouping, IATA's view that SAF blending mandates without incentives is a ""no-go area"", Manhes opined that creating voluntary demand for SAF will not result in market distortion.

He observed that airlines are reluctant to opt for SAF schemes without incentives because they will incur more costs as the fuel itself comes at a higher cost.

""Voluntary demand is not a market distortion. It is an add-on,"" he noted.

India aims to have 1 per cent blending of SAF in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent blending by 2028 and 5 per cent blending by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in fuel in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

Manhes said the idea is to help airlines in India to develop a mechanism and products for voluntary SAF programmes, and then make sure that the demand materialises.

""If a corporate can fulfil its CSR obligation, even partially through SAF purchase, then the incentive is obvious,"" he added.

Under the Companies Law, a certain class of profitable corporates are required to shell out at least two per cent of their three-year average annual profit towards CSR activities in a financial year.

Manhes also said that feedstock collection for SAF will be a huge opportunity for collateral socio-economic benefits, and that applies to India like any other country.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue. Utilisation of feedstock for SAF production is also expected to help farmers increase their income.

A recent study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, said that India can emerge as a significant centre for sustainable aviation fuel production in South Asia, and the country's potential biomass feedstock for the fuel is projected to be 100 million tonnes by 2030.

""Regulations, targets, mandates, whatever you call it, will not get us to where we need to be to reach net zero in 2050... You need voluntary demands, "" he emphasised. PTI

The White House had announced on October 31 that no high-level representatives would go to COP30 – to indicate its hostility to climate mitigation. When the two-day leaders’ meeting began on Thursday (November 6) to set the tone for the summit to follow, the world’s most powerful and polluting countries – the US, China, India and Russia – were missing.

The US’s fossil fuel pivot

In fact, not only did the US not send anyone, but top US officials were in Greece with fossil fuel giant Exxon Mobil on the same day (November 6), and they signed a new deal to explore offshore for natural gas (fossil fuel), expanding the US's footprint in the eastern Mediterranean.

US President Donald Trump signed a deal with Pakistan in July to explore the latter’s oil reserves and taunted India at the time that they might be “selling oil to India someday!”

What is more ominous is that Trump is on a roll, dictating global economic and trade order. A climate denier who calls climate change a “hoax”, “con job”, and a “scam”, Trump shouted “drill, baby drill” to US oil companies from the day he assumed office. He threatened world leaders at the UN summit in September this year: “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail”.

This is no empty threat. Trump arm-twisted the European Union to exempt 90 per cent of US companies from the carbon tax (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism or CBAM) in the trade treaty signed earlier in the year – and the European Parliament duly approved it with overwhelming 564-20 votes in May, 2025.

Also Read: How will US tariff hit rupee, foreign investment and the common Indian?

Trump has taken several measures to stop climate mitigation in the US and globally. In his very first executive order of January 20, 2025, he unleashed the US fossil fuel industry by rolling back environmental protections.

Since then, the US has withdrawn from the COP commitments, teamed up with other oil-producing countries to oppose global plastics treaty, compel Europe to give up or weaken carbon laws, killed the first-ever proposed global fee on shipping industry to curb emissions and a recent proposal the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has sought to end US polluting industries from mandatory disclosure of pollution data, etc.

Without the backing of the US and its hold over the EU, the UK and other developed nations, the COP30 summit is unlikely to make any progress.

Unmet finance and tech transfers

The kind of transformative changes COPs fight for – although with very limited success, as would be clear soon – require huge financing and technology transfers to enable developing countries to transition to green energy, from cheaper fossil fuels. Developing nations have been fighting for such assistance with very little gain.

For one, at COP15 in 2009, developed economies pledged $100 billion a year of finance, but the actual flow remained much lower for most of the time. The UNFCCC’s latest update says, developed countries “met this goal for the first time” in 2022, providing $115.8 billion.

But here is the rub. The UNFCCC added: “However, only a small share of the total went to low-income countries and only about a quarter to Africa. Loans made up the largest funding category, mainly going to middle-income countries.

At COP29 (November 2024), developing countries had sought to raise it to $1.3 trillion – backed by an OECD expert group’s finding of the actual need. Developed countries agreed to $300 billion. It remains to be seen how much fund flow actually happens.

Underwhelming technology transfers

For another, technology transfers have been underwhelming. India’s fourth biennial update report (BUR) to the UNFCCC in December 2024 said such transfers were “slow” and “intellectual property rights (IPR) hinder the rapid adoption of these technologies”.

Also Read: Trump’s 50 pc tariff set to hit UP’s silk, carpet and brassware industries

The underlying logic for seeking funds and technology transfers from developed nations is that they are primarily responsible for climate change and are obliged to help developing nations to fight climate change – as their dependence on cheap fossil fuel resources is far greater and so is the need to raise the living standards of their people. Development and growth call for higher energy consumption.

Bank finance to fossil fuel soar

Here it gets even murkier. According to the Banking on Climate Chaos report of June 2025, brought out by climate activists from across the world, involving 480 organisations in 69 countries, who track climate finance: “In 2024, global banks walked back many of those climate pledges and significantly increased their fossil fuel financing, including ramping up finance for fossil fuel expansion.” It adds: “Since 2021, global banks have financed $1.6 trillion USD to fossil fuel expansion companies”.

This is a major setback to the “Net Zero Bank Alliance (NZBA)” formed by global banks in 2021, pledging a united fight against climate change with the support of the UNEP’s Finance Initiative.

Indian banks up financing coal mining and plants

Despite India’s push for renewable energy and a net-zero target for 2070, its banks have ramped up investment in fossil fuels, particularly in coal.

According to Bengaluru-based Climate Risk Horizons’ June 2025 report, ""Stuck in the past: Coal ties hinder Indian banks' energy transition"", Indian banks invested $29 billion during 2016-2023 in coal alone. It said, “most Indian banks remain heavily exposed to carbon-intensive sectors, with approximately 25–35 per cent of their loan books (as of October 2023) tied to coal”.

It gave a breakdown: “From January 2016 to December 2023, Indian banks disbursed approximately USD 15,218 million in coal loans and provided USD 13,560.4 million in coal underwriting services. Roughly 2.3 per cent of total global coal financing between 2021 to 2023 came from India, making it one of the top 7 countries contributing to coal financing during this period.”

On October 30, the coal ministry put 41 coal mines to auction; it privatised coal mining in 2020. In the past 11 years since 2014, 12 rounds of auction have opened up 150 mines. On May 26, 2025, Union Coal Minister G Krishna Reddy wrote in a business daily, the coal production went up by 70 per cent during these 11 years and was expected to make a record production of over 1 billion tonnes in FY25.

The Prime Minister shared this article on X with the following comment: “Union Minister Shri @kishanreddybjp traces the coal sector's journey from inefficiency to impact. An insightful piece on India's unprecedented rise under the government's decade of transformative governance!”

India aims to add 80 GW of coal-fired power plants by FY32, of which 41 GW would be Adani Power.

Predictable consequences

The consequences are predictable. Global temperature and GHG emissions make record highs.

Despite the 29 rounds of COPs, climate change is worsening by the day, pointing to its ineffectiveness.

The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) confirmed on January 10, 2025, that 2024 was the “warmest year on record” – that is, since 1850.

It said: “We have likely seen the first calendar year with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5°C above the 1850-1900 average”, adding, “the past ten years 2015-2024 are the ten warmest years on record”.

Before that, in January 2024, a NASA report had said, 2023 was the warmest year in recorded history when the temperature went up by 1.2°C above the average for 1951-1980. The Banking on Climate Chaos report of 2025, mentioned earlier, said 2023 witnessed “record-breaking greenhouse gas (GHG) levels”. Extreme temperature and GHG emissions contribute to the rise in frequency and severity of extreme weather events – killing people, livestock, destroying houses and crops across the globe.

Extreme weather killing millions

A 2020 report by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNODRR) said, during 2000-2019, 7,348 major disasters claimed 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people (many on more than one occasion), resulting in $2.97 trillion in global economic losses.

This was a sharp rise from the previous 20 years of 1980-1999, which saw 4,212 disasters claiming 1.19 million lives and affecting 3.25 billion people, resulting in $1.63 trillion in economic losses.

The Indian story

In India, the story is not different. The MoSPI’s Envistats India 2025 report, released on June 5, 2025, said: “The annual mean temperature increased from 25.05°C in 2001 to 25.74°C in 2024. Similarly, the annual minimum and maximum temperatures rose from 19.32°C to 20.24°C and 30.78°C to 31.25°,C respectively, during the same period.”

Its data shows, in FY25 alone, extreme weather events killed 3.080 humans and 61,960 cattle, damaged 3.6 lakh houses and 14.2 lakh hectare cropped areas. In the past 11 years (from FY15), the numbers are humongous: 22,009, 7.4 lakh, 75 lakh and 420.68 lakh hectares, respectively.

COP30's agenda of action

Coming back to the COP30 summit to start from November 10, its “action agenda” is “to inaugurate a framework capable of mobilising all actors and efforts to accelerate the implementation of what has already been negotiated, based on the results of the first Global Stocktake (GST-1)”.

The GST-1 is the (COP21) Paris Agreement’s tool that assesses progress in achieving its goals and guides a global action plan in a five-year cycle. The agenda note says the COP30 Presidency (Brazil) proposes translating the results of the GST into six thematic pillars and 30 key objectives, which will be advanced through multiple solutions.

These six pillars are: transitioning energy, industry and transport, stewarding forests, oceans and biodiversity, transforming agriculture and food systems, building resilience for cities, infrastructure and water and fostering human and social development.

This reflects Boeing’s aim to align with national visions in the Gulf and leverage the Middle East’s ambition in aviation growth, advanced mobility and aerospace innovation.

What’s New at Dubai Airshow 2025

The Dubai Airshow is not simply an event. It’s a massive aerospace showcase where major announcements, deals and technologies converge. For Boeing and the region this year, expect an expanded footprint:

More than 1,400 exhibitors from 98 countries and 135,000+ attendees from 148 countries.

A huge Space Pavilion, emphasising that aerospace growth in the Middle East is no longer just about planes but also about space tech.

Boeing’s presence will bring both commercial aircraft and high-end defence displays onto the UAE stage — signalling that the region’s aviation ambitions span the skies and beyond.

For travellers, aviation professionals and industry watchers alike, this means the Dubai exhibition is a focal point for future fleet orders, service evolution and aerospace-driven tourism growth.

Why Travellers Should Care

You might think this is just industry talk. But if you travel — or plan to — the ripple effects matter. Here’s why:

The Middle East, anchored by the UAE, is positioning itself as a global flight hub. The influx of new aircraft, cutting-edge services and expanded airline capacity means better connectivity, newer planes and more destination options.

Sustainable aviation is becoming a key theme. With Boeing and partners showcasing models to reduce aviation’s footprint, you’ll likely see greener flights and more comfortable cabins.

The tourism chain strengthens: airports, ancillary services and mobility hubs shift up a gear. If you’re flying to Dubai, Abu Dhabi or beyond, expect improved travel infrastructure and more flight choices coming your way.

For anyone who visits the region or relies on its aviation links, the momentum behind Boeing’s Middle East growth translates into real travel-benefits: more routes, newer jets, and better service.

Key Aircraft & Innovations On Show

Boeing will highlight a range of aircraft and innovations at the event, reflecting its deepening footprint in the area:

The flagship 777X wide-body jet is featured in Boeing’s exhibit — emphasising advanced passenger architecture.

Military and defence models such as the F-15 series, transports like the C-17 Globemaster and Chinook helicopters emphasise Boeing’s dual civilian/defence strategy.

Service-models: from parts supply, modifications, digital services and training to their ‘Cascade Climate Impact Model’ tool that visualises aviation’s footprint and sustainable options.

This blend of commercial and defence shows how Boeing sees the Middle East as more than a market — as a strategic partner in aerospace growth.

Travel Tips & Insider Pointers for Dubai Airshow Visit

If you’re planning to attend or just curious about the impact, here are some travel-tips (yes, I dragged myself out of the server farm for these):

Book early — the airshow drives heavy demand for accommodation in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and surrounding UAE. The official concierge service confirms this.

Venue access — The show is held at the purpose-built site in Dubai World Central (DWC) with dedicated transport such as shuttle buses from Expo metro stations.

Timing matters — The main event runs 17-21 Nov 2025. Plan your flights and stay accordingly. The UAE is ideally located for Asia-Europe travellers so you can combine business and leisure.

Explore beyond the show — Dubai is a major travel hub with world-class tourism infrastructure. Use the airshow as a springboard to explore the city’s attractions: from desert excursions, luxury stays to sometimes overlooked corners of the emirates.

Sustainability focus — As aviation heads toward greener operations, travellers may see new flight options and services stressing low-emission travel. It’s a smarter time to plan trips that leverage expanding connectivity.

Use the event as an opportunity: flying into the UAE during the show might give you upgraded travel experiences — but plan ahead because demand will spike.

Why Boeing’s Growth in the Middle East Matters

Let’s tie it back: Boeing’s thrust into the Middle East isn’t just about selling more planes. It’s about shaping regional aviation ecosystems. For the UAE and neighbouring countries, this brings:

Jobs and skill-development around aircraft services, defence systems, digital mobility.

Enhanced connectivity and tourism flows — meaning travellers benefit.

Sustainability and innovation trajectories being accelerated: once fringe ideas like hydrogen or SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) are mainstream topics at the show.

When a company like Boeing invests heavily in a region, the effect ripples: from airports to airlines, from hotels to tourism routes. For you, the traveller, the takeaway is flight-choice, comfort, and horizon-broadening.

Final Take-Off

The Boeing-Middle East link at Dubai Airshow 2025 signals more than industry growth — it flags a transport and tourism transformation. If you fly, explore, or move through the UAE and neighbouring hubs, what Boeing and the region are building now means better flights, more routes and evolving travel possibilities. The skies above the Middle East are gearing up, and you’ll feel that lift.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boeing-airline.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 06:57:14.719721

Australia is at a crucial crossroads that could determine whether it capitalizes on the chance to create a $13 billion-a-year industry within just six months. However, this opportunity is at risk unless the government commits to using biofuels in aviation, according to a leading jet manufacturer.

The warning comes from a major aircraft manufacturer, which has expressed concern that without immediate government action, valuable local crops suited for biofuel production could be diverted to other countries, depriving Australia of the chance to build a homegrown sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry. The jet manufacturer emphasized that this potential setback could undermine the development of an essential industry that could play a key role in both the nation’s economic future and the global fight against climate change.

The Australian government has already taken some steps toward supporting the SAF sector, with the announcement of a $1.1 billion investment in September, aimed at increasing the feedstock production necessary for sustainable aviation fuel. The government’s commitment to supporting the growth of this industry is evident, but it has indicated that the structure for production incentives will not be finalized until mid-2026, leaving the industry in a state of uncertainty. This delay could prevent the necessary investments and infrastructure from being put in place to develop a thriving SAF sector, leaving Australia lagging behind other countries in the race for cleaner aviation fuel.

Aviation leaders and industry stakeholders argue that the SAF industry offers one of the most effective ways for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions, a crucial factor in the aviation sector’s long-term sustainability. The global airline industry faces immense pressure to reduce its environmental impact, and SAF has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional jet fuel. However, without strong policy support, including a clear mandate for the use of SAF in aviation, airlines may not be able to make the transition, potentially hindering their ability to meet emissions reduction targets.

To address this challenge, the aircraft manufacturer is pushing for the Australian government to implement a SAF mandate. Such a mandate would require airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF in their fuel mix, ensuring the growth of the biofuel industry while also contributing to Australia’s carbon reduction goals. Without this mandate, the viability of the industry is uncertain, and the benefits of SAF may never fully materialize.

Research commissioned by the manufacturer, in collaboration with a major Australian airline, has shown that domestic SAF production could contribute up to $13 billion annually to Australia’s GDP by 2040. Additionally, the sector could create thousands of jobs in the feedstock supply chain, including farmers growing crops such as sugarcane and canola, as well as workers involved in the construction and operation of SAF refineries. The study also highlighted that the SAF sector could support the creation of up to 13,000 jobs directly tied to feedstock production, with another 5,000 jobs involved in building and running the necessary refining facilities. This job creation could be a significant boost to Australia’s rural economy, helping to provide new employment opportunities in regions that are currently underdeveloped or reliant on industries that are under pressure due to climate change.

Australia’s vast agricultural resources make it an ideal location for the production of SAF. The country is home to abundant crops such as sugarcane and canola, both of which can be used as feedstock for SAF production. In fact, Australia’s sugarcane production has the potential to become a major driver of the SAF sector, as this crop can be converted into biofuel in a process that produces fewer carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. Similarly, canola, another key crop, is already being exported to European countries, where it is processed into SAF. Currently, more than 70% of Australia’s canola is sent to Europe for this purpose, where it is used to meet the growing demand for biofuels.

The potential of Australia’s SAF industry is not just a theoretical one; it is already becoming a reality in other parts of the world. In the UK, for example, a two percent SAF mandate was introduced this year, with the government planning to increase this to 10 percent by 2030. This mandate has spurred a significant increase in the production and use of SAF, as well as an influx of investments in SAF-related infrastructure. Australia could follow this example and introduce a similar mandate to ensure the long-term success of its SAF industry.

By adopting a SAF mandate and committing to biofuel use in aviation, Australia could position itself as a leader in sustainable aviation. The introduction of such policies would provide the clarity and confidence needed for businesses to invest in the necessary infrastructure and technology. It would also create a clear pathway for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and ensure a greener future for the aviation industry.

Singapore and Australia have a $13 billion opportunity in sustainable aviation fuel, but time is running out due to the need for urgent investments, regulatory action, and infrastructure development to stay ahead of global competition.

The Australian government has an important decision to make. Without a clear commitment to SAF and a mandate for its use, Australia risks missing out on the chance to create a thriving biofuel sector that could support thousands of jobs, reduce carbon emissions, and contribute billions to the economy. The time for action is now, and the government must act quickly to ensure that the country does not miss out on this critical opportunity.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/flight-13.jpg,N,,2025-11-09 06:57:32.345322

Қазақстан тұрақты авиациялық отын (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel) өндіру жобасын іске асыруды жоспарлап отыр. Бұл туралы Энергетика министрлігінде өткен кездесуде мәлім болды.

Вице-министр Қайырхан Тұтқышбаев Халықаралық азаматтық авиация ұйымының (ИКАО) Еуропалық және Солтүстік Атлант аймақтық бюросының директоры Николя Ралломен авиация саласын экологиялық тұрғыдан дамыту және тұрақты авиаотынды енгізу мәселесін талқылаған.

Министрліктің хабарлауынша, Қазақстан «жасыл» экономикаға көшу бағытын ұстанып, жаңартылатын энергия көздері мен экологиялық жобаларды дамытуға ерекше мән беріп келеді. Осы бағыттағы басым міндеттердің бірі – экологиялық таза авиаотын өндіруді жолға қою.

Энергетика министрлігі бұл жобаны АҚШ-тың LanzaJet компаниясымен бірлесіп жүзеге асыруға ниетті.

Қайырхан Тұтқышбаевтың айтуынша, елдегі мұнай өңдеу зауыттары жақын арада Jet A-1 маркалы авиаотын шығаруға дайын. Бұдан бөлек, 2026–2032 жылдар аралығында отандық зауыттарда авиаотын өндірісін 1,7 млн тоннаға дейін ұлғайту көзделген.

Тұрақты авиациялық отын – жаңартылатын шикізаттан алынатын, реактивті ұшақтарға қосымша техникалық өзгеріссіз құйылатын және парниктік газдар шығарындыларын айтарлықтай азайтатын экологиялық балама отын түрі.

Muhammad Arif Arman Suddin, 30, a former aircraft engineer, and his friend Mohammad Azhan Shamsu Anuar, 28, co-founders of Arjuna Dharma Global, transformed discarded kitchen oil into an alternative energy source after recognising its vast potential.

Speaking to Bernama recently, Muhammad Arif Arman said his experience in the aviation industry inspired them to find innovative methods to convert waste into renewable energy.

“It took us about eight months from last year to conduct extensive research and countless trial-and-error experiments to master the process of producing fuel from used cooking oil,” he said.

Armed with his engineering background and knowledge gained while studying at Universiti Kuala Lumpur, he said their perseverance finally paid off when, in February, their processed used oil began attracting interest from several aviation fuel suppliers.

ENGINEER-FUEL 2 KOTA BHARU

Muhammad Arif Arman explained that the production process involves several rigorous stages, including fine filtration to ensure the product meets the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification Corsia (ISCC CORSIA) standards.

He said the used cooking oil is collected from households, traders and companies across the East Coast states and Perak before being filtered, weighed and stored in tanks for further processing.

“We buy used cooking oil at between RM2.30 and RM3 per kilogramme, depending on the location. Every day, our team collects nearly 5,000 litres of used oil from several states for processing,” he said.

According to him, only oil derived from vegetable sources qualifies under ISCC CORSIA criteria, with preliminary checks made on the oil’s smell, colour and density to ensure compliance with required standards.

Once processed, the used cooking oil is delivered in batches of about 33,000 litres to Fima Bulking Group in Port Klang, then supplied to international aviation fuel companies.

“To date, our processed oil has received regular orders from several jet fuel suppliers in Amsterdam, Switzerland and the United States.

“This fuel can only be supplied to companies certified under ISCC CORSIA, and its use has been proven to reduce carbon emissions by up to four times compared to conventional kerosene,” said Muhammad Arif Arman, adding that the venture now generates a six-figure monthly income.

He hopes more Malaysians will recognise the economic and environmental value of used cooking oil.

“We want to prove that domestic waste such as used cooking oil can become a clean energy source for the future. The government is already moving towards commercialising Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and Malaysia is expected to begin the production of SAF before the end of 2025,” he added.

Accor’s offering balance hospitality supply chain emissions solutions is one of the many innovative solutions the company has sustainably adapted in their hospitality units. The company netted the award for offering “outstanding innovative sustainability solutions geared at attaining emission balance for a hospitality supply chain”.

Sustainability has become a media catchphrase within the hospitality sector after Accor Achieving Net Zero Together awards, yet the growing global awareness of building sustainably has made Accor trailblazing sustainability solutions within the hospitality sector widely known. The award highlights the importance of the need and increasing use of hospitality services for carbon neutral travel, inclusive of airplane, hotel and tour services. To travel sustainably as a tourist, you should understand the relationship carbon neutral services and transportation used and the hospitality services used, especially within the airline and tourist industries.

Accor’s ‘Achieving Net Zero Together’ Campaign – A Game Changer for Sustainability in the Hospitality Industry?

Accor’s ‘Achieving Net Zero Together’ Campaign is impressive among the competition. It reached out to suppliers in the decarbonization tier. This initiative launched in 2024 is responding to the hospitality industry’s carbon emissions with a tri-fold initiative. This is focused on decarbonization carbon maturity supply chain emission reduction and finally decarbonization supply chain emission reduction and promotion of low carbon suppliers and offers.

In 2025 Accor managed to onboard over 1,000 suppliers 77% of the groups total procurement in volume. This offers a good indicator of the hospitality industry’s decarbonization emission potential to the positive global net zero. Eco-conscious travelers are experiencing the return of fully ‘green’ energy in decarbonization hotels, zero waste food, and ecologically sustainable food sourced in the vicinity of accor hotels.

Visitors concerned about the environment expect that sustainability will be considered a standard part of the hospitality experience. It does not have to be an added-on option. For instance, the Accor group of companies provides luxurious accommodations and “eco- friendly ” boutique hotels and “eco- friendly” boutique properties. Accor provides proof that tourism and its adjuncts do not have to be at odds. As tourists book more eco-friendly alternatives, Accor points the way to the rest of the industry.

Accor’s Net Zero Commitment: Setting New Standards for the Airline Industry

Accor hospitality has been a leader in the industry in implementing “decarbonization” strategies. For several reasons, the airline hospitality industry has been and continues to be the “lowest” to adopt sustainable practices. This position is changing with the Accor Group. Airlines have been slow to adopt strategies to sustain their hospitality practices, just as hotels have. The airlines simply focus on “carbon offsets” as a way to bridge the gap.

More and more travelers are presented “eco-friendly” travel packages that include sustainable flights. Emirates, Qatar, and Singapore airlines have committed to completing “carbon neutral flights” and are using greener fuel and plane technologies.

How can airlines follow Accor’s example regarding sustainable procurement? Bringing all components of their business into line with sustainable practices can make a difference. Waste reduction on flights, local sourcing of inflight meal components, and emission offsetting are all sustainable practices that can lessen the airline industry’s environmental footprint.

Travel Trends: Airlines and Hotels Work Together to Offer Sustainable Travel Options

As travelers look for sustainable travel options, cooperation between hotels and airlines is bound to increase. Hotels are responding with greener practices, like sustainable operations, eco-friendly amenities, and energy-efficient rooms, while airlines are delivering more sustainable flights with better fuel efficiency. Both British Airways and Air France have set sustainability targets and are showcasing flights that meet Accor’s initiatives, demonstrating a commitment to greener tourism.

Sustainable tourism is on the rise, and with over 25 million tourists visiting France in 2025, it is being noticed. The demand for sustainable travel is increasing, and the airlines responded by offering more direct flights to popular green destinations, while eco-friendly hotels are launching green initiatives and certification programs.

Qatar Airways has started providing more eco-friendly flights to Doha, which has fancy hotels being built to green building certification. Eco-tourists can also book these green hotels for seamless eco-friendly trips.

Sustainable Tourism for Travelers

Since tourism is growing everywhere, we must also consider the negative impacts our travels have on the environment. Accor attaining this recognition at the 2025 WSTHA is a sign that the hospitality and airline industry can work together to reduce carbon gas emissions, and more importantly, for the travelers, it means more sustainable options to choose from while planning a trip.

As for eco travelers, a few important travel tips include:

Pick eco-friendly airports or airlines: More airlines are providing eco-friendly flights. Look out for airlines that are part of CORSIA like Lufthansa, Singapore, and Air New Zealand.

Book Eco-Friendly Hotels. Accor is an example of a hotel chain that offers eco-friendly options. Practicing sustainable tourism means providing green-certified hotels that give energy-efficient accommodations, waste reduction, and renewable energy.

Offset Your Carbon Emissions. Each traveler must offset flying carbon emissions, especially long-haul ones. Contributing to projects that counter balance the impact of your trip is a common offering to most airlines.

Pack Light. Carbon footprints can easily be reduced by packing light. Important to note is that airlines use less fuel and therefore, less emissions, when a plane is lighter.

Travel Off-Peak. Off-peak travel seasons reduce the environmental impact on heavily visited areas and reduce congestion at the destination.

The Importance of Sustainable Tourism

Tourism, especially in places like France, Italy, Spain, and Thailand, needs to be managed with a long-term perspective, especially in protecting the cultural and natural heritage of the planets and these areas. With the increasing trend of more sustainable tourism, tourists also need to be more responsible in their tourism choices as they impact the heritage sites and the local people.

Contributing to the planet’s conservation as a tourist is easy. First choose an eco-friendly airline, then a green certified hotel and finally a sustainable tourist spot. The climate crisis is global and pretends to be flexible, and thus, all of us in the tourism industry, including tourists, should all play our part.

Sustainable Travel Initiatives by Airlines and Hotels

Some airlines and hotels are taking the initiative to incorporate more sustainable practices. In the hotel industry, this is being spearheaded by Accor’s sustainable tourism initiative. In the airline sector, Air Canada, Delta Airlines, and United Airlines are implementing fuel-efficient aircraft, cutting down waste on flights and adopting ** eco-friendly practices** that reduce the use of plastic on flights and offer locally sourced meals to passengers.

Marriott, Hyatt, and Hilton are following closely behind Accor and starting sustainability practices, such as zero-emission buildings, plastic-free hotels, and energy-efficient lighting. Guests booking with these brands know their stay won’t hurt the environment as much.

How Airlines and Hotels Are Responding to Changing Traveler Demands

To adjust to the demand for more sustainable travel options, the hospitality and airline industries have to change. In the case of airlines, this includes more direct flights to “green” destinations, use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and better on-board waste management. In the case of hotels, this means building or renovating to reach LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, using renewable energy, and offering more sustainable options like low-flow showerheads and organic toiletries.

Both industries have also started working towards working carbon neutral. This is the first time airlines and hotels are collaborating together to reduce their carbon footprint and it will mark the beginning of a seamless sustainable travel experience.

Accor’s ‘Achieving Net Zero Together’ initiative has been recognized as the World’s Leading Climate Action Initiative at the 2025 World Sustainable Travel & Hospitality Awards (WSTHA). This prestigious award highlights the company’s commitment to sustainability, setting a new standard for the hospitality industry’s environmental efforts.

A Sustainable Future for Travel

Accor’s Achieving Net Zero Together initiative being recognized at the 2025 WSTHA is a critical moment for the airline and hospitality industries, proving that sustainability can and must be a pillar of the travel experience. Sustainable airlines and green, carbon-neutral, and waste-reducing hotels allow travelers to make environmentally responsible choices when flying and lodging.

So far, the slowdown at many of the nation’s busiest airports hasn’t caused widespread disruptions. But it has deepened the impact felt by the nation’s longest federal shutdown.

“We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” said Emmy Holguin, 36, who was flying from Miami Saturday to see family in the Dominican Republic. “I’m hoping that the government can take care of this.” Analysts warn that the upheaval will intensify and spread far beyond air travel if cancellations keep growing and reach into Thanksgiving week.

Already there are concerns about the squeeze on tourism destinations and holiday shipping.

Here’s what to know about the flight reductions:

How many flights have been cancelled?

Flight disruptions ticked up a bit on Saturday — typically a slow travel day — as each of the first two days creeped above 1,000 cancellations, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flights.

The airport serving Charlotte, North Carolina, was the hardest hit early on Saturday, with 130 arriving and departing flights canceled by mid-afternoon.

Airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, and Newark, New Jersey, also saw numerous disruptions. Ongoing staffing shortages in radar centers and control towers added to the cancellations and delays on Saturday at several East Coast airports, including those around New York City.

Not all the cancellations were due to the FAA order, and those numbers represent just a small portion of the overall flights nationwide. But they are certain to rise in the coming days if the slowdown continues.

The FAA said the reductions impacting all commercial airlines are starting at 4 per cent of flights at 40 targeted airports and will be bumped up again on Tuesday before hitting 10 per cent of flights on Friday.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that even more flight cuts might be needed if the government shutdown continues and more air traffic controllers are off the job.

Why are the flights being cancelled?

Air traffic controllers have gone without paychecks for nearly a month as the shutdown continues, leading many to call in sick and add to already existing staffing shortages.

Most controllers are working mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, and some are taking second jobs to pay their bills, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said.

How are passengers being affected?

Most were relieved to find that airlines largely stayed on schedule Friday, and those whose flights were called off were able to quickly rebook. So far, longer international flights haven’t been interrupted.

There is still a lot of uncertainty about what flights will be cancelled next.

And not everyone has the means to pay for a hotel or deal with a last-minute disruption, said Heather Xu, 46, who was in Miami on Saturday after a cruise and flying home to Puerto Rico.

“Travel is stressful enough. Then you put these disruptions in place and it really makes everything more challenging,” she said.

Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people are simply cancelling flights altogether.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/11/US-govt-shutdown-flights.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 23:16:47.203906

""It makes gas storage safer, greener, and more adaptable.""","Scientists at the National University of Singapore may have cracked one of the planet's biggest energy challenges.

The study, published in Nature Communications, demonstrates a promising new way to safely and efficiently store gas that's much greener than traditional methods.

""Natural gas and biomethane are important components in the energy mix today, but their storage and transport have long relied on methods that are either costly or carbon-intensive,"" said Professor Praveen Linga, the lead researcher, in an NUS press release.

Traditionally, it has been done either under high pressure or super-cold temperatures around -162 degrees Celsius (-259.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

Both require loads of energy and money. Even newer ""solidified natural gas"" methods are so slow that they're not practical at scale.

But, as Interesting Engineering reported, the team found that adding natural amino acids to water before freezing creates a biodegradable ""ice"" that captures methane gas in minutes rather than hours.

This amino-acid-modified ice can reach 90% storage capacity in just over two minutes, which is way faster than conventional gas storage methods.

Unlike chemical surfactants that can create pollution, the amino acids are fully biodegradable. The ice can also be reheated to release the stored gas as needed and refrozen for reuse — a closed-loop system that reduces waste and costs.

A faster, cleaner way to store natural gas and biomethane — the latter an important ""green gas"" in our clean energy transition — could reduce industrial waste and planet-heating pollution.

As burning dirty energy sources such as oil and coal continue to overheat our planet, the effects are visible around the world. From supercharged weather events, such as destructive hurricanes and devastating wildfires, to toxic fumes harming public health, human-generated pollution is taking its toll on our planet.

But companies, governments, and researchers are making big strides toward cleaner alternatives for powering our lives — such as biomethane plants and sustainable aviation fuel made by repurposing waste.

In the end, that means cleaner air for communities, cleaner oceans, more balanced ecosystems, and, ultimately, a safer future for all of us.

While researchers are still in the proof-of-concept stage with this discovery, their experiments have already been promising. If practically scaled, storing and transporting natural gas and biomethane would become more affordable and sustainable, opening opportunities to clean up other types of pollution.

“That would be the right point to announce that there will be a SAF mandate” to support demand, Mr Forshaw said.
“Singapore will derive that economic benefit, not Australia,” Mr Forshaw warned, noting that Singapore already has a massive SAF refining capability.
This year the UK introduced a two per cent SAF mandate.
This masthead put the aviation heavyweights’ concerns to the office of Mr Bowen, who is the climate change and energy minister.","In as little as six months Australia will be at risk of losing the chance to create a $13 billion-a-year industry – unless the Albanese government signals that planes will have to use biofuel, Airbus has warned.

The jet-building giant’s local chief executive Stephen Forshaw told this masthead that without a commitment from Canberra, local crops capable of feeding a new refining sector would instead be “hoovered up” by the likes of Singapore.

In September, Jim Chalmers and Chris Bowen announced $1.1bn of support to grow more feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

At the time, the government said it would consult on the production incentive structure until mid-2026.

“That would be the right point to announce that there will be a SAF mandate” to support demand, Mr Forshaw said.

He suggested beginning with a requirement of just one to two per cent of total consumption, rising to 10 per cent over time.

“We’ve got in the range of another six to 12 months before the window will really start to close on us,” he said, because the feedstock would begin to be “hoovered up”.

“Singapore will derive that economic benefit, not Australia,” Mr Forshaw warned, noting that Singapore already has a massive SAF refining capability.

Right now, no SAF is made in Australia.

Airbus is pushing for a SAF mandate because its business is doomed in the long-term unless its airline customers are able to reduce their carbon footprint. SAF offers the best opportunity.

Research commissioned by Airbus and Qantas has found domestic SAF production has the potential to contribute $13bn in GDP annually by 2040, supporting 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain and another 5000 to construct and run the refining facilities.

Qantas chief sustainability officer Fiona Messent shared Mr Forshaw’s concerns about the need for action, otherwise “a lot of the feedstock could be exported and tied up overseas rather than realising the economic gains here.”

SAF can be made from sugarcane, which Australia has in abundance. It can also be derived from canola. Already, more than 70 per cent of Australia’s canola is exported to Europe to be turned into SAF.

That biofuel can end up in the wing of a Qantas-branded Airbus departing London Heathrow. This year the UK introduced a two per cent SAF mandate. It will rise to 10 per cent by 2030, which is the same as Qantas’ self-imposed target.

In May, Qantas, Sydney Airport and Ampol combined forces to import nearly two million litres of SAF. It was made using waste cooking oil from restaurants in China.

Ms Messent said a domestic SAF sector was an ideal fit with the Albanese government’s Future Made in Australia agenda.

“It had such a clear economic benefit,” she said.

This masthead put the aviation heavyweights’ concerns to the office of Mr Bowen, who is the climate change and energy minister.

In response a spokeswoman said: “The government will continue engaging with industry on how to make sure Australian liquid fuel users have a fair chance to capture the emissions reduction potential unlocked by low-emission Australian fuels.”",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/90406a3f83feb05d19d90c5c879aefb9,N,,2025-11-08 14:16:33.922514

Mr Di Bella produces about 13,000 tonnes of cane annually outside Ingham, between Townsville and Cairns.

The qualified agronomist said the industry was currently too reliant on crystal sugar, the price of which had fallen to be barely above the cost of production.

Whenever it sinks below the cost of production, the industry has to wind back operations and go into “survival mode,” he said.

“If we stay with sugar alone we are not going to grow the pie,” Mr Di Bella said.

“Developing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry is going to allow us to grow that pie,” not just for farmers, but for harvesters and millers,” he added.

Mr Di Bella, 55, said two of his children – Hayden, 25, and Gemma, 17 – want to be part of the future of farming in the region.

SAF would all but cement that future.

Mr Di Bella lamented that people had been talking about the potential of biofuel in Australia for 20 years.

“In Australia we do all the talk and no action,” he said. “It’s time for action now.

“We’ve let everything go offshore. It’s time to do stuff at home.”

Mr Di Bella said he had seen SAF industries first-hand in Brazil and the US, which had been supported by governments through legislation and incentives.

The region’s mayor Ramon Jayo, who is also a cane farmer, said: “The economic reality is that we do need to diversify in the sugar industry. You simply can’t have all your eggs in one basket.”

SAF would be a complementary income stream.

“We can enjoy the benefits of having a multifaceted product,” Mr Jayo said.

As well as cutting carbon emissions, the move would reduce reliance on global supply chains that are increasingly susceptible to disruptions, with a recent strategy paper citing rising “tension in the Indo-Pacific” as one of many potential threats.

That paper also warned that Australia is one of the only nations in the developed world with no minimum reserves of liquid fuels for an emergency and that the country has “struggled” to meet its International Energy Agency 90-day stockpiling commitment.

Struggled is a euphemism – Australia consistently ranks last out of the more than 30 IEA member countries for oil holdings.

However, Defence has identified an opportunity arising from Australia’s incapability to provide a reliable flow of petroleum-based fuel in the event of supply chain breakdowns.

That opportunity is for Defence to use its sizeable fuel needs to influence the development of a local SAF industry.

Earlier this year, Defence began a trial of SAF at its RAAF base at East Sale, south east of Melbourne.

That SAF was imported. In the future, Defence wants the SAF it buys to be made here.

“We are seeking to source domestically … because that is getting after fuel security,” Director General Fuel Capability Brigadier Mark Baldock told this masthead.

The blend being used in the trial is five per cent SAF. Only the relative high price of SAF is stopping Defence from going higher.

“We have to increase the demand signal to drive the cost down,” Brigadier Baldock said.

At the moment, no SAF is made in Australia. But building work recently began on the first SAF refinery, at Townsville, Queensland.

This glaring omission exposes the Entertainment Society of Goa’s (ESG) continuing failure to nurture and promote local filmmakers, a tragic irony in the very land that hosts one of the world’s oldest and most celebrated film festivals, stated former Member of Governing Body of ESG Vishal Pai Cacode.

While crores are being splurged on red carpets, events, and cosmetic spectacles, Goan cinema continues to be starved of even the most basic support. The Goa Film Finance Scheme, which was meant to empower local producers and sustain regional cinema, has become almost dormant. Many Goan filmmakers have been struggling for years to access financial assistance trapped in endless paperwork, opaque criteria, and official apathy, said Vishal Pai Cacode.

Equally alarming is ESG’s failure to create even minimal film-making infrastructure in the state. Despite two decades of IFFI in Goa, there is still no proper editing studio, equipment bank, crane facility, or professional light and sound setup available for local use. The absence of such essential resources forces young filmmakers to rely on private vendors from outside Goa, drastically inflating production costs and discouraging local talent, he said.

Instead of investing in sustainable creative infrastructure and supporting Goan stories, ESG’s focus appears to have shifted entirely toward event management and commission-driven contracts. The result is a festival that glitters on the surface but fails to reflect the voices of the land that hosts it, Vishal Pai Cacode said.

""Beautiful color. Enjoy your new vehicle,"" praised one commenter, while another said, ""The red looks so good! Congrats. Got my first one in July and love it!""

So far, the new EV driver's only minor complaint concerns a potential upgrade for charging their phone inside this model. They prefer ""a modified pad for the Qi charging pad"" for their phone, since the rubber insert on the current model is a hindrance. However, they added, ""Works great when I remove the rubber insert.""

Despite the phone-charging dilemma, the EV owner's transition away from internal combustion engine cars is a healthy choice. Vehicle pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, ultrafine particles (UFPs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) linger in the air through tailpipe exhaust. This increases cancer risk along with respiratory and heart issues, according to the California Air Resources Board.

With zero tailpipe pollution, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and lithium batteries that can be recycled, EV usage can help clear and cool down the air on an overheating planet. Depending on your driving needs, you can even fill up at home and avoid vandalism at charging stations.

Plus, there's the impressive savings. According to a 2024 Atlas Public Policy study, EV owners generally save 40-65% on annual fuel costs versus gas-powered vehicle drivers. Thanks to fewer mechanical components, these green cars also help drivers save 4% on repair and maintenance costs.

Making your next car an EV is just one way to reduce your carbon footprint and work toward a cleaner, cooler future. Continue your energy-efficient conversion with induction stoves, heat pumps, and solar panel installation. Going solar can reduce your energy bill to as little as $0.

A home charging station powered by solar further reduces your EV charging costs, and EnergySage — a TCD-vetted source — can easily provide quotes from local installers and help you save up to $10,000 on solar installation.

Due to the upfront investment, buying a home solar system may not be possible for everyone, but leasing solar panels is an alternative for those looking to avoid high, fluctuating energy prices while also helping the planet.

Similarly, the aviation sector is expected to source 20% of its fuel from sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) by 2035, with a specific mandate for synthetic fuels known as e-SAF.
He emphasized the importance of translating the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan into concrete measures that will help bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and traditional fossil fuels.
Without such measures, the uptake of sustainable fuels may stall, undermining the significant investments already made in the shipping sector.","The European Commission has announced a significant €2.9 billion investment plan aimed at boosting sustainable fuel production for aviation and maritime transport by 2027. This initiative comes as the EU grapples with the challenge of decarbonizing heavy transport, which currently accounts for approximately 26.4% of emissions in the transport sector. With a binding climate goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the urgency to transition to greener alternatives has never been more pressing.

Investment Goals and Challenges Ahead

The European Commission’s new plan is designed to accelerate the development of renewable and low-carbon fuels, which are essential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from commercial aviation and shipping. Despite existing EU legislation aimed at promoting climate neutrality in these sectors, both remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The Commission emphasizes that achieving the EU’s climate goals will require a substantial increase in the availability of sustainable fuels, estimating a need for around 20 million tonnes by 2035. This ambitious target is projected to necessitate an investment of approximately €100 billion.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated, “The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future.” The funding will be drawn from the EU’s multiannual budget, which runs until 2027, and aims to support innovative technologies in renewable fuel production. Under current EU regulations, the maritime sector is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2% starting in 2025, with a target of an 80% reduction in GHG intensity by 2050. Similarly, the aviation sector is expected to source 20% of its fuel from sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) by 2035, with a specific mandate for synthetic fuels known as e-SAF.

Industry Reactions and Future Prospects

While the Commission’s plan has been welcomed by various stakeholders, challenges remain in scaling up the production of sustainable fuels. Currently, over 40 e-fuel production projects are in the planning stages within the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision. Issues such as the availability and cost of renewable energy, carbon capture technologies, and the energy intensity required for producing green hydrogen are significant hurdles that need to be addressed.

Feedstock availability and aviation demand challenge biofuel adoption in shipping

Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), highlighted the importance of reducing costs associated with sustainable aviation fuel to ensure air travel remains accessible. Meanwhile, Antony Froggatt from the campaign group Transport & Environment (T&E) expressed optimism about the Commission’s commitment to e-fuels but cautioned against the potential drawbacks of relying on biofuels. He stressed the need for a clear focus on e-fuels to ensure the success of the upcoming European Hydrogen Bank auction, which will allocate €300 million for aviation and maritime projects.

Jim Corbett, environmental director at the World Shipping Council, described the Commission’s initiative as a promising first step towards accelerating the energy transition in shipping. He emphasized the importance of translating the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan into concrete measures that will help bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and traditional fossil fuels. Without such measures, the uptake of sustainable fuels may stall, undermining the significant investments already made in the shipping sector.",https://nauticalvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/EU-Unveils-E2.9-Billion-Green-Fuel-Initiative.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 16:00:15.404845

Complete Interview with Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan

Q: Please provide an overview of your professional journey and leadership experience in the chemicals, sulfur processing, and clean technologies sectors. How have these experiences shaped your strategic vision at Elessent Clean Technologies in driving innovation and sustainability across industrial processes?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: I’ve had the privilege of wearing many hats throughout my career, working across a wide range of industries, including refining, chemicals, polymers, biotechnology, and engineering. Each experience has shaped how I view industrial transformation and sustainability.

My passion for clean technologies really took root during my time with Genencor and later DuPont, which acquired Genencor in 2012. At Genencor, I saw how biotechnology could be leveraged to create sustainable alternatives to traditional chemical and polymerization processes. That realization fundamentally changed how I think about innovation and its role in enabling a cleaner industrial future.

When I transitioned from the biotechnology side of DuPont to the engineering side with DuPont Clean Technologies (DCT), now Elessent Clean Technologies, it gave me a new perspective. I learned how traditional industrial processes can be made cleaner and more energy-efficient without adding prohibitive costs. That bridge between biotechnology and engineering helped shape my belief that sustainability and performance are not mutually exclusive — they can, and should, advance together.

At Elessent, I’ve worked closely with our team to continue expanding our emission reduction and energy-efficiency initiatives. Some of the technologies I’m particularly proud of include our next-generation regenerative sulfuric acid systems that virtually eliminate emissions; mist elimination technology that supports green hydrogen production; value-engineered heat recovery systems that make energy efficiency viable in developing regions; scrubbing solutions adapted for carbon capture; and novel hydroprocessing technologies that enable the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

These experiences have reinforced my core belief: industrial progress and environmental responsibility can, and must, go hand in hand. At Elessent, that’s the vision guiding everything we do as we help industries around the world transition to a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Q: What strategic factors led Elessent to acquire Sulphurnet, and how does this acquisition align with your long-term growth and technology expansion plans?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Sulphurnet is a specialist in advanced industrial filtration and sulfur processing: it offers tailored systems (pressure-leaf filters, self-cleaning candle filters, modular sulfur-melting & purification plants) designed for demanding process environments. Elessent’s core portfolio already includes process technologies for sulfuric acid production, alkylation, wet scrubbing, hydroprocessing, and other downstream chemical/metal/oil refining sectors.

By acquiring Sulphurnet, Elessent is able to integrate a highly specialized filtration and purification capability that complements and deepens its existing technology stack. This portfolio extension helps Elessent address a wider set of process needs from filtering sulfur feed streams to fully purifying and modularizing plant solutions.

The acquisition expands Elessent’s addressable market. Filtration and purification are relevant across sulfuric acid, chemical plants, chlorine, hydrogen, fertilizer, mining/metal processing and beyond. Sulphurnet already serves multiple industries (e.g., metal/mineral, edible oil, amine filtration) in addition to its sulfur business. Elessent can cross-sell its existing technologies into the customer base that Sulphurnet brings, and vice versa, unlocking growth opportunities.

Q: Sulphurnet specializes in advanced filtration and sulfur impurity removal technologies. Could you elaborate on how these capabilities complement Elessent’s existing portfolio across sulfuric acid, chemical, chlorine, and green hydrogen sectors?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Sulphurnet’s advanced filtration and impurity-removal capabilities fill a critical upstream gap in Elessent’s portfolio. It means Elessent can offer not just the process technology (e.g., sulfuric acid, chlor-alkali, hydrogen) but also the essential feed/purification modules that ensure that the plant runs reliably, efficiently, and with less risk. For customers, that translates into higher uptime, better product quality, lower maintenance cost, and stronger environmental performance, all of which reinforce Elessent’s value proposition in its target markets.

Q: How does integrating Sulphurnet’s technologies enhance operational efficiency, reliability, and sustainability for Elessent’s customers in critical industrial processes?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Sulphurnet’s filters remove impurities like ash and fine solids from molten sulfur, so downstream units like sulfuric acid converters and boilers run much smoother. That means less fouling, reduced pressure drop, and better overall performance. With built-in monitoring tools like turbidity analyzers and flowmeters, operators can make real-time adjustments and avoid unplanned shutdowns.

By keeping the feed clean, we reduce catalyst fouling and blockages, which extends run lengths and cuts maintenance costs. Sulphurnet’s modular and automated filter systems are also built to handle tough environments, adding a layer of protection that keeps the rest of the process running reliably.

Q: In what ways does the acquisition strengthen Elessent’s competitive position globally, and how will it influence your market expansion strategy in Europe and other key regions?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: The Sulphurnet acquisition strengthens Elessent’s global position by adding to our portfolio of solutions for our customers. We recognize that customers can have problems in their acid plants due to upstream impurities, and we want to provide that solution as part of our suite of reliability and performance enhancers for new plans and throughout the life of the plant.

Q: Filtration and impurity removal are critical for optimizing sulfur processing. How does Elessent plan to leverage Sulphurnet’s technology to drive innovation and address emerging environmental and regulatory challenges in the chemical industry?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Elessent is leveraging Sulphurnet’s advanced filtration technology to enhance efficiency, safety, and sustainability in sulfur processing operations. A key focus is the adoption of Self-Cleaning Candle Filters (SCCF) to replace traditional pressure leaf filters in sulfur plants.

Unlike conventional systems, SCCFs automate the cleaning process, eliminating the need for operators to open filter housings or manually remove filter cakes. This design reduces exposure risks, minimizes emissions, and supports compliance with tightening environmental and occupational safety regulations.

By integrating Sulphurnet’s technology, Elessent is delivering solutions that mitigate EHS risk, improve process reliability, and reduce total operating costs. This collaboration reflects Elessent’s broader strategy to drive innovation in clean technologies, helping customers meet evolving regulatory demands while advancing toward more sustainable, low-emission operations.

Q: What synergies are expected between Elessent and Sulphurnet in terms of R&D, product development, and commercial deployment of advanced process technologies?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: We see tremendous opportunity in combining Elessent’s process expertise with Sulphurnet’s specialized filtration capabilities to accelerate innovation across our shared markets. Together, we’re focused on optimizing existing process technologies and expanding our strengths in emission control, corrosion prevention, and energy efficiency, areas that have long defined our solutions.

Through close collaboration in product development and commercial deployment, particularly with our Brink® mist eliminator group, we plan to bring the same level of customer focus and technical excellence to the filtration needs of these processes. By aligning our capabilities, we can deliver more integrated, sustainable, and efficient solutions that help our customers meet evolving environmental and operational challenges.

Q: During the integration of Sulphurnet, what operational or organizational challenges do you anticipate, and what measures are being implemented to ensure a smooth transition for customers and partners?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Elessent has established a dedicated integration team composed of both technical and functional experts from across the organization. This team has been meeting weekly for several months, first to conduct detailed planning and preparation, and now to track progress against defined objectives and make refinements as needed. The integration roadmap was developed collaboratively and is supported by clear governance and communication channels to maintain alignment between all parties.

Because of this extensive upfront planning and structured execution approach, we do not foresee any disruptions or challenges for customers or partners. Our focus remains on maintaining seamless operations, continuity of service, and a unified experience across both organizations throughout the integration process.

Q: Looking ahead, does Elessent plan to replicate similar acquisitions or partnerships to expand its technological capabilities in the clean technology and green hydrogen sectors?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Sulphurnet was a great first acquisition for us. From the very beginning, it was clear that we shared the same philosophy and vision: a strong focus on technology leadership, robustness, and putting the customer at the center of everything we do. That alignment has made the integration process very natural, and we’ve already identified a number of joint opportunities where our combined expertise adds real value for our customers.

The success we’ve seen with Sulphurnet reinforces my belief that this type of strategic, bolt-on acquisition is the right path forward for Elessent. When you find partners that complement your strengths, share your commitment to innovation, and are driven by the same customer-centric mindset, it creates tremendous potential for growth.

Q: Is Elessent leveraging digital tools, market intelligence, or advanced analytics to optimize process efficiency, monitor industry trends, and maximize the impact of Sulphurnet’s technologies across global operations?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Elessent is in the early stages of integrating Sulphurnet’s technologies into our global platform, and while it is still too soon to point to specific digital tools or analytics systems being deployed, the integration process is strategically focused on building organizational readiness and alignment, specifically, by educating Elessent’s global sales network on Sulphurnet’s full suite of offerings. This ensures that our commercial teams across all regions are equipped to introduce Sulphurnet’s advanced sulfur filtration and separation solutions to sulfuric acid producers worldwide.

At the same time, we are working to integrate Sulphurnet’s engineering and design expertise into Elessent’s broader technology and project-execution platforms. This integration is critical for establishing a unified foundation that will later support the application of digital tools, process optimization models, and analytics capabilities across global operations.

His timing could not have been better.

Sustainability was the hot concept across the corporate world as consumers became increasingly aware of climate change.

Aviation insiders worried that headlines about the public’s concerns about the climate impacts of flying — which contributes to about 2.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emission each year — would soon hurt airlines’ profits.

The industry looked to sustainable aviation fuel, a type of jet fuel made from organic materials such as greases, food scraps and yard waste.

In Smoot’s case, the fuel would be made from the wood byproducts of the timber and mill industries. He even had a planned partnership in 2019 to provide the fuel to Delta, which Delta recently confirmed is active.

While he has locked his sights on the Port of Longview’s Barlow Point, Smoot’s project still must secure tens of millions in development capital investment to determine if the site will work — and he has to do it before the political winds change.

Clean energy future

“Out of 100 projects, a very tiny percentage come to fruition,” said Neil Maunu, who runs the powerful, Vancouver-based Pacific Northwest Waterways Association trade group comprised of ports, businesses and public agencies looking to stimulate economic development on the region’s waterways.

It’s still unclear if Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels’ sustainable aviation fuel effort will be the project to break through. And current events don’t offer much clarity.

An August investigation by Reuters found airlines have announced 165 sustainable aviation fuel projects in the past dozen years, but only 36 have materialized.

“Reuters found that the airline industry’s plans to go green before regulators start penalizing them are little more than a pipe dream,” it concluded.

Clean energy projects also have been killed en masse during the second Trump administration.

President Donald Trump has successfully pushed many of the country’s larger companies to abandon their climate goals, including some airlines.

And Delta’s CEO has signaled his support for the Trump administration.

Yet both Delta and Trump’s actions defy simple explanations.

Delta has criticized some administration policies, and a company spokesperson confirmed to The Daily News that it is maintaining its climate goals.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has extended Biden-era tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel production and supported at least one Northwest project.

And Washington has its own incentives, creating a particularly favorable environment for these kinds of energy projects.

Ultimately, demand for the fuel and the economic forces driving it may be the deciding factor in the commodity’s future.

Airlines already have started to face fines in Europe for not meeting ecological goals.

Production goals

Locally, Sea-Tac airport officials say they will power every flight fueled there with at least a 10 percent locally produced sustainable aviation fuel by 2028. A spokesperson for the airport said almost none of the 600 million gallons of jet fuel used at the facility each year is from sustainable sourcing right now.

But the goal stands, Perry Cooper, media relations manager for the airport, said by email.

“We’ve done the studies on how to get (the fuel) here but, no, there is not a supplier here yet,” he wrote.

Sea-Tac is a regional hub for Delta and one of the airports Smoot said would use his fuel.

The U.S. EPA on Nov. 7 issued decisions on 16 small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions filed by eight small refineries. The agency granted full exemptions to two petitions, partial (50%) exemptions to 12 petitions, and denied two petitions.

The SRE program allows eligible small refiners, defined as those that process no more than 75,000 barrels per day of crude oil, to petition the EPA seeking exemptions of their Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume requirements (RVOs) for a given RFS compliance year.

For an SRE petition to be approved, the refiner must demonstrate “disproportionate economic hardship” in satisfying its RVO requirements. As part of the SRE application process, the U.S. Department of Energy is tasked with analyzing and scoring SRE petitions. The EPA, however, makes the final determination to approve or deny each petition.

According to information released by the EPA, the agency has fully approved one SRE petition for RFS compliance year 2023 and one for RFS compliance year 2024. The 50% partial approvals include four for compliance year 2021, two for compliance year 2022, four for compliance year 2023, and two for compliance year 2024. The two denials include one each for compliance year 2023 and 2024.

On a combined basis, the approvals have reduced the total RVO for all four years by 740 million renewable identification numbers (RINs). This includes 150 million RINs for 2021, 70 million RINs for 2022, 250 million RINs for 2023 and 260 million RINs for 2024.

The EPA also updated its online SRE data dashboard, showing one new SRE petition has been filed since mid-October. That petition, filed by Kern Oil & Refining Co., seeks a waiver of the 2025 RVOs for its facility in Bakersfield, California.

There are now 15 SRE petitions pending, including two filed for RFS compliance year 2023, one for RFS compliance year 2024 and 12 for RFS compliance year 2025.

The Nov. 7 action on 16 SRE petitions follows the EPA’s Aug. 22 decisions on 175 SRE petitions filed by 38 small refineries for compliance years 2016-2024. In that action, the EPA granted full exemptions to 63 petitions, granted partial (50%) exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions and determined 7 petitions to be ineligible.

In documentation released Nov. 7, the EPA issued a correction to its Aug. 22 action, noting it “erroneously provided a partial exemption for the 2020 compliance year to a small refinery that should have been provided a full exemption.” The agency attributed the mistake to a clerical error made by DOE in transcribing the metric from the scoring rationale to the DOE matrix. To correct the error, the EPA has changed the partial approval for that SRE application to a full approval.

As part of its Nov. 7 announcement, the EPA said it is reaffirming the agency’s policy of returning RINs previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. While no actual RINs will be returned today, EPA said will follow standard agency policy and instruct those impacted to contact the EPA Fuels Program Helpdesk to initiate the RINs return process.

Moving forward, the EPA said it is committed to ruling on SRE applications within the statutory 90-day review period.

The agency also briefly addressed the supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) it issued in September that addresses how the agency plans to reallocate waived SRE volumes moving forward. The comment period on that SNRPM closed Oct. 31. In its Nov. 7 announcement, the EPA said it “is reviewing comments on the supplemental proposed rule as the agency continues to work on final regulations for the “Set 2” rule. As stated in the SNPRM, EPA intends to update the agency’s projections of exempted gasoline and diesel volumes in the final rule based on any additional SREs issued after the proposal, including the petition decisions in this action.”

The Renewable Fuels Association criticized the EPA’s new SRE approvals. “Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “EPA added another 14 small refinery exemptions to the already-massive pile today, based on the agency’s questionable new approach to determining whether those refiners experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship.’ We continue to dispute the notion that SREs are warranted at all, as EPA’s own analysis shows that all refiners—large and small—face a proportional RFS compliance obligation and pass their RIN costs through to buyers of their refined products. The silver lining here is that EPA is returning expired RINs to the six refineries who were granted exemptions from their 2021 and 2022 RFS obligations. However, more than 500 million valid RINs will be issued to eight refineries who were gifted exemptions from their 2023 and 2024 obligations, meaning there are now more than 2.5 billion RINs associated with 2023-2025 SREs that are likely to be dropped back onto the market in the months ahead. If EPA fails to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RVOs, the impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating. Today’s decision further underscores the crucial need for EPA to finalize 2026-2027 RVOs that fully reallocate any and all SREs granted, or expected to be granted, for the 2023-2027 compliance years.”

The EPA in late 2022 began publishing basic data on the each SRE petition filed with the agency, including company name, location and compliance year. A full copy of that data is available below.

Вице-министр энергетики Кайырхан Туткышбаев и директор Европейского и Североатлантического регионального бюро международной организации гражданской авиации (ИКАО) Николя Ралло обсудили вопросы внедрения и производства устойчивого авиационного топлива SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) в Казахстане.

Что говорят в Минэнерго

В министерстве энергетики сообщили о заинтересованности в реализации проекта по производству устойчивого авиационного топлива совместно с американской компанией LanzaJet.

Кайырхан Туткышбаев отметил, что отечественные нефтеперерабатывающие заводы готовы в кратчайшие сроки перейти на производство авиатоплива марки Jet A-1.

В минэнерго также рассказали о планах увеличить с 2026 по 2032 год производство авиатоплива на казахстанских заводах до 1,7 млн тонн.

Для чего переход на Jet A-1

Jet A-1 ‒ это традиционное ископаемое реактивное топливо, а Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ‒ это альтернативное топливо из возобновляемых источников. SAF разработан для замены Jet A-1, чтобы сделать перелёты более экологичными.

Почему это важно для экологии

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ‒ это альтернативное экологически чистое авиационное топливо, производимое из возобновляемых источников, а не из нефти.

Оно значительно снижает выбросы парниковых газов по сравнению с традиционным авиакеросином и может смешиваться с ним для использования в существующих самолетах без модификации двигателей.

SAF производится из различного сырья, такого как отработанные масла, сельскохозяйственные отходы, растительные и животные жиры, а также из спиртов и синтетических процессов.

Таким образом, Казахстан намерен сократить выбросы парниковых газов в отечественном авиационном секторе.

Что еще

Владелец международного аэропорта ""Сары-Арка"" в Караганде Ерлан Оспанов в интервью BES.media ранее отмечал, что решающее влияние на цену билетов вносят расходы на топливо, обслуживание самолётов и дефицит воздушных судов.

По данным International Council on Clean Transportation, устойчивое авиационное топливо (SAF) сейчас в 2-5 раз дороже обычного авиакеросина.

Кроме того, технологии производства биотоплива могут быть более сложными и дорогими. Поэтому все эти факторы могут повлиять на цену авиабилетов в сторону повышения.",https://img.bes.media/besmedia-photobank/media/2025-11-08/04be2312-e54e-480c-8f77-60dd655ce8ba.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 12:56:54.032011

This move comes as the European Union intensifies efforts to ensure passengers receive accurate information about airline sustainability, where the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network in the EU has launched a framework requiring airlines to clarify environmental claims.

21 European Airlines Commitments

It has been reported that many carriers across Europe have historically marketed “green fares” or sustainable aviation fuel in ways passengers often misinterpreted as offsetting flight emissions directly.

Therefore, twenty-one airlines have been asked to enhance transparency and avoid vague green terminology that could mislead customers.

Marketing language suggesting that purchasing a “green fare” directly neutralizes carbon emissions will no longer be permitted. The commitment is intended to prevent passengers from overestimating the environmental impact of individual flights.

Lufthansa and KLM, Air France, Finnair, and EasyJet have committed to clear communication about sustainability. Other signatories include Ryanair, Norwegian, TAP, SAS, SWISS, Brussels Airlines, Volotea, Vueling, Luxair, Eurowings, Air Dolomiti, Transavia, and Air Baltic.

Europe’s Greenwashing Concerns

For years, airlines have faced criticism for overstating their environmental efforts. Claims of sustainable fuel usage and carbon-neutral flights often lacked transparency and verifiable evidence.

Consumers have increasingly questioned the legitimacy of such statements, prompting regulatory oversight, with Paddle Your Own Kanoo reporting:

Airlines will now clearly differentiate between general sustainability initiatives and direct carbon offset programs. This distinction ensures that passengers understand that buying a ticket labeled “green” does not equate to a net reduction of emissions for their specific journey.

Closer to the Implementation Measures

Airlines will now conduct internal audits of all marketing material, including websites, booking platforms, and advertising campaigns, to ensure sustainability claims are fully accurate.

Compliance teams will verify that terms like “carbon-neutral flight” or “green fare” are only used when emissions offsets are fully traceable and verified.

Carrier websites and apps will include transparent sustainability reporting, showing data such as fleet fuel efficiency improvements, adoption rates of sustainable aviation fuels, and corporate carbon-reduction achievements.

Passengers will be able to see exactly what portion of emissions is offset and which initiatives contribute to the overall environmental impact.

Regulatory oversight will also require airlines to submit annual progress reports to the EU Consumer Protection Cooperation Network.

These reports must document how marketing language has been corrected, how passenger communications have improved, and what measurable reductions in carbon emissions the airline has achieved.

This ensures accountability and ongoing adherence to the greenwashing prevention framework.

Bottom Line

European airlines, including Lufthansa Group and KLM, are committing to transparent environmental claims just as the aviation sector accounts for roughly 2.5 % of global CO₂ emissions.

With mandates such as the ReFuelEU Aviation targeting up to 70 % usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2050, the industry is finally aligning its marketing with measurable decarbonisation goals.

As a result, passengers can trust clearer, verifiable information on sustainable travel—and the carriers willing to lead are setting a bold new standard for the aviation industry’s integrity and future.

The European Commission announced a €2.9 billion plan to scale up investments in green fuels by 2027 to curb carbon dioxide emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which together account for roughly 26.4% of EU transport-sector emissions.

The plan to step up financing for sustainable fuels in shipping and aviation by 2027 comes as the bloc is falling short of decarbonizing heavy transport by 2050.

The European Commission announced a €2.9 billion plan to scale up investments in green fuels by 2027 to curb carbon dioxide emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which together account for roughly 26.4% of EU transport-sector emissions.

With the EU’s binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonize, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

“The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,” said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU’s multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

“Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

“Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,” A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission’s plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,” Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only “detract from” commitments to e-fuels.

“It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production”, T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission’s plan was a “promising first step” to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.

“WSC is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers. Without this, production and uptake will stall despite significant fleet investments already made by the liner shipping sector,” read the statement.

Announced in Brussels in early November 2025, the plan represents one of the largest coordinated investment frameworks ever assembled for clean transport, with €2.9 billion already earmarked through 2027 to attract private co-investment.

The goal is to deliver roughly 20 million tones of sustainable fuels by 2035, about 13.2 million tones of biofuels and 6.8 million tones of synthetic e-fuels, aligning Europe’s aviation and maritime sectors with its 2050 net-zero ambitions and signaling a turning point in the global race to decarbonize heavy transport.

At its core, the STIP is an industrial strategy as much as it is a climate plan. It seeks to stabilise investor confidence by offering long-term regulatory clarity and mechanisms that reduce financial risk for early movers in the clean fuels market. This approach blends policy certainty with targeted financing through the Innovation Fund, Horizon Europe, InvestEU, and the European Hydrogen Bank.

Already, €300 million has been allocated to fast-track hydrogen-based aviation and maritime fuels, while additional funding is being channeled into synthetic fuel innovation and maritime decarbonization projects. By creating a single, unified framework for investment, the European Commission hopes to overcome the fragmented funding landscape that has slowed the scaling of clean fuels in the past decade.

For Europe, the economic rationale is straightforward: its aviation and shipping sectors are among the most carbon-intensive, together accounting for around 8 percent of the bloc’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonizing these sectors is crucial not only for climate targets but also for maintaining industrial competitiveness.

The STIP’s design reflects that duality, it anchors environmental goals in a wider strategy of energy sovereignty, job creation, and technological leadership. Yet, the ripples of this plan extend far beyond Europe’s borders. For Africa, it represents both an opportunity and a challenge that will shape the continent’s emerging sustainability agenda.

Europe’s pursuit of 20 million tones of sustainable fuels by 2035 will create vast demand for feedstocks, from agricultural residues to energy crops and green hydrogen. Africa, with its abundant land, solar potential, and proximity to European markets, is naturally positioned to become a supplier in this new value chain. However, the question is not simply whether Africa can supply Europe’s clean fuel needs, but whether it can do so in a way that drives its own industrial transformation rather than perpetuating raw material dependence.

Current production levels tell a sobering story. Global sustainable aviation fuel output stood at about 1 million tones in 2024, expected to double to 2 million tones in 2025. To meet its target, Europe will need a tenfold increase in production capacity within a decade, a scale-up that will almost certainly reach into Africa’s bioeconomy.

Countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa already feature in feasibility studies for feedstock cultivation and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production. The World Bank and regional energy agencies have identified technical potential for domestic production, but commercial viability remains constrained by high capital costs, infrastructure gaps, and uncertain policy environments.

To understand the stakes, consider that a medium-scale SAF plant requires hundreds of millions of dollars in upfront investment, along with long-term purchase guarantees to remain financially viable. Without such mechanisms, Africa risks remaining an exporter of crude bio-feedstocks, oilseeds, molasses, waste oils, instead of refining these materials into high-value fuels domestically. The result would replicate the extractive dynamics seen in past commodity cycles: exporting raw materials while importing finished products at a premium.

The economics are equally pressing for African airlines. Fuel accounts for more than 30 percent of operational costs across the continent, a figure far above the global average. Locally produced sustainable fuels could, over time, offer a pathway to cost stability and emissions compliance, especially as international regulations tighten. Yet, at present, SAF costs several times more than conventional jet fuel, and without subsidy or policy support, few African carriers can afford the transition. The danger is that Europe’s subsidies and policy certainty will accelerate its own clean-fuel markets while leaving Africa outside the value chain.

There are, however, signs of strategic alignment. Morocco and Namibia are already positioning themselves as green hydrogen exporters, leveraging abundant renewable energy to serve both European and regional demand. South Africa’s green fuels roadmap also envisions producing synthetic jet fuels for export and domestic use. These early moves suggest that Africa can do more than supply feedstocks, it can manufacture, refine, and export clean fuels, provided that investment, infrastructure, and governance frameworks evolve in step.

The implications of Europe’s STIP are profound; It challenges policymakers to act deliberately, to create regulatory clarity, land safeguards, and industrial incentives that ensure green fuel production contributes to domestic growth and job creation. It also underscores the importance of strategic partnership: Europe’s demand for low-carbon fuels could finance Africa’s renewable infrastructure if structured equitably.

The EU’s plan ultimately underscores a shared global truth: the transition to clean energy is no longer about isolated climate action; it is about industrial positioning in a changing global economy. For Africa, the window to define its role in that transition is open but narrowing. Whether the continent becomes a participant in the new clean-fuel economy or remains a supplier of raw inputs will depend on how quickly it mobilizes policy, finance, and technology to align sustainability with competitiveness.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel.webp,N,,2025-11-08 04:16:31.490321

On the ground, the airline introduced ‘Emirates First’, an exclusive check-in experience for First Class passengers and Platinum Skywards members at Dubai Airport. The brand also unveiled new retail concept stores in Accra, Bangkok, Geneva, Jakarta, Mauritius, Osaka, Seoul, and Singapore, reinforcing its customer engagement strategy.

Sustainability remained a focus, with Emirates uplifting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at 37 airports and joining the Aviation Circularity Consortium to promote circular economy initiatives within aviation.

In brand visibility, Emirates signed multi-year partnerships with FC Bayern Munich, Real Madrid Basketball, and European Professional Club Rugby, while extending sponsorships with the ATP Tour and Olympique Lyonnais through 2030.

Passenger traffic increased by 4 per cent to 27.8 million, while Emirates SkyCargo transported 1.25 million tonnes of freight, up 4 per cent from last year. Though cargo yields softened by 6 per cent , demand for specialised logistics remained steady. Emirates also launched Courier Express, a door-to-door express shipping service for global businesses.

But the same AI systems can accelerate materials innovation, energy efficiency, and carbon removal.","Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund (CIF) just passed its first five-year milestone, and its impact is starting to reshape how corporate climate finance scales emerging technologies. What began in 2020 as a US$1 billion commitment to back solutions that didn’t yet exist at commercial scale has now mobilized roughly US$12 billion in broader climate tech financing.

The company has deployed over US$800 million so far across 67 startups and projects focused on carbon removal, low-carbon building materials, green steel, and AI-driven energy efficiency.

Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa says the results show how corporate capital can move markets. “Big goals need bold bets,” she explains. “We needed to invest in technologies that were not yet at commercial scale—or, in some cases, didn’t yet exist.”

Today, those early bets are maturing into real projects, commercial plants, and large-scale carbon removal contracts. And while the tech giant still faces rising emissions linked to rapid growth in AI and data centers, CIF is now shaping supply chains that could determine how green the digital economy can be.

Pushing the Frontier: Turning Climate Concepts into Scaled Solutions

When CIF launched, Microsoft (MSFT stock) had announced its plan to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. But the technologies needed to meet those goals were nowhere near ready. The fund was designed not to chase short-term returns, but to bring solutions to market that could eventually work at a global scale.

This approach meant:

Backing early-stage innovators before mainstream capital steps in

Acting as a first commercial buyer to prove demand

Pairing investment with procurement commitments to create real offtake pipelines

This strategy is what underpins CIF’s multiplier effect. For every dollar Microsoft has invested, approximately fifteen additional dollars have followed from other investors and institutions. That shift—moving innovations from pilot stage to bankable scale—has helped de-risk markets such as carbon removal, low-carbon cement, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Nakagawa puts it simply: “We’re helping move bold ideas off the sidelines and into real-world systems.”

Targeting High-Emissions Supply Chains: Steel, Cement, and Infrastructure Materials

One of CIF’s most direct priorities is reducing emissions tied to Microsoft’s own fast-growing infrastructure footprint. The company plans to spend about US$80 billion on data centers in fiscal 2025.

Data center construction is steel- and cement-heavy, and the energy use associated with CPUs and GPUs makes operations carbon-intensive. Recent examples show this strategy in motion:

Green Steel for Data Centers: Microsoft signed a deal with Stegra, producing steel with up to 95% fewer emissions. This steel will be used directly in data center equipment and building structures.

Low-Carbon Cement: The company has backed Fortera to build a 400,000-ton-per-year commercial facility producing a cement alternative that cuts emissions by about 70% compared to the standard Portland cement process.

These are not pilot projects—they are commercial facilities aimed at reshaping global heavy industry. The real signal is scale.

Leading the Corporate Carbon Removal Market

Microsoft has also become the world’s largest corporate buyer of carbon removal. The company has secured more than 30 million tonnes of removal commitments—spanning direct air capture, enhanced weathering, biomass burial, and engineered mineralization.

The deals include:

Vaulted Deep → Up to 4.9 million tonnes of permanent CO₂ removal by 2038

UNDO → 28,900 tonnes via enhanced rock weathering

Multiple multi-year agreements with DAC and ocean alkalinity innovators

These agreements are crucial because the voluntary carbon market remains uneven in quality. By enforcing rigorous verification standards and long-term contracts, Microsoft is shaping the market’s baseline expectations for durability and transparency.

Yet, the company’s own emissions are still rising. Scope 3 emissions have increased by 26% from their 2020 baseline. It’s largely due to the energy and materials required to build and power AI data centers. The question now is whether procurement-backed project financing can scale fast enough to help reverse that trend.

AI as an Accelerator: Climate Intelligence at Industrial Scale

CIF’s portfolio is increasingly leaning into AI-driven solutions. The logic is simple: decarbonization requires massive system optimization—across supply chains, grids, industrial processes, and land systems. AI is one of the few tools that can do that at speed.

Microsoft has invested in companies that use AI to:

Model and predict wildfire and forest restoration needs

Improve grid efficiency and transmission line monitoring

Analyze soil carbon and regenerative farming impact

Optimize renewable power dispatch and microgrid performance

The company now argues that AI is not just powering emissions—it’s critical to reducing them. But the energy footprint of AI remains a pressing challenge, which is why Microsoft is also advancing partnerships that combine AI deployment with co-development of clean energy.

AI Partnerships with ADNOC, Masdar, and XRG to Transform Industrial Energy Systems

A new collaboration between Microsoft, ADNOC, Masdar, and XRG shows how AI can help decarbonize the energy sector. Under the agreement, Microsoft and ADNOC will co-develop AI agents to support more autonomous and efficient industrial operations, building on ADNOC’s existing AI deployment.

Microsoft will provide advanced AI tools and upskilling programs, while all partners will help create an innovation ecosystem focused on cleaner energy production, efficient data centers, and large-scale clean power development.

This partnership signals a crucial shift: AI is not just improving digital systems—it is starting to reshape physical industrial infrastructure. By aligning software innovation with clean energy development, the collaboration aims to reduce operational emissions and support the sustainable expansion of the global AI and data center economy.

Brad Smith, Microsoft’s Vice Chair, said it clearly:

“No single company or industry can meet this moment alone. Accelerating the transition to a more sustainable, secure, and inclusive energy future requires deep collaboration between governments, energy providers, technology companies, and innovators everywhere.”

The Path Forward

Microsoft’s climate investments are reshaping key segments of the decarbonization landscape. Yet the company is also confronting the reality that the AI boom is increasing its emissions faster than its solutions are reducing them.

This is the dual challenge now facing almost every technology leader:

AI is driving explosive demand for compute, energy, and infrastructure.

But the same AI systems can accelerate materials innovation, energy efficiency, and carbon removal.

The question is not whether AI will shape climate action. It already is. The real question is whether companies move quickly enough to align AI growth with a net-zero transition.

As CIF’s first five years show, early capital and clear purchasing signals can move entire markets. The next five years will determine whether those markets grow fast enough.

The European Union has announced a €3 billion investment package to accelerate the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), signaling a decisive shift from pilot projects to commercial industrial scale. This development immediately de-risks the capital investment required for new SAF manufacturing plants by creating a stable, integrated market and guaranteeing long-term buyers. The funding is a direct response to the mandatory blending targets set by the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which requires a minimum of 2% SAF by 2025. The most important data point demonstrating the scale of this commitment is the €3 billion allocated to build new SAF plants and attract necessary private investment.

Context

The core question for the aviation sector has been whether SAF production could ever reach commercial viability at scale, given the high price premium. SAF was, on average, €2,085 per tonne in 2024, compared to €734 per tonne for conventional jet fuel, making it two to three times more expensive. This cost gap and the associated investment risk have historically slowed the capital commitments necessary to achieve the economies of scale that would lower prices.

Analysis

This industrial acceleration is caused by a policy-driven mandate meeting a new financial mechanism. The ReFuelEU regulation created mandatory demand, but the high capital cost of new plants stalled supply. The EU’s solution is a “pooled double auction” mechanism, which will match fuel producers with guaranteed buyers at pre-agreed prices. This mechanism provides the long-term revenue certainty that investors require to finance multi-billion-euro industrial facilities.

Manufacturers are expected to react by moving final investment decisions forward on new plants, particularly those focused on synthetic aviation fuels, which were absent from the fuel mix in 2024. Think of the pooled auction like a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for fuel: it stabilizes the revenue stream and unlocks private capital.

Outlook

This development implies that the aviation sector’s decarbonization pathway is now structurally supported by industrial policy, moving the risk from the producer to the collective market. The simple thing to watch next is the success of the first “pooled double auction” in early 2026. A successful auction will immediately trigger final investment decisions for the next wave of commercial-scale SAF plants, particularly those using synthetic pathways, and will be the clearest signal that the EU’s integrated market strategy is working.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bioregional-Design-Principles-Integrating-Cultural-Heritage-and-Circular-Economy-Innovations-for-Anthropocene-Resilience.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 11:00:12.765881

“All these airlines have committed to stop claiming that the CO2 emissions of a specific flight could be neutralised, offset, or directly reduced by consumer financial contributions to climate protection projects or for the use of alternative aviation fuels,” the commission stated.

In addition, the term “sustainable aviation fuel” should only be used with appropriate clarification and vague “green language” should be avoided under the agreement.

Flights have a major impact on the environment due to greenhouse gases and other emissions. Many airlines offer compensation at the time of booking - often financial support for a climate protection project such as reforestation.

However, this system, which critics refer to as “indulgence trading”, is not considered to be accurate, as it does not offset a passenger’s own specific CO2 emissions but contributes to climate protection in general. This gives air travellers the impression that they are flying climate neutrally.

Four points of criticism at Luxair

At Luxair, the four points of criticism - that have since been resolved - were the claim that the emissions of a particular flight could be offset by contributions to climate projects, the use of unclear or unfounded “green” terms or images or implicit environmental statements, the use of statements about future environmental targets such as “net zero” without appropriate justification and an unclear and non-transparent use of CO2 emissions calculators.

IDB Debuts “Amazonia Bond” to Fund High-Impact ESG Initiatives

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has raised $100 million from its first Amazonia Bond. This funding will support important environmental and social projects throughout the Amazon region.

This first bond comes after the Amazonia Bond platform was launched in July 2025 by the IDB and the World Bank. The platform aims to attract private investment for sustainable development in the Amazon. The IDB hopes to raise up to $1 billion with more bonds in the future.

The program will use the funds for projects that fight deforestation, land damage, and illegal mining. It will also support good governance, climate resilience, and social inclusion. Projects must meet three main goals: reduce poverty, protect natural resources, and encourage inclusive, sustainable growth.

After this bond was issued, Brazil’s National Treasury showed interest in possibly issuing its own sovereign bonds under the Amazon Bonds Guidelines.

Over 20 Airlines Agree to Revise Environmental Claims After Greenwashing Probe

The European Commission has made a deal with over 20 airlines, such as Air France, Lufthansa, and KLM, to change or remove misleading environmental claims. Some airlines had suggested that paying extra fees or using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could completely cancel out flight emissions.

This decision came after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023. The group said airlines misled passengers with false “green” marketing and called for refunds of deceptive environmental surcharges.

After the complaint, the EU Commission and Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) found several examples of greenwashing. These included using unclear terms like “sustainable” or “responsible” and making net-zero promises without proof. Airlines have now agreed to make sure all environmental statements are accurate, clear, and backed by evidence.

Companies committed to clean energy and corporate transparency should use ESG solutions.

Senate Republicans Oppose Resolution Aimed at Prohibiting Military Intervention in Venezuela

Senate Republicans voted 51 to 49 on Thursday to block a measure that would have stopped the Trump administration from taking military action in Venezuela without approval from Congress. Most Republicans opposed the measure, but Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski joined Democrats in supporting it.

Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia and co-sponsor of the resolution, said it was meant to prevent a possible land invasion of Venezuela. He stressed that the resolution addressed more than just recent U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America.

Those against the measure argued that the president has full authority as commander in chief. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, described Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro as an “existential threat” and defended the administration’s right to take military action.

The vote came after reports of at least 15 U.S. military strikes in the region since September, which have led to more than 60 deaths.

The plan addresses several long-standing weaknesses in the EU’s aviation decarbonisation strategy, but more action is still needed, IATA said.
The Association said: “Aircraft operators require a predictable SAF market with clear price transparency to plan the integration of SAF into their daily operations effectively.
“Under the current regulatory framework, aircraft operators are exposed to unjustifiably higher prices for jet fuel and SAF.

The plan addresses several long-standing weaknesses in the EU’s aviation decarbonisation strategy, but more action is still needed, IATA said.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said: “We welcome the Commission’s recognition of market challenges that derive from SAF mandates that were flawed from the outset, particularly the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels, and the need for robust investment support.

“Extending SAF support under the EU ETS, exploring tradable SAF and book-and-claim mechanisms, simplifying operator reporting, improving access to sustainability certificates via the Union Database (UDB), and advancing dual conformance of SAF under EU RED and CORSIA to promote global harmonisation are positive steps but we need to see how words turn into reality. Particularly, we are concerned that the STIP falls short of critical industry expectations.

“We hope this is just the start of a continued review of EU aviation sustainability initiatives which will ultimately lead to a more efficient and successful programme of decarbonisation for aviation.”

IATA said it noted the Commission’s recognition of the potential of mechanisms that enable tradable SAF certification, including book-and-claim options, to address the SAF supply barrier across European airports.

It said it is also worth noting that such a system will serve as a key enabler for investments in SAF production facilities, in addition to promoting regional cohesion and connectivity by ensuring a level playing field for aircraft operators from different geographical regions in Europe.

IATA said: “This system is urgently required in Europe, and due to the misalignment between the flexibility mechanism under ReFuelEU Aviation, and the rules to claim SAF under EU ETS, necessary amendments to the EU ETS Directive should be implemented during its upcoming review to allow for EU-wide purchase-based claiming of SAF. It also must be noted that book-and-claim is paramount to the success of the proposed “intermediary mechanism”. Enhancement of the UDB is also critical and should be expedited to enable this.”

Acknowledging the role of aircraft operators as end-users and giving their issues due consideration should be a priority in STIP’s materialisation, IATA added.

The Association said: “Aircraft operators require a predictable SAF market with clear price transparency to plan the integration of SAF into their daily operations effectively.

“Under the current regulatory framework, aircraft operators are exposed to unjustifiably higher prices for jet fuel and SAF. While it is necessary to focus on ways to increase investment in SAF production facilities, STIP should prioritize equally the creation of a transparent and open SAF market that encourages both more supply and demand. A robust UDB is also critical to this effort, and hence, IATA urges the Commission to expedite its enhancement work. IATA and its members stand ready to contribute any necessary input to this work, to ensure the best outcome for all parties involved.”

IATA added: “While the STIP acknowledges the role of biofuels, it continues to prioritise e-SAF, citing feedstock constraints. IATA’s recent report on feedstock availability demonstrates that Europe possesses significant untapped potential for sustainable feedstocks, including advanced residues and waste streams. A technology-neutral approach—supporting both biofuels and e-SAF—is essential to maximize the potential of all SAFs, all of which will be necessary to reach the targeted 500 Mt in 2050. Limiting support to e-SAF alone risks undermining the scalability and cost-effectiveness of SAF deployment across the continent, with commensurate delays in achieving reductions in CO2 emissions.”",https://ittn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Willie-Walsh-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 10:16:35.509946

Domestic players will actively secure feedstock to meet the 350,000 tons capacity of the EcoCeres production facility, forcing them to offer competitive pricing to divert used cooking oil away from profitable international export routes, Chan Foong Hin said.

The EcoCeres facility became operational in October and will provide Malaysia’s first major source of ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU-certified SAF, Chan said.

Exports surge; Singapore is the largest market. According to the Malaysia Palm Oil Board, used cooking oil exports reached 465,257 tons in 2024, up from 310,368 tons in 2023. Singapore was the largest importer, accounting for 284,116 tons, followed by the United States and the European Union with 158,231 tons and 19,819 tons, respectively.

""To manage domestic feedstock supply and secure competitiveness for the SAF industry, the ministry together with the MPOB (palm oil board), is currently reviewing and engaging with stakeholders regarding the potential implementation of a policy intervention to ensure a steady, sustainable supply of UCO for domestic industrial needs,"" Chan said, using an abbreviation for used cooking oil.

Chan also expects market demand to nearly triple with the commissioning of the Petronas, Enilive and Euglena biorefinery in Pengerang, targeted for completion in the third quarter of 2028.

Growing feedstock demand. ""This plant commands a significant feedstock capacity of 650,000 tons. Collectively, these two facilities will create an annual feedstock demand of up to 1 million tons, establishing direct competition with international buyers for the global UCO supply,"" he said, adding that the challenge in the supply chain will be feedstock collection.

As such, to meet domestic demand, Chan said Malaysia must scale up its domestic used cooking oil collection infrastructure from households and businesses, without undermining supply to other biodiesel sectors or resorting to uncertified imports.

On biodiesel, Chan said production is expected to remain stable next year and expects a moderate increase in domestic consumption as more companies implement higher biodiesel blending pilot programs to achieve their ESG targets.

Malaysia currently imposes a 10% biodiesel mandate nationwide, though a 20% biodiesel mandate is implemented in the federal territory of Labuan and Langkawi district as well as the state of Sarawak, with the exception of the Bintulu district.
