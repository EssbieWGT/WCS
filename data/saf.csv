Pilatus PC 12 Pro: Modernes Cockpit mit Garmin G3000

Das Herzstück der PC-12 PRO ist das neu gestaltete Cockpit, das auf dem Garmin G3000 Prime Avioniksystem basiert. Drei hochauflösende 14-Zoll-Touchscreens und zwei kleinere 7-Zoll-Displays bieten den Piloten eine intuitive Steuerung.

Laut «Fliegermagazin» ermöglicht ein Cursor Control Device präzise Navigation ohne direkten Kontakt mit den Bildschirmen. Ergonomisch orientiert sich das Cockpit an dem Businessjet PC-24, was die Bedienung erleichtert.

Pilatus hat zudem den Fensterrahmen des Direct Vision Cockpits entfernt, um die Sicht nach aussen zu verbessern. «SkyNews» hebt hervor, dass die neue Autothrottle-Technologie den Leistungsoutput optimiert und den Treibstoffverbrauch reduziert.

Sicherheitsfunktionen für maximale Zuverlässigkeit

Ein Highlight der Pilatus PC-12 PRO ist das serienmässige Autoland-System ab 2026: Dieses System kann im Notfall das Flugzeug eigenständig landen.Ausserdem berücksichtigt es dabei Wetterbedingungen sowie die beste Landemöglichkeit.

Ergänzt wird es durch Smart Glide, das bei Triebwerksausfällen automatisch eine optimale Gleitflugroute berechnet. Zusätzlich integriert Pilatus ein verbessertes Electronic Stability & Protection-System (ESP).

Auch ein optimiertes Stall Warning & Protection-System wurde verbaut, um Strömungsabrisse zu verhindern. Wie «AeroTelegraph» berichtet, sorgt eine grössere Wetterradar-Antenne für bessere situative Wahrnehmung.

Kabine mit futuristischem Design

Die Kabine der PC-12 PRO wurde komplett überarbeitet. Neue Einbaumöbel schaffen zusätzlichen Stauraum, während moderne Materialien und Designs den technologischen Fortschritt des Flugzeugs widerspiegeln.

The report, produced by ‘Airports of Tomorrow’, a WEF initiative bringing together leaders from across the aviation industry, says industry stakeholders are increasingly looking to advance aviation decarbonisation activity in tandem with boosting growth post-Covid-19, posing challenges to progress on sustainability.

The actions that industry and governments across the world take this year will be vital to ensure the aviation sector remains on the right flight path to meet internationally agreed targets, including reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5 per cent by 2030 and attaining net-zero international aviation by 2050, according to the report.

Alignment of SAF policies across regions and longevity of subsidies are crucial for encouraging investment and ensuring consistent SAF adoption across regions. In 2024, Asia Pacific emerged as a key market: several countries introduced supportive policies, while China is expected to unveil detailed SAF policies this year.

In Pakistan, the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank group is providing up to $35 million in equity and debt financing to SAFCO Venture Holdings Ltd (SAFCO Ventures) to help establish Pakistan’s first greenfield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility, which will convert thousands of tonnes of used cooking oil and other waste oils into aviation fuel, helping to reduce global emissions.

The WEF report says the availability and cost of SAF are the biggest challenges for aviation decarbonisation in 2025. Airlines need to commit to long-term SAF offtake agreements, but de-risking mechanisms are vital as the risks of advanced SAF production technologies and varying regional policies pose significant hurdles.

More corporate involvement and favourable policies are essential to attract capital and support SAF projects globally.

Geopolitics is the top non-sustainability challenge affecting progress on decarbonising aviation. The withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement in early 2025 and the “America First” trade policy are being closely monitored by the aviation community, as increasing protectionism and tariffs pose significant risks.

Geopolitical tensions are destabilising feedstock exports and fuelling domestic energy security concerns. International scrutiny on fairness and competitiveness adds to the complex dynamics at play, report fears.

As aviation’s reliance on SAF increases, scrutiny of the sustainability credentials of feedstocks will intensify.

Concerns around land-use change, deforestation, poor agricultural practices, food security and biodiversity impacts have led to regulatory restrictions and bans on certain biofuels.

Improved transparency, research, and consistent sustainability standards are essential to address these risks and support the development of alternative SAF production pathways.

The report says despite easing inflationary pressures and encouraging profitability figures, the global economic outlook remains a concern for aviation executives, particularly in emerging markets. Rising costs in labour, supply chain bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty are impacting profitability and affecting the sector’s focus on the net-zero agenda.

Fostering a circular economy can help Pakistan cope with economic, environmental, and social crises, economic nationalists said.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, they highlighted the need to create a climate in which businesses can prosper and the national economy can grow by leaps and bounds.

Developed and many developing countries are shifting from a linear to a circular economy for better opportunities.

They said the circular economy presents a tremendous opportunity for large-scale manufacturing job creation in Pakistan through waste valorisation. For instance, the widespread burning of crop residues, which annually poses severe environmental hazards, can be transformed into an asset by converting this waste into high-value fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel or into valuable chemicals like acids. Establishing new facilities for this purpose would generate numerous onsite jobs, including skilled roles for technicians, process engineers, and logistics specialists to manage biomass collection. Indirect job creation would span supply chain management, transport logistics, storage solutions, and distribution networks, alongside the development of supportive industries like equipment manufacturing, maintenance, and renewable energy.

Moreover, additional roles in research, development, and innovation would further expand employment opportunities.

They said the concept of a circular economy represents a transformative shift from traditional linear economic systems, which are characterised by the extraction of raw materials, production of goods, and disposal of waste.

In a circular economy, raw materials such as metals and oil are utilised to manufacture products like steel, car engines, and plastic bottles. At the end of their lifecycle, these products are recycled into new ones, thereby minimising the need for the continuous extraction of new resources and significantly reducing waste. This sustainable approach not only mitigates environmental impact but also enhances resource efficiency.

In contrast, the prevailing linear economic model, widely implemented across global economies, perpetuates a cycle of resource extraction, production, and disposal, leading to increased waste and the continuous need for new material extraction. The transition to a circular economy is imperative to address growing environmental challenges and foster a more sustainable and resilient economic system.

Eminent energy scientist and expert in a circular economy, Dr Adeel Ghayur, said, ""Pakistan can strategically leverage the circular economy to address pressing environmental, economic, and social challenges through a multi-sectoral, policy-driven approach spearheaded by experts and technocrats. A key focus should be on sector-specific initiatives that deliver the greatest value for sustainable development, particularly in agriculture, textiles, construction, petrochemicals, and renewable energy.""

He said that by integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and accessing global green financing mechanisms, Pakistan can accelerate its transition to a circular economy and maximise its potential benefits.

Industry 4.0 technologies refer to the fourth industrial revolution, characterised by the integration of advanced technologies such as 3D printing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analytics, aimed at creating smart, automated, and interconnected manufacturing systems.

Additionally, establishing university degrees in a circular economy and a centre of excellence can meet the global demand for experts, positioning Pakistan as a leader.

He said the circular economy will address Pakistan's waste management challenges, reduce import dependency, and foster manufacturing job creation while bolstering energy and food security. By prioritising import-intensive products, Pakistan can gradually achieve self-sufficiency in these areas. Focusing on specific industries has the potential to establish Pakistan at the forefront of key sectors, such as solar panel recycling. Furthermore, Pakistan can unlock revenue generation from waste streams that currently pose significant environmental threats, such as crop residues. These residues can be converted into fuels like sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel, exemplifying the core principle of a circular economytransforming waste into value.

He said the transition to a circular economy begins with the formulation of a comprehensive national strategy, integrating incentives, standards, regulatory frameworks, and public-private partnerships. Priority initiatives should include waste management systems, tax incentives, and support for innovation hubs that drive recycling and remanufacturing. Significant sectors in this transition include petrochemicals, plastics, water, renewable energy, and construction materials.

He said to fully realise this potential, it is essential to streamline policies and channel investments into renewable and green technologies, which are crucial for achieving economic self-reliance. These efforts, combined with consistent monitoring and evaluation, will promote long-term economic and environmental resilience for Pakistan's economy.

Climate Action Centre (CAC) Director Yasir Hussain said the circular economy is part of the emerging green economy. The circular economy is the circulation of materials as they move from industry to industry and product to product, minimising the production of waste, pollution, and carbon emissions while protecting and regenerating nature.

He said that in Pakistan, on the one hand, environmental laws restricting the dumping or release of harmful materials are not being implemented. On the other hand, there is circulation and reuse of material waste in industrial processes and society, but generally at a low-value level.

He said value addition requires the recovery of high-value molecules and substances, which necessitates recent technologies, redesigning, and eliminating materials beyond the lifecycle of products in society.",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/circular-economy1742087588-0/circular-economy1742087588-0.jpeg,N,,2025-03-16 03:51:26.722509

Yael Katzwer How have you seen the attitude towards sustainability and saf change in the aviation industry in recent years?
Yael Katzwer Yeah, so IATA has set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net zero by 2050 based on where we are now.
So in developing a mandate, you need to develop it in such a way that it doesn’t interfere with a voluntary market, that it coexist with the voluntary market.
Yael Katzwer All right.","Jeff Lee

Hello and welcome to this episode of cargo facts connect, the podcast of cargo facts, the newsletter of record for the air cargo and freighter aircraft industries for over 40 years. I’m Jeff Lee, editor of cargo facts and it’s Friday, the 14th of March. Over the past two years, we’ve seen SAF initiatives gaining momentum as companies continue to try and make aviation more sustainable. My colleague, deputy editor Yael Katzwer, recently spoke with Jeroen van Heiningen, founder and managing director of carbon insetting company 123Carbon, to discuss how 123Carbon works with IATA to make its platform interoperable with the IATA SAF registry that will launch next month..

Yael Katzwer

Tell me about 123, carbon and what you do.

Jeroen van Heiningen

So I have a background in sustainable transportation for over about 18 years after my career at Accenture, and we noticed that book and claim as a methodology was one of the most efficient ways to decarbonize transportation. So we developed into that, and it’s especially in aviation, is required that we have book and claim in place to correctly allocate saf. So in 2019 I initiated the development of a new platform that allows the creation, the allocation and the verification of among saf but also other types of low carbon transportation, so that fuel suppliers and carriers could create certificates that they could allocate to their cargo owners and forwarders to in order to basically share the costs of decarbonization and also share the the benefits, the carbon reductions. So we are, we are an independent platform that operates across all modalities, and that has transparency and integrity as a key and they we basically offer a registry for everyone, but also a branded platform for airlines and other carriers to interact directly with their customer with so we’re very much focused and specialized in in book and claim.

Yael Katzwer

And what are environmental attribute certificates and how exactly do they work?

Jeroen van Heiningen

So in principle, environmental attribute certificates are the carbon reductions that have been realized, or the carbon equivalent reductions that have been realized through the use of a low carbon technology, which could be saf, it could be bio methanol, it could be electrification, it could be hydrogen, anything that provides a, let’s say, a discount or an advantage compared to a certain baseline. We have that verified by external parties, we log all the data surrounding that project. So where was it uplifted? What were the emission factors used? Was it? What kind of data was it? How was it verified, and that in an entire data package is through a certificate sent to a customer so that he fully understands what he is procuring. As you might be aware in book and claim, we separate the physical stuff from the environmental attributes. So the physical stuff goes into an airport, for instance, and then the carbon reductions are allocated to airlines and to freight forwarders and cargo owner. So you need a water tight system to make sure that there’s no double issuance, double claiming or double selling. And that’s what we that’s what we provide as an independent platform.

Yael Katzwer

And I know you guys are working on interoperability with I add a staff registry partially to, you know, reduce redundancies and things like that. As you were just saying, you don’t want someone double claiming, even accidentally. So do you have interoperability with any other registries at the moment?

Jeroen van Heiningen

I think this is a first in the market. There’s we are part of an ecosystem of of book and claim specialist government or organized by NGOs, like like RSB or especially smart freight center. We have, we’re in part of the committee, committees that deal with registry interoperability. However, we also agreed that at some point you just need to start doing it. And and we were spending quite some time on discussing how we want to do it, how we want to pick it up. As an industry, everyone has their own innovative motivation, so together with IATA, who said, Well, I think we’re advanced enough. Let’s just make this happen. And then also invites, because the publication was also an invitation to other industries to join that and take a pragmatic, bilateral approach to to registry interoperability. And this is just the first step, but obviously we expect to to announce more of these partnerships, not only in in aviation, but as we said, we are a multi modal player. So for us, it makes sense to to be aware of the environment of registries out there. There’s not, not a whole lot, apart from aviation, but potentially they will come.

Yael Katzwer

You said, this is a first step. What are some of the other steps that you foresee down the line?

Jeroen van Heiningen

Yes, so registry interoperability can be quite a few things. It’s the way that registries communicate, and they can communicate about a lot of things. The first step we do with within IATA, and that’s the scope, what we’re doing now is, as you said, to avoid the redundancies and the double issuance, so to make sure that fuel is not registered on a registry twice with that immediately would lead to double counting. Now the. Also means that we are aligning the data models that we are using. We’re using the same taxonomy and using the same wording. So we’re also standardizing the data structure that we are dealing with in the second phase, and then we’re also developing a protocol. If we find these redundancies, what do we do? Who gets priority? Who needs to back off? Things like that are being mentioned there. However, you can also argue that in a later phase that some people are transacting on one registry and the other ones are transacting on another, so that it would make sense also to create some kind of transfer between the registries, where maybe a fuel supplier would use registry A, but an airline would look at it from registry B, and then they would ask, please, can you transfer from register one to registry B so that I can continue to do to to proceed with, with my customers. That’s not the part of the scope of this first phase with IATA. But you can imagine that that that is where potentially they they will go. Another element is also obviously that book and claim is primarily for the voluntary market. You can also imagine that in technical interactions with the mandated market systems that are there are also that to avoid that things are correctly divided between a voluntary and a mandated market. So I think there are different ways that registries or systems need to be integrated, but also standardized. So integration is one, but also standardization in the interpretation. There’s a lot of work to be done on that space as well. And then over seeding that all, if I this is, allow me over seeding that all is also a movement from where you see airlines now all having individual book and claim methodologies, which all differ a little bit and all have different, slightly different certificate than a slightly different approach, and also deliver different levels of transparency. That this the standardization of the registries is also a pulling mechanism to move the airlines from using their own methodologies or Excel based and on board onto a registry, because obviously we can check between the registries. But there are also airlines, obviously out there, the majority that run their own programs on Excel and have them verified by their own auditors. And this is what we’re hoping to achieve with this movement.

Yael Katzwer

How have you seen the attitude towards sustainability and saf change in the aviation industry in recent years?

Jeroen van Heiningen

I think what you do see happening is that there are shifts in interpretation on sustainability, and there will always be When, when, let me give you an example, maybe beyond soft, but when, when biofuels was first introduced, we were very happy, and this was first gen bio fuels. Now, at the moment, everyone’s looking at advanced bio fuels, and in a few years time, there’s even, especially a marine we’re looking to go beyond bio fuels, and we need to move into E fuels or even zero emission and hydrogen electrification. So we will, I think the society as a whole has always demonstrated that it keeps raising the bar on what it perceives as sustainable, and that definition there will become a time where maybe some of electricity will not be seen as sustainable because we keep on shifting, shifting that, raising that bar. And therefore where I think as soon as long as those differentiations are there and people want to be more sustainable than someone else, then I would imagine that that systems like book and claim will be there to allocate the most greenest of molecules, to those customers that are willing to pay. If that, if that answers your question.

Yael Katzwer

Yeah, so IATA has set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net zero by 2050 based on where we are now. Do you believe we can reach that goal by 2050?

Jeroen van Heiningen

We must say that as a whole, we have not been very well positioned to achieve the tar any targets on this purpose that we’ve set and and as you are well also, geopolitical movements are infecting, affecting The whether or not we can use these targets, but it’s not on the political side. It also has to do with the companies that are willing to invest in this. So I don’t think we ever should say the the politics should make this happen, or should we whatever? No, it’s also society as a whole that needs to move. It’s not just the mandates or whatever that needs to bring this together is is to come. Communicating barrels of the voluntary market and the mandated market, and if they can work together, there’s a lot we can do. Unfortunately, we also see that, if you look at saf a lot of production has been announced, and not all of that production is, in the end, also hitting the market, which is obviously unfortunate. But there’s for us as a registry. Obviously, we are not involved basically in the discussion on the type of fuels or whatever. We take the reductions that the fuel bring and create our certificates based on that through a globally approved methodology, and we are not, let’s say, a body that sets the targets or sets the methodology that should be done through stakeholder dialog. We’re here to facilitate the process, but either I think, I think there, there, it will flow up and down, as will the pricing. But if you look at the general trend, I think it’s non reversible and and we also come into that a little bit. We also need institutes like sbti that set the science base target, if that set the targets for these corporates, and they make the fortune 500 move, and they need to start moving them towards investing in their supply chain, so moving them a little bit away from maybe the planting trees, but investing in their own supply chains, paying the actual abatement costs that it takes to decarbonize supply chain, because that’s what it’s all about. If I can plant a tree for one euro, why would I spend 300 euro on soft if it has the same value? So it needs to make be made clear that if you want to achieve certain targets, and we want those companies to invest in supply chains, we need to facilitate that process. Because you can imagine, corporates will always try to find the most cost efficient way to achieve their targets while still maintaining the approval from the sbti. So there’s also, there’s also major role there, where, where do we put the bar?

Yael Katzwer

And you mentioned there’s obviously the voluntary component and then the regulatory component. What more do you think should be done or could be done in terms of regulations to move this along? What are you hoping to see?

Jeroen van Heiningen

Yeah, no, this is, this is the most fundamental question. I think under under SAF, we need to be aware that you don’t solve everything with mandates. Mandates and the voluntary markets are communicating barrels that need to coexist. So the way I see it is that mandate is for basically, for the laggers is to make sure that the entire industry is moving, and then the voluntary part is so that corporates, or anyone that wants to achieve their target faster, or want to do more that they can do that. So if, if all the market was a mandate, then why would companies like like Microsoft still invest they wouldn’t, because it would only regulate it for them. So we need them. We need the mandated market to shift up and raise the bar. And then there will be companies like the Amazon or the Microsoft that want to do more, and they need food access to the voluntary markets to make that to make that happen. So in developing a mandate, you need to develop it in such a way that it doesn’t interfere with a voluntary market, that it coexist with the voluntary market. And and a lot of players are not that aware. The mandated markets are just looking at the mandates to solve everything. The voluntary markets look at the voluntary markets do everything, and we need to look more at that cross field, where they do Where did the two meet, and how can they, how can they coexist? That will be my goal going forward, to see that improving. For us as a positioning we position yourself multi modal, which is not typically the discussion of book and claim, but if you look obviously at the cargo owners or the freight forwarders, they are dealing with multi modality. So that’s why we position this as a multi modal play, to make sure that a big freight forwarder or a cargo owner can absorb certificates from air, road, marine and rail in a constant, standardized approach, and then introduce them into their infantry. So for us, it’s also important that we standardize across the modalities, so that’s something that fits in aviation. Also works in Marine, and that’s at the moment, not the case. The two have a different view on mandates, which is strange, because as an end user, if I’m buying a certificate, there will be other rules. For air, then it will be for real, whereas the company would say, these are all my emissions. So we are also a strong advocate of that multi modal view to solve it, and not just the silo view of within within saf.

Yael Katzwer

PetroVietnam Power Corporation has also established an MoU with GE Vernova for the procurement of equipment and services for gas-fired power plants.

Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) has formalized an MoU with three leading U.S. ethanol suppliers – U.S. Grains Council, Renewable Fuels Association, and Growth Energy – to enhance biofuel cooperation.

Additionally, Petrolimex has partnered with Marquis Energy through another MoU to facilitate transactions and imports of biofuels. This collaboration holds particular significance as Vietnam accelerates efforts to expand biofuel adoption.

Beyond these agreements, negotiations are ongoing for additional deals, with an estimated total value of $36 billion in the near future.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Minister Dien emphasized the strong and growing relationship between Vietnam and the U.S. Over the past 30 years of diplomatic ties, a decade of comprehensive partnership, and two years of comprehensive strategic partnership, bilateral relations have expanded across multiple sectors.

Economic, trade, and investment ties remain central to this relationship. In 2024, bilateral trade reached nearly $150 billion, marking a 20.5 percent increase from the previous year.

The U.S. has become Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner and a key export market while also emerging as a major supplier of machinery, technology, and energy products.

In terms of investment, the U.S. remains one of Vietnam’s leading investment partners, with most major American corporations having established a presence and successfully conducted business in Vietnam.

At the same time, Vietnamese enterprises are increasing their presence in the U.S. market. As of early 2025, more than 100 Vietnamese companies have registered for the Select USA 2025 event to explore investment opportunities in the U.S..

Minister Dien highlighted the immense potential for further cooperation, particularly in science and technology, innovation, research and development, semiconductor and artificial intelligence (AI) industries, renewable energy, financial services, biotechnology, and healthcare.

According to the ministry, from this year onward, Vietnam and the U.S. plan to implement a series of economic and trade agreements valued at approximately $90.3 billion. These agreements are expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in both countries.

A significant portion of this investment, around $50.15 billion, will be directed toward purchases of aircraft, aviation services, oil and gas exploration, and imports of refined petroleum products.",https://static.tuoitrenews.vn/ttnew/r/2025/03/15/bo-truong-dien-17419621836632059238552-1742031091.jpg,N,,2025-03-16 03:51:48.505662

Regular supply of SAF

JetBlue has announced the first-ever regular supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the New York region at JFK Airport. The airline says that this has been made possible through various corporate business partners that help cover the premium over regular jet fuel. Ursula Hurley, chief financial officer, JetBlue, commented,

“JFK has been JetBlue’s home for 25 years, and our operations here should set the standard we envision for our entire network. Thank you to the many teams and partners who have helped make this possible. Incorporating SAF into our flights is an important lever in decarbonizing the aviation industry and expanding its availability to our Northeast airports is a big step.”

JetBlue has taken initiatives in recent times to further its commitment to a sustainable aviation sector. In December 2024, the airline announced that its TrueBlue and Mosaic passengers who purchase $100 of SAF contributions online will earn one tile.

The carrier said that nearly 90% of the contributions were allocated toward its purchase of SAF and/or blended SAF products. With a limit of $1,000, TrueBlue passengers could receive 10 tiles. The offer was available until December 31.

Making it possible

The current consistent supply of SAF in New York is being done by a careful strategy of fuel production and delivery. According to JetBlue’s official statement, Diamond Green Diesel LLC—a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and Darling Ingredients Inc. affiliate — produces the fuel and Valero then blends it with conventional jet fuel to create blended SAF.

This is then delivered by World Fuel via existing jet fuel distribution infrastructure where it is claimed by JetBlue for use in their fleet at JFK Airport. Brad Hurwitz, senior vice president, supply and trading, World Fuel Services, commented,

“Working with JetBlue and Valero to bring blended SAF to one of our largest airport locations supports our ambition at World Fuel to grow a consistent supply network for SAF on the U.S. East Coast. This collaboration enhances our ability to provide regular sustainable aviation fuel and improves access to lower carbon fuels for our aviation customers.”

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National Renewable Energy Lab first explored the possibility of delivering sustainable aviation fuel to the New York region in a 2021 study.

The latest development has also made Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole quite happy. He said that they are proud to collaborate with JetBlue on the use of SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport and that it is leading by example through its work on safe SAF delivery to regional airports and promoting sustainable air travel.

Long way to go

Airlines are gradually increasing their SAF usage and signing purchase deals to achieve their goals. For example, Air New Zealand announced its largest purchase of sustainable aviation fuel in December, securing the supply of 30 million liters (7.9 million US gallons).

The same month, United Airlines, too, signed an agreement with energy company Phillips 66 for the supply of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).

However, the production rate for SAF is still significantly low to make any meaningful impact. In 2024, SAF accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production and 11% of global renewable fuel.

Director of IATA, General Willie Walsh says that “SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly. Governments are sending mixed signals to oil companies which continue to receive subsidies for their exploration and production of fossil oil and gas. And investors in new-generation fuel producers seem to be waiting for guarantees of easy money before going full throttle.”

Like each of the past meetings, this year’s symposium will feature two days of presentations, including sessions on fuel cell aircraft technology, demonstrations and hydrogen hubs for airports. In addition, interested attendees are invited to SAE International’s AE-5CH Hydrogen Airport Taskgroup meeting the day before, on Tuesday, 1 April.

There are challenges in decarbonizing the aerospace industry, especially due to lightweighting and powertrain needs. Larger, heavier eVTOL aircraft that require more power for sustained flight need fuel cells with hydrogen, combined with batteries to achieve zero-emission, all-electric, long-range flights.

Despite the advantages of utilizing hydrogen, it still hasn’t been widely embraced as an accepted propulsion approach in North America. Though sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a good transition fuel that helps to reduce CO2, it does not answer all the questions for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and consumes more resources such as energy and water. Hydrogen, on the other hand, holds tremendous potential in this area as a mid- and long-term replacement of kerosene.

After the passage of the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the US government has committed $8 billion to support the development of hydrogen hubs across America. In addition, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act offered significant incentives for the large-scale use of hydrogen. Thus, there is great opportunity to utilize these resources towards outfitting hydrogen at airports.

Though hydrogen is standardized for ground vehicles, it is not yet at scale for use for aircraft. Other impediments include the lack of infrastructure, transporting hydrogen and high costs due to the scale of the industry today. The H2-Aero initiative is seeking to think outside the box, as it’s certainly possible to bring hydrogen at scale, especially in conjunction with other forms of transportation such as airport ground equipment.

The H2-Aero Team has published a whitepaper, “Multimodal H2-Airport Hub,” to cover the scenario for a Hydrogen Hub starting with ground vehicles and later scaling to support an airport with hydrogen aircraft through different scenarios of storage, distribution and production.

Although multiple hydrogen consortia and government bodies have published roadmaps, and the UK and European Union have made progress in this area, there has been little traction for hydrogen aviation in the US. The H2-Aero Team is engaging with government, industry and academic organizations to bring hydrogen for the range of aircraft—from eVTOL, eRotor, eSTOL, LTA and eCTOL—to the forefront, because aviation is one of the most challenging transportation industries to decarbonize and stands to benefit the most from hydrogen.",,N,,2025-03-15 04:50:25.544158

This initiative is part of SK Energy's ambitious strategy to solidify its position within the Asia-Pacific SAF market.

Following the success of its European SAF exports that began in January 2025, the company is keen to expand further in this sector.

Lee Young-chul, Head of SK Energy’s Marketing Division, says: “We will closely monitor changes in SAF policies and market dynamics both domestically and abroad.

“By collaborating with Cathay Pacific and other partners, we aim to build a stable global SAF supply chain.”

The company's deal with Cathay Pacific shows the significance of Hong Kong International Airport, which not only catered to more than 53 million passengers in 2024 but also serves as a key logistical hub in the region.

With more than 1,100 daily flights operated by more than 120 airlines, the integration of SAF at this scale could significantly contribute to the reduction of aviation-related carbon emissions in Asia.

The move to increase SAF supply to Hong Kong is seen by SK Energy as a strategic step towards capturing a larger share of the Asia-Pacific market, amidst growing global concerns over carbon footprints of airline operators.

Worldwide SAF demand

Global demand for SAF is on the rise, driven by international commitments to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation industry:

The European Union has mandated that all flights departing from Europe must use a minimum of 2% SAF in their fuel mix, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050

The United States aims to replace all conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050

Singapore plans to implement a SAF levy with a 1% usage target in 2026

South Korea will introduce a 1% SAF blending mandate in 2027.

Despite this, IATA reported “disappointingly slow” growth in SAF production in 2024.

“With airlines, the core of the value chain, earning just a 3.6% net margin, profitability expectations for SAF investors need to be slow and steady, not fast and furious,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

“But make no mistake that airlines are eager to buy SAF and there is money to be made by investors and companies who see the long-term future of decarbonisation.”

Market research firm Global Market Insight predicts that the global SAF market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 46.2% – from approximately US$1.7bn in 2024 to US$74.6bn by 2034.

“Together with DB Schenker, we made another significant achievement in our efforts for sustainable logistics.”","In the field of transport and logistics, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical player in pushing the boundaries of environmental responsibility.

Adopting SAF is not only a strategic move for businesses to enhance their supply chain resilience; it's also crucial in meeting ESG goals.

Beyond compliance, SAF paves the way for sustainable logistics, providing companies a competitive edge by aligning with global sustainability targets.

In a bid to enhance its own sustainability efforts, Mercedes-Benz has placed a record-breaking order of SAF for export air freight shipments from Frankfurt to Beijing and Shanghai.

The procurement of around 13,000 tons of SAF represents the largest single volume order of its kind by a DB Schenker customer and will cut Mercedes-Benz's CO₂e emissions by 40,000 tons.

“Achieving carbon neutrality is a long-haul journey,"" says Thorsten Meincke, Global Board Member for Air & Ocean Freight at DB Schenker.

""Our new biofuel agreement with our trusted partner Mercedes-Benz sets a new benchmark for sustainability commitments.

“By working together, we are actively and immediately reducing emissions in intercontinental supply chains. This contract represents one of the largest-ever SAF deals in the entire automotive and logistics industries globally. I look forward to seeing more customers join us.”

DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz

The relationship between DB Schenker and Mercedes-Benz covers air, land and sea transport as well as warehouse management.

Mercedes-Benz was one of DB Schenker's first customers when it launched the world’s first-ever regular cargo flight fuelled by SAF in 2021.

This ongoing partnership has not only strengthened over the years but has also catalysed significant advancements in reducing carbon emissions in the logistics sector.

As Mercedes-Benz sets a new industry benchmark for corporate sustainability, DB Schenker is showcasing the logistics industry’s move towards more sustainable practices.

Elke Pusskeiler, Head of Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz, states: “As part of our Ambition 2039 for Mercedes-Benz Cars, we aim to reduce CO₂ emissions in logistics by 60% compared to 2021.

“Our sustainability strategy focuses on CO₂ avoidance and on the reduction of emissions for all modes of transport in inbound and outbound. Utilising sustainable aviation fuel for air freight allows us to cut emissions.

Jiaao Enprotech’s bio kerosene has received approval from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, confirming that the fuel meets airworthiness certification requirements, the Jiaxing-based company said yesterday. No details were given about a sales strategy or potential customers.

The jet fuel will be produced at Jiaao’s CNY7.1 billion (USD1 billion) factory in Lianyungang, eastern Jiangsu province, it said. The plant, which came online in November last year, is designed to produce 750,000 tons of sustainable aviation kerosene a year. This would make Jiaao the biggest producer in the country when the factory is fully up and running.

Convinced of its potential, BP Global Investments, part of London-based BP, bought a 15 percent stake in the Liangyungang factory in August last year.

The Lianyungang plant, which is run by subsidiary Lianyungang Jiaao New Energy, uses waste resources, including food scraps and cooking oil, to produce jet fuel. Biokerosene is a key solution for the global aviation industry to transition to greener energy. Compared to traditional fossil fuel-based jet fuel, green aviation fuel can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the company said.

Jiaao’s biodiesel products have already been certified by the EU and, in 2021, the company entered into a long-term supply deal with Shell Oil. In 2023, Jiaao’s biodiesel business generated revenue of CNY1.7 billion (USD234.8 million), which accounted for about 67 percent of its total earnings for the year, according to the firm's 2023 annual report.

Jiaao’s share price [SHA:603822] closed down 6.2 percent at CNY60 (USD8) today. However, the company’s stock has gained around 40 percent in value in the past month, hitting a new high since September 2022 just yesterday. Since BP bought in, Jiaao’s stock has surged 172 percent.

SAF is now projected to account for just 6% of the UK’s aviation fuel mix by 2030, falling short of the government’s 10% goal. By 2040, this figure is expected to reach 17%, yet the CCC warns that feedstock limitations and intensifying global competition could hinder progress.

The report, which came out in late February but is still being picked over, highlights that access to sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oils and agricultural waste, remains a key challenge. The UK faces stiff competition from the US, EU, and China, which have implemented more aggressive SAF policies and incentives. Without sufficient domestic production, the UK could become a net importer of SAF, making it more expensive and less competitive.

Even if supply challenges are addressed, costs remain a major obstacle. The CCC report states, “Synthetic fuels will remain around seven times more expensive than conventional kerosene by 2050, while biomass-derived SAF is projected to be twice as expensive.” These high costs make SAF commercially unviable without policy support or technological advances. Direct air capture and storage could be a cheaper alternative to fuel switching, it is reckoned.

Murray Douglas, Head of Hydrogen Research at global energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, recently framed similar concerns about the cost challenges facing SAF and other synthetic fuels. He told gasworld, “Hydrogen needs to be below $1.50 per kg for e-fuels to work, and we’re nowhere near that. Even in places with ultra-cheap renewables, we’re looking at costs that just don’t make sense.” The economics are particularly difficult for aviation fuels, which require competitive pricing to remain commercially viable, since profit margins for airlines are always thin.

Douglas further noted that e-SAF, once considered a near-term solution, is unlikely to be viable at scale before the 2040s.

If the UK fails to scale up SAF production, the CCC warns that aviation may have to implement demand management measures, such as higher ticket prices or restrictions on flight growth. The report states, “SAF remains a key part of the decarbonisation strategy, but its scalability is uncertain.”

The UK’s SAF mandate, which came into force on 1 January 2025, requires at least 2% of all jet fuel to be SAF this year, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. This timeline is expected to deliver 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2030, reducing carbon emissions by 6.3 megatonnes per year a decade later.

But achieving these targets is now uncertain due to capacity, technology, scaling, and investment challenges.

Four UK airports – Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, and Stansted – currently have SAF handling capabilities.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/03/shutterstock_1879664092.jpg",N,,2025-03-15 04:51:47.588066

Syntholene partners with a geothermal energy provider to power the world’s first geothermally-driven synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) facility.

U.S. based Syntholene Energy Corp reports having signed a binding energy agreement securing 20 MW of geothermal power, a major milestone in deploying the world’s first geothermally-powered synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) plant module.

This agreement will power a commercial demonstration facility, integrating geothermal heat and electricity for high-temperature steam electrolysis, improving the efficiency of power-to-fuel technology. The facility will produce synthetic kerosene, addressing the growing demand for carbon-neutral aviation fuel.

A first-of-its-kind hybrid energy approach

Unlike traditional geothermal power plants that focus solely on electricity generation, this facility will utilize both heat and electricity, demonstrating a new model for industrial-scale geothermal applications.

There are key benefits to geothermal-powered eSAF production, such as base-load clean energy for fuel synthesis, Carbon-neutral industrial heat utilization, and scalability from demonstration to commercial output.

Strategic partnership & expansion potential

Under the binding Letter of Intent (LOI), Syntholene will design, engineer, and operate the facility at a partner-controlled geothermal site, retaining exclusive rights to technology and project expansion.

The agreement also includes a commercial expansion option, allowing up to 20 MW of geothermal capacity for future large-scale production.

“This energy agreement represents the seeds of a transformative moment for synthetic fuel cost and scalability,” said Dan Sutton, CEO of Syntholene.

Geothermal: a game-changer for industrial heat applications

Geothermal energy has long been underutilized in heat-intensive industrial processes. By leveraging geothermal heat for fuel synthesis, Syntholene is setting a precedent for more efficient, carbon-neutral industrial applications.

If successful, this model could pave the way for other industrial sectors to utilize geothermal resources for low-emission manufacturing processes.

In addition to providing evidence of kerosene transport, airlines must also document the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
Penalties for non-compliance with SAF quotas If airlines and refueling providers fail to meet the established SAF quotas, they face severe penalties.
Another BDL demand concerns the financing of SAF quotas.
EU Regulation 2023/2405 presents the aviation industry with new requirements that bring both opportunities and challenges.","A key element of the EU regulation concerns the carrying of kerosene on return flights from countries outside the European Union. Starting this year, airlines departing from the EU will be allowed to carry a maximum of 10 percent of the kerosene from their home country for the return flight. This regulation is intended to prevent so-called “fuel tankering” – a practice in which airlines fill up aircraft in non-EU countries to benefit from lower fuel prices and thus save costs. According to the regulation, the annual quantity of fuel delivered to an airport within the EU must cover at least 90 percent of the respective airline’s annual requirements.

The regulation aims to optimize fuel consumption and reduce unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions. According to the EU, so-called tankering leads to higher fuel consumption, as aircraft typically fly with more fuel than they need for the respective route. This not only leads to higher emissions but also to more inefficient flights, which runs counter to the Union’s environmental protection efforts.

Another reason for this measure is to promote fairer competition between airlines. Airlines based in countries with lower fuel prices could otherwise gain an unfair competitive advantage by meeting their fuel needs at a lower price and carrying unnecessarily more fuel on longer routes. This would exacerbate the competitive disadvantage for airlines operating in countries with higher fuel costs.

Reporting and proof obligations for airlines

The regulation requires airlines and their fueling providers to provide detailed documentation by March 31, 2023, at the latest. This documentation includes not only the quantity and origin of the kerosene used, but also detailed documentation of the fuel purchase. Airlines must provide, among other information, the name of the fuel provider, the quantity purchased in tonnes, the conversion process, and the lifecycle emissions of the SAF used. These reports must be verified by independent auditors to ensure proper compliance with the regulations.

In addition to providing evidence of kerosene transport, airlines must also document the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Since the beginning of the year, a minimum quota of two percent SAF has been in effect for all departures from airports in the EU. This quota will continue to increase until 2030, and synthetic fuels, so-called e-fuels, will also be mandatory in the future. The exact quantity and origin of the SAF used must also be documented in detail.

Penalties for non-compliance with SAF quotas

If airlines and refueling providers fail to meet the established SAF quotas, they face severe penalties. The regulation stipulates that in such cases, the refueling providers will be held primarily accountable, which in some cases could also affect the airlines themselves. The German Aviation Association (BDL) has already pointed out this development and criticized the additional financial burden that the new regulations could impose on the aviation industry. According to the BDL, compliance with the quotas could lead to a significant competitive disadvantage for smaller airlines that do not have the same financial resources as large corporations.

Another BDL demand concerns the financing of SAF quotas. The industry association proposes that passengers should be required to finance the more expensive sustainable kerosene alternatives through a levy across Europe. This should offset the higher costs incurred by airlines due to the mandatory use of SAF. This levy could help cover the higher production costs of SAF while ensuring fair competition.

Challenges for airlines

The new regulations pose several challenges for airlines. On the one hand, they must adapt to the amended regulations and provide the necessary documentation, which entails additional bureaucratic effort. On the other hand, the restriction on the carriage of kerosene also leads to a change in operational processes, especially on routes where “tankering” of cheap kerosene was previously a common business model. The SAF quotas that must be implemented could also pose a financial risk for smaller airlines if prices for sustainable fuels remain higher than for conventional kerosene.

Nevertheless, the new regulations also offer opportunities for innovation in fuel technology and aviation logistics. Some airlines may increasingly focus on developing their own SAF producers or partnering with major fuel suppliers to reduce the costs of sustainable fuels. The development of synthetic fuels, which may be more cost-effective and readily available in the future, could also represent a long-term solution for the aviation industry.

EU Regulation 2023/2405 presents the aviation industry with new requirements that bring both opportunities and challenges. While the limitation of fuel tankering and the introduction of SAF quotas are intended to encourage the aviation industry to become more sustainable, the financial and administrative burdens could put smaller airlines at a competitive disadvantage.

The coming years will show how well the industry is able to adapt to the new requirements while operating economically. What is clear, however, is that the aviation industry is facing a crucial phase in which it must reorient itself both ecologically and economically.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-15 03:51:29.987983

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.","The signing of a binding agreement for up to 20 megawatts of electrical energy (or thermal equivalent) marks a key step toward the company’s goal of delivering clean synthetic fuels at lower cost than fossil fuels, for the first time. Syntholene combines geothermal heat and electricity to enable breakthrough energy efficiency for high temperature steam electrolysis, with the mission of overhauling the economics of power-to-fuels technology.

With the processes already demonstrated at lab-scale, the energy delivered as a result of the binding agreement will be used to power a commercial-demonstration-scale geothermal-powered synthetic fuel production facility. The first target fuel output is synthetic kerosene, earmarked to fill the growing demand for eSAF clean aviation fuel.

This hybrid energy installation represents a global first, demonstrating the potential of geothermal resources to power scalable and sustainable synthetic hydrocarbon fuel infrastructure with a base-load supply of both heat and electricity. Notably, the agreement enables the operation to scale from demonstration to industrial output.

“This energy agreement represents the seeds of a transformative moment for synthetic fuel cost and scalability.” said Dan Sutton, CEO of Syntholene. “By integrating proven processes with a dedicated geothermal resource, we aim to deliver high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral eSAF that can bankably scale to meet the global demand for clean aviation fuel.”

Binding Agreement

Syntholene Energy Corp (“Syntholene”) has entered into a binding Letter of Intent (“LOI”) for the strategic development of the demonstration facility. Under the terms of the LOI, Syntholene will design, engineer, construct, commission, and staff the facility at a partner-controlled geothermal site. Syntholene retains exclusive ownership rights to the test facility equipment, intellectual property derived from the project, and the right to scale operations commercially, contingent upon the successful completion of the demonstration.

The LOI includes a commercial expansion option, allowing Syntholene access to approximately 20 megawatts of geothermal electrical or equivalent heat capacity for future commercial-scale operations, subject to technical, financial, and regulatory viability.

Completion of the transactions contemplated by the LOI are subject to a number of conditions, including entry into a more fulsome definitive agreement.

Geothermal for Carbon Neutral Industrial Heat

Geothermal energy presents several prospective advantages for powering heat-intensive industrial processes such as fuel synthesis. Appropriately selected geothermal resources provide carbon-neutral and low-cost thermal power with consistent uptime. With the right heat and pressure characteristics, these resources can meet the rigorous demands of industrial power requirements.

Most geothermal power plants operating today have been developed to generate electricity, with substantial waste heat. By combining energy inputs for endothermic industrial processes, Syntholene envisions a more efficient use of the heat energy inherent in geothermal resources. This enables a more industrially-tailored energy profile for synthetic fuel production facilities co-located to high-quality geothermal resources.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation. It takes about 1.5 gallons of ethanol to make one gallon of sustainable aviation fuel.

All conventional aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of SAF and jet fuel. However, by 2030, it is expected that a large portion of airplanes will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF.

At this week’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in Rosemont, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state is positioned to be a major player in the aviation fuel producing market.

“The ecosystem that we’ve built for sustainable fuel development is really second to none,” said Pritzker. “From agricultural commodities to refiners to consumers, Illinois is a leader at every step of the sustainable fuel supply chain.”

Last year, United Airlines announced plans to purchase one million gallons of sustainable jet fuel at O’Hare International Airport. O’Hare is the fifth airport in the world where United has purchased SAF for operational use. JetBlue is currently using SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.

The Department of Energy set a goal to achieve 3 billion gallons of SAF production by 2030, and 35 billion gallons by 2050. To qualify for United States federal tax credits, SAF must meet a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Dave Loos, director of Biofuels and Research with the Illinois Corn Growers Association, says the state is well positioned to take advantage of the SAF market.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK).

This milestone for SAF availability in the Northeast brings to reality an announcement from last summer, outlining JetBlue’s 12-month agreement with World Fuel Services (World Fuel), a World Kinect company (NYSE: WKC), for at least 1 million gallons of neat SAF to be provided by Valero Marketing and Supply Company (Valero), a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO).

JetBlue’s SAF supply is made possible through corporate business partners who help cover the cost premium over traditional jet fuel. An additional 4 million gallons of neat SAF is possible under the terms of the deal with the support of corporate partners.

“JFK has been JetBlue’s home for 25 years, and our operations here should set the standard we envision for our entire network.” said Ursula Hurley, chief financial officer, JetBlue. “Thank you to the many teams and partners who have helped make this possible. Incorporating SAF into our flights is an important lever in decarbonizing the aviation industry and expanding its availability to our Northeast airports is a big step.”

To ensure a consistent supply of SAF, Diamond Green Diesel LLC—a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and Darling Ingredients Inc. affiliate — produces the fuel and Valero then blends it with conventional jet fuel to create blended SAF. The blended SAF is then delivered by World Fuel via existing jet fuel distribution infrastructure where it is claimed by JetBlue for use in their fleet at JFK Airport. Blended SAF is a drop-in product for existing aircraft and infrastructure and can lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to approximately 80%, when compared to current conventional jet fuel.

“Working with JetBlue and Valero to bring blended SAF to one of our largest airport locations supports our ambition at World Fuel to grow a consistent supply network for SAF on the U.S. East Coast,” said Brad Hurwitz, senior vice president, supply and trading, World Fuel Services. “This collaboration enhances our ability to provide regular sustainable aviation fuel and improves access to lower carbon fuels for our aviation customers.”

The delivery of SAF to the New York region was first explored in a 2021 study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National Renewable Energy Lab, evaluating the ways in which SAF could be transported to Port Authority airports using existing fueling infrastructure. The study found that SAF could be successfully delivered to Port Authority airports, paving the way for airline partners to fuel an aircraft with SAF at LaGuardia Airport successfully in June 2022 and for John F. Kennedy International Airport to welcome the world’s first transatlantic flight fueled by SAF in November 2023.

“We are proud to collaborate with JetBlue on the use of SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “As the international gateway to the US, JFK is leading by example through our work on safe SAF delivery to our regional airports and promoting sustainable air travel. We look forward to facilitating more SAF operations across our airport system.”

“The Port Authority looks forward to continue working with our partners as we all strive toward more environmentally friendly air travel,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “Our work testing the safe delivery of SAF to our airports was a key first step demonstrating the possibility of more sustainable airport operations. As our agency works to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, we hope more business partners like JetBlue will want to work together to advance our mutual sustainability goals while delivering a world-class air travel experience.”

Expanding SAF Use

Growing the SAF market and expanding adoption nationwide requires public and private collaboration. Proposed federal and state incentives for renewable fuels would support the industry’s transition to SAF, while corporate partnerships offset costs. Businesses can reduce their travel emissions by purchasing JetBlue-issued SAF certificates, and JetBlue continues to seek additional partners to expand its SAF use.

The company is partnering with Houston-based Baker Hughes Co. (Nasdaq: BKR) to accelerate the deployment of Baker Hughes’ direct air capture technology, which could be used at the Matagorda County facility.
In Texas, especially in Matagorda County, we were welcomed to do a new infrastructure project,” Gentle said.
Prior to making its $114 million investment, Idemitsu signed a letter of intent to purchase e-methanol from the Matagorda County facility.
A second site has been identified in Matagorda County where HIF Global intends to build another methanol and SAF facility after it reaches FID on the first site.","HIF Global LLC, a international producer of alternative fuels, has become the first in the United States to receive an approval for an e-fuels pathway in California, supporting the facility it’s developing in Matagorda County.

The certification for the company's sustainable aviation fuel production will allow it to be eligible for California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Meg Gentle, executive director of HIF Global's board, told the Houston Business Journal at CERAWeek by S&P Global in Houston.

“That’s just one more step along the path for creating this market for e-fuels and shows how (places like Europe, California and Japan) are saying, ‘We are going to make a place for e-fuels in the market.” Gentle said.

HIF Global, which has its U.S. headquarters in Houston, is developing a $6 billion to $7 billion e-methanol plant in Matagorda County, which initially will have the capacity to produce 1.4 million tonnes per annum of methanol synthesized from hydrogen, coming from water electrolysis, and carbon dioxide.

It will be the first e-fuels production facility in the U.S. and the largest in the world, HIF Global said.

The first part of the project, which will make the methanol, is being designed by Bechtel Energy, Siemens Energy and Topsoe. The next part of the project will add the production of sustainable aviation fuel and is being designed by London-based Johnson Matthey PLC and North Carolina-based Honeywell International Inc. (Nasdaq: HON).

Gentle said HIF's goal is for construction to begin by 2026, or maybe as soon as late 2025, depending on when the company secures its offtake agreements and reaches a final investment decision. The project was originally projected to start construction in 2024.

“We are working to finish our offtake agreements, which really need certainty in the underlying regulation,” Gentle said. “Uncertainty is the enemy of investment.”

How hydrogen tax credit uncertainty affects HIF's project

In the United States, in order for HIF to move forward with its investments, Gentle said the 45V hydrogen tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act must be fully implemented. The Department of Treasury published its final rule on the hydrogen tax credits at the beginning of January, but it is unclear whether those credits will be among the aspects of the IRA that members of Congress attempt to repeal.

“The discussions in Washington about repealing the tax credit have then created a new uncertainty. So on the one hand, finally, after two years of working on it, we had final guidelines from the U.S. Treasury,” Gentle said.

“We do not view these as a handout. These are an investment that we are making in creating a new industry that then stands on its own, is profitable and grows. And in order to do that, we are competing against other countries bringing these fuels to market, and our most fierce competition is coming from China. And so these are helping us compete against China.”

A spokesperson for HIF Global added: ""Our customers are looking for regulatory certainty in the U.S. to finalize the long-term contracts, including final determination of the tax credits to confirm we are competitive with their alternative supplies from China.""

Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, previously told the Houston Business Journal that the 45V tax credits were something the trade group urged policymakers to retain.

Meanwhile, Gentle is confident that the methanol part of the project will move forward, even if separate market dynamics don’t come together to justify producing sustainable aviation fuel.

“We can always move forward with the methanol, and we have full flexibility then to adjust to what the market wants,” Gentle said.

Other companies are taking a similar approach when it comes to sustainable fuels. Houston-based Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX), for example, recently converted its San Francisco Refinery to a renewable fuels refinery, starting with renewable diesel. However, the company planned to produce more sustainable aviation fuel from the facility into this year as market dynamics were expected to improve.

HIF's investment in Texas

HIF Global chose its site in Matagorda County for several reasons: the state’s business-friendly environment, robust transmission in the area, and access to carbon dioxide, including through direct air capture. The company is partnering with Houston-based Baker Hughes Co. (Nasdaq: BKR) to accelerate the deployment of Baker Hughes’ direct air capture technology, which could be used at the Matagorda County facility.

“We do projects in communities that want us there. In Texas, especially in Matagorda County, we were welcomed to do a new infrastructure project,” Gentle said.

HIF Global has received key investments from investment firm EIG Partners, Porsche, Baker Hughes, Idemitsu Kosan, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., and the Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security. The latter three companies, based in Japan, brought in their investments last year, together reaching nearly $500 million in investments.

Prior to making its $114 million investment, Idemitsu signed a letter of intent to purchase e-methanol from the Matagorda County facility.

HIF Global had previously applied for tax credits for a second facility that would have been located near Fort Worth, but the HIF Global spokesperson said the company is no longer pursuing that location as it determined that site does not work for an e-fuels facility.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.","CHICAGO, March 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ - SYNTHOLENE ENERGY CORP (""Syntholene"" or the ""Company""), a leader in clean fuel synthesis, has secured a dedicated geothermal energy resource sufficient to deploy the world's first geothermally-powered synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) plant module.

The signing of a binding agreement for up to 20 megawatts of electrical energy (or thermal equivalent) marks a key step toward the company's goal of delivering clean synthetic fuels at lower cost than fossil fuels, for the first time. Syntholene combines geothermal heat and electricity to enable breakthrough energy efficiency for high temperature steam electrolysis, with the mission of overhauling the economics of power-to-fuels technology.

With the processes already demonstrated at lab-scale, the energy delivered as a result of the binding agreement will be used to power a commercial-demonstration-scale geothermal-powered synthetic fuel production facility. The first target fuel output is synthetic kerosene, earmarked to fill the growing demand for eSAF clean aviation fuel.

This hybrid energy installation represents a global first, demonstrating the potential of geothermal resources to power scalable and sustainable synthetic hydrocarbon fuel infrastructure with a base-load supply of both heat and electricity. Notably, the agreement enables the operation to scale from demonstration to industrial output.

""This energy agreement represents the seeds of a transformative moment for synthetic fuel cost and scalability."" said Dan Sutton, CEO of Syntholene. ""By integrating proven processes with a dedicated geothermal resource, we aim to deliver high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral eSAF that can bankably scale to meet the global demand for clean aviation fuel.""

Binding Agreement

Syntholene Energy Corp (""Syntholene"") has entered into a binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") for the strategic development of the demonstration facility. Under the terms of the LOI, Syntholene will design, engineer, construct, commission, and staff the facility at a partner-controlled geothermal site. Syntholene retains exclusive ownership rights to the test facility equipment, intellectual property derived from the project, and the right to scale operations commercially, contingent upon the successful completion of the demonstration.

The LOI includes a commercial expansion option, allowing Syntholene access to approximately 20 megawatts of geothermal electrical or equivalent heat capacity for future commercial-scale operations, subject to technical, financial, and regulatory viability.

Completion of the transactions contemplated by the LOI are subject to a number of conditions, including entry into a more fulsome definitive agreement.

Geothermal for Carbon Neutral Industrial Heat

Geothermal energy presents several prospective advantages for powering heat-intensive industrial processes such as fuel synthesis. Appropriately selected geothermal resources provide carbon-neutral and low-cost thermal power with consistent uptime. With the right heat and pressure characteristics, these resources can meet the rigorous demands of industrial power requirements.

Most geothermal power plants operating today have been developed to generate electricity, with substantial waste heat. By combining energy inputs for endothermic industrial processes, Syntholene envisions a more efficient use of the heat energy inherent in geothermal resources. This enables a more industrially-tailored energy profile for synthetic fuel production facilities co-located to high-quality geothermal resources.

Rhoden announced last week that he had signed House Bill 1052 but also emphasized that the measure does not kill a project proposed by Summit Carbon Solutions.

https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2424/files/2025/03/n-0313-13-pipeline.mp3

American Carbon CEO Tom Buis called the bill a lost opportunity for South Dakota to capitalize on growing markets for low-carbon biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel. Buis said, “Other states are moving forward, and it’s unfortunate to see South Dakota take a step back.”

HB 1052 was a direct response from pipeline opponents frustrated by the actions of the Iowa-based company. They said Summit employees have conducted land surveys without permission and have used misleading information to get landowners to sign leases allowing Summit’s proposed pipeline to be built across their property.

Buis said the “legislation comes at a time when South Dakota farmers and ethanol producers desperately need new markets to restore profitability. Instead of supporting economic growth, this decision creates unnecessary roadblocks and sends the wrong message to agriculture and rural communities.”

Rhoden said Summit needs to earn back the trust of South Dakotans and admitted it won’t be easy for the company to do. He outlined his reasons for signing the bill in a letter to the legislature and the people of South Dakota.

Summit’s proposed pipeline project would connect ethanol companies in Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota to an underground storage site in southwestern North Dakota.

This facility will be based on Honeywell UOP’s first ETJ license and basic engineering design in the Asia Pacific region with a production target of 200 million liters per year.

Expected to begin operation in 2029, the facility becomes the fifth of its kind in the world and will provide a vital supply of SAF to both domestic and international markets, contributing significantly to the growing demand for SAF driven by the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

“For more than 40 years, Honeywell has provided Taiyo Oil with key major refining process units for its Shikoku operations, and we are honored to continue this trusted relationship to help the company advance its decarbonization initiatives,” said Barry Glickman, vice president and general manager of Honeywell Sustainable Technology Solutions. “As demand for SAF continues to increase, the aviation industry faces challenges posed by the limited availability of conventional SAF feedstocks like vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste oils. Honeywell’s ETJ SAF technology broadens the available feedstock options to help overcome these challenges.”

This follows its successful SAF export to Europe in January 2025, and the company hopes it will secure a leading position in the Asia-Pacific SAF market.

Lee Young-chul, Head of SK Energy’s Marketing Division, says: “We will closely monitor changes in SAF policies and market dynamics both domestically and abroad.

Expanding SAF’s reach

SK Energy has made impressive progress in SAF production and distribution:

In September 2024, the company established a facility capable of producing 100,000 tonnes of SAF annually using co-processing technology

The company successfully exported SAF to Europe in January 2025, becoming the first Korean oil refiner to do so

SK Energy began supplying ISCC-certified SAF to Cathay at Incheon International Airport in November 2024.

The co-processing method it uses integrates bio-feedstocks into existing refinery infrastructure, enabling large-scale production of lower-carbon fuels such as SAF and bio-naphtha.

Aviation in Asia-Pacific

The Asia-Pacific region is important to SK Energy, accounting for more than 80% of the company's export volume.

Hong Kong International Airport saw more than 53 million passengers in 2024 and is a key transit hub in the region.

With more than 1,100 flights per day by more than 120 airlines, SAF could make a big difference.

SK Energy hopes this export to Hong Kong will accelerate its efforts to capture a larger share of the SAF market in Asia-Pacific.

Worldwide demand for SAF

Global demand for SAF is on the rise, driven by international commitments to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation industry:

The European Union has mandated that all flights departing from Europe must use a minimum of 2% SAF in their fuel mix, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050

The United States aims to replace all conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050

Singapore plans to implement a SAF levy with a 1% usage target in 2026

South Korea will introduce a 1% SAF blending mandate in 2027.

Despite this, IATA reported “disappointingly slow” growth in SAF production in 2024.

“With airlines, the core of the value chain, earning just a 3.6% net margin, profitability expectations for SAF investors need to be slow and steady, not fast and furious,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

“But make no mistake that airlines are eager to buy SAF and there is money to be made by investors and companies who see the long-term future of decarbonisation.”

Market research firm Global Market Insight predicts that the global SAF market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 46.2% – from approximately US$1.7bn in 2024 to US$74.6bn by 2034.

Cathay’s approach to SAF

With almost 3.3 million passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania and the second largest airport in the country, after Otopeni. As part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying sustainable aviation fuels, the airport has also purchased two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing trucks and an electric bus to transport passengers from the terminal to the planes.

How sustainable fuels are produced

SAFs are fuels produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as waste oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to kerosene. SAF can be used directly in existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a life-cycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a very important role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon reduction goals.

To keep pace with the evolving green iron market, Australia must strengthen its competitive positioning and employ its resources effectively.","Green iron could generate $295 billion per year for Australia, three times the current value of iron ore exports, while also creating thousands of jobs. The government has announced a $1 billion Green Iron Investment Fund to support this transition. However, achieving this will not be easy, as Australia must compete with other players in this growing market. So far, Australia has been slow to act compared with other regions.

In 2024, new joint venture Tosyali-SULB announced plans for the world’s largest direct reduced iron (DRI) plant. Last month, the company awarded an order to Midrex and SMS Group for the development of the DRI complex. Initially aiming for an annual production capacity of 8.1 million tonnes (Mt) of DRI for export, Tosyali-SULB plans to start with a first-phase capacity of 2.5Mt.

This is just one among many plans to expand DRI-based iron and steelmaking across the Middle East & North Africa (MENA) region.

The new DRI complex will feature Midrex Flex technology, enabling the production of green iron by gradually replacing fossil gas with hydrogen. This transition is critical for decarbonising the green steel industry in MENA, a global hub for gas-based DRI production.

While some EU steelmakers remain hesitant about importing green iron from regions with more favourable production conditions, Tosyali-SULB is taking a bold step on the supply side of this emerging market. Strengthening collaboration between end users and producers will be essential for building a robust green iron and steel value chain.

First movers are significantly expanding operations in key regions like MENA. Vale, the world’s second-largest iron ore miner and a leader in high-grade iron ore production, is solidifying its position through the development of Mega Hubs in Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. These hubs are designed to boost production of iron ore concentrate and agglomerates co-located with DRI plants, positioning Vale as a dominant supplier in the region.

In January, Vale took a major step forward by signing a land reservation agreement to establish a Mega Hub in Ras Al Khair Industrial City in Saudi Arabia. This facility is expected to produce 12Mt of cold briquetted iron ore (CBI). Vale previously secured an offtake agreement to supply 4Mt of agglomerates for the future ESSAR Group facility in Saudi Arabia, further cementing its strategic presence. The company has revealed that it expects to make two final investment decisions relating to its Mega Hubs plans in 2025.

In Oman, Vale already operates a pelletising facility with an annual capacity of 9Mt and is progressing with plans to produce 12.6Mt of iron ore concentrate in collaboration with Jinnan Steel & Iron Group as part of the broader Mega Hub strategy. These initiatives underscore Vale’s rapid progress in efforts to reduce Scope 3 emissions, especially compared to its Australian counterparts, who have been slower to respond.

The green iron market is expanding rapidly, yet Australia – the world’s largest iron ore producer – is failing to capitalise on this transition. Adapting some of MENA’s key strategies could accelerate Australia’s progress. Despite having world-class renewable energy potential, iron ore reserves suitable for DRI production, and access to gas, Australia doesn’t produce DRI at commercial scale and remains focused on small-scale pilot projects.

One major challenge is access to sufficient gas supplies, given Australia’s LNG export sector uses over 80% of total gas production. This has fuelled high domestic gas prices and supply shortages on the east coast, undermining the competitiveness of gas-based manufacturers and forcing some industrial facilities to close. Market conditions are also tightening on the west coast, pushing prices to levels that may cause demand destruction among existing industries and inhibit new gas-intensive industrial investment. There is an urgent need for a more balanced energy policy to support domestic industries.

Iran, one of the world’s largest gas producers, produced 252 billion cubic metres (bcm) of fossil gas in 2023. It also played a significant role in global DRI production, contributing 33.4Mt in 2023 – equivalent to 36% of all gas-based DRI output. Unlike Australia, which produced 152bcm of gas, Iran retains nearly all of its production for domestic use, while Australia exports a substantial share as LNG.

In this tight market, the most advanced commercial-scale DRI projects announced in Australia, such as POSCO’s Port Hedland HBI plant, may face major gas supply challenges before transitioning to green hydrogen. Securing adequate feedstock and energy remains a key risk, underscoring the broader uncertainties in scaling up low-carbon iron production in Australia.

A recent study indicates that Australia faces significant challenges producing gas-based DRI or hot briquetted iron (HBI) competitively due to its higher gas prices compared to regions like MENA, Canada and the US, where lower-cost gas allows for more cost-effective production.

MENA established itself as a DRI hub decades ago, leveraging gas-based technology and abundant, low-cost energy to remain competitive in steel production. Today, the region is laying the foundation for a hydrogen economy, gradually transitioning towards hydrogen-based processes even in its steel sector.

With industrial decarbonisation progressing rapidly, the long-term role of gas-based ironmaking in Australia is becoming increasingly uncertain. Relying on fossil fuel technologies increases investment risks, as steel sector end-users are shifting away from feedstocks with high embedded carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

A study by Wood on POSCO’s planned Port Hedland HBI plant reveals that, in its base case scenario, total Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions would reach 0.70 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per tonne of HBI (tHBI), with 0.55tCO2e/tHBI from fossil gas consumption alone. This far exceeds what could be considered low-emission production. For the first phase of the project, the plan is to use gas-flexible Midrex Flex technology, and the study highlights that switching from fossil gas to hydrogen could reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57%.

Australian iron ore miners have often claimed that the quality of their in-situ ores is not suitable for DRI production, and they are exploring solutions to enable the use of low-to-mid-grade ores. Studies show that the emerging technological pathways – such as using a smelter after iron ore reduction to remove impurities – will be crucial in decarbonising iron and steelmaking.

However, Australia cannot afford to overlook proven technologies already operating worldwide. Delaying billion-dollar projects until new pathways progress beyond pilot and small-scale trials risks falling behind in the global transition.

Projects like Fortescue’s Christmas Creek green iron initiative and NeoSmelt are making progress, but to secure a foothold in the market, Australia needs more large-scale commercial projects backed by magnetite mines and available technologies. Opening up new iron ore mines can be a decade-long process. Accelerating investments in viable, globally adopted solutions will be essential to securing a role in the future green iron market.

The prospect of combining South Australia’s magnetite ores with green hydrogen in DRI plants to produce truly green iron remains uncertain, particularly given the challenges at the Whyalla steel plant. Despite state government intervention to sustain the business, South Australia may face either a prolonged delay or, at worst, a permanent setback in its ambitions to produce green hydrogen at scale, leaving it exposed to gas supply and cost risks for longer.

Recent progress in MENA projects demonstrates that the technology is readily available and that, with strategic planning, natural resources can be leveraged to accelerate the transition. To keep pace with the evolving green iron market, Australia must strengthen its competitive positioning and employ its resources effectively.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/shutterstock_1421683301.jpg,N,,2025-03-13 08:50:45.148520
