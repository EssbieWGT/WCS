Nevertheless, two critical issues require urgent attention from policy makers; (1) enhancing the diversity of feedstocks available for SAF production, and (2) establishing a clear national mandate to accelerate domestic adoption of SAF.","Mr. Akanat Promphan, Minister of Industry, is advancing Thailand's new economic engines by assigning the Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM) to collaborate with Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited and five leading business organizations to accelerate the promotion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. This initiative is driven through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) titled ""Management of Used Cooking Oil for the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in line with the Bio-Circular-Green Economy policy.""

The aim is to establish a collaborative supply chain network for used cooking oil (UCO) as a key feedstock for commercial-scale SAF production. This partnership seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, move toward carbon neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and elevate Thailand's aviation industry to internationally recognized standards.

Mr. Akanat Promphan, Minister of Industry, stated that Bangchak had initiated discussions with the Ministry of Industry on potential collaboration to collect used cooking oil from the industrial sector for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The Ministry recognized the importance of this initiative and found it aligned with the policy direction of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who aims to enhance Thailand's global competitiveness and reposition the country as a key economic player on the world stage. This also supports Thailand's ambition to become the aviation hub of the region, creating advantages for domestic producers and service providers while opening new gateways to global trade. As Minister of Industry, Mr. Akanat underscored his commitment to driving the ""Fighting, Saving, Creating"" policy through industrial reform focused on three key areas: overhauling the management of industrial waste and hazardous materials that impact public health, strengthening fair competition for Thai industries - especially SMEs, and developing new, environmentally friendly industries to move the country toward carbon neutrality. This collaboration between the Ministry of Industry, through the Department of Industrial Promotion, and Bangchak Corporation, along with five leading private sector partners, marks the beginning of a comprehensive public-private integration that will benefit the nation across all dimensions.

Dr. Nattapol Rangsitpol, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, stated that the Ministry has developed a framework to promote the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), along with studying potential feedstocks, particularly used cooking oil (UCO), in alignment with Thailand's national fuel management plan. The Ministry is also moving forward in building a collaborative network among industry players while supporting the development of an effective UCO supply chain to serve as a key feedstock for SAF production.

The Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Ministry of Industry, through the Department of Industrial Promotion, and Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, along with key private sector partners that utilize used cooking oil—namely Central Group, Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, Charoen Pokphand Foods Public Company Limited, Thai President Foods Public Company Limited, and the Thai Food Processors Association. The partnership aims to establish and promote a supply chain network for UCO sourced from both industrial and service sectors, to be used as feedstock for commercial-scale SAF production. This effort supports the development of Thailand's aviation industry to meet international standards while reducing environmental impacts from air transport, optimizing resource use, and creating added value from waste materials in alignment with the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy policy.

Ms. Natthinya Netyasupha, Director-General of the Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM), added that DIPROM has collaborated with internal agencies under the Ministry of Industry to analyze data on SAF demand, production capacity, and potential domestic feedstock supply—such as used cooking oil (UCO), refined palm oil, and sugarcane by-products like molasses. The goal is to identify practical approaches for developing an industrial ecosystem that will effectively support SAF production from locally sourced materials. In the initial phase of the collaboration under this MoU, the focus will be on promoting and supporting the establishment of supply chain mechanisms for UCO collection from both industrial and service sectors. This includes public awareness campaigns, education initiatives, and network-building efforts to enhance understanding and engagement throughout the UCO supply chain, ultimately transforming waste into value-added SAF in line with the BCG model. This initiative also serves as a role model for other sectors, especially households, encouraging proper and safe UCO disposal and utilization. It not only strengthens energy and economic security in Thailand's aviation logistics industry but also contributes to long-term social and environmental sustainability.

Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group Chief Executive Officer and President of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, stated that Bangchak Group has embraced the government's BCG (Bio-Circular-Green) Economy policy and is pleased to see strong support from government agencies and business partners in advancing the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) - a key solution to reducing carbon emissions from the aviation industry. With readiness as a pioneer in the production of 100% Neat SAF in Thailand, the Group can produce 1 million liters per day under the globally recognized International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) system, covering the entire value chain from feedstock sourcing and production to distribution. Nevertheless, two critical issues require urgent attention from policy makers; (1) enhancing the diversity of feedstocks available for SAF production, and (2) establishing a clear national mandate to accelerate domestic adoption of SAF. A potential path forward includes setting a minimum SAF blending requirement in aviation, complemented by appropriate incentives and support measures. Such efforts would help build confidence among stakeholders, encourage long-term investment in the SAF ecosystem, and ultimately enhance Thailand's position as a future regional hub for clean energy.",https://www.newswit.com/assets/newswit-32.png,N,,2025-03-31 23:56:47.846815

In a report released Monday by Travalyst, the sustainable travel initiative he founded, Prince Harry said the sector remains “off track” but has made some progress.
That number represents an 11% increase from 2023 levels, and figures are expected to grow again this year,” Prince Harry said.
Other major sources of emissions in travel include road transport, hotels, construction, and food and drink, according to the non-profit Sustainable Travel.
A study from the University of Queensland found that travel emissions are growing twice as fast as those in other industries.","Prince Harry has urged the travel industry to cut its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. In a report released Monday by Travalyst, the sustainable travel initiative he founded, Prince Harry said the sector remains “off track” but has made some progress.

“Last year saw a staggering 1.4 billion international tourist arrivals globally. That number represents an 11% increase from 2023 levels, and figures are expected to grow again this year,” Prince Harry said.

He added in the report that the travel sector should “align behind a set of three core goals focused on climate, nature, and communities.

He said that includes “reducing [travel’s] carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, protecting and restoring at least 30% of the planet, land and sea and promoting truly sustainable tourism that enables a just transition of inclusive economic benefits, reduced inequality, and which preserves local culture and fragile ecosystems.”

“The evidence shows we’re significantly off track,” Prince Harry said in the report.

But he added that more of the world’s biggest travel companies are trying to reduce emissions and come up with solutions.

Travalyst partners with businesses including Amadeus, Booking.com, Expedia, and Google to promote greener travel options and reduce emissions.

Aviation: The Biggest Polluter

Travalyst’s research shows aviation is the travel industry’s biggest emitter, accounting for 52% of total emissions. And with air travel set to grow, so will its environmental impact.

The aviation industry aims to reach net-zero by 2050. The plan? Mainly more efficient engines and greener jet fuel - sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said newer engines could reduce emissions by up to 25%.

The industry believes SAF could reduce emissions by up to 70%, but there are concerns that not enough is being produced to realize those gains.

Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) recent report showed that fuel producers are falling behind on SAF production.

Executives from some of the biggest airlines including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and British Airways owner IAG, echoed some of these concerns in an aviation meeting last week.

“Realistically, the SAF does not exist. We don’t see it,” said Benjamin Smith, chief executive of Air France-KLM.

Other major sources of emissions in travel include road transport, hotels, construction, and food and drink, according to the non-profit Sustainable Travel.

Many parts of the travel sector have pledged to reduce emissions and achieve net-zero by 2050, including hotels, online travel agents, and technology companies.

Travalyst said its work with Google, Booking.com, and Skyscanner has helped display flight emissions data in 130 billion searches worldwide.

“Millions of data points on sustainability help travellers make informed accommodation choices,” Prince Harry said.

Can the Industry Meet Its Goals?

Research suggests travel emissions are rising faster than almost any other sector.

A study from the University of Queensland found that travel emissions are growing twice as fast as those in other industries.

With just five years until 2030, that 50% reduction goal looks increasingly out of reach.

A Travalyst spokesperson told Skift there’s no single roadmap for cutting emissions in travel and tourism.

“Different sectors and governments have their own approaches based on specific challenges, regulations, and technology,” the spokesperson said. “The 2030 target is a global milestone, not just for travel and tourism. While emissions from travel are projected to rise, the industry is actively working toward a more sustainable future.”

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented, “We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.
In 2024, Farnborough Airport was awarded Level 4+carbon accreditation status by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme, one of only five U.K. airports and the only business aviation airport to achieve such recognition.
Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power.
We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.","Farnborough Airport, the Birthplace of British Aviation and Europe’s leading airport for premium air travel connectivity, on March 20 announced that it has signed a landmark deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million liters or 10,000 metric tons per annum of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced locally from waste.

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million liters of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the U.K.

The U.K. and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivizing farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks. SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (hydro processed esters and fatty acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented, “We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the U.K. Government’s own target of 10% by 2030. What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the U.K.

He went on to comment, “The transition to new fueling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen. Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support. As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

This news follows a series of successful milestones in recent years at the Airport. In 2024, Farnborough Airport was awarded Level 4+carbon accreditation status by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme, one of only five U.K. airports and the only business aviation airport to achieve such recognition. Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power. In 2022, for a two-week trial period in the lead up to the Farnborough International Airshow, Farnborough Airport became the first airport in the world to offer SAF at the same price as standard Jet A1 fuel, after it took a major step in driving the adoption of SAF by offering it to all customers the year prior. Also in 2022, Farnborough Airport made a commitment to be Net Zero by 2030 or sooner for emissions within its control, setting one of the most ambitious targets in the aviation industry.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented, “We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill.

Thus, while India’s potential capacity for SAF production is significant, multiple interventions are required to realise its potential fully.
Together, we can propel the aviation sector into a new era of sustainability, ensuring that the skies remain a symbol of progress and opportunity for future generations.
Per Deloitte India report, “Green wings: India’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) revolution in the making,” India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by FY40.
The report indicates that an 8–10 million tonnes production would surpass India's estimated domestic demand of 4.5 million tonnes for a 15 percent blending mandate in 2040 across all flights.","The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has introduced the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) scheme to limit aviation emissions to 85 percent of 2019 levels, necessitating decarbonisation efforts in the sector.

Globally, aviation decarbonisation can be achieved through multiple levers such as operational improvement, hydrogen fuel, electric aircraft, SAF, etc. Operational improvement initiatives, which have helped the aviation sector substantially reduce fuel consumption in the last two decades, can deliver only a limited impact in the future. New technologies such as hydrogen fuel and electric aircraft are still in nascent stages. And the forecast for any meaningful and commercial-scale deployment is only after 2040. As a result, SAF is emerging as a key decarbonisation lever expected to contribute between 53 percent and 66 percent in achieving the net-zero targets for the aviation sector.

India currently accounts for ~2.5 percent of the global ATF demand. Given India’s abundant feedstock for SAF and high exposure to exports for ATF (50 percent of ATF produced being exported), India is well-positioned to capitalise on the rising global demand for SAF. Thus, while India’s potential capacity for SAF production is significant, multiple interventions are required to realise its potential fully. A strategic focus on SAF would strengthen India’s leadership in the aviation sector as it transitions toward more sustainable practices, and concerted efforts are required from all ecosystem stakeholders. This includes establishing a clear and long-term regulatory roadmap, formalising SAF feedstock supply chains, creating ecosystem partnerships, institutionalising financial incentives and transparent pricing mechanisms, and identifying certification agencies to fast-track investments.

We hope this report, compiled through a series of deep conversations with key industry leaders in India and across the globe, presents you with real insights and actionable takeaways. As you explore it, we hope it inspires action and fosters the collective ambition required to navigate the complexities of this journey.

Together, we can propel the aviation sector into a new era of sustainability, ensuring that the skies remain a symbol of progress and opportunity for future generations.

Per Deloitte India report, “Green wings: India’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) revolution in the making,” India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by FY40. Investments worth INR6–7 lakh crore (US$70–85 billion) would be required to realise the projected SAF production. It will give impetus to the aviation sector's decarbonisation efforts, reducing carbon emissions to 20–25 million tonnes annually.

The report indicates that an 8–10 million tonnes production would surpass India's estimated domestic demand of 4.5 million tonnes for a 15 percent blending mandate in 2040 across all flights.

It turns out that the number one factor influencing whether women thrive at work isn’t their mindset — it’s the workplace culture.
When women feel valued and supported, they report they are more engaged, productive and creative.
On average, women thrive in environments where they receive support, feel empowered and are able to share concerns and work through obstacles without fear of judgment.
What thriving really looks like Thriving at work isn’t about pushing harder — it’s about changing the work cultures that make success feel like an uphill battle.","For decades, women have been told that success at work requires grit, resilience and perseverance. The message has been clear: push through, work harder and individual tenacity will eventually pay off. But what if the real key to success isn’t just about surviving adversity alone? What if it’s about changing the workplace itself — so that everyone can thrive?

Our latest research in our Thriving at Work Study challenges the deeply embedded belief that professional success is an individual battle. It turns out that the number one factor influencing whether women thrive at work isn’t their mindset — it’s the workplace culture. Poor communication, ineffective leadership, and lack of transparency are the main barriers to women thriving.

Thriving cultures allow everyone to feel they are doing meaningful work, that they are valued and that they can grow and develop. While thriving might sound aspirational and maybe even unattainable, we have seen that it is not just achievable but a business’s long-term success.

Why thriving matters

We began our research by asking participants at our long-running Simmons Leadership Conference (the vast majority of whom are women) what it means to thrive and how it benefits them and their organizations. Our research shows that thriving at work has clear, measurable benefits. When women feel valued and supported, they report they are more engaged, productive and creative. They stay longer, reducing costly turnover.

A report by Deloitte examines the impact of supportive workplace cultures on women’s engagement and retention and finds that 63% of women who work in inclusive and supportive workplaces say they plan to stay at their company for more than three years. They go above and beyond their job descriptions, driving innovation. Thus, the impact of workplace thriving extends beyond individual employees — it can influence the bottom line.

Thriving levels may be declining

In our latest research study, we launched the Thrive Index to measure reported levels of thriving at work and to understand what the blockers and barriers were to thriving more deeply. We learned that thriving may be on the decline. Our Thrive Index shows a downturn in women’s reported level of thriving between the first and second halves of 2024. In early 2024, our survey respondents rated their workplace thriving at 3.4 out of 5. By the end of the year, that number had dropped to 3.2.

The role of leadership: Fostering open and supportive environments

One of the key factors in enabling women to thrive is excellence in leadership. But what kind of leadership? On average, women thrive in environments where they receive support, feel empowered and are able to share concerns and work through obstacles without fear of judgment. This isn’t about being overly protective — it’s about fostering openness and inclusion in a way that enhances overall team performance and produces value.

What thriving really looks like

Thriving at work isn’t about pushing harder — it’s about changing the work cultures that make success feel like an uphill battle. Our research shows three key factors that determine whether someone thrives at work:

Clear and transparent communication – When employees are left in the dark, they feel undervalued and disconnected. Leaders who communicate openly and frequently create environments where people feel included, engaged and aligned with the mission.

Supportive leadership – Micromanagement, avoidance of tough conversations and favoritism create toxic workplaces. Leaders who check in regularly, provide actionable feedback and invest in their employees’ growth foster thriving cultures.

Sustainable workloads and work-life balance – Success should not come at the cost of burnout. Workplaces that prioritize realistic expectations, respect boundaries and support well-being see higher retention and performance.

Thriving is for everyone

Our research reveals that thriving isn’t a luxury; it’s an organizational imperative. Women are ready to go the extra mile, but they need workplaces that enable them to do it without burning out, breaking down or feeling undervalued.

The real opportunity isn’t just making work better for women. It’s about making it better for everyone. We believe that what our research tells us about what women need in order to thrive — meaningful work, recognition and opportunities for growth — are likely things everyone wants. For example, Gallup’s research in 2024 showed that well-recognized employees are 45% less likely to have turned over after two years. Gallup also found that organizations that have made a strategic investment in employee development report 11% greater profitability. Organizations that invest in ensuring all people managers (regardless of identity) take action to remove barriers and create enablers for all to thrive will reap the most significant rewards.

Advancements in efficiency, sustainability, and performance, among other things, will reinvent the future of commercial aviation.

Nature-Inspired Wing Design: Breaking All Existing Boundaries

Aircraft wings have continuously evolved since the early days of flight, and Airbus aims to push the boundaries even further. The next-generation single-aisle aircraft wing concept offers higher lift, less drag, and improved efficiency by harnessing biomimicry and cutting-edge aerodynamics.

One main feature being considered is a folding wingtip, similar to the one found on the B777X. This could enhance the wingspan during flight while still making it compatible with current airport gates.

This is where the Wing Technology Development Centre in Filton, UK, plays a crucial role in these technologies. The research program, known as the Wing of Tomorrow (WoT), aims not only to investigate new types of aerodynamic configurations but also to devise wing production and assembly technologies that will make tomorrow’s aircraft lighter, stronger, and cheaper to produce.

Next-Gen Propulsion: Open Fan Technology

Propulsion systems have made impressive strides, evolving from yesterday's piston engine to today's fuel-efficient turbofan. Now, Airbus is considering the next step: the open fan engine. Open fan engines feature larger, uncowled blades, allowing for a more efficient airstream than conventional turbofans, which results in lower fuel consumption and emissions.

Airbus is partnering with CFM International on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program, which targets a 20% reduction in fuel burn and CO2 emissions compared to today’s most efficient single-aisle aircraft. By the end of this decade, the company foresees test-flying an open fan engine on its A380 test platform, sealing the right path to a more sustainable aviation future.

Hybrid-Electric, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Integration

Airbus focuses on a hybrid approach to power the next-generation aircraft to achieve more efficiency. Key innovations include:

Hybrid-Electric Propulsion: While still at the experimental stage, Airbus is working on systems enabling electricity generated by batteries or fuel cells to support jet fuel, potentially cutting emissions by as much as 5%.

Solid-State Battery Research: Airbus is developing solid-state batteries that are lighter and higher-energy than conventional lithium-ion batteries. These batteries will allow for more efficient taxiing and non-propulsive operations.

EcoPulse demonstrator: A collaboration between Airbus, Daher, and Safran has already gained key knowledge on implementing battery-powered high-voltage systems in commercial aircraft.

New Materials Make Planes Lighter, Stronger

The materials of aircraft have evolved from wood and Aluminium to Carbon-fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and titanium. Airbus is now looking into even more exotic composite options like biomass composites and thermoplastics, which provide lower weight but also higher recyclability and manufacturing times.

This evolution has been foreshadowed by the Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD), a Clean Sky 2 project led by Airbus. By using CFRTP instead of traditional CFRP, Airbus demonstrated weight savings without penalties, making recycling and production efficient.

Aircraft Commercial Digital Systems

Airbus was the pioneer in digital technology in aviation, the first manufacturer to introduce fly-by-wire on its aircraft in the 1980s. This will replace the next-generation single-aisle aircraft with a fully connected digital fly-by-wire plane to improve safety, efficiency, and automation.

Key features include:

Live Data Processing: Real-time AI-driven processing platforms will enhance predictive maintenance and performance.

Automated Pilot Assistance: This will provide pilots with enhanced operational support, drastically improving safety and precision.

Innovative Ground Operations: The combination of automated ground handling and ground maintenance systems will lead to increased turnaround time efficiency and reduced operational costs

Bottom Line: New Era for Single-Aisle Planes

Airbus's next-generation single-aisle aircraft will feature advanced wing designs, open fan propulsion, hybrid-electric capabilities, sustainable materials, and AI-driven digital systems.

El Mecanismo de Certidumbre de Ingresos (MCI) es una nueva política del Gobierno británico. Su objetivo es acelerar el desarrollo del combustible de aviación sostenible (SAF). El MCR garantiza rendimientos estables a los productores. Esto reduce el riesgo de inversión y fomenta el abandono de los combustibles fósiles. Dado que la aviación se enfrenta a una creciente presión para descarbonizarse, el MCR se convierte en una pieza clave del plan del Reino Unido para alcanzar las emisiones netas cero en los vuelos en 2050.

Para apoyar esta visión, el Gobierno británico está implantando el RCM como parte de su programa más amplio Marco político de las FAS. Al ofrecer estabilidad de mercado a largo plazo, el mecanismo fomenta la inversión privada y permite a los promotores de combustibles limpios ampliar su escala con mayor confianza. En este artículo analizaremos lo que se ha decidido, a quién afecta el mecanismo, cómo y cuándo se aplicará, y cómo se alinea con los esfuerzos más amplios de descarbonización del Reino Unido.

¿Qué se ha decidido sobre el MCR?

En Enero de 2025el Gobierno británico anunció su decisión de aplicar un Modelo de precio de ejercicio garantizado para el MCR. Al igual que el Contratos por diferencia (CfD) modelo utilizado en los mercados de electricidad renovable, este enfoque garantiza que los productores de SAE reciban un precio garantizado por su combustible.

Si los precios de mercado caen por debajo del precio de ejercicio, el MCR cubrirá la diferencia.

Si los precios superan el precio de ejercicio, los productores devolverán el excedente.

Para mantener la sostenibilidad financiera del mecanismo, el Departamento de Transporte (DfT) propuso una tasa variable en marzo de 2025. Los proveedores de combustible de aviación pagarían al fondo. Este fondo protegería a los promotores de FAE de las oscilaciones del mercado y mostraría el apoyo a largo plazo del Gobierno a los combustibles limpios.

¿A quién afectará el mecanismo de ingresos seguros?

El MCR está concebido principalmente para beneficiar a Productores SAFEn particular, las que se enfrentan a costes iniciales elevados y beneficios inciertos. Sin embargo, su impacto se extiende a todo el ecosistema de la aviación:

Proveedores de combustible de aviación contribuirán al fondo a través de la exacción propuesta.

Aerolíneas pueden tener que adaptar sus estrategias de adquisición de combustible a medida que cambien los costes y la disponibilidad.

Inversores y promotores de proyectos obtendrán una mayor visibilidad de los ingresos, lo que hará que los proyectos de FAE sean más atractivos y financiables.

Al reducir el riesgo financiero y garantizar rendimientos previsibles, se espera que el MCR desbloquee importantes inversiones privadas e impulse el crecimiento de las infraestructuras en el sector de las FAE.

¿Cuándo se introducirá el MCR?

El Gobierno británico tiene previsto lanzar el MCR en 2026en línea con su objetivo de tener al menos cinco plantas comerciales de SAE en construcción para 2025-un hito clave en el mandato de las FAE.

He aquí una cronología de alto nivel:

Mediados de 2025: El Gobierno seguirá consultando a las partes interesadas y recabando opiniones del sector.

Finales de 2025: Los funcionarios finalizarán el diseño de la política e introducirán la legislación necesaria.

2026: El Mecanismo de Certidumbre de Ingresos entrará en funcionamiento, proporcionando estabilidad de ingresos a los productores de SAE.

Este planteamiento gradual da tiempo para planificar los proyectos, adaptar la normativa y lograr una participación efectiva de la industria.

Posición del Gobierno británico sobre la MCR

En Ministerio de Transportes ha subrayado que el MCR es crucial para acelerar la inversión en FAE. Según su funcionario Enero de 2025 respuesta:

""Un mecanismo de certidumbre de ingresos es esencial para apoyar el despliegue comercial de las instalaciones de producción de SAE, que a menudo se enfrentan a costes de capital y operativos más elevados en comparación con los combustibles fósiles.""

Esta declaración deja clara la postura del Gobierno. SAF es vital para alcanzar los Estrategia Jet Zeroy el MCR es una forma inteligente, impulsada por el mercado, de aumentar la producción. En lugar de funcionar como una subvención, el mecanismo corrige los desequilibrios del mercado y ayuda a los combustibles limpios a competir con alternativas fósiles más baratas.

Impulso de 63 millones de libras a través del Fondo de Combustibles Avanzados (AFF)

Para seguir apoyando a la industria de las FAE, el Gobierno británico también se comprometió a 63 millones de libras en financiación para 2025/26 a través de la Fondo de Combustibles Avanzados (AFF). Esta iniciativa pretende acelerar el desarrollo de proyectos mediante:

Financiación instalaciones de SAE a escala comercial

En apoyo de tecnologías de producción innovadoras

Proyectos regionales en ámbitos clave como Teesside y Humberside

El FFA contribuye a que los proyectos en fase inicial lleguen a un listo para invertir y cerrar la brecha entre innovación y comercialización. Con ello, no sólo se construye una cadena de suministro de FAE más sólida, sino que también se fomenta desarrollo económico regional y descarbonización industrial.

Por qué el RCM y la AFF son importantes para la aviación sostenible en el Reino Unido

Juntos, los Mecanismo de ingresos seguros y el Fondo de Combustibles Avanzados formar una estrategia global para situar al Reino Unido como líder mundial de la aviación limpia:

En RCM ofrece estabilidad de precios a largo plazo y fomenta la inversión privada en FAE.

En AFF desbloquea la innovación en fase inicial y refuerza la cartera de proyectos del Reino Unido.

En lugar de responder reactivamente a los objetivos climáticos, el Reino Unido está construyendo proactivamente una industria aeronáutica competitiva y preparada para el futuro, basada en la sostenibilidad y la innovación.

The company – now investing abroad for the first time ever – has reserved a 14-hectare land area in Rauma on the western coast of Finland.

Together with the energy company Fortum and the Port of Rauma, Norsk e-Fuel will now start with electricity grid connection planning and permitting processes to establish an e-Fuel production facility in Rauma.

In cooperation with Fortum and the Port of Rauma, Norsk e-Fuel will begin the planning of the area’s electricity connections and the permit processes for establishing an e-fuel production plant. The project is also the first outside Norway as the company expands its operations in Northern Europe.

By entering into a strategic partnership agreement with Fortum for site development, Norsk e-Fuel has secured sufficient space for an e-Fuel plant with an annual production volume of up to 100 million litres. Most of the product will be refined into synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) to provide fossil-free fuels to the aviation industry.

– We are currently working on the permits and detailed project plans for the project. One aspect of this is our work to prepare for the Environmental Impact Assessment, says Karl Hauptmeier, CEO of Norsk e-Fuel.

Wanted: Sustainable power

According to the CEO, Finland offers a unique combination of advantages for the e-Fuel industry – one of them being power.

– Finland has one of the cleanest grids in Europe and is continuing to have significant investments in new clean power generation. This, in addition to past and planned major investments in the transmission grid, offers great potential for energy-intensive industries, he says.

Hauptmeier notes that it is not only the aspect of power that made the company expand into Finland.

– The potential of approximately 24,4 million tons of bio-based CO2 ready for capture, access to well-developed transportation infrastructure and a strong workforce of highly educated people made the decision easy for us.

Teaming up with Boeing

The Rauma site can play an important role in increasing the supply of eSAF across Europe. EU regulations require aviation fuel suppliers to gradually increase the share of eSAF blended with conventional aviation fuel at EU airports, starting with a blending obligation of 1,2% in 2030 and rising to 35% by 2050. Given the energy-intensive nature of eSAF production, reliable grid connection and availability of clean power are essential.

Boeing and Norsk e-Fuel have just announced that they will start developing aviation fuels together. What’s the significance of this move?

– Boeing’s investment is supporting our entire project pipeline and this includes Rauma, Hauptmeier says.

Targeting performance

Finnish energy company Fortum is committed to promoting Green Transition – and the company has its own unit that helps industry players find suitable plots for their operations. Jyrki Holappa, head of Fortum’s Customer Site Development team, says that cooperation with Norsk e-Fuel began in autumn 2023.

– Our attention was soon drawn to the Rauma Port area, and we recognized that there was potential here, Holappa explains.

The land in question is partly owned by the Port of Rauma. The land is mainly owned by the City of Rauma and leased to the port.

– In order to enable new operations, the plot needs development in terms of both zoning and power issues, but the overall situation is solid, due to the logistical connections offered by the port.

Gas network is crucial

Gasgrid is a very important partner for Fortum.

– Building a hydrogen network is an undertaking with great national significance. Gases are needed in the Green Transition, Holappa says.

Holappa says that, ultimately, Fortum always wants to champion the cause of decarbonization. In terms of regional development, this means a variety of things, from production plants to data centers:

– Our focus is on large, power-intensive projects where we can genuinely help our customers, Holappa concludes.",https://gasgrid.fi/wp-content/uploads/Portrait_Karl-Hauptmeier_2_2022-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 14:56:27.885074

The country’s own net-zero transformation presents a $6 trillion opportunity through 2050 – equivalent to 6.6% of the country’s GDP over the same period – and as the host of COP30, Brazil has a chance to help shape the world’s climate agenda while also highlighting the progress it is making on its own climate goals.

The 2025 edition of the Brazil Transition Factbook, produced by BloombergNEF and commissioned by Bloomberg Philanthropies, aims to support policy, business and investment professionals by making available key data about the country’s energy transition. Across eight sectors of the low-carbon economy, the Factbook analyzes the key trends, challenges and opportunities that define Brazil’s energy transition – and considers how the country is positioned to support the world meet its climate targets.

On the one hand, Brazil’s energy transition is well under way. The country has the cleanest electricity generation among Group of 20 members and has seen a significant increase in wind and solar generation in the past few years. Energy storage is expected to take off soon. And after reaching six figures for the first time in 2024, electric vehicle sales are on track for another big bump, as Chinese automakers are planning to set up factories in Brazil later this year.

Yet Brazil’s primary energy demand still relies significantly on fossil fuels, and further electrification will be critical if the country is to meet its net-zero goals.

Beyond its own transition, Brazil could play a key role in helping decarbonize the world by providing biofuels, energy transition metals and nature-based solutions. Sustainable aviation fuel targets now cover 45% of global jet fuel demand, and Brazil’s well-developed biofuels industry could play a role in supplying SAF at competitive prices – although announced projects in the country represent just 2% of total projected supply by 2030.

Brazil’s biomass availability could help build out the country’s green-steel industry as clean hydrogen developers grapple with high costs and low demand. And Brazil is one of the world’s top sources for critical energy transition metals.

It also has one of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems in the world, which means Brazil could lead the way in sustainable agriculture. The country’s corporate regenerative agriculture market is already the second-largest globally, and Brazil possesses the largest potential for nature-based solutions in the world.

To support these transitions, Brazil’s national sustainable taxonomy is expected to be finalized later this year, and carbon markets are likely to play a key role. The country stands at the nexus of domestic and global carbon markets, hosting COP30 – where attendees will try to finalize a worldwide market – just as its own offsets market gets off the ground.",https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/3484364292.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 13:56:28.901304

The United Kingdom has raised the bar for emission reductions by submitting its 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) goal to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The new target commits the country to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 81% (excluding shipping and aviation) from 1990 levels by 2035. This bolstered target expands on the prior commitment of a 68% reduction by 2030.

The UK was one of just 12 countries that submitted their updated NDCs to the UNFCCC by the original February 10 deadline. The deadline was subsequently extended to September to allow for inclusion in the NDC Synthesis Report that will be published before the COP in Brazil.

One key element of the UK’s submission is its current stance on Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. While it does not plan to use ITMOs to meet its targets, the UK has left the door open for future engagement. ITMOs provide countries with mechanisms to trade carbon credits authorized and correspondingly adjusted by host nations which can then be used to help meet their own NDCs.

For example, Switzerland has adopted this approach, striking bilateral agreements with Peru, Ghana, Thailand, and others under Article 6.2. These partnerships allow nations to take a cooperative approach to achieving their climate goals by tapping into international emissions reductions. Switzerland’s strategy to gradually reduce its reliance on ITMOs from 2031 onward indicates a maturing framework for their use.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) faces investment hurdles

The push for decarbonizing aviation through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) continues, but recent challenges loom larger than anticipated. US government programs that once bolstered SAF development, such as the SAF Grand Challenge and the 40B blenders’ tax credit, are facing uncertainty. This transition away from the 40B credit to the production-oriented 45Z tax credit has added complexities, directly impacting the path forward for innovative SAF technologies.

Under 45Z, tax credits are linked to carbon intensity (CI) scores. For instance, HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) fuels with lower CI scores receive larger credits, making waste feedstocks particularly advantageous. Technologies like Fischer-Tropsch (FT), derived from biomass feedstocks such as corn stover, are now gaining traction due to their lower CI scores with tax credits ranging up to $1.65 per gallon. Similarly, plant waste like sugarcane bagasse is being tapped to produce SAF within FT processes, with companies initiating pilot projects aimed at full-scale production in the years ahead.

Another emerging technology, power-to-liquids (PTL), holds great promise but faces significant obstacles. PTL could achieve a negative CI score when operational, qualifying for the maximum tax credit of $1.75 per gallon. However, its scalability and the removal of SAF-specific incentives raise concerns about its ability to reach commercial viability. The absence of sustained governmental

backing risks delaying critical advancements, which could impact aviation’s ability to achieve long-term emissions reductions.

Google deepens commitment to carbon removal

Google continues to be one of the leaders in corporate climate action with its large investment in carbon removal credits. For 2024, the company has committed over $100 million, spanning projects like direct air capture (DAC), enhanced rock weathering, biomass carbon sequestration, and biochar production. With nearly 800,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent removals secured to date, Google is making a notable contribution to scaling durable carbon removal solutions.

These investments, which include purchases through carbon demand aggregator Frontier, demonstrate Google’s holistic strategy. For example, biochar and enhanced rock weathering projects contribute towards Google’s portfolio, with scalability and innovation driving down costs for future buyers. Google’s commitment reflects a broader trend among corporations integrating climate innovation into their operations while supporting global net-zero ambitions.

United Airlines seeks scalable DAC initiatives

Through its Sustainable Flight Fund, United Airlines has made its first investment in Direct Air Capture (DAC) through project developer Heirloom. This partnership not only provides funding but also secures United the option to acquire up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent removals, either for sequestration or as a raw material for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production using power-to-liquid methods.

Heirloom’s technology combines DAC with geological storage to achieve permanent carbon removal. The company currently oversees a 1,000 tCO2 per year DAC facility in California, with the first phase of a larger Louisiana plant capable of capturing up to 17,000 tCO2 per year planned for 2026. A separate facility in Louisiana is set to add a further 100,000 tCO2e year of carbon removals in 2027. This collaboration underlines the growing engagement of the aviation sector with scalable carbon removal technologies to tackle the industry’s residual emissions.

Broader implications for voluntary carbon markets

The landscape of voluntary carbon markets continues to evolve, offering a mix of optimism and challenges. The UK’s ambitious climate targets, advancements in SAF production, and significant private-sector investments highlight the sector’s forward momentum. However, looming uncertainties in policy and funding underscore the challenges still facing the market.

Corporate and governmental collaboration remains critical to addressing gaps in support and scaling the adoption of innovative solutions, from SAF to DAC technologies. Staying informed and proactive is essential for stakeholders aiming to leverage the market’s potential fully.

Voluntary carbon markets are not only a bridge to today’s climate challenges but also a powerful platform for fostering long-term sustainability. By aligning with Fasmarkets latest news, pricing and analysis updates, market participants can better position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.

India is one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets and slowly, steps are being taken towards using SAF.

Aircraft maker Airbus has been pursuing initiatives for increasing the production and use of SAF, for which the demand is in Europe currently. It has also inked a partnership with the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun.

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer. The first one is the availability of feedstock, there is a lot of biomass waste, used cooking oil (and) municipal solid waste that can be recovered,"" Julien Manhes, head of SAF and Carbon Dioxide Removal Development Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, told PTI.

During an interaction at Toulouse last week, he asserted that SAF can help in addressing various issues, including pollution.

""In India, for example, the rice straws or the wheat straws that are burnt every year that makes for very bad air quality in Delhi, these could be used as a feedstock for SAF,"" he said.

Among other aspects that can push SAF production, Manhes said were India having a huge petrochemicals industry, a lot of refineries and engineering capabilities.

Airbus has partnered with the Indian Institute of Petroleum and they are working on a new way of making SAF. ""We are helping IIP to get the new way of making SAF technically approved... it is a specific partnership in India,"" he said.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association estimated SAF production to touch 2.1 million tonnes (2.7 billion litres) in 2025 and the projection was 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) for 2024.

As SAF is much more expensive than crude oil now, Airbus' Manhes said efforts should be made to ensure that SAF is competitive for which there should be mass scale.

""To reach mass scale, you need policies. The government has to either mandate SAF or support in production of SAF. That is why every country is doing regulatory engineering, finding the best regulatory mechanism that will help the local ecosystems grow.

""In India, there is a lot of work going on at the moment...,"" he noted.

According to the firm, Boston Consulting Group currently has a team of around 50 advisers permanently based out of Perth, along with a considerable FIFO roster, but aspires to significantly ramp up its local number of professionals over the next five years.

“Western Australia is globally recognised for its strength in natural resources and its growing leadership in innovation and technology,” stated Asia Pacific chair Neeraj Aggarwal. “Our new office reflects BCG’s deepening commitment to the state.”

Aggarwal noted that the new, larger state-of-the-art office would also support an expansion of the firm’s suite of services to the local market, including cutting-edge technologies via its BCG X division, with the further aim of positioning Perth as a ‘destination office’ to attract both new talent and current BCG professionals from around the world.

After originally setting up shop in 2011, BCG currently has five managing directors and partners stationed in Perth, including office leader and original member Matthew Leach, with the local team predominantly focused on the state’s resources and mining sectors and serving large global players such as Rio Tinto and BHP.

Amusingly, that first office in 2011, staffed by a small team of imports from Sydney, Melbourne, NZ, and Germany, had a capacity for just fifteen people, before the firm almost immediately won a major mining contract and had to bring in an additional 80-plus professionals to support the project, prompting its shift to its last St Georges Terrace address back in 2013.

CADO, created by IATA, will manage the new SAF Registry to promote a transparent, global market for sustainable aviation fuel.

CADO will operate as an independent entity from IATA, with an open and global approach to build trust across all stakeholders. “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Registry will track SAF transactions in a transparent manner, allowing the environmental benefits of SAF to be claimed against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes.

NEW YORK, March 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- New York's Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) has awarded its first tender to buy renewable diesel for its ferries. The tender is part of a plan announced in October 2024 to transition the Staten Island Ferry and other vessels to renewable diesel. DCAS is basing its tender — for barge delivery — on the New York Harbor R99 price published by global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus. Adopting renewable diesel is part of the DCAS plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the New York City Ferry service.

Renewable diesel (R99) is a biofuel that acts as a drop-in replacement for petroleum diesel with no requirement for engine modifications. Use of the fuel has grown in the US, spurred by environmental policy. California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard has driven big investments in renewable diesel production, and two major refineries in the state, P66 Rodeo and the Martinez renewables project refinery, a joint venture between Neste and Marathon, have switched from making petroleum diesel to renewable diesel. Companies have also invested in expanding renewable diesel capacity in the US Gulf coast.

DCAS, the NYC Department of Transportation, the NYC Department of Environmental Protection and NYC Parks have already begun testing the use of renewable diesel in vessels. The barge contract will enable the transition to long-term and large-scale renewable diesel use for City vessels.

Argus publishes comprehensive coverage of the renewable diesel market, including price assessments for markets in California and the US Gulf coast.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""We developed our renewable diesel prices in close consultation with buyers and sellers to provide essential transparency around market value in this evolving space. We are delighted that DCAS is using our price for its ferry fleet transition program.""

DCAS Deputy Commissioner and NYC Chief Fleet Officer Keith Kerman said: ""We have already moved all our heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to renewable diesel, making us the first major East Coast city to adopt green technology on such a large scale. As announced by the City in October 2024, step two is to move NYC's ferries and vessels to this more environmentally friendly fuel. DCAS contracts with Argus for fuel market information and Argus has now provided us with a new resource to compare renewable with conventional fuel pricing in our contracts.""

Argus' R99 prices are published daily in the Argus Americas Biofuels report. R99 is the most traded grade of renewable diesel in key US spot markets, reflecting volume priced without tax credits or government mandates.

Argus is the leading provider of renewable fuel indexes and benchmarks for renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and for the key feedstock used cooking oil across the globe. Its indexes are used as the settlement basis for futures contracts in the US, Europe and Asia.

European Union

The Council of the EU has approved the so-called ""stop the clock"" directive which forms part of the European Commission's proposed EU Omnibus Package. The directive postpones by two years the application of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for large companies that have not yet started reporting, and by one year the transposition deadline and first phase of application (covering the largest companies) of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

A vote for the ""stop the clock"" proposals has been scheduled by the European Parliament for 1 April. Parliament remains divided, however, with various political groups expressing differing views on the proposal. The proposals will only enter into force once the Parliament and Council have reached an agreement on the final version of the text.

The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), which has been mandated by the Commission to prepare the EU sustainability reporting standards (ESRS) that companies will need to apply when they report under CSRD, has undertaken a mapping exercise with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a widely adopted voluntary environmental disclosure platform. The exercise allows companies that apply ESRS 1 to be better equipped to complete CDP disclosures and companies disclosing through the CDP platform to prepare for CSRD reporting.

The Commission has published an action plan for the European automotive industry, including a relaxation of the CO2 standards regulation, which would have resulted in significant fines for carmakers that had not met their targets for electric vehicle take up. The amendment will allow carmakers to meet their compliance targets over a three-year period (2025-2027) rather than on an annual compliance cycle. The overall target for a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars and vans registered in the EU from 2035 remains.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority have dropped proposed rules and expectations aimed at improving diversity and inclusion in regulated firms in response to ""the broad range of feedback received, expected legislative developments and to avoid additional burdens on firms at this time"" (see below for the expected legislative developments mentioned). The rules had been the subject of consultation in 2023 and had been anticipated for some time. The FCA will be setting out its next steps on tackling non-financial misconduct by the end of June this year.

As part of its proposed draft Equality (Race and Disability) Bill, the government has opened a consultation to seek views on how to implement mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap reporting for large employers (more than 250 employees) in Great Britain, with changes likely to be implemented in 2026. At present, employers with more than 250 employees are only under a statutory duty to report on their gender pay gaps.

The Home Office has updated its statutory guidance on transparency in supply chains under section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This is the first time it has been updated since it was first published in 2015. Section 54 obligates businesses with an annual turnover of £36 million or more that supply goods or services and conduct business in the UK to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement. The updated guidance outlines how businesses should comply with both the letter and ""spirit"" of the law, and goes into a lot more detail on what the ""spirit"" means.

Large organisations within scope of the extended producer responsibility (EPR) scheme for packaging must submit their July-December 2024 data by 1 April 2025. Small organisations must also submit their January-December 2024 data by this date. Businesses that place packaging on the UK market should check whether they fall within scope of the EPR and if so, submit the relevant data by the deadline.

The Department for Transport has launched a new consultation on the revenue certainty mechanism that will support investment into sustainable aviation fuel in the UK. The government is proposing that the revenue certainty mechanism should be funded by industry and that the preferred approach is to introduce a levy on suppliers of jet fuel.

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer.","Synopsis

India has great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) using available biomass waste and feedstocks like rice and wheat straws. Airbus is working with the Indian Institute of Petroleum to develop new SAF production methods. Policies and government support are vital for scaling production and making SAF more cost-competitive.

India has many attributes to become a great producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which can help reduce pollution, as rice and wheat straws can also be used as a feedstock for SAF, according to a senior Airbus official. India is one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets and slowly, steps are being taken towards using SAF.

Aircraft maker Airbus has been pursuing initiatives for increasing the production and use of SAF, for which the demand is in Europe currently. It has also inked a partnership with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun.

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer. The first one is the availability of feedstock, there is a lot of biomass waste, used cooking oil (and) municipal solid waste that can be recovered,"" Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) Development Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, told PTI.

During an interaction at Toulouse last week, he asserted that SAF can help in addressing various issues, including pollution.

""In India, for example, the rice straws or the wheat straws that are burnt every year that makes for very bad air quality in Delhi, these could be used as a feedstock for SAF,"" he said.

Live Events

Among other aspects that can push SAF production, Manhes said India also has a huge petrochemicals industry, a lot of refineries and engineering capabilities.

Airbus has partnered with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) and they are working on a new way of making SAF. ""...we are helping IIP to get the new way of making SAF technically approved... it is a specific partnership in India,"" he said.

He also said that by 2040 or 2050, India could be producing 100 million tonnes of SAF or slightly less.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated SAF production to touch 2.1 million tonnes (2.7 billion litres) in 2025 and the projection was 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) for 2024.

IATA represents around 340 airlines, including Indian carriers, that account for more than 80 per cent of the global air traffic.

As SAF is much more expensive than crude oil now, Airbus' Manhes said efforts should be made to ensure that SAF is competitive for which there should be mass scale.

""To reach mass scale, you need policies. The government has to either mandate SAF or support in production of SAF. That is why every country is doing regulatory engineering, finding the best regulatory mechanism that will help the local ecosystems grow.

""In India, there is a lot of work going on at the moment...,"" he noted.

On the current demand for SAF, he said the demand is clearly in Europe now while the production is spread across Europe, China and the US. ""What we are working on is to stimulate demand in other countries"".

Last week, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told PTI that SAF, which can help reduce carbon emissions, provides an opportunity for India, where sustainability is high on the agenda.

Delta says JetZero’s vastly more fuel-efficient, blended-wing-body (BWB) design is one facet of its ongoing journey to advance industry innovation, reduce cost through increased fuel savings, elevate the customer experience and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Delta’s formal partnership with JetZero comes after the startup received a $235M grant from the US Air Force in 2023 to help facilitate building a full-scale demonstrator for first flight in 2027. Delta’s operational expertise will play a crucial role in development.

“Working with JetZero to realize an entirely new airframe and experience for customers and employees is bold and important work to advance the airline industry’s fuel saving initiatives and innovation goals,” said Amelia DeLuca, Delta’s Chief Sustainability Officer. “While Delta is focused on doing what we can today to address our carbon footprint, it’s critical we also work with a variety of partners to advance revolutionary technologies, like JetZero’s blended-wing-body aircraft, to solve for a significant portion of future aviation emissions.”

The partnership with JetZero — the newest member of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab — marks Delta’s fourth “revolutionary fleet” partnership outlined in its Sustainability Roadmap, launched in 2023, by which it aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

“JetZero is working to change the world by bringing to market an aircraft that aims to fly this decade and make immediate and marked progress toward reducing airline energy costs, and the associated emissions,” said JetZero cofounder and CEO Tom O’Leary. “The ability to realize such significant efficiency gains in the near future meaningfully impacts the industry’s commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and will serve as the foundation on which other technologies and efficiencies can be realized. Delta was one of the first carriers to partner with us, supporting us behind the scenes since 2023, and we look forward to their continued support of our program through their deep knowledge and expertise.”

The evolution of the blended wing body

The BWB’s biomimetic design, inspired by the manta ray, is among a growing group of nature-derived innovations that are helping to optimize aircraft design for sustainability and efficiency. First tested and demonstrated in the 1990s by NASA and Stanford University, BWB aircraft could achieve a 50 percent reduction in fuel consumption and emissions compared to current commercial jets — thanks to its markedly lighter weight, which creates less drag.

Other anticipated traveler and sustainability benefits include:

Capacity to carry more than 250 customers — similar to existing, widebody aircraft — to provide the capacity and range needed to meet growing travel demand.

Less noise — with engines mounted on top of the aircraft, BWB aircraft are expected to be significantly quieter than existing aircraft.

The potential to fit into existing airport infrastructure and offer faster turn-around times.

The ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to further decrease lifecycle carbon emissions.

Delta will also help design a new interior experience for the BWB’s uniquely shaped frame to ensure a best-in-class customer and employee experience. Anticipated changes include dedicated overhead bin space for each passenger, accessible seats and lavatories, and fewer rows.",https://sb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/production/52037/conversions/production-asset-thumb--delta-jetzero-advancing-50-more-fuel-efficient-aircraft-2025-03-31-050d382e60af83e9b62b189d61ed790d-fbimg.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 09:56:59.513691

These partners, which generate large volumes of UCO in both industrial and service sectors, will contribute to the supply chain supporting SAF production at scale.
Ms Natthinya Netyasupha, Director-General of DIPROM, explained that her department has collaborated with internal agencies to study SAF demand, production capacity, and feedstock availability.
“These steps are essential to building confidence, attracting long-term investment, and reinforcing Thailand’s leadership in clean aviation fuel within the region,” he added.","The Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM) has partnered with Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited and five leading business organisations to accelerate the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Thailand. This public-private collaboration is driven by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the “Management of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) for the Production of SAF in Line with the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy Policy.”

The initiative aims to establish a nationwide UCO supply chain as a key feedstock for commercial-scale SAF production. By promoting a circular economy approach, the collaboration supports Thailand’s push toward carbon neutrality, enhances energy security, and boosts the country’s aviation sector to meet international sustainability standards.

Mr Akanat Promphan, Minister of Industry, emphasised that the move aligns with the government's policy direction under Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, aimed at positioning Thailand as a key economic player and aviation hub in the region. The SAF initiative also supports the Ministry’s “Fighting, Saving, Creating” policy, which focuses on waste management reform, SME competitiveness, and development of green industries to meet net-zero goals.

“This MoU marks the beginning of comprehensive public-private integration that will benefit the nation across economic, environmental, and social dimensions,” said Mr Akanat.

Dr Nattapol Rangsitpol, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, noted that the ministry has developed a framework for promoting SAF production and assessing UCO’s potential as a domestic feedstock. It is also working to build a collaborative industrial network to strengthen the SAF ecosystem.

The MoU was signed by DIPROM, Bangchak, and five key partners: Central Group, Thai Beverage PCL, Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, Thai President Foods PCL, and the Thai Food Processors Association.

It also aims to set a precedent for UCO collection in households, supporting long-term sustainability in both energy and waste management.

Mr Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation PCL, said the Group is ready to support Thailand’s SAF ambitions with its ability to produce 1 million litres of 100% Neat SAF per day, certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme.

While welcoming government and private sector support, Mr Chaiwat identified two urgent issues for policy makers:

Expanding feedstock diversity to support SAF production; and

Establishing a clear national mandate for SAF usage, including blending targets and investment incentives.

“These steps are essential to building confidence, attracting long-term investment, and reinforcing Thailand’s leadership in clean aviation fuel within the region,” he added.

This landmark collaboration reflects a unified effort across sectors to accelerate Thailand’s clean energy transition, unlock economic opportunities, and help tackle the climate crisis.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20250331/c1_2992029_700.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 07:56:13.691514

Speaking at the 2025 Airbus Summit, the company solidified its commitment to introduce a commercially viable hydrogen aircraft to the market, putting forward a number of key technological building blocks it plans to utilise in enabling its introduction.

Said technologies include a set of four, 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines driven by a fuel cell system converting hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy.

The technology, which Airbus states will be refined over the coming years, would be supplied to a prospective hydrogen aircraft via two liquid hydrogen tanks.

Airbus Head of Future Programmes, Bruno Fichefeux says, said:

Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonise aviation. While we've adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering.

Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, Glenn Llewellyn, adds:

Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology.

In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.

Airbus first demonstrated its 1.2MW hydrogen-propulsion system in 2023, with subsequent end-to-end testing of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters and heat exchangers taking place throughout 2024.

""The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF,"" Willie says.","Right now, the scaling of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is one of the aerospace sector's topmost priorities.

However, it is also one of the industry's biggest problems.

While SAF is being used by airlines in 2025, the amount available is nowhere close to the amount required to sustain air travel at its current rate.

At the end of 2024, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production worldwide.

“SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly,” says Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.

Clearly, the production of SAF needs to accelerate, and soon.

That is why IATA has announced the creation of a new body to manage the future of SAF production globally.

The Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) is an independent organisation and its main function will be to manage the SAF Registry, a group established during COP28 to promote the scaling of SAF across the sector.

Based in Montreal, CADO will be tasked with managing the registry with an open and global approach to ensure transparency and trust among stakeholders.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry,"" says Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist.

""Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.”

Ensuring transparency and market liquidity

The SAF Registry is designed to be a critical piece of infrastructure in the aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

By creating a standardised and transparent system for tracking SAF transactions, the registry aims to facilitate the growth of a global SAF market.

Airlines, corporate customers and regulatory bodies will be able to verify the environmental benefits of SAF and claim them under compliance or voluntary emissions reduction schemes.

One of the primary challenges in scaling up SAF adoption is its limited supply, with production sites concentrated in specific regions.

The SAF Registry aims to bridge this gap by linking airlines with SAF producers, suppliers and investors, regardless of geographical barriers.

Additionally, corporate customers will be able to participate in emissions reductions within the aviation sector and contribute to co-financing decarbonisation efforts.

""The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF,"" Willie says.

""The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5428b9c1ee8be3ce810045098f1c3286:8694eba38155a4a1325bf98d47cb28f3/the-establishment-of-cado-could-jumpstart-the-production-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 07:56:21.748472

“There is broad interest in monetizing waste streams.” Significant demand is forecast for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made from waste fats and oils.
For example, cement kilns and asphalt plants are buyers of any high-BTU (British Thermal Units) fuels.
Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) and Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) reached completion on new SAF production last October at their Diamond Green Diesel joint-venture in Port Arthur, Texas.
The conventional market for UMO has been fuel for ships or power plants, which has high carbon emissions.","Energy transition is creating M&A opportunities in green fuels and lubricants. Margins can be captured upgrading waste streams to reuse, supplemented by a range of environmental and tax credits to be harvested or traded. Rollup and consolidation opportunities are appearing, but logistics and commodity prices remain headwinds.

“The waste-to-value environmental services sector is open to capital deployment or M&A,” says Effram Kaplan, head of the infrastructure and environmental practice at Brown Gibbons Lang. “There is broad interest in monetizing waste streams.”

Significant demand is forecast for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made from waste fats and oils. Domestic SAF production volume was small until two big public refiners added capacity last year. Another PE-backed development is diverting used motor oil from the power and ship-fuel market to re-refine and reuse.

“The new administration will have an effect that might not be obvious,” suggests Kaplan. “Given the view of subsidies in general, there will be challenges for some forms of alternative energy, but others are very viable without subsidies. For example, cement kilns and asphalt plants are buyers of any high-BTU (British Thermal Units) fuels. So certain green fuels will do well.”

Kaplan notes that waste processors — including GFL Environmental; VLS Environmental, owned by I Squared Capital; and Reworld, owned by EQT Group — blend waste oils and fats with high-BTU solid waste, such as from construction and demolition.

“There are evolving opportunities to protect volumes and monetize waste streams,” he adds, “starting with the expansion of services and collection, and deploying processing technologies. That enhances both conservation and margins. Once you sort the stream into hazardous and non-hazardous, solids and liquids, the opportunities become abundant to pursue M&A and consolidation.”

Early in January GFL struck an $8 billion deal to sell its environmental services business to Apollo (NYSE: APO). BGL was among several advisors on the complex transaction.

Specific to biofuels, there is increasing interest, says JP Hanson, global head of oil and gas at Houlihan Lokey (NYSE: HLI), but so far it is still early in terms of ability to demonstrate scale. “We’ve been hit up with proposals to raise capital for brownfield-into-green-fuels developments at about 30 refineries globally, but economic margins and timeframe to generate consistent cash flows still don’t compete with traditional crude refining margins so as to justify full-scale conversion.”

Of all the green fuels and lubricants, SAF has the most promise for broad application and cashflow generation. “It’s still a relatively small scale, fragmented sub-industry but is a growing market with real demand,” says Hanson. “Jet-A production is limited, so the most meaningful way to meet that increase in demand will be with SAF. Ultimately, SAF could end up being as much as 60 percent of aviation fuel volume.”

Hanson notes that strategics “are not getting out of the traditional refining sector, so we do not foresee a big wave of existing refineries to convert or otherwise repurpose to biofuels. In my experience, the backers of biofuel projects that are getting support to scale up are smart engineers, but so far those opportunities are mostly bespoke situations.”

The global demand for Jet-A, the most common type of aviation fuel, is expected to double, roughly from about 330 millions gallons (8 million barrels) per day today to about 630 million gallons a day (15 million barrels) by 2050.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there were only two small SAF producers this time last year, World Energy in Paramount, Calif. and Montana Renewables in Great Falls.

Last June Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) completed the reconfiguration of its Rodeo complex in the San Francisco Bay Area to produce biodiesel and SAF. Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) and Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) reached completion on new SAF production last October at their Diamond Green Diesel joint-venture in Port Arthur, Texas. Aemetis received a $200 million federal investment last March for its SAF, renewable natural gas, and carbon sequestration projects.

Separately, the Braya Renewable Fuels, backed by Cresta Fund Management, reached 18,000 b/d of biodiesel production at its reconfigured refinery in Newfoundland, Canada. Plans call for an expansion to 40,000 b/d of biodiesel and SAF.

In a public-private collaboration, Blue Tide Environmental recycles used motor oil (UMO) to produce high-quality base oils at its Baytown, Texas facility. It is in the process of starting its hydrotreater starting with an initial capacity of 5,000 barrels a day. Blue Tide is a portfolio company of Tailwater Capital, and is partly owned by Pennzoil Quaker State, a subsidiary of Shell (NYSE: SHEL).

“Our ability to deploy this process internationally is one of the reasons Shell was excited about the platform,” says David Cecere, partner of Tailwater, and board member of Blue Tide. “It is an all-new facility on a brownfield site. Re-refining has been around for many years, and there are well-established processes for collecting UMO and using a hydrotreater to recycle base oils, so there is not any significant technology risk.”

The key, Cecere adds, “is finding a location where there is a large volume of UMO, as well as access to water transportation and storage assets. We have all those at Cedar Bayou, which connects us to the Houston Ship Channel.”

Looking ahead to replicating the Blue Tide model, Cecere says that land and logistics are paramount. “We are looking at where there are large volumes of high-quality UMO being burned, where there is a logistics network, and where there is demand for base oils. It is a low-risk model with attractive economics.”

Some of the attractive economics is due to the low cost of raw materials. The conventional market for UMO has been fuel for ships or power plants, which has high carbon emissions. “That is a terrible outcome for the environment,” says Cecere. “The marginal demand for UMO continues to be for BTU value, so the key for us is to create additional profit margin by detaching UMO from the energy market in favor of the value-added lubricants market, which has the added benefit of reducing carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.”

In addition to that demand pull, there is also a supply push making raw materials more available. “UMO is high in sulfur,” Cecere explains, “and as a result of the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 rules strictly limiting sulfur in marine fuels, demand for UMO and high-sulfur fuel oil has declined so there is excess supply.”",https://www.themiddlemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iStock-1334432110-1024x475.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 07:56:26.419642

Travel industry analysts reported on March 30, 2025, that BOC Aviation had significantly expanded its Boeing aircraft order book, placing a firm order for 50 Boeing 737-8 jets. The deal, announced from Seattle, was expected to ripple across the aviation and travel sectors, with far-reaching implications for airline networks, flight connectivity, and the future of sustainable air travel.

The purchase increased BOC Aviation’s Boeing backlog to 139 unfilled orders, marking the company’s largest commitment to Boeing aircraft to date. This strategic acquisition placed the Singapore-based lessor in a strong position to support international airlines with next-generation single-aisle jets as global passenger demand continues to rebound and surpass pre-pandemic levels.

Strengthening the Backbone of Global Tourism Recovery

With over 69 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft already in operation, leased to more than 15 airlines worldwide, BOC Aviation was seen as a pivotal enabler in the post-COVID aviation recovery, offering flexible leasing options to airlines that need to modernize their fleets swiftly to meet demand across both established and emerging travel corridors.

As travel rebounds in markets across Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East, airlines were reportedly in urgent need of aircraft that deliver higher fuel efficiency, longer range, and lower emissions—all features offered by the Boeing 737-8 model. The ability to cover short- and medium-haul routes more economically makes these aircraft attractive not only to major carriers but also to regional and low-cost airlines supporting tourism growth in secondary and underserved markets.

Air Travel Demand Soars Amid Fleet Modernization

Aviation experts have noted that single-aisle jets like the 737-8 are expected to account for 75% of global aircraft deliveries over the next two decades. The announcement from BOC Aviation validated this forecast and demonstrated how lessors are positioning themselves as crucial players in facilitating airline fleet expansion and sustainability transitions.

The new order was also part of a broader industry trend to retire aging Next-Generation 737s, which are less efficient and more expensive to operate. Boeing estimates that up to 300 such aircraft will retire annually by decade’s end, opening up major opportunities for replacements that align with sustainability goals.

BOC Aviation’s Strategic Move and Industry Confidence

Steven Townend, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of BOC Aviation, emphasized that the deal with Boeing reflected the company’s confidence in the aircraft type and its relevance to the future of air travel. He said that BOC Aviation now had commitments to over 140 Boeing 737-8s, underlining it as their largest Boeing orderbook in history.

Townend added that the agreement would allow BOC Aviation to continue equipping its partner airlines with technologically advanced aircraft, reinforcing their ability to scale operations, reduce carbon footprints, and offer affordable travel options to a global audience of flyers.

Tourism Industry Impact: What This Means for Global Travelers

From a tourism perspective, the expansion of BOC Aviation’s 737 MAX fleet could significantly influence airfares, flight frequency, and route availability—particularly in regions where tourism growth is fueling demand for reliable, lower-cost flights.

Increased availability of fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 737-8 will allow airlines to:

Launch or restore routes to mid-sized tourism destinations

Increase frequency on popular tourist routes (e.g., intra-Europe, intra-Asia, transcontinental U.S.)

Improve connectivity between secondary cities and major travel hubs

Offer lower fares due to savings on fuel and operational costs

This is expected to encourage tourists, digital nomads, students, and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travelers to explore new destinations, while also empowering national tourism boards and destination marketing organizations to promote air-linked travel packages more confidently.

Boeing’s Role in Fueling the Next Era of Global Travel

Commenting on the deal, Brad McMullen, Boeing’s Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales and Marketing, highlighted the significance of the 737-8 in the eyes of lessors and airlines. He stated that the aircraft’s versatility and fuel efficiency continue to drive its popularity among fleet planners seeking to meet the surging global travel demand.

The 737-8, which can accommodate 162 to 210 passengers depending on its configuration and fly up to 3,500 nautical miles (6,480 km), has become a preferred choice for operating profitable routes across diverse network structures, from regional tourism circuits to international short-haul services.

As a result, airlines worldwide—including those in tourism-heavy economies—are likely to use the 737-8 to enhance connectivity while aligning with environmental goals and improving traveler experience.

BOC Aviation’s Expanded Orderbook: A Strategic Global Asset

With this new order, BOC Aviation’s total portfolio of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft now reaches 215 units, positioning the company as a top-tier supplier for global airlines seeking leasing solutions amid rapid traffic recovery.

Industry insiders have observed that aircraft leasing companies like BOC Aviation are increasingly shaping travel accessibility. By reducing the capital investment barrier for airlines, lessors empower carriers in emerging markets to join the global stage, thus boosting regional air connectivity and opening new frontiers for tourism.

This development was also expected to benefit airport authorities, tour operators, hotel chains, and tourism-dependent economies, especially as newer aircraft enable nonstop point-to-point services between cities that previously required hub-based transfers.

Sustainable Travel and Aviation’s Green Future

The Boeing 737-8 was designed with lower emissions and fuel consumption in mind, offering a 14% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to its predecessors. For travel sector stakeholders, this translates into a cleaner, greener way to fly, appealing to the growing number of eco-conscious travelers and sustainability-focused airlines.

This aircraft is also equipped to support carbon-offset initiatives and future SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) integration, reinforcing the travel industry’s long-term environmental commitments while maintaining the economic feasibility of tourism-focused flights.

Seattle-Based Boeing Remains a Key Export Force for U.S. Aviation

This deal also reaffirmed Boeing’s strength as a top U.S. exporter and a global driver of aerospace innovation, with manufacturing and servicing operations impacting over 150 countries. From Seattle, Washington, the company continues to design next-generation aircraft while supporting supply chains and skilled labor across the U.S. and beyond.

Boeing’s expansive role in travel, tourism, and connectivity also enhances its reputation among tourism ministries and airline planners seeking resilient partnerships and fleet renewal options aligned with future-ready standards.

Global Connectivity Gains Momentum with Asia-Based Lessor’s Commitment

Given BOC Aviation’s headquarters in Singapore, the news also signaled the growing influence of Asian financial and aviation players in shaping the future of global travel. The Asia-Pacific region, long seen as the engine of air travel growth, is leading the charge in aviation investments, infrastructure expansion, and international leasing activity.

This makes BOC Aviation’s move a geostrategic signal, boosting the region’s role in fueling the global movement of travelers and reinforcing Singapore’s status as an aviation and leasing powerhouse.

Conclusion: An Acceleration of the Travel Industry’s Rebound

As the travel world embraces technological transformation, fuel efficiency, and operational resilience, the latest partnership between BOC Aviation and Boeing is expected to deliver far-reaching benefits for global tourism.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/airline-BOC-737_8_Boeing-seattle-USA1-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 07:56:29.433944

The achievements reflected in Friday's release resuled from through 2.58 million admissions and 2.15 million dismissals. Year-to-date, the job market saw a net increase of 576,081 positions, and over the past 12 months, there was a total gain of 1.78 million jobs.

Overall, South America's largest country recorded 47,780,769 active jobs in February, a 0.91% increase from the previous month.

Labor Minister Luiz Marinho claimed that February's figures stemmed from the federal government's policy of investment and reindustrialization of the country. “We stimulated a lot of investment, and this is the result,” he said. “We have a re-industrialization program, we are encouraging industry to prepare to produce health equipment instead of importing it. We're having a debate about the climate transition, encouraging investment; we want to produce SAF [Sustainable Aviation Fuel] in Brazil to replace polluting aircraft fuel,” he went on.

The biggest growth in formal employment last month was in the services sector, with the creation of 254,812 jobs, a variation of 1.1% compared to January. In industry, 69,884 jobs were created, a variation of 0.78%. In commerce, 46,587 jobs were created (0.44%); in construction, there were 40,871 jobs (1.41%); and in agriculture, there were 19,842 jobs or 1.08%.

The average salary was R$ 2,205.25 (US$ 382.83). Compared to the previous month, there was a R$ 79.41 drop in the average salary (-3.48 %).

Most jobs created in February were filled by women, who accounted for 229,163, while men held 202,832 positions. The age group with the highest balance was 18 to 24-year-olds, with 170,593 jobs. High school graduates accounted for 277,786 jobs.

In terms of salary range, jobs paying up to 1.5 minimum wages amounted to 312,790 jobs. In terms of race/color, brown people accounted for 269,129 jobs, while white people accounted for 189,245 jobs.

Except for Alagoas, all states had positive job creation results last month. In absolute terms, São Paulo generated the largest number of jobs, closing February with 137,581; followed by Minas Gerais, with 52,603 jobs, and Paraná, with 39,176 jobs.

On the opposite end, Alagoas lost 5,471 jobs, while Acre created only 429 new positions, with Paraíba slightly better at 525 new jobs.

Marinho noted, however, that the February figures were seasonally adjusted and that a drop in the number of jobs generated is expected for March. He also said he expected the policy of job creation to continue. “I hope the economy continues to heat up; after all, we still have a lot of people underemployed, unemployed,” he pointed out.

The minister once again criticized the increase in the Selic rate to 14.25% by the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) earlier this month. “What seems to me to be happening is that the transition of the Central Bank had contracts in place, and they are being fulfilled. It's not recommended to ride roughshod over the economy and, therefore, the processes are being respected,” he mentioned.

“I think what is needed in Brazil is a great pact of more production to contain inflation, and not the other way around. It also seems to me that, with the increase in interest rates, people aren't going to stop eating meat, eggs, rice, and beans. The debate is different: we need to produce more,” said Marinho.

The unemployment rate for the quarter ending in February was 6.8%. The result is 0.7 percentage points higher than in the previous quarter ending in November 2024 (6.1%). However, it is the lowest for a quarter ending in February since 2014, when it stood at 6.8%.

The labor market data is part of the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (Pnad Contínua), released Friday by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). According to survey coordinator Adriana Beringuy, the rise in unemployment compared to the previous quarter is a common trend at this time of year.

“It's an expected movement because in the transition period from the end of one year to the first months of the following year, there is, in fact, this downward movement in occupation,” she said.

The number of people out of work reached 7.5 million in the period, up 10.4% from the previous quarter. However, this figure is 12.5% lower than that recorded in the same quarter of 2024.

Of the ten activity groups surveyed by the IBGE, three showed a drop in the number of people employed: construction (-4.0%, or 310,000 fewer people), public administration, defense, social security, education, human health and social services (-2.5%, or 468,000 fewer people) and domestic services (-4.8%, or 290,000 fewer people).

According to Beringuy, the reduction in vacancies in the public administration group is also seasonal and has to do with the end of temporary workers' contracts.

The researcher also says that this seasonal behavior of the job market means that it is not possible to say that there are recessionary effects from the interest rate hike, a measure adopted by the Central Bank (BCB) to contain inflation.

“At the moment, I wouldn't attribute the effect of this variable to interest rates and the impact of household consumption on the labor market,” she argued.

In the quarter ending in January 2025, the rate stood at 6.5%, down from 6.8% in the period ending in February. However, the IBGE does not make the comparison between the immediately following intervals because there are months that are repeated in both periods (December and January), which distorts the comparison.

In the quarter ending in February, the country's employed population was 102.7 million people. This figure is 1.2% lower than in the period ending in November (1.2 million fewer people) but 2.4% higher than in the same period last year (2.4 million more people).

The IBGE survey also points out that the country reached a record high in the number of workers with a formal contract. There were 39.6 million contracts, the highest volume since the beginning of the historical series in 2012. In one year, there were 1.6 million more people (+4.1%) with a formal contract.

The IBGE study assesses the labor market behavior of people aged 14 and over and takes into account all forms of occupation, whether employment with or without a formal contract, temporary employment, or self-employment, for example.

The informality rate - workers who are not guaranteed rights such as vacations, Social Security contributions, and yearly bonuses fell “slightly” to 38.1% of the employed population, which represents 39.1 million informal workers. In both the quarter ending in November and the same period in 2024, the rate was 38.7%.

This is the 4th project in Europe to select FT CANS for SAF production.

This is the 6th project contributing to JM’s strategic milestone of 20 additional large-scale projects in Catalyst Technologies’ sustainable technologies portfolio by the end of the 2025/2026 financial year.

LONDON, March 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson Matthey (JM), a global leader in sustainable technologies, today announced that Willis Sustainable Fuels (WSF) has selected JM and bp’s award-winning Fischer Tropsch (FT) CANS™ technology for WSF’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in Teesside, Northeast England.

The project, which is expected to be operational in 2028, plans to be the first of its kind in the UK. The facility intends to use a biomethane feedstock, processed into syngas using JM’s proven reforming technology. This syngas will feed the JM/bp FT CANS technology to produce synthetic crude oil that can be upgraded and blended to SAF. Once operational, the WSF facility plans to produce 14 thousand tonnes of SAF blendstock per year.

Teesside is becoming an active location in the UK for SAF production, with Teesside International Airport’s own net zero strategy setting ambitions for it to use SAF to achieve net zero flights by 2035 and to be the UK’s first net zero airport[1].

WSF’s planned development was one of five Teesside-based projects to receive funding from round two of the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund[2] which enables the commercial deployment of fuel production technologies capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the UK aviation industry.

Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licensing at Johnson Matthey, said: “As a UK-headquartered company, we’re excited our technology has been selected to be part of this innovative UK project. With our FT CANS development and testing facilities located in Teesside, and projects like this in development, we see the North East as a leader in efforts to meet the UK SAF mandate. We look forward to working with Willis Sustainable Fuels to develop SAF in the region …and beyond!”

Amy Ruddock, Senior Vice President, Sustainable Aviation & Corporate Development at Willis Lease Finance Corporation, the parent company of WSF, said: “Partnering with Johnson Matthey and other industry leaders enables us to drive meaningful progress toward our vision of connecting the world through sustainable flight.”

“This pioneering project will demonstrate the potential of our Carbonshift pathway, which can leverage various sustainable feedstocks and be tailored to produce power-to-liquids—helping to shape the future of aviation fuels.”

The A350-1000 acquisition marks a pivotal moment in China Airlines’ fleet modernization strategy. These aircraft will enable the airline to enhance its premium long-haul services while significantly reducing operational costs and environmental impact.

With a range capability of up to 9,700 nautical miles (18,000 kilometers), the A350-1000 will allow China Airlines to operate ultra-long-haul routes more efficiently.

China Airlines Chairman Kao Shing-Hwang emphasized that this investment supports their international growth strategy while improving passenger experience.

The A350-1000’s superior range, fuel efficiency, and comfort capabilities will transform the airline’s long-haul operations, particularly on routes connecting Taipei (TPE) with major hubs in North America and Europe.

Operational Benefits and Environmental Advantages

The A350-1000 offers China Airlines significant operational advantages through commonality with their existing A350-900 fleet. This compatibility streamlines maintenance procedures, simplifies crew training, and provides greater flexibility in aircraft deployment across their network.

Powered by the latest generation Rolls-Royce engines, these aircraft will consume 25% less fuel than previous generation widebodies, with a corresponding reduction in carbon emissions. This aligns with China Airlines’ sustainability initiatives and industry-wide efforts to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint.

Strong Partnership

This order strengthens the long-standing partnership between China Airlines and Airbus. The Taiwanese carrier currently operates several Airbus models, including 15 A350-900s, 15 A321neo, and 16 A330s across its comprehensive network serving Asia, Europe, North America, and the Pacific region.

The A350 Family has secured more than 1,360 orders from 60 global customers, with over 640 aircraft already in service with 38 operators worldwide.

Like all Airbus aircraft, the A350-1000 can currently operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% SAF capability by 2030.

China Airlines Retrofitting A350s

China Airlines has committed to a complete overhaul of its Airbus A350 cabin interiors, signing an agreement with Airbus on December 9, 2023, to retrofit 15 A350 aircraft. The first upgraded aircraft will enter service in 2027, with the entire program scheduled for completion by 2028.

The Taiwanese carrier joins several leading Asia-Pacific airlines in upgrading cabin products to meet evolving passenger expectations. The retrofit will maintain China Airlines’ signature Oriental aesthetic while introducing modern luxury elements designed to create stronger emotional connections with travelers and reinforce brand identity.

All three cabin classes on the A350-900 fleet will receive upgrades, with improvements focusing on ergonomic seating designs and space efficiency. The renovation will also deliver enhanced in-flight entertainment systems featuring larger screens and improved connectivity options.

China Airlines currently configures its A350-900 aircraft with 32 business class seats, 31 premium economy seats, and 243 economy class seats. These wide-body jets primarily serve the carrier’s long-haul network to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and North America.

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels, as reported by Business Recorder.

The EU’s RefuelEU regulation stipulates that airlines operating within the single market must use at least 2% SAF by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050. However, airlines argue that there is insufficient SAF on the market, and producers are increasingly shifting back to fossil fuels.

The CEO also cited a Boston Consulting study that predicts a 30% shortfall in SAF by 2030 compared to what EU regulations will require.

Despite expressing a commitment to reducing emissions, Gallego stressed that the aviation business must remain ""affordable and accessible for everyone"". He lamented that SAF is not only scarce but also three to five times more expensive than kerosene.

In addition, European carriers warned that the region is falling behind due to stricter regulations than in other parts of the world, which have tripled operational costs since 2014.

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, urged the EU to grant more free emission rights to airlines under the Emission Trading System (ETS) and to avoid implementing green policies that inadvertently favor non-EU competitors.",https://www.mobilityplaza.org/media/cache/640/bundles/app/images/40848/67e70b6664292.png,N,,2025-03-31 05:56:21.900095

Despite widespread agreement on the need for net zero, few binding requirements compel individuals or organizations to act in support of climate goals.
As a result, achieving net zero globally must rely heavily on early movers — organizations that pursue net-zero outcomes voluntarily.
SBTi’s working groups should recommend that flexibility and iteration are core pillars of its forthcoming revision to the Corporate Net Zero Standard (see go.nature.com/428ukzq).
For example, SBTi’s Corporate Net Zero Standard requires a company’s decarbonization commitment to include a pledge to reduce their emissions by 90% or more before relying on carbon-removal technologies to counterbalance the remaining 10%.","Net zero. This simple accounting term represents humanity’s greatest challenge — and opportunity — to stabilize Earth’s climate. The goal, timeline and metric for success seem clear: by 2050, each tonne of carbon emitted must be matched by a tonne removed. But achieving this is easier said than done.

Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the world has built up more than 250 years of momentum in a carbon-emitting economic and technological paradigm. Now, under the terms of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, it has just 25 years — or a few business cycles — to replace the carbon-dependent parts with net-zero components.

Will AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions?

The journey requires unprecedented coordination, innovation, investment and speed to avoid the catastrophic consequences of failure — including increasingly severe natural disasters, from rapidly rising sea levels and floods to heatwaves and wildfires. We, the authors, understand the potential and pitfalls, having spent more than 20 years between us developing the strategies, programmes, products and policies that achieving net zero demands.

We have deployed and influenced more than US$1 billion in investments and purchases related to carbon reduction and removal, and have been on the front lines of driving large-scale voluntary decarbonization in the corporate sector. Previously, we served as principal architects of Microsoft’s carbon-negative commitment. Now, one of us (E.W.) is a net-zero strategy consultant, and the other (L.J.) is a private-equity executive working to deliver a net-zero investment portfolio.

Although we have a deep conviction that net zero can work, we know it has issues. A premature desire for perfection, overly precise guidelines for implementation, insufficient flexibility in carbon accounting, unhelpful constraints on collaboration and a disproportionate focus on the actions of others all combine to slow down the net-zero transformation just when it needs to speed up. Here, we describe the barriers and suggest ways to overcome them.

Obstacles to market growth

For net zero to work, the world must design markets in which every product or service, everywhere, prices in the cost of removing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or replacing them with an alternative that emits little or no carbon. Regulation will play a crucial part. But adoption at scale will happen only when removals and low-carbon alternatives are cheaper in price, superior in performance, or both, relative to higher carbon incumbents.

Reduction and removal technologies are still in their infancy. Sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen and steel, low-carbon concrete and technologies that capture CO2 from the air are expected to be part of a future net-zero economy. But today, they are too scarce and expensive to enable stakeholders to build anything more than theoretical plans around them.

Long-term cost-efficiencies and supply will emerge only through large investments in a host of approaches, allowing the markets to determine winners and losers. This was a clear lesson from decades of advances in solar and wind energy, which ultimately saw the costs of these renewables plummet by more than 70%.

How car and battery companies can work around US trade tariffs and rules

To meet net-zero goals, global investments in the clean-energy and carbon-removal sectors, and their supporting infrastructure, must exceed $4 trillion annually by 20301. But we are concerned that current carbon-market expectations are inadvertently making it harder — not easier — to deploy the climate capital needed to build robust carbon markets.

Despite widespread agreement on the need for net zero, few binding requirements compel individuals or organizations to act in support of climate goals. This creates a carbon catch-22: governments are hesitant to impose regulations without clear price signals from markets, while markets struggle to deliver price clarity without regulatory guidance.

As a result, achieving net zero globally must rely heavily on early movers — organizations that pursue net-zero outcomes voluntarily. But, so far, there are too few of these, and they aren’t moving quickly enough. In part, that is because the net-zero landscape is dominated by prescriptive rules that are difficult to implement, often creating confusion instead of clarity.

These roadblocks must be removed. Here we identify six remedies.

Pursue progress over perfection

Organizations need flexibility if they are going to commit to innovation. For example, in the early days of renewable energy, corporate buyers purchased renewable energy credits to meet their 100% renewable electricity goals that would not meet quality standards today. But they got the ball rolling: buyers invested, learnt and iterated. Procurement of ‘unbundled’ renewable-energy certificates was replaced by more sophisticated ways of buying and selling energy, such as through contracts to match hourly energy consumption.

Similarly, today’s corporate leaders are advancing energy projects on a voluntary basis, from nuclear to geothermal. Their energy prices are high now, but will come down if buyers and suppliers are given room to improve the technologies. In other words, setting an ambitious but achievable goal and sticking with it, while continuously improving its execution, should be a core principle for reaching net zero.

Yet, rigid and complex standards introduced too soon are discouraging companies from innovating. For example, last year, the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) removed nearly 240 companies — representing more than $4 trillion in market capitalization — from its Corporate Net Zero Standard, because of their inability to meet its stringent criteria2. This highly publicized action led to frustration from the affected companies, some of which stated they were unaware that the deadline for meeting these criteria was approaching.

Delisting or penalizing companies for ‘missing’ arbitrary net-zero milestones should be avoided. SBTi’s working groups should recommend that flexibility and iteration are core pillars of its forthcoming revision to the Corporate Net Zero Standard (see go.nature.com/428ukzq).

Prioritize direct over indirect emissions

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership between businesses, governments and other organizations that has set global standards for measuring emissions, has established three ‘scopes’ for voluntary reporting of emissions by corporations. Scope 1 includes an organization’s direct emissions (such as those from a steel producer’s coal-powered kiln). Scope 2 reflects those associated with consuming electricity, as well as heating and cooling. Scope 3 emissions represent all those embodied in an organization’s supply chain and product-delivery networks. Thus, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions help companies to understand the wider carbon implications of their operations. But, if every company reduced their Scope 1 emissions to zero, then every other company’s Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions would also disappear.

For most companies, Scope 3 captures most of their emissions. Accounting for these has helped to drive a cascade of decarbonization commitments, such as identifying, addressing or replacing high-carbon producers. That is good.

Why we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change

But a disproportionate focus on reporting Scope 3 emissions — including by the SBTi, the CDP (an international non-profit organization dedicated to collecting information on corporate sustainability efforts) and jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union — has arguably distracted many companies from doing the hard work at home. In 2022, only 7% of consumer companies were on track to meet their targets for value-chain decarbonization, and only 18% were on track with their direct-emissions targets (see go.nature.com/43ystkc). Companies could make more progress on Scope 1 if they were able to simplify and focus their attention.

First, requiring companies to commit to reductions they have little or no control over, and then penalizing them for failing to make progress, discourages them from engaging. Indeed, in a 2024 survey by the SBTi, Scope 3 difficulties were the biggest complaint from companies working on climate issues, mentioned by 54% of firms2.

Second, a focus on Scope 3 introduces extreme uncertainty into reporting of carbon emissions. The most common way to derive Scope 3 emissions is to multiply how much is spent on certain broad categories, such as ‘marketing’, by a numerical factor approximating national or global emissions for that activity. This simplistic approach misses both the accuracy and precision that reporting bodies desire.

And third, Scope 3 emissions can potentially divert focus away from Scope 1 and 2 emissions for a reason of efficiency: if most of an organization’s emissions are indirect, why focus first on the minority that are direct?

The fix is simple. SBTi, CDP, regulators and other parties should create a tiered system that prioritizes target setting and reporting for Scope 1 and 2 over that for Scope 3. Companies should be making progress on decarbonizing their Scope 1 and 2 emissions before they are expected to tackle the more difficult Scope 3.

Focus on demand over delivery

Corporate demand has had an outsized role in developing renewable-energy markets. Starting in the 2010s, companies were motivated to make purchases because they received credit for doing so under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. But the protocol’s accounting practices contain an inconsistency. Under its ‘location-based’ and ‘market-based’ accounting rules, companies can get credit for Scope 2 carbon reductions from the electricity they consume by purchasing renewable energy that is never physically delivered to them. But there is no mechanism to do that for Scope 1 or 3.

The protocol now needs to be expanded to allow for such claims across all emissions classes. It is more important that solutions are contracted and paid for than specifying where and to whom they are delivered. For instance, being able to track the delivery of sustainable aviation fuel to a buyer in a specific seat on a particular aeroplane is less important than ensuring that an equivalent amount of fuel was delivered into the broader aviation network.

Allowing companies to claim credit for these purchases would incentivize them to invest. To build trust, descriptions of the projects funded or financed can help others to assess the value of any company’s carbon reduction and removal purchases.

Allow flexibility between emissions reduction and removal

As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has emphasized, limiting the worst harms of global warming requires both reduction of emissions and large-scale carbon removal. In the context of global net zero, how much reduction is needed versus how much removal is an open question, and well-intentioned but premature mandates hold back innovation.

For example, SBTi’s Corporate Net Zero Standard requires a company’s decarbonization commitment to include a pledge to reduce their emissions by 90% or more before relying on carbon-removal technologies to counterbalance the remaining 10%. This requirement is too strict, and too early.

By analogy, in the renewable-energy sector, early markets were unconstrained by requirements for specific amounts of solar, wind or hydropower. Instead, technologies competed, and winners emerged for different uses in different places. A market-driven approach allowed the most effective solutions to materialize naturally over time.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00935-1/d41586-025-00935-1_50793110.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 05:56:27.245088

The technological breakthroughs represent Airbus’s comprehensive approach to addressing aviation’s environmental challenges while maintaining its position as an industry leader in aerospace innovation.

Contribution to EU defence

Airbus executives revealed ongoing discussions about extending commercial aircraft decarbonization measures to military products while acknowledging that environmental concerns aren’t the defense industry’s top priority.

The European Union’s ambitious €800 billion defense capacity plan emerged as a major talking point at the Airbus summit, with the aerospace giant poised to be a primary contributor through its comprehensive military portfolio. This will include transport aircraft, refueling capabilities, intelligence aircraft, fighter jets, military helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, and air defense systems.

Airbus Türkiye Partnership

Airbus has maintained a significant partnership with Türkiye for almost four decades, collaborating with both commercial and military entities.

The relationship began when Turkish Airlines started flying Airbus A310 aircraft in 1985, followed by the Turkish Air Force’s acquisition of the CN235 in 1991. Throughout this period, Airbus has served as a key solution provider for various Turkish organizations.

Looking ahead, Airbus plans to intensify its focus on military production and increase procurement from its supply chain partners, with Turkey identified as a key sourcing priority.

Sustainable Aviation Initiatives

While enhancing its military production focus, Airbus continues efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. The company invests in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve zero carbon emissions. SAF currently represents only 2 percent of aviation fuel usage due to its cost—three to four times higher than conventional jet fuel. Airbus plans to increase this to 10 percent by 2030.

Julie Kitcher, Airbus’s chief sustainability and communications officer, emphasized Türkiye’s potential in this area. “Türkiye can play a leading role in the sustainable fuel industry,” she said, noting that next-generation aircraft could eventually operate entirely on SAF.

The summit also explored hydrogen fuel technology as a petroleum alternative, along with innovations in propulsion systems, foldable wings, open fan engines, and materials technologies designed to improve fuel efficiency in future aircraft.

Airbus Strengthens Collaboration with India

Airbus has also significantly strengthened its partnership with India in recent years, recognizing the country’s growing aerospace capabilities. The collaboration focuses on manufacturing, engineering services, and innovation.

Airbus established a final assembly line for C295 military transport aircraft in Gujarat, marking the first time a private sector company will manufacture a full military aircraft in India.

Subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025.

The agreement follows a competitive M&A process that began after CPH announced a strategic review of its assets in late 2023. VARO has been engaged in this process for over 15 months, having entered exclusivity in August 2024. As part of this process and in accordance with its rights under existing security arrangements, Deutsche Bank (Suisse) SA, as pledgee of the CPH shares, executed the sale agreement on behalf of CPH’s parent company, Moroncha Holdings Co. Ltd.

Preem is one of the largest energy companies in Scandinavia. The company plays a critical role in the region’s energy security, providing over 40% of Sweden’s and around a quarter of Scandinavia’s energy needs for transportation. It serves customers in 17 countries across Europe.

An early mover in renewable fuel production, Preem has invested nearly US$1 billion since 2010 in the production of renewable fuels and initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon intensity throughout the value chain. As a result of these investments, Preem’s current renewable fuel production of 0.3 mtpa will rise to 1.3 mtpa with the Synsat diesel plant upgrade enabling up to 40% co-processing of renewable feedstocks. The company also has a material pipeline of other renewable fuel projects.

Preem owns two major fuel manufacturing facilities in Sweden, at Lysekil and Gothenburg. The two facilities have a combined capacity of 352,000 barrels per day, which equates to 80% of Sweden’s refining capacity, and the ability to co-process renewable feedstock. Primarily located in Scandinavia, Preem’s assets are highly complementary to VARO’s existing operations across northwest Europe with limited overlap.

Dev Sanyal, CEO of VARO, said: “The acquisition of Preem is transformational for VARO. On completion, we will become Europe’s second largest renewable fuel producer with an extensive distribution and storage network across major European markets with conventional fuel production capacity of 530,000 barrels per day. Combined we will serve over 50,000 business customers across 33 countries, with our future growth underpinned by a robust portfolio of mature renewable fuel projects.”

Marcel van Poecke, Chairman of VARO and Chairman of Energy at Carlyle, said: “This acquisition provides material value creation opportunities through disciplined investment in future growth projects, while enhancing VARO’s ability to deliver the reliable and secure energy that Europe needs. The combined entity will be well positioned to continue to play an important role in meeting Europe’s growing demand for sustainable energy for the mobility and industrial sectors.”

Russell Hardy, Supervisory Board member of VARO and CEO, Vitol, said: “We are very excited by this transaction. The company will be Europe’s second largest producer of biofuels – which are key to decarbonising transport in Europe. It will benefit from access to Vitol’s network and global expertise. We greatly look forward to expanding this ongoing and successful partnership and working with the combined entity to meet customer requirements and supply evolving markets.”

Creating a leading energy provider for mobility and industrial customers

The combined group will have a large geographic footprint across key European markets, with global feedstock sourcing capabilities and an expanded customer base. Benefiting from Preem’s manufacturing facilities and VARO’s Cressier and Bayernoil assets, our fuel manufacturing capacity will increase to 530 kbd. It will serve over 50,000 business customers in Europe and account for almost 10% of all road and marine fuels sold on the continent, with Sweden becoming its largest manufacturing base. The company will operate one of Europe’s largest supply networks in Europe with access to over 120 terminals.

The company will be the largest co-processor of renewable feedstocks in Europe. On completion, the combined group will rank in the top five largest producers of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) globally. It will be Europe’s second largest renewable fuel producer and the top producer in Sweden.

Material renewable fuel production will provide the company with a strong position in the fast-growing biofuels for transport sector. Biofuel demand in the EU transport sector is expected to increase by 50-80% by 2030 as Member States accelerate decarbonization efforts.

With more than a decade of experience developing renewable fuel assets, Preem brings valuable expertise in applying proven technology at scale. When combined with cash flow growth, increased liquidity and a strong balance sheet, the combined group will have an enhanced capacity to invest in and develop its renewable fuel asset portfolio. In addition, material value upsides from combining the two businesses have been identified. These include leveraging the combined companies’ physical assets with VARO’s extensive value chain optimisation, risk and exposure management capabilities to deliver higher margins, improved crude mix and renewable feedstock optimisation.

Post completion the intention is to focus on three investment priorities. First, investing in improved security of supply and asset resilience, across manufacturing, distribution and storage. Second, decarbonizing and increasing the efficiency of conventional manufacturing assets. Third, investing in the attractive portfolio of biofuel projects of both companies, with a customer-centric approach designed to keep pace with evolving demand for sustainable energy.

Delivering on VARO’s 2022 strategy

In 2022 VARO set out an ambitious set of strategic targets to triple EBITDA by 2026 with 50% coming from sustainable energies. Over the last three years VARO has made good progress towards achieving these goals, notably the acquisition and expansion of the biogas facility in Coevorden and progressing the development of a SAF facility in Rotterdam. The combined company will be well positioned to achieve these financial targets.

Both VARO and Preem share a strong commitment to ambitious targets for decarbonizing their operations and reducing the carbon intensity of the solutions they deliver to customers. Following completion of the transaction, VARO will leverage the decarbonization expertise and proven track record of both organizations to support national and European energy transition agendas and drive progress toward a low-carbon future. They have collectively achieved a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions from their own operations and abated 5.5 million tons per year of CO2 for their customers since tracking began.

Investing for the long-term

Since it was founded in 2012, VARO has made close to 20 acquisitions and has built a strong track record of investing in and integrating the companies that it acquires. Privately held and backed by long-term strategic and financial investors, VARO plays an important role in supporting energy security and decarbonization in the markets in which it currently operates.

With strong medium-term cash flow generation and a long-term holder of assets, VARO will ensure responsible stewardship of Preem. We will continue to be a partner in Sweden and the wider region’s security and energy transition priorities.

The national campaign aims to support customers for whom cost is a barrier to transitioning to low carbon fuel, while also strengthening their fuel security and offering more buying options for their specific needs.

According to a recent customer survey conducted by Certas Energy four in ten businesses state that sustainability is ‘less important than keeping costs down’.

Certas Energy aims to ease the transition to renewable fuel HVO, by offering a complete tank leasing solution, eliminating the need for upfront purchase.

Every steel tank comes as standard with FuelWise Telemetry, servicing, and enhanced security features. Real-time reporting, robust design, fuel alerts, and restricted access minimise theft, making this one of the most comprehensive HVO storage leasing solutions available today.

Consumption of HVO in the UK almost reached 700 million litres in 2024, and Certas Energy expects the growth in demand to continue rising for the rest of this decade.

Darren Holloway, commercial director for Energy Solutions at Certas Energy, said: “Our ‘Tanks for Hire’ offering is all about putting our customers in control of their fuel management, addressing the high upfront costs associated with buying a tank while making the whole process more convenient. Businesses have told us what they’re looking for and we’ve developed precisely that - this is fuel management on customer terms.

“This is a great option for the growing number of companies, particularly in haulage, logistics and construction sectors across the UK, that are looking to commit to a wider scale trial or roll-out of HVO. Being able to hire our tanks has made the switch to renewable HVO more attainable and simpler than ever before.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/New-tank-hier-initiative-pic-Biofuel-31-1-768x551.png,N,,2025-03-31 01:56:08.434195

By Scott Hamilton

March 31, 2025, © Leeham News: Airbus last week announced a program to boost Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) called Book and Claim. Its purpose is to buy SAF credits in one location and take credit for them in another.

The buyer can then claim in its corporate reports that it is meeting environmental goals, at least in part.

“This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption,” Airbus said at its annual environmental Aviation Summit.

“In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to 'book' a certain amount of SAF and ‘claim’ the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot program running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points,” the company said.

It's an admirable effort for an industry that has so far fallen dramatically short of the SAF goals outlined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at its 2021 Annual General Meeting in Boston (MA).

However, LNA is skeptical about the effort. Carbon credits, which appear to be a variation, failed when airlines tried them. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby called carbon offsets a “fig leaf” and “mostly a fraud.”

In land use regulations, Book and Claim sounds suspiciously like wetland mitigation programs. This is where a wetland is filled in for development and a new one may be created miles away, offsetting the environmental damage in the original location. At least this is the theory, and it’s essentially pencil-whipping. Nature doesn’t work this way for wetlands. LNA isn’t convinced it works this way for carbon, either.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LHC-SAF.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 01:56:12.302635

The astonishment was as searing as a jet engine exhaust heat when it was announced that Doncaster Sheffield Airport was to close in 2022.

As new operators and financial packages are now announced and the Chancellor of the Exchequer herself namechecks its importance alongside Heathrow Airport, one question stands above others - can it work?

The ambition now is to have planes using the former RAF Finningley site, to be known as South Yorkshire Airport City, by April 2026.

Wholly-owned council company FlyDoncaster Ltd will operate the airport with Munich Airport International (MAI) hired to provide operational and management services.

Prior to closure, Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA) was run by Peel Airports, part of the Peel Group - which has £5bn worth of assets under management. So if it couldn’t make DSA work why should anyone else?

Dan Fell, chief executive of the city’s Chamber of Commerce, says: “Peel is an outstanding land and property company. There isn’t an easy path through to a million passengers, to profitability. The airport is a complex organisation in a complex sector in a challenging economy but there is definitely a pathway to it.

“When the local authority went out to market to find an operating partner, 35 organisations around the world threw their hat in the ring for it. That speaks volumes. I am delighted they picked Munich Airport and that is a key part of why it will work. They will hopefully bring carriers with them, though I can’t name names unfortunately, but we can all see who flies in and out of Munich. They have relationships.”

City of Doncaster Council says the airport could be profitable within five years of reopening and SYMCA’s business case states that the project will generate £6.6 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) to the local economy and 5,000 direct jobs.

Peter Kennan, who sits on the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce’s transport forum, says: “I don’t think the airport will be profitable for some time, although most regional airports aren’t profitable. It doesn’t bother me that the airport loses some money. Someone would have to underwrite losses but tell me about the business rates income that comes from all this investment in due course, tell me about income tax, national insurance, VAT receipts from all this possible investment and then the jobs, skills and opportunities. It is about the wider, economic and social benefits of a region that has had so many hard shocks and bad news. How else are we going to regenerate without using our key strategic asset which is the airport?”

Peel Airports still owns a 47 per cent stake in Liverpool John Lennon Airport though it did sell its majority stake in Durham Tees Valley Airport to the Tees Valley Combined Authority in 2018.

Teesside International Airport, as it now is, has seen revenue double since 2019-2020 and balance sheet assets increased from £33m to £83m, although it did report a £3.3m EBITDA loss most recently.

Its managing director Phil Forster was also head of external affairs at Leeds Bradford Airport until April 2019. On any acceptance of trading losses he says: “That would really alarm me. If you took the view that you didn’t need to make money, you are still playing with public numbers and you are going to be scrutinised for every single penny and rightly so. I’d want to be looking at getting the place back in the black.”

DSA has permissions to take 24-hour flying, which is important in cargo. Kennan argues that the airport needs to be viewed in the context of the South Yorkshire Investment Zone in advanced manufacturing. Hybrid Air Vehicles is preparing to start work on its flagship production facility for Airlander 10 airships at Carcroft Common. Peel itself has room for 3.5m sq ft of industrial space at its adjacent Gateway East development.

Kennan says: “The University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is doing work on sustainable aviation fuel and the lightweighting of aircraft in alloys and metals too. So there is a great opportunity to grow a green aviation cluster.

“And then think Vertiport and all the uses to which drones can be used and how we can regulate them in an environment which is safe. Having regulated airspace around an airport means that we can use Doncaster Sheffield Airport for drone applications. There are many opportunities too as aviation grows around the world for maintenance and repair of aircraft.”

Teesside’s Forster says that DSA’s operators need to look at diversifying revenue streams this time around. “Small regional airports can’t look to operate and survive just with passenger flights because the dynamics just don’t work.They need to go after cargo, real estate and maintenance, repair and overhaul - all the non-passenger aeronautical opportunities.”

In January, a government report said that FlyDoncaster would be set up with £105.2m of low-interest loans from the council with £60.6m covering start-up and other costs, while a further £44.6m would plug a shortfall caused by the deferral of rent.

Council auditors Grant Thornton have expressed “a major concern” about the use of public money advanced from the South Yorkshire Gainshare devolution funding.

South Yorkshire mayor Oliver Coppard has postponed a decision on handing over the Gainshare funding until summer to seek independent advice on the financial risks.

Fell says: “We should be able to get the money released to Doncaster to do all of the things it needs to. If SYMCA delays any longer and we miss the window for 2026 and it becomes 2027 or 2028 then confidence could ebb from the project. Pace is important. I understand that, in a world of austerity and other asks such as bus franchising and trams, that it is a lot of money but I think that now is a time for political bravery.”

Fell says there is widespread public support for the reopening, with 130,000 signing a petition.

“I have never known such an outpouring of community support for a project like this. I would say 95 per cent plus of the businesses I have spoken to in the last two years absolutely support it.”

The oil industry and biofuel producers have long competed for a share of the multibillion-dollar US gasoline market, frequently clashing over the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) — a federal programme requiring billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels to be blended into the nation’s fuel supply, Reuters added.

Following the White House directive, at least two meetings have taken place, including one last week hosted by the American Petroleum Institute (API).

Participants, including API’s vice president of downstream policy, Will Hupman, discussed key issues such as future biofuel blending mandates, exemptions for small refineries, and biofuel tax policies.

Any agreement between the two industries could influence the Trump administration’s approach to biofuels policy moving forward.

The range discussed was between 4.75 billion and 5.5 billion gallons, with some wanting higher volumes in 2026 and others pushing for a more gradual rise, the three sources said.

Blending mandates for ethanol, meanwhile, have capped out at 15 billion gallons, and the parties saw little growth prospect due to plateauing demand for gasoline, the sources said.

The groups were also split over small refinery exemptions to the RFS, one of the most controversial and divisive issues, the sources said.

In Trump's first administration, the EPA approved a record number of such exemptions, letting small refiners sidestep their blending obligations, and triggering political backlash from his Republican allies in the Farm Belt who said it punished farmers.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump-whotehouse-pic-Biofuel-31-3-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 01:56:57.061785

EA shareholders supported this move as they were asked to approve a new business restructuring plan, aimed at generating cash by selling biofuels and renewable power.

EA produces 278 megawatts from solar farms and 566MW from wind farms.

The company will continue to increase electricity generation capacity by developing two waste-to-energy power plants, each with a capacity of 8MW, in Pathum Thani and Phuket, and is preparing to join the new state auction for solar and wind farms with a combined capacity of almost 800MW, said chief financial officer Vasu Klomkliang.

EA also wants to supply renewable power to data centre operators in Thailand that require clean energy.

In the biofuel business, EA is in talks with aviation companies interested in buying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in line with global campaigns to reduce the carbon footprint of the industry.

SAF, a biofuel for aircraft, produces up to 80% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel, according to media reports citing various forecasts.

Mr Vasu did not elaborate on the talks, saying only that EA's SAF factory, with annual production of 100,000 litres, is scheduled to start commercial operations in the second quarter this year.

The company is conducting a business restructuring plan for its EV sales, which are waning as the domestic auto market slumps. The adjustment will pave the way for the company to achieve long-term growth, he said.

EA needs to forge partnerships with global EV companies to be more competitive and enter new overseas markets, said Mr Vasu.

The company is setting up a joint venture with Chengli Special Automobile Co, a manufacturer of EVs for special purposes, including ambulances, garbage trucks and telescopic boom lifts.

EA's EV assembly plant in Chachoengsao can produce between 3,000 and 9,000 vehicles a year, depending on the type of vehicle.

As Australia is one of the largest gas producers in the world, the prospect of building liquid natural gas (LNG) import terminals seems hard to swallow. But LNG import terminals are being considered by government as a means of avoiding oncoming gas shortfalls, particularly in Australia’s southern states.

“The fact is, international gas prices are far higher than domestically produced gas, even when global prices fall in the northern hemisphere’s summer months,” APA group executive, strategy and corporate development Beth Griggs said.

“The Future Gas Strategy estimated the cost of production and delivery of domestic gas to Melbourne from Surat, Narrabri and Beetaloo to be around $9 to $13 per gigajoule.

“This compares to an Asian LNG spot price of between $17.81 and $21.58 per gigajoule over the 2024 winter and summer.

“This is clearly not a viable solution for a strong Australian economy.”

Griggs said the key to a low cost and sustainable energy system lies in the right regulatory framework to unlock domestic gas supply.

“There are estimated to be over 31,000 petajoules in Queensland’s Surat and Bowen basins, and the Northern Territory Government estimates that there are over 200,000 petajoules of gas in place in the Beetaloo,” she said.

“To put into perspective just how much gas this is, Victoria, which is one of the largest gas users on the east coast, used 181 petajoules of gas in 2024.”

But policy is only one piece of the puzzle. To bolster domestic gas supply, Australia will need to expand the capacity of its gas pipeline networks.

“Governments need confidence that the market will invest to deliver gas where and when it is needed,” Griggs said.

“On 24 February 2025, APA announced a five-year East Coast Gas Grid Expansion Plan which will help to deliver gas from the north of Australia to meet southern market demand. Two elements of the plan have reached Final Investment Decision (FID) and will deliver new capacity in 2025 and 2026.

“If the full plan progresses to FID with support from customers, the resulting investment will deliver a ~24 per cent increase in north-to-south gas transport capacity and new southern markets gas storage.

“This will provide Australian households and industry with the reliable and affordable energy they need and fuel the gas-powered generation capacity that will underpin our energy transition.”",https://www.energytodaymag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_711782220-Large-e1742168594428.jpeg,N,,2025-03-30 22:56:31.634714

The acceleration in global energy demand growth in 2024 was led by the power sector, with global electricity consumption surging by nearly 1100TWh, or 4.3 per cent.
The expanding supply of low-emissions sources covered most of the increase in global electricity demand in 2024.
Global coal demand rose by one per cent in 2024, half the rate of increase seen the previous year.","A new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) has found that the rapid growth of electricity worldwide in 2024 led to increased natural gas demand.

While natural gas saw the strongest increase in demand among fossil fuels, the faster-than-average growth in global energy demand in 2024 drove up consumption of renewables, gas, coal and nuclear – with increased supply of renewables and natural gas covering the majority of additional energy needs.

Based on the most recent data, the latest edition of the IEA’s Global Energy Review covers energy demand, supply, the uptake of new energy technologies and energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

The report found that global energy demand rose by 2.2 per cent in 2024 – lower than GDP growth of 3.2 per cent but considerably faster than the average annual demand increase of 1.3 per cent between 2013 and 2023.

The acceleration in global energy demand growth in 2024 was led by the power sector, with global electricity consumption surging by nearly 1100TWh, or 4.3 per cent.

This was nearly double the annual average over the past decade.

The report found that the sharp increase in the world’s electricity use in 2024 was driven by record global temperatures, which boosted demand for cooling in many countries, as well as by rising consumption from industry, the electrification of transport and the growth of data centres and artificial intelligence.

The expanding supply of low-emissions sources covered most of the increase in global electricity demand in 2024.

The supply of natural gas-fired generation also increased steadily to cover rising electricity demand.

The amount of new renewable power capacity installed worldwide rose to around 700GW, setting a new annual record for the 22nd consecutive year.

Nuclear power capacity additions reached their fifth highest level in the past three decades. As a result, 80 per cent of the increase in global electricity generation in 2024 was provided by renewable sources and nuclear, which together contributed 40 per cent of total generation for the first time.

According to the report, natural gas saw the strongest increase in demand among fossil fuels in 2024 as a result of higher power consumption.

Gas demand rose by 115 billion cubic metres (bcm), or 2.7 per cent, compared with an average of around 75bcm annually over the past decade.

Meanwhile, oil demand grew more slowly, rising by 0.8 per cent in 2024. Oil’s share of total energy demand fell below 30 per cent for the first time ever, 50 years after it peaked at 46 per cent.

Sales of electric cars rose by more than 25 per cent in 2024, with electric models accounting for one in five cars sold globally. The report found this contributed considerably to the decline in oil demand for road transport, which offset a significant proportion of the rise in oil consumption for aviation and petrochemicals.

Global coal demand rose by one per cent in 2024, half the rate of increase seen the previous year. According to the report, intense heatwaves in China and India – which pushed up cooling needs – contributed more than 90 per cent of the total annual increase in coal consumption globally, highlighting the major impacts extreme weather can have on energy demand patterns.",https://www.energytodaymag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_769679836.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 01:57:06.190849

The initiative marks a significant step in the airline’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions and promote greener air travel in Australia.

SAF, derived from renewable sources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food crops, is seen as a critical component in the aviation sector’s strategy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Under the agreement, Viva will supply Virgin Australia with a blend of Jet A1 fuel and a 30-40 per cent synthetic component made from waste and residue feedstocks.

According to Viva, this blend meets all regulatory and safety requirements and is compatible with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure.

Virgin Australia chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer, Christian Bennett, emphasised the importance of SAF in the airline’s sustainability journey.

“SAF represents the critical long-term opportunity in commercial aviation’s pursuit of its 2050 net zero emissions ambition,” he said.

“Partnership, focused policy development, and collaborations such as this with Viva Energy will be essential if we are to adopt successfully SAF’s broader use in Australia over the years and decades ahead.

“Ensuring SAF is affordable and accessible will be key to achieving lowest cost carbon abatement at the same time as maintaining the essential role of aviation in connecting Australian communities.”

Viva Energy’s general manager for aviation, Nick Adams, highlighted the agreement as a step toward building a sustainable SAF supply chain for regional Australia.

“It is clear that SAF is going to play a bigger role for commercial airlines in this country as they move towards a more sustainable future,” he said.

“Through this collaboration – and drawing on the strengths of Viva Energy’s national distribution network and experience supplying high-quality fuels and aviation operations – we will be working with Virgin Australia to establish the supply chains that will be critical to the future of the aviation industry. Viva Energy is also delighted to be helping a key partner like Virgin Australia in its sustainability journey.”

The introduction of SAF at Whitsunday Coast Airport has been welcomed by Whitsunday Regional Council Mayor Ry Collins who described the initiative as a “perfect fit” for the region’s commitment to sustainable tourism.

Put simply, a biofuel is a fuel option produced from biomass, or any living matter.
Unlike the slow burn of fossil fuels such as diesel, biofuel is able to be produced quickly from the likes of plant, algal or animal biomass.
“Cost is still a barrier for entry for many operators,” a Volvo Trucks Australia spokesperson told OwnerDriver.
Right now though, biofuels offer a lower total carbon impact than existing diesel fuels, as they are created using a less carbon intensive production process.","Right now, the global transport industry is at loggerheads about the best ‘green’ power source for the heavy vehicle of the future.

Should an electric battery power a load, or should hydrogen fuel-cell technology be the weapon of choice? Is a hybrid truck the best way to begin the transition, or is simply focusing on Euro 6 diesel technology a feasible starting point?

While these four options tend to be the dominant pillars of the debate, a choice lesser considered, nor mentioned, has steadily grown behind the scenes, riding on the coat tails of the latest electric releases. That option is biofuel.

While biofuels are not the preferred power source for many in the global transport industry, they certainly have their followers. Globally, major manufacturers have steadily unveiled new models that can take a range of bio-friendly fuel. But what is biofuel, and is it an option for Australian trucking manufacturers?

Put simply, a biofuel is a fuel option produced from biomass, or any living matter. Unlike the slow burn of fossil fuels such as diesel, biofuel is able to be produced quickly from the likes of plant, algal or animal biomass. Additional to its speedy production timeframe, biofuel is also cost-effective and more sustainable, with the use of vegetable oils and animal fats being easier to source in the long term than the raw ingredients of petrol-based fuels.

It’s these benefits that are slowly starting to see biofuels and other Low Carbon Liquid Fuels (LCLFs) come into the fray in the Australian trucking sector.

The Truck Industry Council’s (TIC) latest National Truck Plan discusses a range of options for refreshing the nation’s truck fleet in order to bring it in line with global truck age averages and, in turn, help hit zero-emissions targets.

To help reach sustainability targets, TIC calls for the expansion of the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include LCLFs which would allow the industry to run existing trucks on cleaner fuels that cause less damage to the environment during their production

“The federal government should implement blending mandates for biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to be introduced concurrently on all three LCLFs and at a point in the fuel supply chain no later than the fuel wholesaler,” the plan says.

“The federal government should also introduce measures that will achieve cost effective, high quality and consistent LCLF/ mineral diesel blends to support blend mandates by means of a volume blending system similar to that deployed in Europe.”

OwnerDriver has chatted to Australia’s major OEMs to find out what they think of biofuels in their truck models and whether they’ve made any moves to implement the potential power source in their fleets.

At Penske Australia and New Zealand, producing trucks locally that are biodiesel-ready has been a core part of its program for decades. Since 2004, MAN models have been able to take biodiesel, while Western Star trucks have had the same ability since 2007. Penske Australia and New Zealand executive general manager of on-highway Craig Lee says biofuel is just one player in a diverse range of “current and emerging technologies across all industries” that should be used to reduce emissions.

“Certain industries will be harder than others to achieve significant reductions in emissions,” he told OwnerDriver.

“We see liquefied low-emission fuels running in internal combustion engines as a practical and viable technology for reducing emissions in vehicles used in the freight task.

“While there are some challenges in the current and future supply chain for significant volumes of this product and highly competitive demand across different sectors, we certainly think that liquified low-emission fuels have a part to play, and we’re ready to use these fuels today.”

This means Penske Australia and New Zealand was quick to support TIC’s National Truck Plan recommendations around biofuel regulations. It wasn’t alone in this endeavour – out of the five OEMs that OwnerDriver chatted to about biofuels, all of them were supportive of the idea that access to LCLFs should be made easier.

“Isuzu supports TIC’s position, not just on LCLFs, but also on the entirety of its National Truck Plan to improve the carbon footprint of the transport industry,” an Isuzu Australia spokesperson told OwnerDriver.

“We plan to provide further details regarding our products and Isuzu Trucks’ carbon neutral strategy at our media briefing at the upcoming Brisbane Truck Show.”

While manufacturers are supportive of the use of biofuels, they report that the price barrier for getting into the biofuel market is currently too high to make biofuels a cost-effective alternative for truck owners around Australia.

“Cost is still a barrier for entry for many operators,” a Volvo Trucks Australia spokesperson told OwnerDriver.

“Any initiative that speeds up the uptake of cleaner fuels or cleaner drivelines is a great step in the right direction.”

In December last year, Volvo announced it had switched to filling all new Volvo and Mack truck models produced at its local Wacol facility in Queensland with Hydro Treated Vegetable Oil (HVO) instead of diesel. Its upcoming FH Aero will also come ready to take the fuel source.

“All Volvo Group engine platforms are biofuel friendly, however the D17 at its highest hp setting of 780 is only rated to run on HVO or a diesel equivalent rather than straight recycled biodiesel,” the Volvo spokesperson says.

While Volvo is able to source the fuel and send its trucks out with a first tank of biofuel, its customers will find it difficult to re-fill tank number two with the same fuel at any regular service stations in Australia. The spokesperson says the lack of investment in the technology and infrastructure to support biofuels in Australia means accessing biofuels easily, and at the right price, is too hard.

In Europe, IVECO is a market leader in alternative fuels through its use of natural gas, which has become popular due to government support in funding refuelling facilities. While alternative fuelled vehicles aren’t new to Australia, with IVECO another manufacturer offering natural gas-powered vehicles for some time, issues regarding infrastructure continue to prevent the power source from becoming more popular for the local truck scene.

“Unfortunately, this fuel has never reached its full potential here due to a lack of refuelling infrastructure – the public refuelling network is small,” an IVECO spokesperson told OwnerDriver.

“Given this, vehicles were limited to shorter back-to-base operations, with some fleets electing to install refuelling infrastructure at their own depots if it’s a viable option.”

The current IVECO range is completely compatible with the latest generation of renewable diesel fuels such as HVO/XTL. IVECO says no technical modifications are needed to use the biofuels on its trucks, and it doesn’t impact the standard warranty and maintenance intervals if it’s used compared to the previous generation of biofuels such as B7, B10 and B15.

When looking at its applications in transport, IVECO says biofuels have power and output performances that are comparable to standard diesel with the added advantage of not being tied to international parity pricing. With significantly less emissions coming from trucks that use this fuels such as CNG, IVECO is one brand hoping local governments in Australia invest in biofuels.

“IVECO is technologically agnostic, acknowledging that there isn’t one solution for all applications, and is actively developing battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell options along with our current CNG technologies,” the spokesperson says.

“Trucks compatible with biofuels, both renewable diesel and RNG, are available today with ranges and refuelling times in parity with fossil fuel diesel, marking its significant advantage over BEV and HFCEV trucks in heavy haulage operations.”

Daimler is another company supporting the use of biodiesel at various levels, with its vehicles able to operate with pure alternative diesel fuels in accordance with DIN EN 15940, as well as in a mixture with convention diesel fuels. The brand has found that biodiesels are more than just able to be used – they have no adverse effects on how Daimler’s truck models operate.

“We’ve found that operating with 100 per cent paraffinic diesel fuel or mixed-fuel operations with diesel fuel has no impact on the oil change intervals or intervals for the cleaning and exchange of the diesel particulate filter,” a Daimler spokesperson told OwnerDriver.

“Our technology supports biodiesel, although our main focus remains on low emission diesel internal combustion, battery electric and, moving forward, hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen combustion technology.”

Manufacturers around the world are faced with the difficult task of speculating on which green technology will become the most cost effective and readily available at some point in the future.

Ultimately, the aim is for zero emissions from the trucks themselves – which leans in favour of hydrogen and electric outcomes. Right now though, biofuels offer a lower total carbon impact than existing diesel fuels, as they are created using a less carbon intensive production process.

While projects developing zero-emissions truck infrastructure are underway around the country, in the Western Australian town of Kwinana, it’s the future of biofuel development that is firmly in the spotlight.

At Kwinana, which is deep in the state’s mining heartland, bp’s Renewable Fuels project is currently in Front End Engineering Design. When complete, it will allow a mixture of transport fuel sources to be decarbonised, creating more accessible biofuels in the process.

“The project will see existing refining infrastructure repurposed to produce drop-in fuel products that have the ability over time to support the decarbonisation of aviation and heavy industry, subject to regulatory and state government approvals,” a bp spokesperson told OwnerDriver.

Once this is completed, logic dictates that biofuels should rise in popularity. Many of Australia’s leading truck models can seamlessly use the source, and the infrastructure issue should have a temporary fix to create more supply. But is it that simple?

When asked, all major OEMs who discussed biofuels with OwnerDriver viewed them in a different light to battery electric and hydrogen fuel source technology. Instead of being perceived as an end objective, biofuels are seen as a transitionary stepping stone to achieving net zero emissions.

“Biofuel is a technically viable intermediary for transitioning to a more sustainable energy future – it could act as a bridge between our current reliance on conventional fossil fuels and the anticipated widespread adoption of zero-emissions alternatives,” the IVECO spokesperson says.

“For RNG to succeed here in Australia, we would require the same government support regarding legislation and funding as provided in the EU, for instance, to initiate and incentivise the production of high-quality compressed natural gas (CNG) for transport and support the entire ecosystem necessary.”

The Volvo spokesperson supported this point, seeing biofuels as a “great step on the path for decarbonisation, but not a likely end point”. The reason provided went back to the volatile emissions impact the technology had on its trucks. A positive was that this still didn’t rule out biofuels from the global powerhouse’s future planning.

“HVO, for example, reduces well to wheel emissions, but when it is burnt in the engine, the emissions are close to if it was running on diesel. Future development of e-fuels for ICE drivelines are likely to tackle this issue,” the spokesperson says.

“Biofuels are just one way to reduce emissions, however there will be a multipronged approach to decarbonisation in transport that will include battery electric and hydrogen drivelines. In the future we may also see bio-gas drivelines powered by renewable biogas.”

The final word goes to Penske Australia and New Zealand’s Craig Lee. While the international OEM also follows its competitors in not being able to place all of its eggs in the one basket when it comes to future power sources, it has more of an idea where biofuels lay in its plans. While biofuel is currently a viable technology, Penske views it as a bridge to cover the gap between diesel and zero-emissions options like electric and hydrogen sources.

“We’ve seen globally that different segments, geographies, infrastructure and policies heavily influence the commercial viability of different technologies,” he says.

“The barriers currently in Australia to broad adoption of hydrogen fuel cell and battery-electric vehicles in the heavy duty on-highway truck segment make low-emission liquified fuels look like a practical and timely alternative.”",https://www.ownerdriver.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-2-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-03-31 01:57:12.807074

IFM Investors, the fourth-largest infrastructure manager in the world, today released new insights on the latest trends shaping the infrastructure investment landscape, in a report titled Infrastructure Horizons 2025.

Its key findings include:

the AI revolution is expected to profoundly impact the infrastructure space – bringing opportunities for data centres, electricity and fibre networks as well as operational upside for infrastructure assets;

sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the only medium-term pathway to decarbonise aviation, and by 2050, 80-90% of aviation fuel is expected to be SAF;

the renewable natural gas (RNG) industry is poised for significant growth over decades to come, with increased demand leading to an acceleration of capital in the sector;

data centre operators are now ‘following the power’ and approaching renewable energy generators to build new data centres on existing renewable energy sites; and

governments are focusing on energy independence and boosting advanced manufacturing capabilities, leading to opportunities for investors in infrastructure debt.

Infrastructure as a maturing asset class

The report suggests that there are infrastructure opportunities emerging at the intersection of traditional asset classes.

“As infrastructure matures and develops as an asset class, it demands fresh thinking from asset allocators,” said IFM Investors Chief Strategy Officer, Luba Nikulina.

As a leading private markets manager with deep expertise, experience and networks in infrastructure equity and debt, IFM is particularly interested in the confluence of technology and critical infrastructure.

“The opportunity set and investment universe of these infrastructure technology opportunities are only limited by the speed of technological developments emerging. These new opportunities span a range of important investment themes and megatrends, from capturing the energy transition to digitisation and automation,” said Nikulina.

IFM’s inaugural PM700 investor survey found that the proportion of respondents allocating to infrastructure is set to grow over the next three to five years from 46 per cent to 54 per cent for equity, and 45 per cent to 50 per cent for debt.

Flying into the future: the decarbonisation of aviation

Unlike other decarbonisation pathway suggestions for aviation, such as engine and aircraft advancements, electrification, and hydrogen, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ ready fuel which can be blended with existing jet fuel, without significant changes to aeroplane engines and refuelling infrastructure.

“We believe Australia has natural advantages which have the potential to create a generational opportunity to become a significant global producer of SAF,” said IFM Investors Investment Director, Timothy May.

In July last year, IFM, Ampol and GrainCorp signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels supply chain in Australia.

The waste to energy opportunity: renewable natural gas

Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) is an alternate fuel that can help industries lower emissions, improve waste management and create more circular economies.

Industry attention is rapidly shifting toward the recent and rapid growth in the voluntary market, where RNG is sold directly to end-users, such as natural gas utilities and commercial and industrial customers.

“This favourable supply-demand dynamic is expected to both drive RNG pricing higher and encourage the development of higher cost RNG sources. With this, the RNG industry is poised for significant growth over decades to come,” said IFM Investors Executive Director Infrastructure, Ashish Thomas.

The AI revolution: opportunities and challenges

The AI revolution is expected to profoundly impact the infrastructure space - creating significant opportunities for investment and enhancing value of existing infrastructure and also bring about challenges.

“Generative AI is expected to create sizeable economic benefits, given its potential to transform work and to accelerate technological development across industries,” said IFM Investors Executive Director Asset Management, Sebastian Domenech.

However, to fully harness its benefits, IFM believes it must be developed and implemented in ways that maximise its positive impact while proactively addressing potential risks such as cybersecurity and misinformation.

Integrating renewable energy and digital infrastructure

The outlook for energy demand, particularly electricity, is increasing at a rate not seen in decades.

IFM Investors expects a rapid convergence of renewable power generation, energy storage and digital infrastructure to meet the surging power demand, while simultaneously addressing the growing net zero objectives of data centre operators.

“Corporates are developing tailored solutions such as co-locating renewable energy sources with data centres to help ensure power security and to gain competitive advantages,” said IFM Investors Executive Director, Marigold Look.

Deglobalisation’s impact on infrastructure

Deglobalisation is emerging as a major driver of infrastructure debt opportunities, as the US and Europe look to onshore vital industries.

“While we believe the global economy will remain fundamentally interconnected for years to come, we also believe there will be a renewed focus on reshoring of industries and building national economic self-sufficiency,” said IFM Investors Director Head of Product Specialists, Jacob Otto.

By 2050, 80-90% of aviation fuel is expected to be SAF, reducing global aviation emissions by 62%.
Where traditional aviation fuel is produced from crude oil, SAF can be produced from a range of feedstock readily available, including canola oil.
As a key decarbonisation lever in aviation, SAF is increasingly used across the aviation supply chain.
By 2050, global SAF demand is forecast to reach 330ML/d with the highest penetration in Europe (c. 50%) and North America (c. 35%).","Maintaining the freedom and connectivity that comes with frequent, affordable air travel while decarbonising is a significant global challenge. Over 20% of global carbon emissions come from the transport sector and while some of these emissions can be readily addressed, the 2% stemming from aviation are considered particularly hard-to-abate. This is because the energy density requirements of commercial flight are difficult to meet using electrification or hydrogen. To decarbonise aviation, a fuel that is lighter than batteries and denser than hydrogen is needed. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) meets these criteria and is the only medium-term pathway to decarbonise aviation. By 2050, 80-90% of aviation fuel is expected to be SAF, reducing global aviation emissions by 62%.

Where traditional aviation fuel is produced from crude oil, SAF can be produced from a range of feedstock readily available, including canola oil. Other SAF feedstocks include sugar crops, waste oils, municipal rubbish and agricultural residues.

Unlike other decarbonisation pathways envisaged for aviation, such as engine and aircraft advancements, electrification, and hydrogen, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ ready fuel which can be blended with existing jet fuel, without significant alterations to airplane engines and refuelling infrastructure.

As a key decarbonisation lever in aviation, SAF is increasingly used across the aviation supply chain. The International Air Transport Association estimates SAF production will reach 2.7 billion litres in 2025. This would equate to 0.7% of all global jet fuel, more than doubling its share compared to the year prior. In the UK, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), a portfolio company of one of IFM Investors’ funds, was instrumental in calling for the now-legislated UK mandate of 10% SAF usage by 2030. In the US, New York’s LaGuardia Airport first distributed SAF to an airline tenant in 2022, transporting the fuel from a Texas refinery nearly 1,500 miles via two existing pipeline systems – those operated by Colonial Pipeline and Buckeye Partners, both owned by one of IFM Investors’ funds. As an owner of multiple Australian airports, including Sydney Airport, Melbourne Airport, Brisbane Airport and Adelaide Airport, rollout of SAF in Australia is a critical component in the continued decarbonisation strategy of IFM’s portfolio. Where many airports, including those owned by IFM, have successfully tackled Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, for instance by installing on-site solar arrays, procuring renewable energy via power purchase agreements or electrifying fleet vehicles, most of an airport’s Scope 3 emissions come from aircraft emissions.

Currently, however, global SAF supply is constrained, with 77 in-production SAF refining facilities which produced an estimated 1,900ML of SAF, or approximately 0.5% of total aviation fuel demand in 2024. Of this, the overwhelming majority has been produced via the Hydrogenated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process, and S&P forecast 70% of all SAF will still be made via the HEFA process in 2030. By 2050, global SAF demand is forecast to reach 330ML/d with the highest penetration in Europe (c. 50%) and North America (c. 35%). Commitment to increasing the global SAF supply is therefore necessary, with the Clean Skies for Tomorrow global target of 10% SAF across the aviation supply chain by 2030 backed by the wider industry, including Brisbane Airport.",https://www.ifminvestors.com/siteassets/shared-media/news--insights-images/horizons-2025/saf_horizons_hero.jpg,N,,2025-03-30 20:56:08.890954

With Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and lightweight materials, the A330neo delivers a 25% fuel burn reduction per seat and is certified under ICAO’s latest CO₂ standards.

Other highly efficient contenders include the Boeing 787-10 (2.31 L/100km) and Airbus A350-900/1000 (2.39 L/100km). These jets balance range, capacity, and fuel savings, with the 787-10 offering the best per-seat fuel economy and the A350-1000 leading on range.

With fuel costs expected to reach $248 billion in 2025, aircraft efficiency directly impacts airline profitability. Aviation remains focused on net-zero emissions by 2050, with next-gen engines, composite airframes, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) playing a key role.

As demand rises, the A330neo, A350, and 787 families represent the new gold standard in long-haul efficiency."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/486822406_122218865906064089_2273200214039050613_n.jpg?stp=c216.0.648.648a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&_nc_ohc=BRvrWIJD1yMQ7kNvgGWgZgr&_nc_oc=AdnVnY0CaERvfEPLIZOTSegqyGVywpT1EbGM4FWaXRejlv4llV2LPkB_9uWRaOevbkk&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=v83zfAWc_Sp35twOOI0zLw&oh=00_AYG3j2OIFPczeZdGKbhXfNIJJaLJ2WqKgkhcC-qN1kl3-w&oe=67EF82FF,N,,2025-03-30 17:56:35.761163

According to Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, the school located at the outskirts of Murang’a town, will get an additional Sh4.5 million in the next financial year to complete the project.
Ndindi said once completed, the school will help absorb learners from the area, thus reducing congestion in neighbouring primary schools.
In addition to education, Ndindi inaugurated the newly constructed Kandundu Estate Road, which was completed in under a year.

The funds will be used to construct classrooms to accommodate learners from grade one to grade nine.

According to Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, the school located at the outskirts of Murang’a town, will get an additional Sh4.5 million in the next financial year to complete the project.

Ndindi said once completed, the school will help absorb learners from the area, thus reducing congestion in neighbouring primary schools.

“Kandundu is a growing area in terms of settlements and population. The need to expand this ECDE centre into a primary school was informed by the fact students have been trekking for long distances to access education in schools within Murang’a town,” said the MP, when commissioning the project Friday.

Ndindi reiterated his commitment to improving education standards and school infrastructure in his constituency.

“Education in itself cannot be seen with bare eyes, but its impact on economic improvement and society at large is evident over time,” he stated.

He proposed naming the school after either former President Mwai Kibaki or veteran politician Kenneth Matiba, recognizing their contributions to Kenya’s development.

Ndindi also lauded the ongoing Masomo Bora program being implemented in day secondary schools within Kiharu, which allows parents to pay only Sh1, 000 per term while students receive meals, revision books, and enhanced facilities, including laboratories.

He noted that the initiative’s success has attracted over 2,000 students from neighboring constituencies, either commuting daily or living with relatives to access better education.

The MP underscored the significance of impactful leadership, emphasizing that elected leaders should let their work speak for them.

In addition to education, Ndindi inaugurated the newly constructed Kandundu Estate Road, which was completed in under a year.

He highlighted the constituency’s shift to concrete roads in steep areas, replacing murram roads that are frequently eroded by heavy rains.

“While concrete roads are costly, they provide a long-term solution compared to murram roads, which require frequent repairs after every rainy season,” Ndindi explained, assuring the residents that pending road construction projects would commence within the next two months.

Township Ward MCA Charles Machigo, praised the MP’s development agenda, recalling their initial discussions about constructing the school.

“We talked about this project, and our MP asked me to find land. I presented the title deed, and now here we are, ensuring that we always deliver on our promises,” Machigo said.

Margret Kamau, a retired teacher from Kandundu Nursery School, expressed gratitude, recalling how parents often asked when the school would be fully upgraded.

“I have been here since 2016 when we had only 16 students. Over the years, the MP has consistently supported renovations, and now, parents have peace of mind knowing their children will access primary education in the new school,” she said.

A local resident, Daniel Ndung’u, noted that infrastructure improvements have fueled economic growth, with more people moving into the area regardless of tribe or religion.

“The road has boosted businesses, increasing the number of shops and boda-boda operators,” he stated.

Meanwhile, area Assistant Chief Swaleh Hassan urged parents to monitor their children, cautioning them against playing near quarries, especially during school holidays.

“Security remains paramount, and we must ensure our children’s safety,” he emphasized.",https://www.kenyanews.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/android-chrome-256x256-150x150.png,N,,2025-03-30 12:56:30.463848

While IOC has tied up with LanzaJet to produce SAF using alcohol-to-jet technology, State oil marketing company is Parallelly working on more cost effective co-processing method to fast track the availability of SAF before introduction of government mandate.

The government has set an indicative blending target of one per cent of SAF in conventional jet fuel for international flights from 2027.

Co-processing plant

“Co-processing involves lower capex compared to a new standalone plant as it utilises an existing facility,” said an industry executive. “It is expected that SAF from the co-processing plant in Panipat will be available within a year and significantly earlier than one produced using ATJ method,” he added.

SAF refers to waste-derived aviation fuel. It is produced from various sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste , fats or non-food crops. SAF which is referred to as biofuel can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by upto 80 per cent depending upon the feedstock used and production method.

As of now there are 11 globally approved pathways for production of SAF. While both ATJ and co-processing methods are recognised, LanzaJet’s own plant in the US is set to commence production from this year.

“The ATJ project with LanzaJet is currently in the design engineering stage. Subject to successful due diligence, IOC will initiate the investment approval process,” he said.

Used cooking oil

It is learnt IOC will rely on used cooking oil as a feedstock for producing SAF with co-processing method.

IOC did not respond to an email query on the topic.

Along with IOC, other State oil marketing companies too are working on manufacture of SAF. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd is relying on CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum’s single step process that uses used cooking oil or palm waste to produce SAF. Last December it invited expression of interest from companies to partner for its SAF production plant.

According to a November 2024 media report, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd is planning to set up a SAF production plant by 2027. The company is finalising locations for the facility which could come up at its Mumbai or Kochi refineries. Last month, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd announced a tie up with Boeing to advance SAF ecosystem in India. HPCL’s R&D centre has also patented its proprietary Trijet technology for converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Last week, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol informed Rajya Sabha that public sector oil companies are engaged in setting up pilot/commercial scale facilities to produce SAF.

At present there are various challenges like high capex, fragmented supply chains, absence of tax benefits and subsidies for SAF production.

Airbus is looking to expand its collaboration with Türkiye's defense and aviation industries, daily Milliyet has reported.

The aerospace giant is particularly focused on increasing its parts production and leveraging Türkiye's capabilities in military aviation.

The announcement came following a summit in Toulouse on March 24-25, where the company presented its latest advancements in sustainable aviation.

The event also featured discussions on the European Union's efforts to establish a new defense capacity, with Airbus expected to play a significant role in contributing military transportation, fuel supply, intelligence aircraft, fighter jets, military helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles and air defense systems.

“We are absolutely determined to leverage our entire product portfolio to meet Europe’s defense and security needs. Türkiye is a priority country for Airbus,"" Milliyet quoted company officials as saying.

“Our 41 suppliers in Türkiye manufacture products worth $600 million annually. In the new period, we want the Turkish defense and aerospace sector to cooperate more and produce more parts for Airbus.”

As the company continues to focus on military production, it is also pushing forward with efforts to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint.

Airbus is investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and aims to reach zero carbon emissions. However, SAF currently accounts for just 2 percent of aviation fuel usage due to its higher cost — three to four times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Airbus plans to increase this figure to 10 percent by 2030.

Julie Kitcher, the company’s chief sustainability officer and communications, highlighted Türkiye's potential.

“Türkiye can play a leading role in the sustainable fuel industry,” she said, adding that new generation aircraft could eventually operate entirely on SAF.

The summit also addressed other critical topics, including the development of hydrogen fuel technology as an alternative to petroleum, innovations in propulsion systems, foldable wings, open fan engines and materials technologies aimed at increasing fuel efficiency for future aircraft.",https://image.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/200x200/67e94d1d6f547b4d588268fe.jpg,N,,2025-03-30 10:56:14.237701

It got the final green light from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).

It now enables Virgin Australia’s new 28 weekly flights between Australia and Doha – operated under a wet-lease with Qatar Airways – to proceed.

Utilising the wet-lease partnership from Qatar Airways, Virgin Australia is set to commence long-haul flights from Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to Doha from June 2025.

Melbourne flights to Doha will start in December 2025. Connecting through Hamad International Airport in Doha, Virgin passengers get access to more than 100 connecting itineraries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The Virgin-Qatar Air alliance also offers increased loyalty earn and redemption opportunities for both Qatar Airways’ Privilege Club and Virgin Velocity members.

The airlines say the Australian visitor and tourism economy will get a boost of an estimated A$3 billion in economic value over the next five years.

The Australian Government approved Qatar Airways Group’s 25% stake in Virgin Australia last month.

Qatar Airways Group CEO, Engr. Badr Mohammed Al-Meer said: “This marks the start of a new chapter in the relationship between our two airlines, and our collective commitment to supporting Australian businesses, Australian jobs and the wider economy.”

In October 2024, Qatar Airways and Virgin Australia o signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on a range of sustainability initiatives, including advancing the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), environmental management including waste and energy management and aviation workforce development.

Brasil quer reduzir emissões Em 2024, o governo federal sancionou uma lei que criou o Programa Nacional de Combustível Sustentável de Aviação, que pode potencializar o Brasil como nova liderança mundial nesse setor.
O SAF representa 65% da redução necessária, mas a produção ainda é muito baixa — apenas 0,3% do consumo total de combustível de aviação.","O SAF busca, justamente, mudar quais produtos podem produzir esse combustível, que pode ser derivado de etanol (álcool), óleo (inclusive o usado) e, até mesmo, resíduos de madeira. Cada um desses materiais passa por um processamento, assim como o petróleo, para se tornar um combustível compatível e seguro com os motores das aeronaves.

O etanol brasileiro é que se diferencia, justamente pelo país ser o maior produtor mundial desse produto, e já ter experiência de décadas na fabricação de biocombustíveis.

EUA sentem ameaça do Brasil

Em 2024, Tom Buis, presidente-executivo da ACA (American Carbon Alliance, ou, Aliança Americana do Carbono), se manifestou sobre o assunto após cargas de etanol que partiram do Brasil chegarem ao país norte-americano para serem transformadas em SAF.

""Se quisermos ver a agricultura americana sobreviver e prosperar, precisamos garantir que o etanol de milho seja parte da solução quando se trata de Combustível de Aviação Sustentável. Se não agirmos, o Brasil continuará a preencher o vazio"", disse.

A questão é polêmica, pois o Brasil é o segundo maior produtor de etanol do mundo, ficando apenas atrás dos próprios Estados Unidos. Ocorre que, no país norte-americano, o álcool é feito a partir de milho, que tem rendimento menor e tem uma pegada de carbono maior que o etanol feito a partir da cana-de-açúcar.

Com isso, o produto brasileiro tem mais potencial de redução nas emissões de poluentes do que outros concorrentes diretos, com o combustível feito a partir do álcool derivado do milho. E essa é uma forte preocupação do setor.

Desafios regulatórios limitam avanço

A exportação de etanol para a produção de SAF nos Estados Unidos pode favorecer o Brasil, mas ainda existem desafios regulatórios significativos. De acordo com Dany Oliveira, executivo sênior de aviação e transição energética, o Brasil possui vantagens como a vasta experiência na produção de etanol e a experiência de empresas como a Raízen, que já produz SAF a partir de etanol de segunda geração. No entanto, questões regulatórias podem dificultar o avanço no mercado.

""No curto prazo, a exportação de etanol para os EUA pode colocar o Brasil em uma posição de destaque, especialmente por termos a tecnologia para a produção de etanol de segunda geração"", afirma Oliveira. Para ele, a capacidade do Brasil de fornecer etanol competitivo e com baixo impacto ambiental é um ponto forte, mas ainda existem obstáculos regulatórios que precisam ser superados, como as questões de certificação de sustentabilidade relacionadas ao etanol brasileiro.

Outro ponto crucial apontado pelo especialista é a necessidade de biorrefinarias no Brasil. Oliveira destaca que, ""quando tivermos biorrefinarias operando em território nacional, o Brasil deve reavaliar sua estratégia e buscar ser um fornecedor de SAF, e não apenas exportador de commodity"". Isso garantiria ao país a liderança na produção de SAF com maior valor agregado, segundo Oliveira.

Brasil quer reduzir emissões

Em 2024, o governo federal sancionou uma lei que criou o Programa Nacional de Combustível Sustentável de Aviação, que pode potencializar o Brasil como nova liderança mundial nesse setor. De acordo com a iniciativa, os operadores aéreos deverão reduzir as emissões de gases do efeito estufa a partir de 2027 com o uso do SAF.

No primeiro ano, a redução deve ser de 1%, chegando a 10% menos em 2037. Hoje, o SAF já emite cerca de 75% menos gás carbônico em toda sua cadeia (desde a produção até a queima no motor) em comparação com o querosene de aviação usado atualmente, que é de origem fóssil.

Mas será necessário um pesado investimento público para transformar o país no líder da que vem sendo chamada de ""nova OPEP sustentável"", em alusão à Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo.

Já disponível, mas importado

No Brasil, a Vibra passou a disponibilizar em março ao mercado a primeira opção de SAF a partir do óleo de cozinha usado, matéria prima tipicamente poluente, mas que pode ganhar uma nova função. Ao todo, foram 550 mil litros importados da Bélgica. O produto pode ser misturado na proporção de 10% do biocombustível para 90% do querosene tradicional para ser usado nos aviões.

Mesmo com o primeiro lote importado, Marcelo Bragança, vice-presidente de operações, logística e fornecimento da Vibra, diz acreditar no potencial do Brasil, que tem tecnologia e experiência na produção de biocombustíveis em larga escala. "" O país detém uma vantagem competitiva única que é a disponibilidade de matérias-primas abundantes e diversificadas, incluindo cana-de-açúcar, resíduos agrícolas, óleos vegetais e gordura animal, que oferecem potencialmente múltiplas rotas de produção para SAF com custos competitivos e baixa pegada de carbono"", diz o executivo.

A empresa planeja, a partir de 2027, passar a substituir o produto importado por um produzido nacionalmente. Nesse cenário, a empresa não descarta que o país tenha potencial para, além de suprir a demanda interna, exportar o produto no longo prazo.

""A infraestrutura logística e industrial do país pode se constituir em outro diferencial importante com o avanço dos investimentos e da regulação, contribuindo para que possamos não apenas ter uma produção eficiente, mas também uma exportação competitiva. Diante de uma demanda global crescente, impulsionada por metas obrigatórias de SAF na Europa (ReFuelEU), nos EUA (Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge) e em outros mercados importantes, o Brasil está bem posicionado para se tornar um fornecedor estratégico"", afirma o executivo.

""Quando os projetos de produção de SAF no mercado brasileiro efetivamente entrarem em produção, o Brasil não será apenas um mero consumidor do produto, mas será protagonista na nova economia de baixo carbono, com potencial de se tornar um ator relevante no mercado internacional de SAF"", afirma Bragança.

Iata é otimista com sustentabilidade

Para Pedro de la Fuente, gerente de relações exteriores e sustentabilidade da Iata (Associação Internacional de Transportes Aéreos), o setor tem de insistir nas metas chamadas de net zero, ou seja, zero emissões de poluentes até 2050.

A instituição, que representa empresas e entidades do setor aéreo mundial, tem programas discutidos com toda a indústria, e, segundo de la Fuente, ainda é preciso evoluir em diversos aspectos para atingir esse objetivo. Veja os principais pontos da entrevista a seguir:

UOL: A indústria está avançando no ritmo necessário para alcançar o net zero (saldo zero em emissões de carbono) em 2050?

Pedro de la Fuente: O progresso tem sido lento. O SAF representa 65% da redução necessária, mas a produção ainda é muito baixa — apenas 0,3% do consumo total de combustível de aviação. Esperávamos números mais altos devido às novas instalações de produção do combustível, mas ainda não atingimos o ponto de virada para as metas de 2030. Precisamos de políticas que incentivem investimentos para atingir 5% de redução de emissões até 2030 e 65% até 2050.

UOL: Que políticas os governos podem adotar para estimular a produção de SAF?

Pedro de la Fuente: Três principais medidas: expandir biorrefinarias e coprocessamento, pois muitas refinarias podem ser adaptadas para SAF rapidamente; diversificar matérias-primas, indo além do álcool para Jet, já que há 11 caminhos técnicos para produzir SAF, e estabelecer um sistema global de gerenciamento de SAF, permitindo comércio internacional de créditos ambientais e garantindo um mercado mais dinâmico e integrado.

UOL: A meta de 2050 pode ser postergada para 2060?

Pedro de la Fuente: Obviamente, há muitos desafios pela frente. Mas também não podemos ficar sentados e dizer que, porque não temos capacidade hoje, vamos desistir das mudanças climáticas e do impacto que elas têm. As mudanças climáticas são uma ameaça existencial e todos e todas as indústrias devem lidar com as mudanças climáticas.

Então, reduzir as emissões é nossa principal prioridade e não queremos desistir de que podemos atingir a meta até 2050. Mas esta é uma medida autoimposta na aviação, mas requer intervenções governamentais. Requer política e o movimento lento da política é algo que também estamos acompanhando de perto porque elas não estão lá.

O progresso é muito lento nas implementações de políticas, nas definições, nas diferentes coisas que precisam mudar para que o SAF se torne uma mercadoria nos diferentes mercados, nos vários mercados.

UOL: Como engajar o público final?

Pedro de la Fuente: A conscientização cresceu. Hoje, 84% dos passageiros reconhecem a importância de SAF para a descarbonização da aviação, frente a 40% em pesquisas anteriores feitas pela Iata.

Do combustível convencional [de origem fóssil], do momento em que você está extraindo e perfurando o petróleo, você já está colocando carbono no ar. Assim como durante todo esse processo, através da refinaria, transporte, armazenamento, até a asa da aeronave, você queima, queima, queima, queima, queima. No SAF, você está reduzindo parte das emissões dessa cadeia de suprimentos.

O SAF reduz as emissões em até 80%, pois sua cadeia produtiva captura carbono. É essencial comunicar melhor esse impacto positivo ao consumidor final, ou seja, os passageiros.

UOL: Como as tarifas e políticas de Trump podem afetar o mercado de SAF?

Pedro de la Fuente: O governo dos EUA está mais protecionista que anteriormente. Mas não acredito que o escoamento da produção será limitado ou dificultado por essas leis protecionistas. O que podemos ver com essa nova guerra tarifária são provavelmente limitações nas importações dessas matérias-primas para o mercado dos EUA, mas não necessariamente algo que possa dificultar ou afetar o controle, de uma certa forma da produção geral, seja você controlando-a como um mercado específico ou entregando ela para outras partes do mundo.

Ayrıca gelecekteki bir uçağın yakıt verimliliğini artırabilecek yeni tahrik, katlanabilir kanat, açık fan motoru, dijital ve malzeme teknolojileri üzerinde araştırma yapıyor.

Airbus CEO’su Guillaume Faury, yeni nesil uçakların devrimci olmaktan ziyade evrimsel olacağını ifade etti. 2050 yılında net sıfır emisyon hedeflerine dikkat çeken Faury, “Karbon salınımını azaltmak için elimizde dört kaldıraç var. Bunlardan ilki az yakıt yakan yeni nesil uçaklarla eski uçakları değiştirmek, ikincisi gelecek nesil uçakları daha yakıt tasarruflu hale getirmek, üçüncüsü hava trafik yönetiminin daha optimize bir hale getirilmesi ve son olarak da uçaklarda SAF ve hidrojen gibi daha az karbon salınımına neden olan yakıtları geliştirmek. Yeni uçaklarımız yüzde 100 SAF ile uçabilecek ve bu sürdürülebilir havacılık için bir dönüm noktası olacak” dedi.

AB savunmasına katkı

Sıvı hidrojen teknolojisinde en büyük sorun depolama. Airbus bu konuda yeni bir teknoloji geliştirdi ve yıl sonundan itibarın geliştirdiği yeni hidrojen tanklarının testlerine başlayacak. Ayrıca sıvı hidrojenin genleşmesiyle ortaya çıkacak eksi 200 dereceleri aşan borular da uçağın ve elektronik sistemlerin soğutulmasında kullanılacak.

Airbus yetkilileri ticari uçaklarda aldıkları dekarbonizasyon adımlarını askeri alanda da uygulamak için görüşmeler yaptıklarını, ancak savunma sanayisinin önceliğinin çevre olmadığına dikkat çekti. Avrupa Birliği’nin (AB) 800 milyar euroluk savunma kapasitesi kurma planı da Airbus zirvesinde en fazla konuşulan konulardan birisi oldu. AB savunma kapasitesine, askeri nakliye, yakıt ikmal, istihbarat uçakları, savaş uçakları, askeri helikopterler, insansız hava araçları ve hava savunma sistemleri ile en büyük katkıyı sağlayacak olan Airbus, önümüzdeki dönemde askeri üretimine de ağırlık verme planları yaparken başta Türkiye olmak üzere parça tedarik ettiği ülkelerden de alımlarını artıracak.

Türkiye öncelikli

Airbus yetkilileri, “Airbus Avrupa’nın savunma ve güvenlik ihtiyaçlarına cevap verebilmek için tüm ürün portföyünden yararlanmaya kesinlikle kararlıdır. Türkiye Airbus için öncelikli ülke. Türkiye’deki 41 tedarikçimiz yıllık 600 milyon dolarlık ürün üretiyor. Yeni dönemde Türk savunma ve havacılık sektörünün Airbus için daha fazla işbirliği ve daha fazla parça üretmesini istiyoruz” açıklaması yaptı.

Yeni geliştirilen hidrojen yakıt tankı için testler bu yılın sonunda başlıyor.

SAF’ta Türkiye ‘lider’ oyuncu

Havacılık sektörü dünya karbon salınımının yüzde 3’üne sahip. Ancak son 15 yılda geliştirilen teknolojilerle uçuş kapasitesi ikiye katlansa da karbon salınımının aynı kalması sağlanmış. Airbus 2025 sıfır karbon hedefine ulaşmak için SAF yakıt (sustainable aviation fuel) alanında ciddi çalışmalar yürütüyor. Ancak SAF, petrol bazlı yakıta oranla 3-4 kat daha pahalı olduğu için şu anda yüzde 2’lik bir kullanım alanına sahip. 2030’da bu oranın yüzde 10 seviyesine çıkartılması hedefleniyor. Airbus Sürdürülebilirlik ve İletişim Baş Sorumlusu Julie Kitcher, “Türkiye sürdürülabilir yakıt endüstrisi konusunda lider bir rol oynayabilir” açıklamasında bulundu.

The ZEROe project initially explored the feasibility of two primary hydrogen propulsion technologies – hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. The company has now confirmed the selection of the fuel cell technology as the propulsion method for this future aircraft.

“Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionize air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway”, he added.

Four propellers

As far as the engine technology is concerned, the updated concept features four, 2 MW electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system. The systems transform hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction. The process will be almost carbon-neutral as long as renewable energy-derived ‘green hydrogen’ is used.

Further, all four fuel cell systems would be supplied via two liquid hydrogen tanks. This concept will continue to be refined over the coming years as additional tests will help mature the technologies associated.

It is certain that from this year onwards, airports will intensify their focus on enhancing passenger experience through automation, eco-friendly design, and improved connectivity. As a result, money is flowing into airports!

Those who plan, design and build the future global airport network are poised to decide how we will travel in the next 50+ years.

Airports will now use smart hubs to improve efficiency and passenger convenience. Facial recognition will speed up check-ins and security, while robots assist with luggage and directions. Digital displays will provide real-time updates on gate changes and wait times. India’s strategic geographical location positions it as a potential major international aviation hub, capable of serving both eastern and western markets. The mobile passport is a gamechanger for passenger experience improvements. Through that lens, let’s take a look specifically at the One ID initiative of IATA (International Air Transport Association). This is an ambitious, game changing take on streamlining the passenger journey. Built around biometrics, One ID enables contactless processing at airports and leverages advanced traveller information sharing, contactless processing and biometric-enabled identification. Looking to the next five years, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport intends to invest six billion Euro by 2029, while India is projected to invest 170 billion by 2030.

Seamless biometric travel is changing the way passengers move through airports. Instead of showing passports or boarding passes, travelers use facial recognition, fingerprints, or iris scans for check-ins, security, and boarding. This reduces wait times and enhances security with precise identity verification.

Passengers simply scan their biometric data, making travel less stressful. As technology advances, seamless travel is becoming the new standard. The government aims to achieve one percent SAF blending in international flights by 2027, escalating to five percent by 2030, with plans to produce five million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel. Paying due attention to the present day standards, airports are making sustainability a priority. Many are turning to renewable energy, with wind turbines and solar panels becoming more common. The key initiatives include electric ground vehicles, water recycling systems and eco-friendly terminal designs. Airports are also promoting public transport and low-emission travel options for the convenience of passengers. With these changes, airports are leading the way toward a greener future while maintaining smooth and comfortable travel experiences.

Data analytics will help manage crowds and optimize flight schedules. Automation in lighting and climate control will enhance sustainability. As a result, airports will offer a smoother, more user-friendly experience for travelers worldwide. Currently, Air India Group, after integrating Vistara, enjoys over 28 per cent market share, while IndiGo commands 60-62per cent, collectively controlling 90 per cent of the market. Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu has emphasized that such market concentration disadvantages travelers. He outlined three strategic initiatives to transform India’s aviation landscape: financial support mechanisms; state-level collaboration and price control strategies.

Researchers from Northumbrian Water hope to produce sustainable aviation fuel using algae grown in domestic sewage. The 'Green Machine' project will use the algae to extract nitrogen and phosphorous from wastewater, before it is recovered and turned into sustainable fuels.

Northumbrian Water hopes to use its Bran Sands Treatment Works site in Teesside to trial the process. It says the project, which has used a £6.5m investment from the firm, will help reduce environmental impacts of waste treatment and could save up to £1m operational costs per year.

The work is in collaboration with US-based firm BrightWave, which specialises in providing the photobioreactors that are used to cultivate algae, and Ligoflux - a specialist filtration company that provides products for algae harvesting.

Angela MacOscar, head of innovation at Northumbrian Water Group, said: ""The Green Machine is set to revolutionise the way we treat waste, and we are incredibly excited that we have started work on this brand new project. With our ‘Power from Poo’ project, where we create green energy using the sludge that is left over from wastewater treatment, we have already shown that we are leading the industry in pushing the boundaries of innovation – and this is set to be carried forward with this project.

""Not only will this help to develop a value-added product, but it will also help to boost us forward towards our own net zero goals and help us to achieve our net zero ambitions.""

Tim Shaw, president at BrightWave, added: “BrightWave is thrilled to support Northumbrian Water in this innovative and important project. It will be one of Europe's largest indoor algae-based initiatives and a model for future applications. We're excited about how this venture's integration of wastewater treatment, SAF development and a low-cost profile will position it as a viable and relevant worldwide solution.""

Letter of the week

Dear Editor

The fire at one of the substations that provides power to Heathrow served as a reminder of the many hundreds of flights that the airport handles every day. Chancellor Reeves justified the recent Government announcement supporting a series of airport expansions by stating that ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ (SAF) was a ‘game changer’ that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70 per cent.

Currently, the UK is committed to a 2 per cent SAF content in aviation kerosene and is providing £63million to boost production. To date, this is predominantly derived from used cooking oil, 80 per cent of which is imported from China and Malaysia. It is planned that the SAF content will increase to 22 per cent by 2040, by which time it is forecast that passenger numbers will have doubled, equating globally to 200,000 flights a day consuming over 18million barrels of aviation fuel. This will necessitate the use of multiple sources of feedstock such as municipal waste, sewage and a vast area of land dedicated to growing bioenergy crops. These are already grown on a massive scale to provide the E10 element in the petrol, thus further reducing the area of land available for growing food. Alternatively, SAF could be produced in the form of green hydrogen, but this would require up to 3.4 times more wind and solar capacity than at present.

Clearly, the Chancellor has not taken the trouble to read the report from the Royal Society, which concludes that this course of action could be up to 69 per cent more carbon intensive than using standard kerosene jet fuel and could result in ‘unacceptable collateral ecological damage’. Airline operators may be keen to be seen as environmentally responsible but, in reality, they and the Chancellor are hiding behind another green smokescreen that fails to stand up to robust scrutiny.

Promises and pledges and pretty much nothing else

Dear Editor

My concern is that those in power are not applying any actual political philosophy. There is the seeking of power for power’s sake, but no intention of significantly changing anything. You cannot fault Lenin, or indeed Hitler, for not wanting to change things. At least they went into politics to do something!

Our politicians are not aiming higher than just getting elected. Where is the vision, a bringing together of the people? Where are the ideas, the imagination, the farsightedness, the inspiration?

This country desperately needs a (peaceful) revolution. The difference between the haves and have-nots is unacceptable. This is not some Marxist, communist rant; the population is not coherent as a nation. I am not advocating any sort of nationalism. I am advocating a fair and just society that is at ease with itself.

Politicians of all parties have completely failed us. At the last election, nearly half the people could not even be bothered to vote. There is absolutely no belief in the current political system. It is all promises and pledges and meaningless drivel. The Houses of Parliament are regarded with derision. The House of Lords existence cannot be justified on any grounds. The level of debate in the Commons is pathetic, and since all the members vote in accordance with party lines, what is the point of discussing anything anyway?

The current political system cannot and will not make the fundamental changes needed. The existing parties have no real concept of how a successful country should be administered. This is not success in a material sense, but success in the wellbeing of every single one of us. To achieve that, there must be a different outlook and political system. The gross unfairness must be eliminated completely, and the Government must represent the wishes of the people, not just exclusively their career interests.

A sour taste in a tourist’s mouth

Dear Editor

Keep up the good work. I am incredibly saddened by what’s been going on in the UK for the past few years regarding freedom of speech. The covid debacle seemed to just exacerbate the downward slide.

We have been to the UK (from the United States) so many times that I have stopped counting, and we used to hike almost every year in Scotland. I wonder if the Government realizes they’ve lost two visitors because of both those issues above. Surely, we aren’t the only ones? We did not take the jabs, and I had been concerned had I needed medical care of some sort while there, I couldn’t get it without submitting. Now, I’m concerned that an opinion I express in public might land me in hot water with the ‘authorities’. It’s both disturbing and disgusting to see this.

The UK and most of Western Europe are committing cultural and political suicide, but you know that. It breaks my heart to see it happening. Thank you for being a strong voice in the wilderness.

Climate Derangement Syndrome has clearly infected the UK’s cheese-manufacturing industry.

Perhaps, ‘Mad Ed’ Miliwatt has shares in Ivy’s Somerset Cheddar Cheese company.

Acquiescence is a political stance

Dear Editor

The family of Sheku Bayoh, who died after officers restrained him, have settled their £1.85million civil damages claim against Police Scotland. The public inquiry, which is still ongoing, has so far cost more than £23million. How much has the family’s solicitor, Aamer Anwar, been paid? By capitulating to political pressure and agreeing to the civil damages claim, the Chief Constable Jo Farrell has betrayed her officers. The Scottish Police Federation reacted with fury and said, ‘The only person who can be said indisputably to have broken the law was Sheku Bayoh.’ They added that evidence showed Bayoh had taken illegal drugs, was thought to have armed himself with a knife and punched a female officer to the ground. It took six police officers to hold him down. Jo Farrell is merely a political puppet doing what she is told to do and is held in low esteem by those she should be leading. Hopefully, the 2026 Scottish general election will see a change in the Scottish Government and result in a new and independent Chief Constable.

The aircraft maker told staff in February that the rollout of its hydrogen aircraft was “expected to come later than 2035” — the date it had previously targeted.
Previous iterations of Airbus’s “ZEROe” programme envisaged a hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane that could carry up to 100 passengers with a range of 1,850km.
As Airbus grapples with hydrogen, Faury issued a further warning on the long-term viability of quotas for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — seen by many as the industry’s only tool to decarbonise at scale.
Worries over sustainable aviation fuel SAF is made in a number of ways, including from used cooking waste, clothes and tyres.","“Given the distribution of our operational system, and the global market we are serving … we think that there are ways to adapt,” Faury said. “We have manufacturing sites in the US, so we think that we have some cards [to play].

“There will be a need for adaptation — it will hurt at the beginning. So I will not say that I am optimistic, but I think realistically we will be able to manage the situation.”

• Airbus boss: European aerospace braced for Trump tariffs

The comments from Faury came just before Trump is set to hail “Liberation Day” on Wednesday — when a raft of protectionist measures, designed to promote American jobs at the expense of free trade, come into force.

Failing a last-minute reprieve, tariffs of 25 per cent will be imposed on imports from Mexico and Canada — America’s two biggest trading partners. Likewise, the US president will levy import taxes of 25 per cent on cars and car parts coming into the US. Steel and aluminium tariffs have already been imposed, as well as punitive measures on goods entering from China.

“We have been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe,” the president said this month.

Although the fate of the aerospace sector remains to be seen, Airbus is preparing for new import taxes that would have big implications for an industry where semi-finished goods cross borders multiple times.

US aerospace tariffs are expected in order to protect Boeing, the plane maker that has historically been the country’s biggest exporter by value.

Trump, however, has been more sparing with his praise for Airbus’s American rival since returning to the White House in January. In 2017, he lauded Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner jet as a “beautiful aeroplane”, but the company’s delayed delivery of two new Air Force One planes has led to the US president being more critical during his second term. “No, I’m not happy with Boeing … we gave that contract out a long time ago,” Trump said in February.

Despite his apparent misgivings, Trump awarded the Virginia-based company a $20 billion (£15.5 billion) contract this month to build the US military’s next-generation F-47 fighter jet.

Faury, chief executive of the €132 billion (£110 billion) Airbus since 2019, said that Airbus had done extensive planning for US import taxes. “In all of the different scenarios that we have looked at, they are either so bad for both sides that you need to come to a resolution; or it’s so imbalanced that the one putting tariffs on is suffering a lot,” he said.

“[In the latter scenario] there will then come a point where the industry says we need support so we can get out of this situation. A bit like we have heard from the car industry going to Washington and asking for ways of dealing with the situation because it would be too harmful.”

Airbus has beefed up its presence in the US in recent years. The company employs 5,000 people in America across the commercial aircraft, helicopters, space and defence sectors.

Faury said: “We are in the position to serve the US from the US. That’s one of the things we did, eyes open, and accelerated after the tariffs we had to suffer five years ago [during Trump’s first term]. We have a bit more experience when it comes to tariffs compared with other industries.”

‘Bigger’ hydrogen planes

Faury’s comments on US tariffs came as the most influential executive in commercial aviation insisted that Airbus had not given up on developing hydrogen-powered aircraft.

The aircraft maker told staff in February that the rollout of its hydrogen aircraft was “expected to come later than 2035” — the date it had previously targeted. It subsequently emerged that the timeline had been pushed back by five to ten years and the programme’s budget cut by a quarter.

“We continue to believe that hydrogen will be part of the solution,” he said.

Faury, 57, said that there was more to do to optimise the aircraft. “What we had not forecast or understood is that it will take much more time for the so-called hydrogen ecosystem to grow.

• The ‘albatross’ folding wing helping Airbus go green

“There is no point running a plane on green hydrogen if there is no green hydrogen available at scale.” Green hydrogen is a version of the gas made from renewable power sources.

Pressing ahead with the previous timescale risked producing a “sort of ‘Concorde of hydrogen’, where we would have a solution but one that would not be commercially viable at scale”, he told delegates at a conference in Toulouse last Monday.

Previous iterations of Airbus’s “ZEROe” programme envisaged a hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane that could carry up to 100 passengers with a range of 1,850km.

Faury said that delaying the project could allow for the development of a larger plane. “We were targeting about 100 [seats] … I think it is quite likely that we will end up with more room,” he said.

As Airbus grapples with hydrogen, Faury issued a further warning on the long-term viability of quotas for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — seen by many as the industry’s only tool to decarbonise at scale.

Worries over sustainable aviation fuel

SAF is made in a number of ways, including from used cooking waste, clothes and tyres.

Quotas stipulate that it must represent 2 per cent of total aviation fuel burnt in the UK in 2025, rising to 10 per cent in 2030, and 22 per cent by 2040. Similar rules in the EU also require 2 per cent in 2025, but rise moderately in the early years to 6 per cent by 2030 and 20 per cent by 2035.

It is the ramp-up beyond 2030 that concerns Faury. This is because airlines will increasingly look to source SAF from countries that are able to produce it more cheaply. In extreme cases, this could lead to airlines burning extra fuel as they “tanker” it from those countries selling cut-price SAF.

“The beginning of the trajectory is very reasonable,” he said. “I am a bit more worried that we need a level playing field on a global scale to have the real successful development of SAF.

“If you want SAF to go beyond 15-25 per cent, the fragmentation of the regulatory framework recreates big differences in competitiveness. That is the thing that will slow down SAF.”

Unlike hydrogen power, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel — meaning that aircraft engines need few changes to operate on it, and it can be easily blended with traditional jet fuel.

Faury said that if global SAF quotas can be harmonised, and sufficient production secured, standard combustion aircraft engines will still be operating for the rest of the 21st century.

“[By then] the transition to SAF will have happened to a large extent, maybe completely,” he said.

“I am very optimistic that we will find [enough] SAF, over time.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fdd584e19-d751-4f8c-8015-6cefd97e0dad.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-03-29 21:56:53.407034

As the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a viable solution to significantly lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that meets the same technical and safety requirements as traditional fossil-based jet fuel while offering a more sustainable alternative.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF is chemically similar to conventional jet fuel but is derived from the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks and agricultural residues. Unlike fossil fuels, SAF sources hydrocarbons from more sustainable origins, leading to a net reduction in emissions on a life cycle basis.

To qualify as SAF under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the fuel must meet two primary sustainability criteria:

Achieve at least a 10% net GHG emissions reduction compared to baseline fossil jet fuel emissions.

Not be produced from biomass sourced from land with high carbon stock.

Additionally, SAF cannot be derived from edible feedstocks that compete with food production. The fuel is refined and blended with traditional jet fuel in approved ratios before certification, ensuring seamless integration into existing aviation infrastructure.

How Does SAF Reduce Emissions?

A common misconception is that SAF directly reduces tailpipe CO₂ emissions. The real emissions reductions stem from the fuel’s life cycle assessment, including feedstock origin and induced land use change effects.

Current Adoption and Industry Efforts

Since its first commercial use in 2016, SAF has fueled hundreds of thousands of flights, with supply points expanding across major airports. However, production remains limited.

The U.S. and global aviation sectors have set ambitious SAF targets:

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge aims to increase U.S. SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050.

Engine manufacturers are developing systems capable of running on 100% SAF, eliminating the need for blending in the future.

Challenges and Next Steps

Despite its potential, widespread SAF adoption faces hurdles:

High production costs: SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel, limiting widespread airline uptake.

Feedstock availability: Sustainable sources must be carefully managed to prevent adverse environmental and food security impacts.

Infrastructure limitations: Expanding refining capacity and distribution networks requires substantial investment.

SAF Book and Claim

Book and claim is a system that allows buyers to purchase a specified amount of SAF and claim the associated emissions reduction, even if they do not physically use the fuel themselves. This method separates the fuel’s physical distribution from its climate benefits, enabling organisations to support SAF adoption without direct access to it.

Neste’s Impact solution aligns with the Science Based Targets initiative, ensuring businesses can credibly report emissions savings from their SAF purchases, reinforcing their sustainability commitments.

“In simple terms, many organisations are eager to reduce their Scope 3 emissions by using SAF, but they may not have direct access to it. A book and claim system provides a practical way for them to start cutting emissions,” explains Susanne Bouma, Head of Customer Experience and Offer Management, Renewable Products at Neste, a leading producer of SAF.

Using the book and claim scheme is a fantastic way to add more sustainable fuel into the pool of overral jet fuel used around the world.

Airbus sta progettando una common digital platform per un future next-generation single aisle, che garantirà operazioni più sicure ed efficienti.","Airbus informa: “Oggi, gli ingegneri Airbus stanno sviluppando attivamente soluzioni innovative che promettono di rivoluzionare il futuro dell’aviazione.

Immaginiamo un nuovo Airbus single-aisle aircraft con ali progettate con aerodinamica avanzata e biomimicry per generare significativamente più portanza, riducendo il consumo di carburante e incrementando l’efficienza. I suoi motori consumeranno il 20% in meno di carburante rispetto ai modelli attuali, rendendo il viaggio più decarbonizzato ed economico. Per supportare ulteriormente i guadagni nei consumi realizzati con i miglioramenti dei motori, Airbus prevede un ruolo crescente per le hybridisation and electrification technologies.

L’aeromobile verrà costruito con materiali più leggeri ma più forti, consentendo aerei più resistenti e più facili da gestire. Inoltre, Airbus sta adottando un approccio olistico per l’integrazione di una nuova system platform che includerà la smart automation non solo all’interno dell’aeromobile, ma anche nelle operazioni di terra e nella manutenzione.

Queste innovazioni trasformeranno il modo in cui gli aeromobili sono costruiti, operati e mantenuti, preparando le basi per una nuova era (leggi anche qui)”.

“Le ali degli aeromobili si sono evolute in modo significativo sia nel design che nella funzionalità sin dai primi giorni del volo. Le prime ali erano semplici, piatte e dritte, basate sull’aerodinamica di base per ottenere la portanza e realizzate con materiali basici come il legno. Con il progredire dell’ingegneria nel corso degli anni, le ali sono diventate più aerodinamiche e curve, ottimizzando la portanza e riducendo la resistenza, per performance migliori.

Rispetto a dove sono iniziate, le ali degli aeromobili di oggi possono sembrare all’apice dell’innovazione. Ma Airbus ritiene che ci sia ancora un mondo di possibilità per migliorare la progettazione delle ali. Nel 2023 la società ha aperto il Wing Technology Development Centre presso il suo sito di Filton, Regno Unito. È sede del Wing of Tomorrow (WoT) research and technology programme, che è fortemente coinvolto nella progettazione dell’ala per la futura prossima generazione di aeromobili. Ma il programma va oltre la progettazione, mirando a migliorare le nuove tecnologie di produzione e assemblaggio delle ali.

Sebbene i dettagli tecnici siano tenuti strettamente segreti, alcune delle possibilità per una nuova ala sono già state divulgate pubblicamente, la più importante delle quali è una folding wing. Ciò conferisce all’aereo un’apertura alare più elevata in volo, aumentando la portanza e riducendo la resistenza, pur rendendolo compatibile con i gate degli aeroporti”, afferma Airbus.

“Similmente alle ali, l’industria aeronautica ha progredito attraverso vari modelli di motori nel corso dei decenni, migliorando costantemente la fuel efficiency, le performance e la sicurezza del propulsion system. Mentre i motori a pistoni dei primi aerei fornivano la spinta necessaria per decollare, erano limitati in termini di efficienza e velocità. Il turbojet engine, introdotto per la prima volta negli anni ’50, ha cambiato per sempre l’aviazione e le ha permesso di diffondersi in tutto il mondo. L’attuale motore turbofan offre una migliore fuel efficiency e meno rumore, il che lo ha portato a diventare lo standard nell’aviazione commerciale moderna.

Per portare le cose al livello successivo, Airbus sta studiando il potenziale di alcune promettenti tecnologie di motori. Uno dei principali contendenti è l’open fan. Un open fan engine è molto diverso da un moderno turbofan, poiché le fan blades che generano la spinta sono più grandi e non sono contenute in una nacelle. Ciò consente all’aria di muoversi in modo efficiente attraverso il motore, riducendo il consumo di carburante.

Airbus sta lavorando con gli esperti di CFM sul Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator, che mira a mostrare come questa tecnologia potrebbe ridurre il consumo di carburante e le emissioni di CO2 del 20% rispetto ai single-aisle engines più efficienti di oggi. Airbus prevede di testare in volo RISE sul suo A380 flight test aircraft entro la fine del decennio”, prosegue Airbus.

“Hybridisation significa combinare diverse fonti di energia invece di affidarsi esclusivamente al jet fuel. Questo si presenta in diverse forme. Innanzitutto, la prossima generazione di aeromobili Airbus sarà in grado di volare con una fino a 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Poiché il SAF può ridurre le emissioni di carbonio del ciclo di vita fino all’80% rispetto al tradizionale jet fuel, questo standard di compatibilità sarà una leva fondamentale per aiutare le compagnie aeree a raggiungere il loro obiettivo di decarbonizzazione.

Ma il SAF non è l’unico modo per ridurre le emissioni. Airbus sta anche lavorando per far progredire la hybrid-electric propulsion, che integra l’uso del jet fuel convenzionale o del SAF con l’elettricità da batterie o fuel cells. Ciò ha il potenziale per ridurre le emissioni di carbonio di un aeromobile fino al 5%. Proprio come le automobili ibride, l’electric hybridisation può ridurre il consumo di carburante utilizzando energia altrimenti sprecata per alimentare non-propulsive functions.

L’EcoPulse demonstrator, un progetto congiunto tra Airbus, Daher e Safran, ha fornito informazioni significative sull’uso di batterie agli ioni di litio a bordo di un aereo con un high-voltage network. Airbus sta anche esplorando il potenziale delle solid-state batteries, che potrebbero fornire un equilibrio ottimale di energia e potenza in uscita per la prossima generazione di aeromobili. Queste batterie potrebbero essere utilizzate per alimentare l’aereo durante il rullaggio a terra, nonché durante il volo per funzioni di bordo come l’air conditioning system o l’illuminazione”, continua Airbus.

“Proprio come le ali e il sistema di propulsione, i materiali utilizzati per costruire gli aeromobili si sono evoluti in modo significativo da quando l’airframe in legno del Wright Flyer ha effettuato il suo primo volo. Il legno è stato sostituito dall’alluminio nei primi decenni di volo, che a sua volta ha iniziato a essere sostituito da carbon-fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) negli anni ’80, poiché la sua resistenza superiore e il peso più leggero hanno migliorato la fuel efficiency. Anche il titanio ha anche assunto un ruolo chiave negli aeromobili moderni, in quanto è abbastanza resistente da essere utilizzato per componenti aeronautici ad alto stress ma pesa meno dell’acciaio.

Nel complesso, i materiali sono passati dall’essere più deboli e pesanti all’essere ora ad alta resistenza e leggeri. Ciò ha portato a miglioramenti nella sicurezza, nella fuel efficiency e nelle performance degli aeromobili. Ma Airbus ritiene che ci siano ancora molti progressi da fare. Un percorso chiave per il miglioramento è la ricerca su come biomass composites and thermoplastics potrebbero sostituire le CFRP e il progresso mirato non si limita alla riduzione del peso. Airbus sta anche cercando di rendere il processo di produzione degli aeromobili sia più sostenibile, scegliendo materiali più facilmente riciclabili, sia più efficiente, con meno sprechi e un assemblaggio più rapido.

Un esempio di questo tipo di miglioramenti è il Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD), un programma guidato da Airbus nell’ambito della Clean Sky 2 Large Aircraft platform. Utilizzando carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic polymer composites (CFRTP) al posto di CFRP, il dimostratore ha raggiunto il suo obiettivo di risparmio di peso a un costo neutro e ha anche dimostrato una maggiore efficienza di produzione. Il CFRTP è anche più facile da riutilizzare e riciclare rispetto ad altri materiali”, prosegue Airbus.

“Airbus ha sconvolto il mercato degli aeromobili commerciali negli anni ’80 quando ha introdotto la tecnologia fly-by-wire sull’A320. Sostituendo i comandi meccanici con quelli digitali, la sicurezza, la manovrabilità e l’affidabilità dell’aeromobile sono state migliorate. Presto adottato dall’intero settore, il fly-by-wire definisce la quarta generazione di aeromobili che volano oggi.

Sebbene il fly-by-wire sia ora lo standard del settore, non è la fine della strada. Airbus sta progettando una common digital platform per un future next-generation single aisle, che garantirà operazioni più sicure ed efficienti. Questi sistemi futuri saranno altamente connessi e automatizzati, alimentati da piattaforme informatiche avanzate. Ciò consentirà automatic installation, updates and modifications delle system applications, consentendo miglioramenti immediati per incrementare le performance. Allo stesso tempo, le maggiori velocità di elaborazione supportate dall’intelligenza artificiale aumenteranno la quantità di dati che possono essere elaborati in modo sicuro. Ciò faciliterà la predictive maintenance e migliorerà l’esperienza dei passeggeri attraverso la disponibilità di informazioni in tempo reale.

La sicurezza, la massima priorità di Airbus, sarà ulteriormente rafforzata anche attraverso l’incremento di automatic assistance technologies per i piloti, aiutandoli a gestire operazioni complesse con maggiore precisione. Questa automatic assistance sarà estesa anche all’esterno del cockpit, a ground operations and maintenance”, conclude Airbus.

Sono alcune delle caratteristiche dell’aereo di nuova generazione di Airbus destinato a sostituire la famiglia degli A320 a corridoio singolo, il più venduto di sempre, svelate durante il summit sull’aviazione sostenibile a Tolosa. I tempi sono ancora lunghi e per il suo decollo bisognerà attendere dai dieci ai 15 anni, ma di certo vedrà la luce prima dell’avveniristico velivolo alimentato ad idrogeno del produttore europeo, lancio previsto nel 2035, posticipato a data da definire.

«Abbiamo gli ingredienti e la ricetta - ha detto Bruno Fichefeux, Head of Future Programs di Airbus -. Ora si tratta di capitalizzare quanto di meglio abbiamo realizzato finora per compiere un nuovo salto in avanti». E il nuovo passaggio va nella direzione dell’aviazione sostenibile con la diminuzione fino all’azzeramento delle emissioni nocive nell’aria entro il 2050.

Obiettivo ambizioso per un settore che inquina tra il 2% e il 3% delle emissioni globali di CO2, ma con una combinazione di carburanti alternativi, nuove tecnologie e nuovi aeromobili con ali più lunghe e più leggere sarà possibile raggiungere se non avvicinarsi al target, almeno secondo i tecnici e gli ingegneri di Airbus. Uno degli ingredienti per rendere meno inquinante l’aereo del futuro è il motore Open Fan che a Tolosa stanno studiando insieme a CFM, la joint venture tra la statunitense GE Aerospace e la francese Safran: il propulsore ha dimensioni maggiori, si colloca esternamente alla casula, costringendo a modificare l’aerodinamica dell’aereo. «Una delle novità importanti è la tecnologia Open Fan - ha confermato Fichefeux -. La stiamo sviluppando. Abbiamo un piano per eseguire test di volo» che tuttavia non inizieranno prima della fine di questo decennio.

A confermare le capacità del nuovo propulsore è Mohamad Ali, senior vice president e chief technology di GE Aerospace: «Con il nuovo motore sarà possibile un risparmio di carburante superiore al 20% rispetto alla tecnologia attuale». Airbus non ha scelto alcuna configurazione di motori ed è in trattativa anche con Rolls-Royce e Pratt & Whitney, i principali concorrenti di CFM International, per valutare eventuali alternative.

Un altro ingrediente è il carburante, ovvero il SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), al momento l’unica alternativa ai kerosene per aviazione, ma ancora troppo costoso e disponibile in quantità non sufficienti alle esigenze del settore: il SAF viene già utilizzato dalle compagnie aeree al 2% miscelato al carburante tradizionale, ma in prospettiva l’obiettivo è di aumentare questa quota fino al 100% rispetto alla miscela massima al 50% consentita sugli attuali aeromobili Airbus.",https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/S24/Documenti/2025/03/27/Immagini/Ritagli/Airbus1-U32758021311ivS-1440x752@IlSole24Ore-Web.jpg?r=1170x507,N,,2025-03-29 16:56:26.315007

Specifically, the Massachusetts-based company is leveraging low-cost renewable energy, carbon dioxide, and water to make a ready-to-use, carbon-neutral jet fuel alternative. It comes with astounding 95% lower heat-trapping gas emissions, all according to a press release.

The latest news involves the successful testing of a North Carolina pilot station.

""In less than three years, we've moved from concept to pilot, which marks a pivotal step toward our long-term goal of decarbonizing aviation,"" CEO Joe Rodden said in the statement.

Aviation is widely reported to account for about 2.5% of worldwide, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. The fume volume has accelerated faster than rail, road, or shipping since 2000, according to the International Energy Agency.

Once spewed, the exhaust contributes to our planet's warming. Massachusetts Institute of Technology experts said the higher temperatures, combined with natural weather patterns, play a part in worsening severe weather and harmful ocean warming — conditions already being realized.

Many flights use sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, which is a non-petroleum product that has reduced emissions compared to conventional fuels, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

But Lydian's team thinks it can make it much cleaner. Its process collects abundant carbon dioxide — partially generated from planes themselves — and sends it to specialized synthetic gas production tech, where water is added. Low-cost renewable energy powers the transformation happening inside a shipping container-sized unit. The syngas is then sent to a fuel synthesis station, where it's made ready to power aircraft, all per a Lydian rendering that details the process.

Part of the efficiency comes by operating only when renewable power can be bought at low prices. By running at ideal times, the process avoids extreme energy expenses typical to power-to-liquid operations. What's more, the strategic electricity use doesn't strain the grid and avoids competition for valuable electricity, all per the release.

The pilot operation can produce 25 gallons of e-fuel daily, which represents massive progress for Lydian. But it's not much when considering that big aircraft can burn that amount in minutes, TechCrunch noted.

The team includes NASA, Stanford, and MIT experts. By 2030, the plan is to be making 20 million gallons of fuel per year for commercial flights and even for the Department of Defense, all per the release.

""This pilot showcases the viability of our novel technology to produce SAF and our ability to scale toward commercial production in record time,"" Rodden said.

Hydrogen fuel is another alternative being developed for flight and transportation. But it isn't entirely clean, depending on how it's made and used, as noted by the Sierra Club. And even syngas has some flammability and toxicity concerns that could result from uncontrolled releases, according to ScienceDirect.

For their part, carbon neutral efforts are geared to remove as much CO2 from the air as the operation — or in this case flights and fuel production — generate. Meta and other companies are investing in solar farms to offset energy demand for their growing data centers, as another example.

Anyone can help to remove air pollution from the environment by planting trees. One mature tree absorbs 48 pounds of CO2 annually, according to the Arbor Day Foundation. By letting native plants and flowers grow in your yard, you can also help pollinator health, which is crucial to our food supply.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lydianimage-recpgHcxq5i9eMG2R-e1743270159221.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 15:56:30.992329

Zrównoważone paliwo lotnicze (sustainable aviation fuel, SAF) to jeden z najgłośniejszych tematów w branży lotniczej w ostatnich latach. Od początku 2025 r. przewoźnicy mają obowiązek stosować 2 proc. SAF w mieszance paliwa lotniczego, aby obniżać emisje dwutlenku węgla. Nadal jest jednak problem z jego zdobyciem. Międzynarodowe Zrzeszenie Przewoźników Powietrznych IATA zwraca uwagę, że choć jest obowiązek jego stosowania, nie ma zachęt do zwiększenia produkcji przez koncerny paliwowe.

- Od pierwszego lotu braci Wright nastąpił fantastyczny rozwój lotnictwa. Zaledwie 60 lat dzieli go od Boeinga 707. Ale przełomowe technologie skończyły się 60 lat temu. Jeśli spojrzeć na 1960 i 2025 rok, to samoloty wyglądają tak samo. Oczywiście są znacznie bezpieczniejsze, wydajniejsze, zużywają mniej paliwa i są cichsze. Mamy jednak problem z CO2, więc oczywiste jest, że musimy zacząć od nowa. Czy SAF jest przełomem? Nie. To sposób na kontynuowanie optymalizacji i samoloty dokładnie takie jak teraz - mówił Bertrand Piccard.

Jeśli nie zużyty olej kuchenny, to co?

Zamiana konwencjonalnego paliwa lotniczego na SAF może pozwolić na obniżenie emisji dwutlenku węgla w tej gałęzi transportu o 70-80 proc. Skąd bierze się ""magia"" zrównoważonego paliwa lotniczego? Jak już pisaliśmy w money.pl, z matematyki.

- Podczas spalania emisja CO2 jest taka sama jak w przypadku paliwa kopalnego. Jednak w przypadku paliw kopalnych pobieramy surowiec z ziemi i uwalniamy dwutlenek węgla do atmosfery. W przypadku SAF surowiec już go pochłonął z atmosfery (tak jest w przypadku zużytego oleju spożywczego), więc mimo uwolnienia dwutlenku węgla w procesie spalania, nie dodaje żadnego ""nowego"" CO2 do atmosfery - tłumaczy Marjan Rozemeijer z KLM, w odpowiedzi na pytania Money.pl.

Dlatego Bertrand Piccard uważa, że SAF nie jest wcale najlepszym rozwiązaniem.

Wychwytujemy CO2 z oleju spożywczego, odpadów, starego plastiku, czegokolwiek. Zamieniamy go w paliwo i emitujemy z powrotem do atmosfery. W pewnym sensie jest więc neutralne, ale z drugiej strony może być negatywne. Mając dwutlenek węgla w swoich rękach można go umieścić w ziemi, gdziekolwiek, byle nie w atmosferze - przekonywał w Tuluzie.

Podczas wystąpienia w Tuluzie wskazał również na inne rozwiązania, które już dziś mogą pozwolić na dalszy rozwój lotnictwa cywilnego na masową skalę, a równocześnie przysłużyć się klimatowi i środowisku. Mimo to jednak nie są stosowane.

- Jeśli wykonujesz stałe podejście do lądowania (ang. continuous descent approach, CDA), zamiast robić to ""schodkami"", to jeden Boeing 747 oszczędza tonę paliwa lotniczego na każde takie lądowanie. Można latać nad oceanami w eskadrach, dokładnie tak jak robią to ptaki. Daje to oszczędność 20-30 proc. paliwa. Można mieć bezpośrednie trasy z punktu A do punktu B. Ale każdy kraj chce mieć możliwość wystawiania faktur liniom lotniczym za żeglugę powietrzną po drodze. Więc jest to problem polityczny - mówił Piccard.

Kim jest Bertrand Piccard? Pionier lotnictwa w XXI wieku

Bertrand Piccard to 67-letni szwajcarski lekarz psychiatra i podróżnik. Jego ojciec jako pierwszy zbadał dno Rowu Mariańskiego, dziadek - konstruował batyskafy i balony stratosferyczne. W 1999 r. Bertrand Piccard wraz z Brianem Jonesem w 15 dni okrążyli Ziemię balonem bez międzylądowania. W 2003 r. razem z André Borschbergiem (pilotem) zainaugurowali projekt Solar Impulse, który doprowadził do budowy samolotu słonecznego. Już w 2010 r. wykonał on 26-godzinny nieprzerwany lot, również w nocy. Pięć lat później nowsza wersja - Solar Impulse 2 okrążyła świat, startując z Abu Dhabi. Najdłuższy etap tej podróży trwał 118 godzin.

Dwie godziny do Sydney? ""To jest możliwe""

- Gdy leciałem dookoła świata samolotem napędzanym energią słoneczną, był to samolot elektryczny z bateriami. I zauważyliśmy, że potrzeba 36 kg baterii, aby uzyskać odpowiednik 1 kg nafty lotniczej. To niezbyt optymistyczne. Silnik elektryczny jest trzy razy bardziej wydajny niż silnik cieplny. Potrzebujesz tej samej ilości energii, aby pokonać trzy razy większą odległość. Myślę, że to wodór jest dziś szansą na kolejny przełom technologiczny w lotnictwie - podkreślił Piccard w Tuluzie.

Obecnie tworzy projekt Climate Impulse - w 2028 r. chce ponownie wyruszyć w 9-dniowy lot dookoła świata zupełnie nowym samolotem zeroemisyjnym. Tym razem na wodór. Procent zaawansowania budowy swojego samolotu określił na 30 proc.

- Jeśli wyobrazimy sobie następny krok, to będzie to samolot z setką pasażerów, ciekłym wodorem i ciekłym tlenem, dokładnie jak w rakietach Ariane. Wystartuje z Tuluzy, osiągnie wysokość 100 km, po 15 minutach wyłączy silnik, lecąc parabolicznie w locie suborbitalnym i dotrze do Sydney w ciągu dwóch godzin. To właśnie jest wodór. Pewnie trudno będzie polecieć tak z Paryża do Londynu, ale dalekie podróże się zmienią - wyjaśniał.

Moja praca zakończy się w 2028 r. Bo pionierzy potrzebni są na początku, aby otworzyć drogę. Ale wtedy zacznie się wasza praca [zwrócił się do szefostwa Airbusa - przyp. red.], aby to zaistniało na poziomie komercyjnym. To jest możliwe - przekonywał Piccard.

Abschließend werden die vielversprechendsten Kandidaten unter realen Bedingungen im Flugzeug getestet. Dabei geht es nicht nur um die reine CO₂-Bilanz, sondern auch um Wechselwirkungen mit bestehenden Triebwerken, die Bildung von Stickoxiden oder Rußpartikeln sowie die Frage, wie sich die Kraftstoffe langfristig auf Wartung und Sicherheit auswirken.

Embraer is currently one of the leading aircraft manufacturers in the world; specializing in the production of commercial passenger aircraft, military aircraft and agricultural aircraft.

In 2024, Embraer will have about 24,000 employees, operating in 80 countries around the world, with revenue of about 6.4 billion USD.

Previously, during his official visit to Brazil (September 2023), Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh visited Embraer's aircraft manufacturing plant and worked with President Francisco Gomes Neto in Brazil. On the occasion of attending the G20 Summit in Brazil (November 2024), the Prime Minister also received the Global Vice President of Embraer Group.

Embraer aircraft (E190) has been certified by the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam to be allowed to operate in Vietnam since December 2020. In December 2024, Embraer brought a number of military aircraft (C-390 Millennium multi-role transport) to participate in the Vietnam Defense Exhibition. Currently, Embraer and Vietnamese airlines are promoting aircraft purchase contracts.

Pleased to meet again with Mr. Francisco Gomes Neto, President of Embraer Group, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh hopes that Embraer's relationship with Vietnam will become increasingly closer and more effective, in the spirit of unlimited cooperation between the two countries.

The Prime Minister said that with a dynamically developing economy, Vietnam currently has great potential and growing demand in the aviation sector; identifying the aviation and aerospace industry as playing an important role in exploiting new development spaces, including outer space.

Specifically, the Prime Minister suggested that Embraer cooperate with Vietnamese partners to produce aviation equipment, contributing to the development of the aviation industry through the transfer of modern technology, training of high-quality human resources, technical support and experience exchange.

Along with that, cooperate in providing aircraft at preferential prices, cooperate in building aircraft maintenance and repair service centers; research and develop renewable and sustainable aviation fuel, implement emission reduction measures, and promote greening the aviation industry.

The Prime Minister requested relevant agencies and partners to promptly carry out procedures according to regulations to effectively implement projects, contributing to concretizing high-level agreements during President Lula da Silva's visit to Vietnam, making the aviation industry a breakthrough cooperation field in the bilateral relations in the coming time.

The Prime Minister affirmed that the Vietnamese Government is committed to always accompanying and sharing with businesses, ensuring that businesses operate legally, healthily and effectively.

For his part, Mr. Francisco Gomes Neto sincerely thanked the Prime Minister for taking the time to meet him; said that Embraer highly appreciated the opportunity for cooperation and was very pleased to contribute to the development of Vietnam; wanted to introduce modern aircraft lines as well as cooperate in deploying aviation services.

Informing the Prime Minister about the activities and exchanges with Vietnamese partners during the visit, the Embraer Chairman said he is ready to work with Vietnamese partners to promote cooperation in the areas mentioned by the Prime Minister.

“We believe that climate risk and the opportunities around the energy transition are one of the most significantly mispriced financial risks in the markets today,” he said.
“We think about the impact of decarbonisation and climate risk on the companies that we’re providing capital to.
“And boy, climate change will create real problems.","Six major US banks — including JP Morgan, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs — left the Net Zero Banking Alliance in January on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration as US president. Four Canadian banks followed, along with Macquarie, the Australian financial powerhouse, and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group from Japan.

• JPMorgan is latest lender to walk out of net zero banking group

Net zero, it seems, is in full retreat, with the Trump edict of “drill, baby, drill” ringing in its ears. And this is not just a US phenomenon. Friedrich Merz won the German election last month with an attack on his predecessor’s green policies, while Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has decided that the UK’s 2050 net-zero target is “impossible” to achieve without bankrupting the UK. Even Rachel Reeves, who once claimed an ambition to become Britain’s “first green chancellor”, said in January that growth “trumps” net zero as she backed the expansion of Heathrow.

Corporations the world over have read the mood music and are dancing to the new tune. In the past few weeks, BP has slashed investment in its renewable energy business and announced a scale-up of oil production; HSBC has moved its net-zero target back by 20 years; and even Bill Gates, a prophet of corporate environmentalism, has cut staff as he slims down his climate group Breakthrough Energy.

There was a time, not so long ago, when every corporation was desperate to crow about its green credentials, leading to accusations of “greenwashing”. Nowadays, any talk of CSR (corporate social responsibility), DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) or ESG (environmental, social and governance) is taboo. We have entered a new era of “greenhushing”.

“Companies are scared to talk about ESG, and particularly scared to talk about the positive impact they’re having on the world,” said Sebastian Leape, chief executive at Natcap, an Oxford University spin-out that measures and assesses companies’ interactions with nature.

It is no wonder they are fearful. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has threatened a clampdown on ESG-related activism by investors, with many fearing litigation.

The quandary facing global businesses is revealed in a section of the latest annual report by HSBC bank, published last month, where it admitted: “Our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our decision to participate, or not to participate, in certain projects perceived to be associated with causing or exacerbating climate change.”

When it comes to acting on climate change, in other words, it is a matter of damned if you do, damned if you don’t.

This contradiction is made all the more acute by the coincidence of the great green rollback with a series of events that have graphically illustrated what a significant force climate change can be. With temperatures last year breaching the totemic 1.5C threshold above pre-industrial temperatures, and the Los Angeles fires and Valencia floods raising the profile of environmental disasters even higher, many corporations are quietly taking the issue far more seriously than they have in the past.

Meanwhile coffee prices hit a record high of $4.34 per pound last month, up more than double in a year after droughts in Vietnam and Brazil and flooding in Indonesia. Cocoa prices have also soared after production fell 14 per cent last year due to similar unpredictable weather patterns. In England, farmers had their second-worst harvest since 1983 last year, following the wettest 18-month spell since records began.

Insurers also have a first-hand view of the impact of climate change. Lloyd’s of London put its losses from the California wildfires at $2.3 billion (£1.8 billion). According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), a record £585 million was paid out for weather-related damage to homes and possessions in the UK last year.

Alison Taylor, clinical associate professor at New York University Stern School of Business, said: “We will perhaps see a shift away from climate as a consumer-facing poster child, which treats this topic as marketing. But anyone sourcing food, for example, is going to have to take this seriously because it’s not just a matter of corporate virtue signalling.”

JP Morgan — one of the very banks to have pulled out of Carney’s green banking alliance — published a report in February on “navigating the new climate era”. The company, where former Labour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna is global head of sustainable solutions, said success in a warming world “hinges on our ability to integrate climate considerations into daily decision-making”. It added: “Those who adapt will lead, while others risk falling behind.”

HSBC last month made headlines with its noisy pushback of its net-zero operations target from 2030 to 2050. But the bank — where Sir Danny Alexander, former Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, is head of infrastructure finance — also quietly revealed that it has increased its investment in the climate transition, with $99 billion invested in sustainable finance in the past year alone, double the $44 billion it spent in 2020.

Recent projects backed by HSBC include a wind-power manufacturing plant in Teesside, sustainable aviation fuel in Hong Kong and low-carbon clothing manufacture in India. All corporate credit applications and reviews at the bank now require an assessment of “climate risk factors”.

Will Evison, sustainability strategy director at the professional services firm PwC, said: “I’m OK with companies taking meaningful action, rather than just shouting about it. The level of action now, on both the climate and the nature transition, is fundamentally far greater than it was even a few years ago.”

Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions for the asset management division of insurer Legal & General, said fund managers still take climate risk seriously when making investment decisions. “We believe that climate risk and the opportunities around the energy transition are one of the most significantly mispriced financial risks in the markets today,” he said.

“We think about the impact of decarbonisation and climate risk on the companies that we’re providing capital to. But we also think about the inverse of that … how good a job those companies are doing of leaning into the financial opportunities that the energy transition is going to create for them.”

One company seeking solutions is Bayer, the German biotech giant. “Our teams are looking into crops that can adapt to extreme weather,” said Matthias Berninger, Bayer’s head of public affairs, sustainability and safety. They are developing short-stem corn that is better able to survive storms, and rice that requires less water to grow.

“Rice is the number one staple food — 3.5 billion humans depend on it,” Berninger said. “Can we grow it with 30 or 40 per cent less water? We are also looking at crops better able to withstand insect pressures and fungal infections.”

Leape at Natcap said this attitude encapsulates the current mood among those engaging in sustainability. “It’s about self-interest. Companies are really engaging in this agenda, not because it’s politically correct but because it’s critical to achieving their business goals.”

Others, however, are using the political backlash against net zero to jettison targets that they never thought were feasible in the first place. Taylor at Stern School of Business said: “There was a consensus [in the past] that what companies should do was to set really ambitious goals they weren’t sure they were going to achieve, and try and bring other institutions along. There is now a collective realisation that they’re not going to meet those goals.

“So in that sense. the Trump crackdown comes at a very convenient time and allows a lot of companies to try and drop these issues.”

But there is a drawback to this approach, Taylor noted: “Everybody is at risk of looking like they shift in the breeze depending on who’s in power, and that they have no meaningful commitment to anything. And there is even more of a risk of alienating young employees and consumers.”

David Craig, founder of analytics provider Refinitiv and co-chair of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), believes that the backlash against corporate sustainability initiatives had been building for a while. “The sustainability community is slightly guilty, possibly, of focusing too much on top-down targets,” he said.

But Craig added that there had been a shift in mindset. “The corporate social responsibility model was ‘let’s do a few good things and show the world that we’re making up for some of the harm’. The mindset now is that this is core to the business and its resilience. Companies realise that if they do run out of natural materials or water, for example, they can’t run their factory any more.”

Berninger at Bayer put it a different way. “My very conservative, very traditional view is that businesses make money when they solve real problems,” he said. “And boy, climate change will create real problems.

“Businesses that invest in solving the problems will have a better prospect than those that do not.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fe2a88c88-fc94-4cde-bc2e-b3e7fc0e4e5a.jpg?crop=3072%2C1728%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-03-29 11:56:13.832817

Why not leave the Labour Party?
Mr Findlay, who supported the Better Together campaign in 2014, has at least had the decency to resign from the Labour Party, if for no other reason than to salve his conscience.","A significant part of the problem is our national debt. As Mark McGeoghegan points out (“This Labour government is devoid of the courage or ingenuity to meet today’s crises”, The Herald, March 28), it’s almost 100% of GDP, four times what it was in 1990. Interest payments on that debt will be over £100 billion this year, 8% of government spending; five years ago, when interest rates were low, the figure was £25 billion. We’ve maxed out the national credit card and are now at the mercy of the money markets.

It's not going to be easy to escape this dilemma. Austerity, as imposed by Rachel Reeves, won’t help; nor will borrowing more. A partial solution is offered in a report by the Wealth Tax Commission, which suggests a time-limited wealth tax would raise £260 billion if set at the rate of 1% for five years on those individuals with net assets of £500,000 or more (ie £1 million for a couple). That doesn’t sound over arduous when you consider the situation we’re in.

Beyond that, as a country we’re going to have to learn to live within our means. With an ageing population, spending on the NHS and social care is only going to increase at rates above inflation, and most other government departments are already cut to the bone. We’re going to have to accept that, if we want good public services, we’ll have to pay a bit more tax. Tax is often referred to as a burden, but it’s really the fee we pay to live in a decent society.

We’re also going to have to consider whether we can afford some of the freebies and subsidies currently offered universally, and that may include university tuition.

Doug Maughan, Dunblane.

Why not leave the Labour Party?

A few days before Polling Day at the 1983 UK General Election Neil Kinnock, then Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, made his famous ""I warn you"" speech in which he cautioned voters about the consequences of another Tory victory and the return of Margaret Thatcher. Kinnock's closing words in that speech were: ""I warn you not to fall ill. I warn you not to grow old."" After witnessing the actions of Rachel Reeves since the Labour Party came to power only eight months ago, those warning words of Neil Kinnock from 1983 now ring very hollow. Like many older Scottish voters I never thought we would see the day when a Labour Party Chancellor of the Exchequer would take actions to jeopardise the welfare of vulnerable people to the extent that even Margaret Thatcher herself might have thought was unacceptable.

More interesting however have been the reactions of Labour politicians to what has been taking place. In Scotland we have their leader at Holyrood, Anas Sarwar, staying silent on the matters concerned, as if trying to pretend that they weren't happening. Then we have a group of their Scottish MPs, apparently led by former Better Together campaign leader Blair McDougall, actually voting in favour of Ms Reeves' actions at Westminster. For their benefit I would advise them that proposals to withdraw the winter fuel payment from pensioners and then to cut payments to the sick and disabled did not appear on their party's manifesto prior to last July's election.

Finally, we have the other extreme in Scotland where the criticism of Labour's actions from two of their worthies, former MSP Neil Findlay and Brian Leishman MP, has been quite virulent. Mr Findlay, who supported the Better Together campaign in 2014, has at least had the decency to resign from the Labour Party, if for no other reason than to salve his conscience. Mr Leishman, on the other hand, has done plenty of well-publicised moaning from the sidelines, but little else. My question to Mr Leishman would be that if he is so opposed to the harm that his party is doing, why does he continue to remain a part of it?

• Ian Murray (""With the SNP unfit to handle money wisely, Labour will deliver renewal"", The Herald, March 27) says “but we are doing it [sound financial management] in a fair way, asking those with the broadest shoulders to pay their fair share, while protecting the most vulnerable”.

Surely such a cap-doffing hack as Ian Murray doesn’t really believe this? Has he been accepting too many tickets to fortune teller events? Sheer fantasy.

We should not subsidise rail

I agree with Mark Smith (""The £200m that’s being wasted on the wrong train line. Time for a rethink on rail policy"", The Herald, March 24) that money should not be spent on reducing train times between Glasgow and Aberdeen but disagree that it should be used to build new railways. There are excellent bus services between Aberdeen, Peterhead and Fraserburgh and no need for a train service.

He refers to the many new homes built near the Borders Railway but these are within the Edinburgh journey-to-work area. This means that many trains are heavily used for under four hours daily. That is a loss-making situation requiring public subsidies.

Already UK residents, only 30% of whom often use trains, pay £200 billion a year to subsidise them without being consulted. That is entirely undemocratic.Why should people in say, Newton Stewart, Kelso and Stornoway pay to build and run railways in Aberdeenshire or elsewhere any more than they should pay to provide parks there? In many countries there has long been a policy of requiring users to pay the costs of train services. That should be the case here.

There are far better ways of creating wealth and reducing inequality by using public money. Max Wiszniewski (""Scotland’s Land Reform Bill is broken, but there is a foolproof way to fix it"", The Herald, March 24) describes one of them: through land reform. It does not require spending huge amounts of taxpayers' money on infrastructure to benefit a tiny minority.

There are many other opportunities. Many more people who are rarely heard from should be better informed of possibilities and encouraged to make a case for providing these through cost-benefit analysis. It would be far better to have a large number of small projects which can be soon implemented than a few very costly showy ones which could take ages to implement and may become disasters like HS2.

Policies should not be mainly under the control of narrow self-serving interest groups who want others to fund their pet projects.

Alan Mathieson, Perth.

This fuel is a green smokescreen

The fire at one of the substations that provides power to Heathrow provided a reminder of the many hundreds of flights that the airport handles every day. Chancellor Reeves justified the recent Government announcement supporting a series of airport expansions by stating that ""sustainable aviation fuel"" (SAF) was a ""game changer"" that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70 per cent. Currently the UK is committed to a 2% SAF content in aviation kerosene and is providing £63 million to boost production. To date this is predominantly derived from used cooking oil, 80% of which is imported from China and Malaysia.

It is planned that the SAF content will increase to 22% by 2040 by which time it is forecast that passenger numbers will have doubled, equating globally to 200,000 flights day consuming over 18 million barrels of aviation fuel. This will necessitate the use of multiple sources of feedstock such as municipal waste, sewage and a vast area of land dedicated to growing bioenergy crops. These are already grown on a massive scale to provide the E10 element in the petrol, thus further reducing the area of land available for growing food.

Alternatively SAF could be produced in the form of green hydrogen but this would require up to 3.4 times more wind and solar capacity than at present. Clearly the Chancellor has not taken the trouble to read the report from the Royal Society which concludes that this course of action could be up to 69% more carbon-intensive than using standard kerosene jet fuel and could result in ""unacceptable collateral ecological damage"". Airline operators may be keen to be seen as environmentally responsible but in reality they and the Chancellor are hiding behind another green smokescreen that fails to stand up to robust scrutiny.

Neil J Bryce, Kelso.

• Rather than worry about sustainable aviation fuel, why not do a proper problem-solving exercise and find out why there has been such an increase in air travel, despite the advent of instant electronic global communication?

Such an exercise might reveal the true situation, and the correct answer, rather than a knee-jerk response that could be wrong.

The philosopher AC Grayling said that the major reason for the continuance of religious belief in a world which might otherwise have long moved beyond it is indoctrination of children before they reach the age of reason. Norwood Primary School in Eastleigh, Hants, has sent a letter to parents and carers informing them that the Easter Service would not be held this year ""in the spirit of inclusivity and respect for the diverse religious beliefs represented within our school community"".

We live in a multi-racial, multi-cultural, principally secular society. By educating children from all backgrounds together, without emphasis on any particular religion, there is a far greater chance of mutual understanding and personal friendships. Enthusiasts of all faiths oppose secular education because exposure to other traditions has the effect of loosening the grip of their own. The steady move away from Christianity in this country may be traced to a number of factors: education, apathy, immigration and the well-documented incidence of paedophilia and child molestation among some Christian clerics. Christianity should have its privileged position in our schools removed. Religion-free morals – which predate by centuries their Christian counterparts – are freely available.

Prioritizing fuel efficiency in aircraft design Plane makers are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
Electric aircraft may contribute to these advancements, with Airbus developing a hydrogen-based aircraft to reduce carbon emissions by up to 100%.","Fuel economy in air transport is achieved through the efficiency of the aircraft and engine model combined with airline efficiency factors like seating configuration and loading factor. This makes commercial airlines look to operate advanced fuel-efficient planes, which advance profitability and produce fewer emissions, including carbon dioxide, which is a major contributor to climate change.

In terms of fuel efficiency, the leading long haul aircraft is the Airbus A330neo widebody aircraft, offering the lowest operating cost and fuel consumption per seat, equal to 2.1 liters per passenger per 100 kilometers. This means that, on average, an A330neo consumes 2.1 liters of fuel to transport one passenger over a distance of 100 kilometers. It measures fuel efficiency on passenger transport, indicating a fuel-efficient aircraft or operation.

This is compared to 8–9 liters per 100 kilometers for a mid-sized SUV. With 4 passengers, this becomes 2–2.25 liters per 100 kilometers per passenger, which is favorable to the aircraft.

The most fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft

The A330neo is the most fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft in 2025. Thanks to its winning engine-airframe combination, it delivers a 25% lower fuel burn for operators in commercial aviation. It is the first aircraft to be certified by EASA for ICAO’s new CO2 emissions standard, confirming its ability to comply with future environmental regulations. The first A330neo was delivered to TAP Air Portugal on 15 May 2018.

Its versatility makes it suitable for various short and long-haul routes, maximizing efficiency in different operational environments. According to Airbus, the A330neo offers a 25% reduction in fuel burn per seat and 25% lower maintenance costs, including longer check intervals and fewer fatigue tasks. In 2024, Airbus received 82 orders for the A330, indicating a continued interest in the aircraft without any order cancelations.

On November 29, 2024, Airbus delivered its first A330neo to Malaysia Airlines . The aircraft features a premium two-class layout with 297 seats, 28 fully flat business class suites, and an all-new 269 Economy seats. Virgin Atlantic's neos, received in July 2022, is configured with 262 seats—156 in standard economy, 28 in Economy Delight, 46 in Premium economy, and 32 in Upper Class, including the two Retreat Suites.

According to Malaysian Airlines, the A330neo flies daily to Melbourne effective 18 March 2025, with four weekly flights to Auckland effective 13 March 2025 and three weekly flights to Bali effective 16 March 2025 in a truly Malaysian interior.

More fuel-efficient long-haul leading aircraft

When comparing the most fuel-efficient advanced Airbus and Boeing aircraft models, according to i6, an expert group in aviation operations—Boeing B787-10, Airbus A350-1000, Boeing B787-8, and Airbus A350-900 rank at the top level. However, each is tailored for specific operational needs, blending efficiency, range, and capacity in unique ways.

The Boeing B787-9 and -10 place as the second most fuel-efficient modern aircraft, combined with the flexibility of a mid-sized seating capacity, makes it an excellent choice for long-haul routes with moderate demand. Boeing B787-9 key data are:

Fuel Efficiency: 2.31 L/100km per passenger.

Seating Capacity (multi-class layout): 290 passengers

Range: 8,787 miles (14,140 km).

Fuel Capacity: 126,372 liters (33,385 gallons).

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner , powered by the Trent 1000, is 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Boeing 767. Rolls-Royce aims to remain a leader in widebody commercial aircraft engines. The engine offers the highest bypass ratio (10:1) of any Trent engine, with a more stable operating cycle.

The Boeing B787-10 features 2.31 L/100km per passenger, marginally edging out both Airbus A350 models, which share 2.39 Liters. The Boeing B787-8, while an earlier-generation model, lags slightly at 2.77 L/100km per PAX. These efficiency figures can greatly influence operating costs, especially on long-haul routes, making the B787-10 particularly attractive for commercial air carriers.

Seating capacity showcases the adaptability of these aircraft. The Airbus A350-1000 accommodates the most passengers (350 in a multi-class layout), followed by the Airbus A350-900 (315), Boeing B787-10 (330), and the smaller Boeing B787-8 (242). Airlines looking to serve high-demand routes might favor the A350-1000's larger capacity, while the B787-8’s reduced size suits thinner routes with less demand.

The Airbus A350-900 and the A350-1000 are powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 and Trent XWB-97, respectively, two new-generation high-thrust engines. The Trent XWB-84, with 84,000lb thrust, is set to improve fuel and CO2 efficiency by 1%, while the Trent XWB-97, with 97,000lb thrust, is the only new-generation high-thrust engine in service since 2018, enhancing durability and efficiency.

Regarding the flying range, the Airbus A350-1000 boasts the longest range at 7,400 miles, while the A350-900 also excels at 9,522 mi. This difference underscores how the A350 series is optimized for ultra-long-haul travel, whereas the B787-10 is better suited for mid- to long-haul routes.

Prioritizing fuel efficiency in aircraft design

Plane makers are committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. They invest heavily in research and development, collaborate with governments and industry partners, and explore revolutionary technologies to make aviation more sustainable.

These manufacturers incorporate lightweight composite materials, such as the A350, which is made of up to 54% composites. These materials reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. In addition, advanced digital tools are used to optimize aircraft design and production, ensuring efficiency throughout the lifecycle.

Engine manufacturers play an important role in developing advanced engines like the GE9X for the 777X , which offers 10% lower fuel consumption and is actively compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel SAF. Governments also enhance fuel-efficient practical solutions to help achieve net-zero emissions. These aircraft reflect a blend of cutting-edge engineering and strategic design, highlighting the ongoing evolution of commercial aviation.

""The development of more efficient aircraft and engines. Particularly important are the steps needed to enable aircraft powered by 100% SAF, hydrogen or batteries,"" according to IATA.

The critical role of fuel efficiency in the industry

Aviation is vital for individual and economic prosperity, and strengthening profitability and financial resilience is crucial. With over five billion air travelers, the demand for air travel is strong, and as the global economy relies on air cargo for $8.3 trillion in trade, the aviation industry plays a crucial role in facilitating both passenger and freight movement.

Aviation innovation is advancing with the potential for fuel efficiency improvements. Electric aircraft may contribute to these advancements, with Airbus developing a hydrogen-based aircraft to reduce carbon emissions by up to 100%. Additionally, maintenance can also save fuel by reducing fuel consumption and flexible wing design technology allows wings to adjust shape dynamically, reducing air resistance.

At the same time, airlines seek to boost their profitability, reaching a net profit of about $30.5 billion in 2024. That's why fuel efficiency management is vital for the carrier's continuity. Fuel costs represent about one-third of airlines' operating expenses, and cumulative fuel spending is expected to be $248 billion in 2025. Fuel is expected to account for 26.4% of operating costs in 2025, down from 28.9% in 2024.

The good news is that the industry is experiencing steady technological and operational advancements in fuel efficiency (liter/100 ATK) and fuel consumption (liter/100 km/passenger) developed from 2023 to 2025. With 23.1 fuel efficiency in terms of an airline's transport capacity, fuel efficiency is relatively stable and slightly lower at 4.1 Fuel consumption per passenger per 100 kilometers.

""We’re expecting airlines to deliver a global profit of $36.6 billion in 2025. This will be hard-earned as airlines take advantage of lower oil prices while keeping load factors above 83%, tightly controlling costs, investing in decarbonization,"" said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

This suggests that airlines are optimizing their operations or adopting more efficient aircraft, enhancing the global airline industry's performance. Simultaneously, this will subsidize investments in products and sustainable solutions to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-2-19.png,N,,2025-03-29 10:56:13.910878

Santo Domingo.- Alrededor de 150 representantes de 24 países participan en la conferencia “Combustible y sostenibilidad”, que organiza la Asociación Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Transporte Aéreo (ALTA, por sus siglas en inglés), en la que abordan temas cruciales sobre las iniciativas locales y regionales en materia de combustibles sostenibles para la aviación.

Durante cinco días, las misiones nacionales e internacionales que velan por un sistema aéreo libre de contaminación ambiental debatirán interesantes tópicos encaminados a encontrar soluciones que permitan avanzar hacia el futuro de la aviación sostenible.

En ese sentido, el director general del Instituto Dominicano de Aviación Civil (IDAC), Igor Rodríguez Durán en su calidad de anfitrión del encuentro internacional, resaltó la importancia de este tipo de reuniones en los que los Estados discuten y encuentran soluciones a los asuntos que afectan la industria aeronáutica de los países involucrados.

“En la República Dominicana, a través del IDAC, estamos comprometidos con la preservación del medioambiente, el desarrollo sostenible y, por supuesto, la seguridad de la aviación. Nuestro interés es que, durante esta jornada de reuniones, podamos encontrar soluciones que nos permitan avanzar hacia el futuro de la aviación sostenible”, indicó Igor Rodríguez Durán.

El titular del IDAC destacó la importancia de esta conferencia sobre esta reunión, por los avances y la visión global colectiva y ambiciosa que representa, con el objetivo de reducir las emisiones de CO2 en la aviación internacional mediante el uso de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, por sus siglas en inglés) y otros combustibles sostenibles y energías limpias, cuya meta es reducir las emisiones en un 5% para 2030, un compromiso clave para el futuro de la aviación.

Asimismo, José Ricardo Botelho, quien preside la conferencia en representación de Peter Cerdá, CEO y presidente de ALTA, aportó datos interesantes, como que entre 2011 y 2023, el consumo de combustible de las aerolíneas de América Latina y el Caribe, por cada 100 RPK (Pasajeros-Kilómetros Recorridos) disminuyó un 28% gracias a la renovación de flotas, mejoras operativas y la adopción de nuevas tecnologías.

Botelho añadió que las aerolíneas miembros de ALTA han reducido la edad promedio de sus flotas en un 18%, lo que les ha permitido aprovechar los beneficios de los aviones de última generación, que consumen entre un 15% y un 20% menos de combustible.

“América Latina y el Caribe es una de las regiones que menos contribuye a las emisiones globales de CO2 en la aviación. En 2023, las emisiones globales de la industria alcanzaron aproximadamente 867 millones de toneladas, de las cuales solo el 2.6% correspondieron a Brasil y México, los dos únicos países de la región entre los 25 con mayores emisiones de CO2 derivadas de la aviación”, puntualizó.

En sesión de apertura de la conferencia “Combustible y sostenibilidad”, que organiza la Asociación Latinoamericana y del Caribe de Transporte Aéreo (ALTA, por sus siglas en inglés) participaron, además de Botelho y Rodríguez Durán, Paola Aimée Plá Puello, subdirectora General del IDAC; Miguel Mejía, subdirector-Director de Desarrollo Sustentable del IDAC; Noel Báez, viceministro de Hidrocarburos, en representación de Joel Santos, ministro de Energía y Minas Joel Santos.

Relevance of the Topic: Prelims: Key facts about Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF); Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF)

ATF is a type of aviation fuel designed for use in aircrafts and jet engines.

Constituents: Jet fuel is a mixture of a variety of hydrocarbons. The most common ATF is Kerosene-type jet fuel.

Concerns:

Price-sensitive: The price of ATF is a major component of the operating cost of airlines, and the tax on ATF significantly contributes to the ATF price. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has long advocated for bringing ATF under GST (Goods and Services Tax) to eliminate tax disadvantages faced by domestic airlines compared to foreign carriers.

Environmental pollution: ATF combustion in aircraft engines releases various pollutants like Nitrogen oxides, Carbon monoxide, Particulate matter etc. leading to ozone layer depletion and global warming.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is a biofuel alternative to conventional jet fuel with a smaller carbon footprint.

It can be blended with conventional jet fuel (with blending limits ranging 1%-50%).

Sources of SAF:

Oil seeds, other fats, oils, and greases

Residues- agricultural, forestry residues, wood mill waste

Wastes- municipal solid waste, sludge and wet waste

Produced synthetically by capturing carbon directly from the air.

Advantages:

Engine compatibility: can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure.

Fewer emissions: 100% (pure) SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway.

Sustainable: SAF feedstock does not compete with food crops, neither causes forest degradation.

Challenge:

Expensive: SAF is about four times more expensive than petroleum jet fuel.

SAF indicative blending Target:

In 2022, members of the International Civil Aviation Organisation had agreed to a long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from aviation by 2050, and SAF has long been seen as the industry's fastest way to reduce emissions.

In 2023, Indian government has set the following initial indicative blending percentages of SAF in ATF:

1% SAF indicative blending target in 2027 (Initially for International flights).

2% SAF blending target in 2028 (Initially for International flights )

5% by 2030.

The success of SAF will require using a greater diversity of feedstock and production methods. This includes areas such as investing in carbon offset programmes and the diversification of SAF feedstocks.",https://i0.wp.com/compass.rauias.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-109.png,N,,2025-03-29 11:56:18.680535

A portfolio of that size is expected to keep Shell ahead of TotalEnergies, despite the French major’s own ambition to grow its LNG business by more than 50% by the end of this decade.
Shell has opted not to match the oil ambitions of its supermajor rivals, which all guide for growth this decade.
""The one big asset that Shell has that doesn’t get enough credit [or] awareness is the formidable trading business,"" says Panmure Liberum analyst Ashley Kelty.
“We do not believe we are the natural owners of this chemicals portfolio,” given lack of scale in some areas and competing opportunities across the company for capital, Sawan said.","Shell cemented its two-year strategic turnaround at this week’s Capital Markets Day (CMD) in New York, largely sidelining its low-carbon spending and embracing an industry-leading LNG portfolio as its new, streamlined transition strategy. The decision — made in the name of returns — promises bumper cash flows that can support years of increased buybacks, crystallizing the sector’s wider embrace of near-term shareholder returns over long-term strategic change. Here are four key takeaways from Shell’s latest strategy update.

• Shell insists LNG will be a strategic ""winner,"" no matter how the world transitions.

Shell is hardly alone in its bullish views on LNG, but its singular bet on the fuel to drive its production growth this decade stands out from its peers. At the Mar. 25 CMD, Sawan underlined that making and trading more LNG will be Shell's biggest contribution to the energy transition over the next decade, tipping the fuel to be a ""winner"" no matter which of Shell's future energy scenarios turns out to be most accurate. The company’s recent baseline industry outlook forecasts a roughly 60% increase in global LNG demand by 2040, fuelled by Asian economic growth and rising electricity consumption for artificial intelligence.

Integrated Gas — the first of three ""great franchise businesses"" Sawan chose to highlight — will consequently claim a 27%-30% share of capex over 2025-28. Already the leading Western LNG player, Shell had 29 million tons of liquefaction volumes to its name last year, and capacity is set to increase by almost one-third in the next few years, Sawan said. Upcoming projects include Nigeria, Qatar, Abu Dhabi and the first 14 million ton per year phase of LNG Canada, which will start up later this year.

Wider LNG sales from both equity and offtake positions will meanwhile grow at 4%-5% per year, giving it some 83 million-88 million tons in 2030. A portfolio of that size is expected to keep Shell ahead of TotalEnergies, despite the French major’s own ambition to grow its LNG business by more than 50% by the end of this decade. Later, Shell will have options such as Oman Train 4, a second phase at LNG Canada and backfill opportunities to consider should it want to chase further growth beyond 2030. Most of Shell’s sales are set to be indexed to Brent crude.

Shell will not join its peers in plotting oil growth, but insists its stable production base will remain profitable and long-lived.

Shell has opted not to match the oil ambitions of its supermajor rivals, which all guide for growth this decade. Instead, Shell is sticking with previous plans to maintain 1.4 million barrels per day of liquids output, with CFO Sinead Gorman noting that the company will still need to invest to sustain that level due to natural decline rates. Nonetheless, she insisted that there is ""no cap"" on Shell’s liquids output and noted that the guidance represented ""a view out to 2030 which is not priced in at the moment."" Shell’s guidance is premised on a $70 Brent real 2024 oil price.

To maintain this liquids base, Shell is banking on maximizing output from deepwater fields such as Sparta in the US Gulf of Mexico and the recently FID’d Gato de Mato offshore Brazil. Such projects will add more than 1 million boe/d of new capacity between now and 2030, with an estimated breakeven of $35 per barrel. The major is ""very much focused in terms of the high-margin barrels that will come through,"" Gorman said.

Overall production levels could be sustained until 2035, Sawan said, claiming the list of projects in the pipeline would allow Shell to ""build a runway through to the 2040s,"" without a lot of inorganic spending.

• Shell wants to use its trading prowess to help turn struggling businesses around.

Shell's opaque, but significant, trading business has long made material contributions to earnings in oil, gas, LNG and marketing, delivering an average 2% uplift to returns on average capital employed (ROACE) over the past decade, the company claims. With the head of trading now sitting on Shell's executive committee, the company wants to leverage its trading savvy in its power and transition businesses to help make them profitable.

""The one big asset that Shell has that doesn’t get enough credit [or] awareness is the formidable trading business,"" says Panmure Liberum analyst Ashley Kelty. ""It's up there, if not better than the likes of Vitol and Glencore — [and] makes a big impact on profits.""

Shell has identified $45 billion of capital employed that is not performing as desired, and $20 billion sits within its power and low-carbon businesses. The company wants to raise its power ROACE from 3% in 2024 to 10% by 2030, moving away from assets with infrastructure-facing returns toward assets that support trading strategies, such as gas-fired power, large-scale batteries and digital technologies. The major's recent acquisition of a 609 megawatt combined-cycle gas turbine power plant in Rhode Island is an example of this strategy in action.

Through a business model ""best described as trading-led, asset-backed,” Sawan wants to raise the share of flexible trading assets in power from 50% to 80% by 2030. Shell also plans to divest nonstrategic transition assets such as its offshore wind positions in South Korea and the Philippines, echoing BP in pursuing a “capital-light” approach to renewables.

Shell also sees big potential for trading in low-carbon fuels. The major sold 10 times more biofuels than the amount it produced last year, becoming one of the biggest traders in sustainable aviation fuel. “We want to build a profitable low-carbon fuels business for the future and we will do this by leveraging our trading and optimization capabilities to grow sales and secure sustainable feedstocks,” said Sawan, remaining bullish on the long-term outlook for biofuels, despite current headwinds.

When he took the helm, Sawan pledged to devote 15%-20% of investment toward low-carbon businesses but now wants a maximum of 10% of Shell's capital employed in those areas by the end of the decade. The outlook for carbon capture and hydrogen within Shell is particularly bleak, although they could help support its gas business.

Sawan’s returns emphasis will see a further downstream rationalization and partnerships in chemicals.

Shell, once a huge oil refiner, will now focus its refining at four big facilities: two in Europe and two in North America. ""By harvesting noncore refineries for cash, repurposing them or disposing of them, we can focus on a smaller number of high-performing facilities that generate stronger financial returns,"" Gorman explained.

Sawan confirmed Shell could sell its struggling US and European chemical assets through ""strategic and partnership opportunities” in the US and “high-grading” in Europe, where selective closures could be made. “We do not believe we are the natural owners of this chemicals portfolio,” given lack of scale in some areas and competing opportunities across the company for capital, Sawan said.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e741bb9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/900x473+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2F80%2Fed835bb342e2bfed0869bf1b7146%2Fss1801829758-logo-shell-v2.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 10:56:22.474362

Thanks, Eric. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our call. We have filed our Form 10K today and we ask that you refer to it for more detailed information after this call.

We're here to talk about our results from the fourth quarter and for the full year 2024 and to discuss the business update that we released on March 7. There's lots to talk about. We want to leave some time for questions, so let's get at it.

2024 was a big year for Gevo. It set us on a path we believe for substantial growth this year targeting positive adjusted EBITDA. We explained this in our business update and our press release earlier today, and you'll also see these ideas laid out visually in our investor presentation on our website. Please go take a look. It's pretty darn interesting.

First up, Gevo North Dakota. This acquisition in Richardton, North Dakota is a game changer for us, and it's already contributing. The site is one of the two low-carbon ethanol plants with operational carbon capture and sequestration or CCS that are operating today. It captures over 160,000 tons of biogenic carbon dioxide a year and has one of the lowest carbon intensity scores in the industry.

The CI score at Gevo North Dakota is an estimated 21 grams of CO2 equivalents per megajoule under the Argonne GREET 45Z model. That's not including any benefits for regenerative agricultural practices. That's a big deal because it means we can start monetizing carbon abatement and the 45Z tax credit immediately. We're already working on it.

This asset alone has the potential to generate $30 million to $60 million of adjusted EBITDA annually, depending upon the price of ethanol, depending upon the full values of the 45Zs and all the rest and RINs. So it's very interesting opportunity for us.

On RNG we saw a strong production growth in 2024. We're on track to produce over 400,000 million BTUs in 2025. And with the Biogas 45Z tax credit, that business is shaping up to be a solid contributor as well. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the $9 million to $18 million range in the year 2025 from this project due to operational improvements securing the provisional California Air Resources Board or CARB, net carbon intensity score, and the monetization of Biogas 45Z tax credits.

We're excited that CARB has published our comment for low carbon fuel standard pathway application, and it has a weighted CI score of around minus 339. So that's right in line with what our expectations were. I'm feeling pretty good about that, and actually, we should get that any day now.

Our South Dakota project, which we're now calling Alcohol-to-Jet 60 or ATJ-60, that means, we're talking about Alcohol-to-Jet 60 million gallons, is progressing. Last year, we received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.46 billion excluding the capitalized interest during construction from the US Department of Energy, DOE, loan program office for our ATJ-60 project.

With capitalized interest during construction, the DOE loan facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.63 billion. We're pleased with the continued collaboration with the DOE loan office as we move forward to achieve financial goals for the project.

Now, lots of questions about what happens, were there any changes during the transition for the President and his new administration? Well, like I say, we haven't seen much of a slowdown. I know I see all these press reports, but they're not correct. They didn't -- we didn't see slowdown. They're plugging away; we are plugging away to do on our end as well.

Now, one good piece of news that I can point to that isn't -- that I think is worthwhile is that at CERAWeek in Houston a couple of weeks ago, Secretary Wright said in his presentation that the DOE loan office, the LPO, would be honoring the commitments made by them. That's good because I think that was his first wide public statement of that.

We are watching the Summit pipeline issue with interest. I would like to see what Summit does next regarding the pipeline before we finalize the economics for our project. While we do have our own sequestration site with our -- up at North Dakota at our Richardton plant, we can capture the CCS, bring it there, and put it downhole and capture value from it.

We could do that, and if we went this route, the project returns for South Dakota plant would still be attractive. However, doing that transfer without a pipeline hurts by a couple of IRR points.

Now Summit tells us that they still believe strongly that the pipeline is going to get done, and I do know this that CCS and CO2 are part of the energy infrastructure. CO2 absolutely is going to be needed in North Dakota for enhanced oil recovery in the Bakken. Getting more oil out of the Bakken strikes me as a priority.

Now it takes years to build that infrastructure. So we'll see what happens here is they're going to get incorporated part of the overall energy infrastructure. I'm interested to see how this all unfolds.

We also need to pin down some tweaks to off-take agreements with airlines to make them more compatible with project financing requirements put up by -- or put on us by the DOE loan office. We want to underpin carbon value outside of the regulatory value. We're making progress on this front. We'll announce details after it's done.

Now, recall that the jet fuel is -- that we'll produce is valued as a commodity like fossil jet. It's just jet fuel. It has to be that way for it to be a drop in. Now, there certainly is a regulatory value like RINs or the state level, and we expect 45Z, okay? All good. That adds value.

In addition to that, it's this voluntary carbon value that is worthwhile. We want to make sure that we're getting paid properly for the carbon value. So we're reworking some of the contracts, some of the deals, some of the approaches to make sure that we aren't giving money away. We're working at it.

In addition to Gevo's paid-in capital as we developed this project, we're going to need to raise roughly about $800 million of equity into a special purpose vehicle whose mission is to build that plant and operate that plant. This SPV would be a project-level company that would not -- and it would not be diluted to Gevo. It's not raising money at a Gevo level. It's at a special purpose vehicle level, project level, classic project financing for the DOE loan.

We are targeting financial closes for our project level capital raise by 2025 year-end. That includes the DOE loan, our project level equity capital raising, and then the start of construction of the facility. In order for us to get to financial close, we expect that we will need to spend maybe $40 million-more of development money inclusive of the whole year of 2025 actually to get all the way to FID, so even if it's stretched further.

Once we get the financial close, we'll be off to the races building this plant in South Dakota. It'll be heavily modularized, and it wouldn't require any further capital from Gevo. That's a pretty big deal to bake into your memory.

We're also doing the engineering work for our ATJ plant at our North Dakota site. This one's on the fast track because we can leverage the work that was done for our ATJ-60. North Dakota is an extremely friendly business state. We have great ethanol plant there. We've already got CCS, and there seems to be a lot of interest in this plant.

So we're going to try to move it along very fast, leveraging what we have already done. So more come on this as we progress. We also have two other plants in concept development based on what we're doing in North Dakota.

So what's interesting is I think we're getting this modularization model pinned down, here's how we can replicate things. Copy-paste is how Paul Bloom likes to refer to it, sometimes copy, edit, paste. But we're getting interest from around the world on this. So let's see what comes through in the future. We won't lose focus on getting the plant, get ourselves to EBITDA positive, but then also getting the CTG plant in North Dakota, getting the one South Dakota deployed.

Now stepping back for a second, the reason that we have interest in our plants and technologies is that we can produce this drop in jet fuel, and that on a production cost basis can be competitive with fossil-based jet fuel. That is a big deal in terms of concept.

It's not that it's one or the other of reducing the carbon footprint. You can actually make jet fuel for renewable resources like cornstarch that are competitive on a production cost basis with fossil-based jet fuel. That's a big concept. It's the capital that is the issue.

If our plant was paid off, then we just compete head-to-head, no substitute tax credits required. But we do have capital to pay back. Now, to pay back the capital and generate reinvestment returns, the tax credits for SAF, the RINs, they're certainly useful.

We are bringing this new attribute to markets. We're spending a lot of work on effort to make sure that we're -- how do we capture value from carbon abatement? That's separate than tax credit and RINs. There are people -- there's a market that people will pay for the carbon to be reduced.

A project like our ATJ-60 could abate 500,000 to 600,000 tons of carbon annually. I wonder how many dollars per ton can we get for that? And I wonder if there'll be different fractions that we might be able to market to add value.

Bottom line is, it's not that -- this project isn't about carbon reduction at any cost. It's about making a cost competitive jet fuel and cash rebounded from the new attribute we bring, which is the carbon abatement. It's carbon reduction done cost effectively.

So we're having to sort this out. It takes work, and I got to tell you that when you add it all up, you add up the tax credits, you add up the RINs, you add up the voluntary market, you add up the fact that it's dropping jet fuel, it makes for an exciting project.

That's why we're getting such broad support across the board, and I think it's that -- I think that there aren't that many approaches that can do this. We happen to have one of them. ATJ is going to be part of the product mix in the future.

We see -- now turning my attention to a little bit to 45Z, it's a common question we get asked. I got to say we see a lot of bipartisan support for 45Z extension. 45Z is set up so that it is truly a pay for performance. Right now, I'm only aware of two plants in the country that could qualify for a 45Z tax credit as of today. Both of them are in North Dakota, one is ours.

So that's good. And I think as CCS becomes more widely available, there might be some other plants, et cetera, that can be done, but it's not a government giveaway at all. You got to do something for it that's creative and helps set up infrastructure.

When it comes to jet fuel, jet fuel is now referred to by the new administration as synthetic aviation fuel rather than sustainable aviation fuel. I think that's actually closer to the name it was originally called synthetic kerosene. That actually is what it's called in the ASTM certifications.

So great, it's on their list. Awesome. And so I think 45Z is relevant for that and it's exciting because 45Z SAF allows a new market for ethanol. That's a big deal for when you're trying to develop our economy.

So when we do an ATJ plant, it's about energy security, real economic development, impact on commodity prices and jobs, all of that stuff together. Now, we did a study done by Charles River Associates looking at ATJ-60 plant in South Dakota, and it would be expected to create for 100 direct jobs, 700 indirect jobs right in the region. You have more than 1,000 highly paid construction jobs during the build out period of three years.

It'd be expected to generate when it's operating $100 million-plus per year of regional economic development right there in South Dakota for as long as the plant exists and operates. That's a huge economic impact. It lifts the prices of the commodities. It's like -- it makes cost competitive, production cost competitive fuels.

And the ATJ-60 plan to draw corn from roughly 230 farmers would help them. They'd expect to see the price rise in their corn because we're buying it locally and we have a business system that we expect will be able to capture value from the agricultural practices. We'll be able to differentiate it. This is what Verity is all about, tracking and tracing and taking it forth to the marketplace as attributes so we can find those people who value it.

And the other thing that Charles Rivers associates did is that they estimated that for every $1 tax credit in 45Z to return to the Treasury could be expected to be up to $6. For every $1 tax credit, $6 back to the Treasury. So even if you're a big skeptic and say, that's all those things that they take into account and all those soft things, even the hard things, you're still going to get a couple $3 back to Treasury per $1 of tax credit.

This matters. This is what economic development is all about, using government money wisely. But you've got -- it's pay-for-performance. You got to deliver something, jobs, energy security, cost-competitive products, address a new market.

So it's all about adding jobs, adding value for farmers, economic development, delivering the drop-ins, competitive with fossil-based jet fuel, and that abates carbon. Yes, cost competitive and carbon abatement are possible at the same time. I'm excited for the future and what's possible.

Now, imagine cookie cutter versions of our ATJ plants. This is actually the approach that we're taking. It's what we want to do. It's why we're pursuing the modularization approach. There's roughly 180 ethanol plants currently operating in the US. Imagine the impact by converting a chunk of these into ATJ plants. Think of the jobs created. Think of the ethanol -- think about how the ethanol market is in current overcapacity.

We could sop up that overcapacity, turn it into jet fuel, and lift ethanol prices and lift corn prices. It'd be a good deal, actually, and I think everybody would benefit. And of course, all this while we're adding to energy security, producing more jet fuel. And of course, whenever we say jet fuel, we could also produce diesel fuel too. These plants can do either one.

And these can be cost competitive with the fossil-based fuels. And don't forget, these business systems would produce about 3 tons of protein and feed products for the food chain for every ton of jet fuel produced. So it's not food versus fuel or anything like that. It's about doing both wisely and economically and making the overall business system better, the economy better.

And there's also no more need to draw in more land for agriculture. In fact, we're finding that the farmers are doing great. They can increase productivity. There's a lot of room to grow on the land that they already have. So all this talk that we occasionally hear about, oh, it's going to take so much more land. No, that's wrong. Let's go. We got data. It's an exciting time for us.

I really, really like President Trump's Executive Order called declaring a national emergency. Did you all catch that biofuels are listed right there with oil, that ethanol and aviation fuel are listed right there with refined products as priorities? That's very cool, very good for us.

I also like the Executive Order called Unleashing American Energy. This one talked about clearing the roadblocks for infrastructure deployment. It also called for removable political bias and assessments and models. That's huge because that's how there'd been a problem in the past with how environment groups do.

They say, hey, here's this really cool thing we can do. This is the government. We do a really cool thing; we're going to make this new thing. Oh, and then also there's 50,000 rules that make it impossible to take any action. Good, let's get rid of that stuff. A lot of those rules are put in there by environment groups. They're the ones who raised these issues with no data. Great, let's get rid of it. Look at the data and the facts. I'm all about that.

The other thing that I'm interested in is that -- this new administration is interested in leveling the playing field at the EU level. Good, you penalized agricultural products in the United States. They do that. They do it in their modeling and their scoring of carbon and all the rest. Good, that's been an issue. I want to see it get addressed. Let's go.

So all in all, I'm very optimistic, so I want to see what these guys can deliver. If they do what they say, it can be very good for all of us.

Now, before I turn over to Lynn, I want to give you some context as to what we're doing with Axens. No doubt you saw a press release about that and wondered. It comes down to this. We announced that we're broadening the relationship with Axens.

They've been a good partner. We started working with Axens a number of years ago because they have proven technology unit operations that can convert ethanol into jet fuel. There's several steps involved. They did them in the petrochemical industry. So by working together, we can put the whole process together.

The thing about them is that these technologies, these unit operations have been operating, for instance, ethylene to make butanes, then butanes to make the thing that's just real close to jet fuel. They've been operating for decades on a commercial basis in the petrochemical industry. They didn't make it from ethanol; they got their ethylene from a different source.

So that's why we could clear the technical diligence for the DOE launch, showing and proving to their independent engineers -- the DOE's independent engineers -- who are being paid to prove things to say no. We could prove to them that these technologies work.

That's why we're able to achieve this. Axens is the only company with each of the critical unit operations commercialized, albeit with fossil fuels, except for they have a project in that does ethanol de-aggregation and ethylene in Japan.

Having technologies for unit operations is only one piece of the puzzle, however, and that's where Gevo comes in. We know how to put it all together with renewable energy and how to integrate ethanol plants that drive both cost and CI down. The overall plant designs we own. Those are our property, our intellectual property.

We have the patents on how to achieve the very low CI footprint. We file those patents. We also know how to track and trace carbon as well as a deep understanding of the developing market, because the company that needs the jet fuel isn't necessarily the one who needs the carbon. It might be somebody else in the value chain.

We also have roughly over 100 patents covering the whole business system of ethanol to jet from end to end. They have technology, we have technology, we have quite a lot of it. So it makes sense to partner, to offer a more complete business offering to potential customers who want to build plants. And remember, we see ourselves as developing plants or even selling plants.

We're already down the road on this. We'll be a developer and a license to leverage what we learned in our South Dakota project. We believe that the market for alcohol to hydrocarbons will continue to increase fundamentally economically sound.

We've also licensed our ETO technology to Axens. So they've become a licenser from us, taking a license from us. I find this very significant. The reason is this. The Axens technology embodied in the first-generation processes, the ones we are planning to use for our HTJ-60 plant and for our North Dakota ATJ plant, they won a Nobel Prize for the critical step of converting ethylene to mixed butane.

This is a long time ago. This was like 40 years ago. They want it. That was a great breakthrough. That's why they're the only ones who -- they've led the way in that technology in the petrochemical industry. We see a lot of startups try to do this tech, and they're going to -- they fail, or they will fail or they're going to fail. It's a very difficult step.

That's why we finally got Axens to work with us after trying for 10 years. Axens has proven it out, it works. There's no question about it.

Now I take great pride then that these people with the Nobel Prize in their background think that our ETO technology is a breakthrough on this converting of ethylene -- ethanol to ethylene into the jet system, and that it simplifies steps, and it's expected to lower CapEx and OpEx by a ballpark of about 30%, beating their technology.

That makes me feel like maybe we're on to something here. So together, we're going to go finish it out. Scale it up, probably take about 18 more months, depending upon what we learn as we go or kind of roadblocks we run into. You got to go through and scale up this kind of these kind of technologies.

So for all of these reasons together, technology and business system that make for a great partnership. All right then, Lynn it's over to you.

L. Lynn Smull

Thanks, Pat. Let's go over some key numbers. We ended Q4 2024 with $259 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Combined operating revenue and other net income was $8.9 million for the fourth quarter, and $32.7 million for the full year.

Our RNG subsidiary generated $15.8 million in revenue during the year. We're working towards securing a final LCFS carbon intensity score from CARB, which we expect in the first quarter of 2025. As Pat said, that's any day now. That will unlock more value and better margins for the RNG project.

Company-wide, loss from operations was $19.6 million last quarter with a non-GAAP adjusted EBEA loss of $11.3 million. Given that the acquisition of Gevo North Dakota has closed and the ethanol 45Z and Biogas 45Z tax credits expected this year, and other factors, as Pat mentioned, we see a clear path to a positive run rate adjusted EBITDA in 2025. That's a major shift in our financial trajectory, and the updated investor presentation on our website provides more information on that topic.

We continue to be disciplined with our capital. We project 40 million of spend on the ATJ-60 project development from January 1 this year until we reach financial close. We expect total development cost at financial close to be well under previously announced high ends of potential ATJ-60 development spend.

At the start of last year, we said we planned to achieve first revenue at Verity, our software-as-a-service business for tracking and tracing of regenerative agricultural products. We achieved that in 2024, and we expect to grow the customer base in 2025. It's too early to provide specific guidance, but we have a unique software platform that provides much needed accuracy, transparency, and quality that is poised to grow into a very large total addressable market.

With that, I'll pass it over to Chris.

Chris Ryan

Thanks, Lynn. You'll find a summary of our Gevo North Dakota acquisition in our press release, and Pat also made some comments. So I'll just provide a brief update on that. Our operations team at the plant are doing a great job keeping the processes running smoothly.

They're producing about 67 million gallons a year of low carbon ethanol, which includes 2 million gallons of ultra-low carbon intensity corn fiber ethanol. We're capturing carbon and sequestering it on site, which gives us an important competitive advantage in the ethanol industry, while we generate valuable carbon dioxide removal credits, otherwise known as CDRs.

To put some carbon score numbers on this, our British Columbia carbon intensity is about 19 grams of CO2 per megajoule, and our CI score calculated according to the Argonne R&D GREET model, is about 21 grams CO2 per megajoule before we take into account the regenerative ag practices from the corn farmers that are supplying us. For those who are familiar, that's nearly the lowest carbon intensity in the ethanol industry.

As a result, as Pat mentioned, this acquisition immediately strengthened our ability to generate and monetize carbon reduction even without any major capital investments. In the longer term, we believe it's a great site to look at potentially converting that low carbon ethanol into synthetic aviation fuel or SAF.

In March, a group from Gevo management spent the afternoon with many of the farmers that supply our plant in Richardton. We talked with these farmers about our vision for growth at the site, including the potential for an ATJ plant, which represents a whole new use for American agricultural products.

We listened to the farmers talk about the regenerative ag practices that they're already using there. And we talked about ways those practices may translate into more value for them. These farmer relationships are critical for the success of our plant, and we all walked away feeling our interests were aligned with them.

We're excited about what this means for Gevo's future. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul.

Paul Bloom

Thanks, Chris. I'll be brief as well. Regarding Verity, we're growing fast. We're currently generating revenue and growing our customer base. We doubled our growers' program acreage since the second quarter of 2024 and tracked over 200,000 acres in 2024.

We signed agreements with five ethanol producers and two soy crush plants and have more on the way. Verity aims to help the industry measure and verify sustainable attributes from the fields to final products made from corn, soybeans, and other agricultural feedstocks for food, feed, fuels, and industrial products. The growing unmet demand for traceability in agriculture and energy is real, and Verity is proving to be a valuable tool.

Regarding our patented ethanol-to-olefins or ETO technology, as Pat mentioned, we expanded our strategic alliance with Axens to develop, commercialize, and license this technology globally for fuels. We also aligned our technology, business system, and know-how with Axens to drive alcohol to jet commercialization under a new alliance agreement.

We aren't just building our own ATJ projects. We have a robust IT portfolio to license technology and engineered solutions to the whole industry. In addition, we continue to make good progress with our ethanol-to-olefins joint development agreement with LG Chem to make bio-based chemicals, including propylene, which is a key building block in the petrochemical industry today.

The market opportunity here is large and could create more demand for US agricultural products. We're talking about technologies that can take corn and ethanol and convert into low carbon drop-in fuels and materials that match petroleum to help make all kinds of products from diapers to durable parts for our cars to jet fuel.

We're using our technology and business system to bring agriculture and energy together to drive growth for rural America. Back to you, Pat.

Patrick Gruber

Thanks, Paul. And with that, let's open it up for questions.

Question and Answer Session

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Amit Dayal, H.C. Wainwright.

Amit Dayal

Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So Pat, with respect to the SPV side of the net 01 opportunity, what are the equity investor options in front of you? Are these potentially like, strategic folks already in that value chain? Or are these typical, financial investors like who are you speaking to right now? Any color on what those options in front of you are?

Patrick Gruber

Yeah, it's the normal set of characters across all, ranging from strategics to specialty funds to those classic financial funds. It's a whole spectrum of them. And just got to go work through it and see who's going to -- what's real. And we'll make it happen.

Amit Dayal

Okay. And does some of this need to be arranged to close the DOE loan, or can that come later when you start tapping into or drawing down on that loan?

Patrick Gruber

No, this would be a prerequisite to have the commitments. It's a prerequisite to have the commitments to get the FID. It would all come together at once.

Amit Dayal

So then in that context, what is the timeline to complete sort of this side of the process?

Patrick Gruber

I think the best that -- we're not supposed to talk about the details of the DOE loan process still. But I think it's -- to say that we get it done in 2025, that's what we're targeting, and it's in that timeframe that we would come together.

We've already been engaged obviously in Wall Street and talking to funds, so we already have a sense of interest, and we have a sense that things economics can work. I think at this point that we made about pinning down some of the carbon values that market is growing in in the voluntary carbon market, Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions.

It's pretty interesting, and so we are tweaking some of our contracts because it makes a better project, and so we're doing that. So we're going to want to get that done, but it's just the practical reality is this going to be later in the year to get it all done.

Amit Dayal

Okay, understood. Then with respect to the carbon capture expansion opportunity at North Dakota, going forward as you, increase capacity over there, what are the options sort of to monetize that? Will you be sort of participating in the carbon trading markets? Or is there sort of a different, monetization strategy that is maybe easier and more -- or provides a better visibility for you guys?

Patrick Gruber

Paul, I'm going to let you answer that. This is your realm as the Chief Business Officer, and you're busy on carbon.

Paul Bloom

Yeah, sure, no problem. So we've got a couple of options here on how to monetize. Obviously, we can put that value from the CCS into an approved pathway with the renewable fuel. So think about just including that all bundled together. But then separately if we don't do that, we can take that CCS value into a market called CDRs, and Chris mentioned this, which are carbon dioxide removal credits.

And these are permanent carbon dioxide removals, right? They're going to be there for 100,000 of years, as we store that CO2 that used to be in the atmosphere. And that's a market that's developing today. And so we're actively participating there and working on, how do we market carbon either with the fuel or separately from the fuel into those markets. So more to come on that.

Amit Dayal

Understood, thank you. Just last one for me. The expansion on the RNG front, I know you were looking to increase volumes, et cetera. Is that already done or are you still in the process of executing on that?

Patrick Gruber

Well, we've already expanded it so it's the capacity 40,000 million BTUs. We're pushing up further how far we go beyond that. We put in some additional equipment and such, so we have to go do that work.

Amit Dayal

Okay. All right. So that's all I have for now. I will take my other questions offline. Thank you.

Operator

Nate Pendleton, Texas Capital.

Nate Pendleton

Good afternoon. Specifically looking at your first plant, can you share your perspective on how recent tariff announcements are impacting potential costs there as you approach financial close?

Patrick Gruber

Do you mean for the ATJ-60 in South Dakota?

Nate Pendleton

That's correct.

Patrick Gruber

Yeah. Hey, Chris, you want to comment on it? That's your bailiwick.

Chris Ryan

Those are not impacting -- if that was the question, really not impacting our project at all. We've got -- when you look at, say, project cost, for example, most of the project really wouldn't be subject to that.

Nate Pendleton

Okay, understood. Thank you. And then shifting over to the ethanol-to-olefins technology that you touched on in the prepared remarks, can you lay out future milestones that the market should be watching as that business scales?

Patrick Gruber

Paul, you want to take that one?

Paul Bloom

Yeah, sure. As Pat mentioned in his remarks, right now we've got the development -- we're in the development phase of that with Axens, so active project. We've been through a first pilot stage, so that was our real first milestone that we made after getting to our lab phase.

And now we're really in this stage, can we get this done in 12 months? Can we get it done in 18 months? It's all about de-risking that technology. So we're very comfortable with moving to scale. So that's kind of the timeframe that we're looking at to have our next milestone, which is really getting this ready for commercialization.

Patrick Gruber

And I'll add that is typical. This chemistry converting these what are called olefins into these fuel products, when you think about it at a really large scale, things that are PPM, parts per million, matter, because you're doing millions and millions of pounds.

And so what builds up? What happens? Do you really understand it in detail? This is the mistake that is classically made over and over and over. People will take something from the lab and just rush it in the scale up in these catalytic systems. These are catalytic systems, not fermentation systems, catalytic systems.

And they get burned by it, and stuff doesn't work, plugs the columns or the catalysts just don't work the way they thought. This is the beauty of what Axens has done in the past and why it's fun to work with them because they've seen lots of these things.

Between us, we've been working on these catalytic technologies since 2007. I think people have forgotten that we were the first to do ethanol to jet fuel back and even in 2007, 2008 timeframe, we did it.

It was just a very practical case of -- at that point, Axens didn't want to license their technology to us because they didn't believe you could get to a low carbon, a zero-carbon footprint. Well, we were pursuing isobutanol, which is a way of skipping the steps, and then we had ETO.

When everyone got focused on the jet fuel, on SAF and jet fuel, then Axens had been working with us on the isobutanol to jet and gasoline because we thought gasoline was going to be the big driver. Well, the market centered on SAF. Well then, together, we said they learned with us that, my gosh, you really can get to zero and below footprint on a CI score. So they licensed it to us. Good, I wish they had done it sooner or even further ahead on the ethanol front.

So the ETO thing is a breakthrough. It looks really good. It is this classic case of we don't know fully what we don't know and we're going to go look for things that go wrong and scale it up. And that's the approach you take on these kinds of scale-ups, try to figure out what breaks the system. That's what we have to go do. And when we learn something, then we'll adjust the conditions. So I hate to say that here's a hard and fast milestone of we're going to go through the scale ups.

By the way, this is the same technology that we're already working on scale up with LG Chem. So the LG Chem for propylene is a variant of the technologies. So we already have pretty good confidence that it works at reasonable size scale, but we need ginormous scale for fuels. Chemical products only need kind of medium sized scale; fuels, ginormous scale.

Nate Pendleton

Got it. I appreciate that detail. And then, just one last one for me if I may. Regarding your Luverne facility, do you provide any thoughts around how you may leverage that asset in the future?

Patrick Gruber

Yeah. I think it's a -- for us, running it as an ethanol plant doesn't make sense. Yeah, we have some ideas here, so you'll have to stay tuned. But it's a -- we got some really good ideas that are in play. We just can't talk about things yet.

Nate Pendleton

All right. Well, thanks for taking my questions.

Patrick Gruber

You bet.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) Ethan Fingerer, Opp Co.

Ethan Fingerer

Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Can you talk about what's been holding up the DOE process and what the timeline is? What have been the obstacles, and what have you accomplished, and what's still left to be done, please? That's question one.

And then the second question is you mentioned needing to raise $800 million in equity. One of the other questioners asked who the targets is in terms of the potential investors. I'm interested to know who's banking that for you. Who's helping you bank that? Which investment banks are you working with? Have you engaged anybody on that, and where does that stand, please?

(technical difficulty) Can you guys hear me?

Patrick Gruber

Hey, Ethan. So it's the same things we've been same things we've talked about in the past is that we have to go through and do some of the environmental stuff that's required for the DOE loan program that has to be done. That was slowed down probably by the transition. They just weren't people there to sign off on things.

That has to happen. We're tweaking some of these contracts. The uncertainty around the pipeline isn't helpful in that we just got to know which way it's going, which way it's blowing. We're still going to plan on that, the economics for the whole project work.

But none of us really want to take a hit of a couple percentage points on the IRRs. So that matters, especially for equity. So going slower on this, a month or two, I want to see what happens. What is Summit going to do next? I really would like to know that because it's a question that always comes up, and we always have to answer it.

This other thing that is interesting that I mentioned is the carbon markets by -- we have already talked that we're tweaking contracts. We've said this many earnings calls that we're tweaking contracts. Part of this is that if you just rush in and do a kind of a project finance contract the old way, just whatever, you're giving away a huge amount of value. I think it's really stupid.

So we're tweaking stuff to make sure the project economics work in our favor. All those things added up, plus the practical timing of things, just say that it will get done sometime this year. For us, we think the project is going to get done. It's just a question of when, and it'll be fine.

In terms of the bankers, we're still working with Guggenheim and Citi.

Operator

Peter Gastreich, Water Tower Research.

Peter Gastreich

Yes, thank you. Excuse me, Peter Gastreich here. So thanks for the presentation today, and congratulations to the team on executing your strategy. Just a couple questions for me. The first one is on Red Trail. Just in terms of cash coming from carbon credits there, has that started from day one?

And are you able to give any color on the broad assumptions for that $30 million to $60 million dollar adjust to the expectation and what the contribution of carbon credits might look like? Is that range more the results of a commodity variable, or do you have a range in credits in there as well? Thank you.

Patrick Gruber

Eric, I think you're probably in the best position to describe this. It's your chart that he's probably looking at, Peter's probably looking at.

Eric Frey

Yes, sure, Peter. So just to give you a sense, the carbon intensity using the 45Z GREET model for (technical difficulty) FFO plant and CCS is about 21 grams of future growth for (inaudible). And so the math, the way the 45Z tax credits works is basically you get $0.02 per gallon of tax credit per CI point that's below [50] -- okay, about.

And so at a 21 CI score, which is really industry-leading carbon intensity because this ethanol plant is so unique because it has carbon capture, and it's one of the few ethanol plants in the world that actually operates carbon capture. I think Pat mentioned that you think we want to basically (technical difficulty). That means that the 45Z tax credit loan is to get math on about 67 million gallons per year of volume. It is worth somewhere between $30 million to $40 million just that tax credit.

So there's other elements of value that we're targeting, but that's a big element of how you can get to kind of the range that we're talking about between $30 million to $60 million. That's a large range and as we kind of get more experience in your results as we go through the year, you can see that just that tax credit alone gets us a pretty good foundation to achieving that target.

And Chris, feel free to jump in if you want to add the detail of that as well, but that's kind of how we map, Peter.

Peter Gastreich

Okay, great. Thanks, Eric.

Patrick Gruber

Sorry, Peter, could you understand him?

Peter Gastreich

I got most of it, but yeah, it was not a good line. We could follow up afterwards as well.

Patrick Gruber

Well. Yeah, so the short version is this ethanol margins, they're low right now. So they should come back in the summertime like always to follow the normal cycle of ethanol, so that'd be the normal contribution you'd expect from us, 67 million gallons per year ethanol plant. It'll be the normalness there.

And then I think that a large part of what you see on that slide is the monetization of the 45Z. It's a fascinating thing. There's a marketplace for the 45Zs already, even though they're still -- their law, they have to do them. It's the la. And so people are betting on that already, and so it's very interesting and a large part of that is the 45Z.

Peter Gastreich

Okay, great, got it. Thank you very much for that. And just the second question I just noticed that in your 10K that there's disclosure about the weakness and controls. Could you just expand on this and what exactly is meant by the auditor there? Thank you.

Patrick Gruber

Yeah, this is one of these ones of as we're going through the end of the year stuff with the auditors and then also ourselves on our internal audit, we had a pattern of mischaracterizing. We're treating a transaction as expenses where they should have been capitalized.

So for me, this is one of these ones that I find very frustrating because we were mis-categorizing things. It was a couple of contracts and some just transaction expenses for capital or for projects that should have been capitalized.

So it turns out it doesn't hurt our cash, it doesn't hurt -- our earnings per share got better because stuff got capitalized. And so it's one of these very frustrating things where we made mistakes on the technical interpretation of the rules of what it is, we got it wrong. And so that's just part of it and it's irritating, but that's what that one's about.

We're already in the path through mediation for it as well. But because that's about training as you saw in the K, then you saw it's about training people, getting the right people, et cetera.

Peter Gastreich

Okay. Thank you very much, Pat.

Operator

James Arett, Morgan Stanley.

James Arett

Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question here. I was wondering about the Verity portion of the business. And I guess I'm curious about do you guys have any projections about revenue? I know that that would be very forward-looking and nothing in concrete, but any like maybe a three-year and a five-year projection about what kind of revenue that that could bring in?

Patrick Gruber

Yeah, Paul, how about that?

Paul Bloom

Yeah, it's a good question. And we're -- I mean, the good news is we got first revenue last year like we said we were going to do. And so now what we see is that, well, I don't have the three- and the five-year projections for you, but we're signing up more customers which come with typical subscription fees, so software-as-a-service.

And then some of the agreements that we have in place have a profit share, which we've talked about in the past, profit and revenue share. So some of those can be pretty sizable as we think about how this is going to grow and go forward. But yeah, still too early to say a lot of the same things when we think about calculating carbon values and doing carbon accounting and profit shares that we've got built into some of those agreements.

James Arett

Got you. Thank.

Operator

(Operator Instructions) [Karen McGinnis].

Karen McGinnis

Yes, good afternoon. I had a quick question. Given there's a number of issues around what we got to achieve for the DOE loan, how long does that commitment stay open?

Patrick Gruber

It depends on -- well, that's up to them. I mean, I've seen them extend them for years. So we'll see. The way we view this is there's -- we're going to -- we have -- for us, we don't view this as a binary thing and a lot of shareholders do. I don't view it that way. It's not binary.

This project makes a lot of sense. It'll happen. The DOE loan makes a lot of sense, project financing. In the meantime, I got other projects to build too. We're going to get those built, and we'll do them a little bit differently than a classic project finance.

So it's not a binary outcome. Our game plan is to be profitable irrespective of net 01. So this paradigm that people have that, somehow, we have to have that, it's going to be a miracle. And then -- and wow, we better get cash flow from it when you think about the timelines.

So our whole game is to not have to raise money again except for very creative reasons. That's our whole game plan here. So it's not at all that paradigm of one thing or the other. I am keen on setting the right precedents in the market, setting the right price points, setting the right -- all the precedents of value. I'm very keen on that because that sets the stage for going forward.

Karen McGinnis

Thank you. The second question, just a simple question. Just listening to the call, there's a lot of moving pieces here, and there seems to be a lot of -- we're going in a lot of different directions. What do you see is kind of the top two or three priorities as the CEO of the company?

Patrick Gruber

Are you kidding me? This is -- are you freaking kidding me? What do you think they are? Really? We're unclear? Have you been -- you read our presentations, go look at our documentation. Route to -- first, we're developing the marketplace for alcohols into hydrocarbons and commercializing those products. We're establishing the carbon value for those same products.

And along the way, we're building our network infrastructure in a property portfolio, so we have a serious competitive advantage. And you know what, we've got a strong balance sheet. Those are the things. Crystal clear. They're spelled out in our documents.

Karen McGinnis

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

That does conclude our Q&A session for today, and I would like to turn the call over to Pat for closing remarks. Please go ahead.

Patrick Gruber

It's been interesting times during the transition with the new administration. The number of questions that we're getting from the press is amazing. I think I've had something like 55 interviews with press. Usually, they have the wrong information about things.

And so what I find is the noise is going to have to settle down, and I think we'll see money flow back into our sector. It has gone away because people don't know what to make of anything. That's all part of it.

So I think we're in great shape. Our balance sheet is strong, our technologies are strong, our capabilities are strong. We continue to make progress in the marketplace.

This carbon value that we talked about is real, and it's separate than just regulatory value. That is the ultimate game is to make sure that you have technologies that are competitively making products on a cost basis, and there's a value-added attribute, and it's carbon.

So thanks for participating. Thanks for listening in.

In all, the IEA reported global energy demand grew “faster than the average rate over the past decade” at 2.2% last year. The growth was driven by electrification, digitalization, data center expansions and rising temperatures.

All forms of energy saw greater demand. However, renewables—led by solar—accounted for the largest share of growth at 38%. Following renewables were natural gas, 28%; coal, 15%; oil at 11% and nuclear at 8%, according to the report.

“Generation from solar PV and wind increased by a record 670 TWh, while generation from natural gas rose by 170 TWh and coal by 90 TWh,” the IEA said. “In the European Union, the share of generation provided by solar PV and wind surpassed the combined share of coal and gas for the first time. In the United States, solar PV and wind’s share rose to 16%, overtaking that of coal. In China, solar PV and wind reached nearly 20% of total generation.”

Energy demand is expected to continue increasing as the world’s population grows and economies strengthen amid a push toward electrification and lower-carbon energies in parts of the world. The report showed that more than 80% of global energy demand growth came from emerging and developing economies led by China, where demand slowed but still grew, and India. Both countries, however, saw coal use rise due to “intense heatwaves.”

“There are many uncertainties in the world today and different narratives about energy—but this new data-driven IEA report puts some clear facts on the table about what is happening globally,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “What is certain is that electricity use is growing rapidly, pulling overall energy demand along with it to such an extent that it is enough to reverse years of declining energy consumption in advanced economies.

The U.S. and EU also returned to growth mode.

Of the fossil fuels, natural gas demand grew the most worldwide, rising by 115 Bcm in 2024 compared with an average of about 75 Bcm annually over the past decade.

“The result is that demand for all major fuels and energy technologies increased in 2024, with renewables covering the largest share of the growth, followed by natural gas,” Birol said. “And the strong expansion of solar, wind, nuclear power and EVs is increasingly loosening the links between economic growth and emissions.”

Here’s a roundup of some other renewable energy news.

Biofuels

Eni, Saipem Extend Biorefining Collaboration Agreement

Eni and Saipem agreed to continue collaborating on efforts to advance biorefining projects on March 27 with the extension of a November 2023 agreement between the two companies.

As part of the extended agreement, Eni said it plans to further develop its biorefining capacity with new initiatives focused on biofuels for aviation, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and for land and sea mobility.

Eni recently awarded Saipem a contract to start detailed engineering and procurement services as well as purchase of critical equipment to upgrade the Enilive biorefinery in Porto Marghera, near Venice, Italy, according to the release. The project aims to boost the facility’s capacity to 600,000 tons per year, up from 400,000 tons per year, beginning in 2027. The companies also plan to add SAF production in 2027.

Energy storage

TotalEnergies to Invest in Six German Battery Energy Storage Projects

TotalEnergies said on March 26 it would invest $172.7 million for six new battery energy storage systems with a total capacity of 221 megawatts (MW) in Germany.

Most of the batteries, the company said, will be supplied by Saft and developed by TotalEnergies affiliate Kyon Energy. The projects are scheduled for commissioning in early 2026.

“The implementation and integration of all these battery projects will allow us to supply our customers with clean firm power, contributing directly to our targeted 12% profitability in this activity,” TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné said.

The projects are being pursued as Total takes step to help strengthen the German power market by boosting renewables backed by battery energy storage systems.

Poland’s PGE to Invest About $4.7B in Battery Storage Projects

(Reuters) Polish utility PGE plans to invest about $4.7 billion in battery storage projects, CEO Dariusz Marzec said March 24.

With a growing share of intermittent renewable capacity in the system replacing stable electricity generation from coal, Poland urgently needs to develop battery storage to continue its energy transformation.

“The total value of investment in large-scale energy storage facilities is about 6 billion zlotys,” Marzec told reports, adding that this was for six large projects, with plans to invest a further 12 billion zlotys in smaller facilities across the country.

The company said it plans to build a total of 85 energy storage projects to increase its storage capacity to more than 17,000 megawatt hours, which it says will provide energy for about 2.5 million households.

Hydrogen

Calgary Region Hydrogen Hub Opens in Canada

A hydrogen hub managed by the Transition Accelerator has opened in the Calgary area of Alberta, Canada, bringing together established hydrogen producers and consumers, Calgary Economic Development Ltd. said March 21 in a news release.

The Calgary Region Hydrogen Hub (CRH2) takes shape amid global efforts to establish competitive low and non-emitting industries. The hub will initially focus on airports, heat and power, hydrogen corridors, trains and industrial and municipal fleets, according to the release. “The hub will bring together experts across industries with early potential to anchor a self-sustaining hydrogen economy, working closely with industry partners to coordinate research and initiatives, facilitate application of hydrogen solutions and overcome barriers to hydrogen development,” the release states. “The CRH2 will also serve as a point of connection for Calgary’s hydrogen ecosystem, sharing insights, analytics and inspiration to provide the region with a competitive edge.”

Calgary Economic Development, the Transition Accelerator, Wheatland County, the City of Calgary and Prairies Economic Development Canada are among the hub’s initial members.

US Weighs Funding Cuts to Four Hydrogen Hubs

(Reuters) The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is weighing funding cuts to four of seven hydrogen hubs selected under a $7 billion federal program, according to a source briefed on the matter.

The hubs, part of former President Joe Biden’s effort to decarbonize the U.S. economy, are intended to jumpstart the production of “clean hydrogen” and the infrastructure needed to get it to industrial users like steelmakers and cement plants.

Washington has slashed funding for clean energy projects since Trump took office in January. His administration is prioritizing fossil fuel production as part of its “energy dominance” agenda.

The four hubs targeted for cuts include those in the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, California and the Mid-Atlantic, according to a list circulated by the agency. They represent about $4 billion in pledged funding.

Funding would be preserved for hubs in Appalachia, the Gulf Coast and the upper Midwest.

“The Department of Energy is conducting a department-wide review,” a DOE spokesperson said when asked about the list, which was first reported by Politico. “The review is ongoing, and speculation by anonymous sources about the results of the review are just that—speculation.”

The hubs that could have their funding cut would largely serve Democratic states, while the three hubs that would be kept are located in Republican states.

A California hydrogen trade group said the DOE should reconsider pulling funding from the Golden State hub, which is known as ARCHES.

“The many benefits of hydrogen energy—American energy independence, cleaner air for all of us to breathe, and good paying, blue-collar jobs—are not partisan issues,” Teresa Cooke, executive director of the California Hydrogen Coalition, said in a statement. “Projects like ARCHES are already benefiting the U.S. economy and removing funding will only hurt the people of our state, including more than 6 million who supported President Trump in the 2024 election.”

In an emailed statement, ARCHES said it was committed to establishing a hydrogen ecosystem, creating jobs and delivering economic benefits to California residents.

Officials from the other hydrogen hubs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The solar farm includes equipment sourced from U.S. manufacturers, such as solar panels from Arizona-based First Solar and smart solar trackers from New Mexico-based Array Technologies, BP said.

ENGIE Adds 900 MW Solar, Storage to Portfolio from Ares Management

ENGIE North America said March 24 it added 900 MW of solar and storage assets from Ares Management Infrastructure to its portfolio, deepening the companies’ partnership.

The assets consist of three solar projects in operation across the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and Midcontinent Independent System Operator and one co-located battery storage project connected to ERCOT, ENGIE said in a press release.

The addition brings the partnership’s portfolio to 3.7 GW of investment in U.S. generation, the company said.

ENGIE will retain a controlling share in the portfolio and will continue to operate and manage the assets.

ENGIE currently has over 11 GW of renewable production in operation or construction across the U.S. and Canada. Globally, the company has 51 GW of renewables and storage in operation and is targeting 95 GW by 2030.

“The expansion of our relationship with Ares reflects the strength of ENGIE's portfolio of assets and our track record of delivering, operating and financing growth in the U.S.,” said. Dave Carroll, chief renewables officer and senior vice president, ENGIE North America. “The addition of another almost 1 GW of generation and storage to our existing relationship reflects the commitment both ENGIE and Ares have to meeting growing demand for power in the U.S. and continuing to deploy clean energy.”

Wind

Vattenfall to Build Germany’s Largest Offshore Wind Farm

(Reuters) Swedish power utility Vattenfall said on March 25 it has made a final investment decision for two wind farm projects in the German North Sea, Nordlicht 1 and 2, the first of which is expected to become Germany’s biggest offshore wind farm.

Vattenfall said in a statement it had agreed to buy back the 49% stake in the Nordlicht cluster sold to BASF in 2024, while the German chemicals group will receive access to long-term supply of renewable electricity.

Construction for Nordlicht 1 and 2, which will have a total capacity of 1.6 GW, is planned to begin in 2026, Vattenfall said.

Expected to be fully operational in 2028, the two wind farms will be able to produce around 6 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity per year, equivalent to the electricity consumption of 1.6 million German households.

In related news, BASF on March 25 flagged a non-cash effective disposal loss of around 300 million euros (US$324 million) for its first quarter earnings following the sale of its 49% stake in the Nordlicht cluster to Vattenfall.

Siemens Energy Sells Most of Indian Wind Unit in Latest Revamp

(Reuters) Siemens Energy will sell 90% of its wind turbine business in India and Sri Lanka to an investor group led by the climate investment arm of buyout group TPG, in the latest move aimed at fixing its struggling renewables division.

Siemens Gamesa, Siemens Energy’s loss-making wind turbine division, holds a 30% market share in India but had said it was considering strategic options for the business, citing cut-throat competition.

“It’s a very fragmented and competitive landscape,” Vinod Philip, Siemens Energy’s board member in charge of Siemens Gamesa, told Reuters. “This deal allows us as Siemens Gamesa to tackle the other markets in a more focused manner.”

Philip said the new company could also become a cost-effective Indian supplier to Siemens Gamesa, helping to diversify its global supply chain.

No financial details of the transaction were disclosed.

As part of the deal, Siemens Energy will transfer about 1,000 employees and two manufacturing plants in India to the new entity. About 1,200 of its local staff will not be part of the deal and will remain with Siemens Energy, the company said.

Siemens Gamesa has an installation base of nearly 10 GW in India and provides service to more than 7 GW worth of turbines under long-term agreements, it said, adding the market was expected to add 57 GW of capacity by 2032.

Philip said the focus remained on fixing Siemens Gamesa’s onshore business, which has suffered from a quality crisis around its newer generation 4.X and 5.X turbine models. An updated version of the 4.X turbine has been brought back into the market and Philip said there were “good conversations” with customers in Europe about it.

That compares with a R$1.1 billion loss during the equivalent period of 2023.

Sao Paulo-based Gol did not hold a conference call with investors as it works to emerge from Chapter 11 restructuring.

Gol reports that the devlauation of Brazilian currency hit the carrier hard in 2024, with total costs rising 3% compared with the full year of 2023.

It attributes the increase in expenses primarily to “exchange rate depreciation”, though higher airport fees and labour costs also played a role.

Indeed, the carrier’s fourth-quarter loss from depreciation and amoritisation increased by nearly 30% compared with the prior-year period, to R$544 million from R$435 million.

There are bright spots in the carrier’s year-end financial report, however.

Gol says that passenger capacity increased througout the year “due mainly to the introduction of new routes” and the re-introduction of others, pointing to the restoration of flights between Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre.

The carrier opened four new international bases in 2024, with new outposts in Cancun, Aruba, Costa Rica and Bogota.

”Another important point was the expansion of the international network and the reconstruction of connectivity, especially with Rio de Janeiro, one of Gol largest hubs,” the airline says.

Gol took delivery of eight new Boeing 737 Max 8s last year, including three in the third quarter. It ended the year with a fleet of 52 Max jets.

On 31 December, Gol’s full fleet included 138 jets – 114 of which are operational.

Gol says it “ends the year with a well-built network for 2025 and a larger operational fleet by seven aircraft” compared with the end of 2023.

”This increase in operational aircraft was result of the Chapter 11 restructuring efforts and lessor negotiations… to support growth and ensure the company’s efficient operation to build the foundation for Gol’s performance in 2025 and its long-term plan,” the airline says.

Earlier this month, the carrier said it had secured exit financing from unnamed investors as it works to emerge from bankruptcy as “a well-capitalised standalone company”.

Gol told shareholders that it had secured from “certain investors” $1.25 of $1.9 billion in debt instruments to be issued as part of its restructuring plan.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/7/1/108971_shutterstock_1359480122_606776.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 12:56:20.409645

The Gulfstream G700's remarkable ultra-long range of 7,750 NM (8,918 mi, 14,353 km) positions it as a leading business jet.","Since its beginning in 1958, Gulfstream Aerospace Company has been paving the skies with visionary private jet models like the Gulfstream IV and the G650 series, which have become symbols of modernity and elegance. This Savannah, Georgia-based plane maker has engineered unique design qualities, as seen in their continuously developed products.

Gulfstream's latest jet in production, the cutting-edge G700, was introduced on October 22, 2019, at the NBAA Convention & Exhibition in Las Vegas. The G700 boasts one of the longest flying ranges in private aviation history, with adaptable cabins and advanced avionics technology. The company continually challenges the boundaries of what an aircraft can achieve, such as the upcoming G800, whether it's enhancing fuel efficiency or speed limits.

The first operator of the G700 was Qatar Executive , the private jet company of Qatar Airways, which received the world’s first Gulfstream G700 Aircraft to Doha on May 22, 2024. Today, QE’s G700 fleet has reached six jets, as the company added two additional jets on January 6, 2025. Another four G700s are scheduled for QE delivery between 2025 and 2026, bringing the company's total fleet to ten.

“Qatar Executive has been a valued Gulfstream customer for nearly 10 years. We are honoured to have them as our international partner for the launch and first deliveries of the all-new G700. We look forward to growing their fleet in the months ahead,” said Mark Burns, President of Gulfstream.

On September 2, 2024, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, was seen in Los Angeles with his new $80 million Gulfstream G700 jet at Van Nuys Airport, one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world. A private jet service provider, ABS Jets, acquired the G700 in December 2024. Additionally, the Tanzanian government acquired the jet for VIP transport.

G700 blends ultra-long range and speed

Due to its capabilities, the G700 flagship stands out as a superior private business aviation selection, with remarkable demand in the market. This explains why Gulfstream Aerospace’s large-cabin deliveries jumped by 32.6% to 118 in 2024, as reported by the Gulfstream umbrella company, General Dynamics. Gulfstream expects to deliver 150 jets in 2025.

The Gulfstream G700's remarkable ultra-long range of 7,750 NM (8,918 mi, 14,353 km) positions it as a leading business jet. Its capability transforms global travel, connecting cities and continents, such as Las Vegas to Macau or London and Singapore, in a single non-stop flight. This boosts the jet's life and durability, eliminating the need for refueling stops and saving time and workload.

From there, the maximum speed of Mach 0.935 (617 knots, 712 MPH, 1,145 km/h) takes off to its highest point. This near-supersonic speed shortens travel time and enhances the overall efficiency of long-distance journeys, promoting the aircraft as the fastest business jet in private aviation. By minimizing the hours spent in transit, the G700 allows passengers to maximize productivity by executing efficient business schedules.

Thanks to the Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines

The Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engine, designed for Gulfstream's G700 and G800 , is a leading business aviation powerhouse. It combines the most efficient engine core with a new low-pressure system, resulting in an 8% increase in take-off thrust at 18,250 lb (81.21 kN).

On September 20, 2022, RR announced that the Pearl® 700 had received certification from the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency EASA .

The G700's styling

Cutting-edge engineering minimizes turbulence and vibration, so the passengers onboard enjoy a quiet, comfortable cabin even as the aircraft hurtles through the atmosphere. When the G700 flies at 41,000 ft (12,497 m), passengers will feel refreshed as if they are at 2,916 ft (889 m), representing the lowest cabin altitude in its class, according to Gulfstream.

This cabin altitude feature is particularly beneficial on ultra-long-range flights because the outside air pressure is extremely low when cruising at high altitudes, leading to discomfort and health issues if not properly managed. Lower cabin altitude means passengers experience less physiological stress, reduced fatigue, and improved overall well-being.

The aircraft offers an exceptionally spacious cabin, bringing up to 19 passengers in up to five individual living areas, including a dedicated private meeting room and a master suite with a shower. The cabins have been crafted to meet high standards and comfort.

The G700 offers a spacious stretched cabin with natural lighting through 20 oval windows. The cabin air is 100% fresh and refilled every two to three minutes, and an ionizing system is also included. The G700 can also be customized to meet passengers' unique needs, providing a high-quality business jet. Moreover, the passenger experience delights include the jet's revolutionary lighting system.

The baggage compartment volume of 195 cu ft (5.52 m³) offers both flexibility and convenience, catering to the needs of passengers traveling for leisure or business. Enough to hold up to 48 checked suitcases. This space can handle more than just personal luggage—it can also be used for sports equipment or other bulky items often carried by business travelers.

G700's outer design

The aircraft maintains aerodynamic stability with a height of 25 ft 5 in (7.75 m). Its length of 109 ft 10 in (33.48 m) accommodates a spacious interior, advanced systems, and ample storage area. Meanwhile, the wingspan of 103 ft (31.39 m) enhances lift and efficiency.

The winglets are upward-curved extensions at the wingtips made of composite and metallic materials, optimizing weight and enhancing appearance. These advancements redefine high-speed, ultra-long-range flight expectations, contributing to the state-of-the-art fuselage and wing designs, which reduce drag and boost aerodynamic efficiency.

In comparison, the G700's height is slightly lower than the Global 7500 and Falcon 10X, contributing to its profile. It is more concise than the Bombardier Global 7500 and Dassault Falcon 10X. The G700's wingspan is comparable to its competitors, ensuring excellent lift and fuel efficiency.

Leading-edge technology

The Gulfstream G700's Symmetry Flight Deck is a cutting-edge cockpit design revolutionizing the piloting experience. It incorporates active control sidesticks, which are electronically linked to provide tactile feedback.
