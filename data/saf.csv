""Through this agreement, FedEx has purchased blended fuel from Neste that includes a minimum of 30% neat, i.e. unblended Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Delivery of the fuel began in May 2025 and will continue for one year,"" the statement said.

Neste will supply more than 3 million gallons or 8,800 mt of blended SAF to FedEx at the Los Angeles airport, which will account for about one-fifth of FedEx's Los Angeles jet fuel consumption annually.

Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste, including used cooking oil and animal waste fat, and can be blended with up to 50% of conventional jet fuel.

Neste already supplies other Los Angeles carriers with SAF. Earlier in May, Air New Zealand signed its biggest SAF offtake deal with Neste for 30 million liters of SAF to be delivered to Los Angeles and San Francisco airports through February 2026.

SAF production supported as Martinez's work is completed

Currently, Neste's global SAF production capability is 515 million gallons, or around 1.5 million mt annually. Neste produces SAF at its Rotterdam and Singapore facilities as well as in California, where Neste and Marathon Petroleum are 50:50 joint venture partners in Martinez Renewables.

The facility, converted from a petroleum refinery, is located in the San Francisco Bay Area and can produce about 730 million gal/year of renewable diesel and SAF.

The facility reached full capacity at the end of 2024 when the pre-treatment unit was up and running, which allows it to optimize advantaged feedstock, improving the carbon intensity score and increasing its value.

Marathon's renewable diesel segment, which also includes the Dickinson, North Dakota, facility ran at 70% utilization in the first quarter, due in part to down time at the Martinez facility, Marathon said on its May 6 Q1 results call.

The Martinez pre-treatment unit came online in Q4 2024, allowing the partners to optimize feedstocks and benefit from California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits, which reward lower carbon fuel intensity.

So far in the second quarter, California's LCFS credits are averaging $57.97/mt, down from Q1's average of $66.80/mt. The LCFS is undergoing a significant change aimed at reducing carbon reduction targets and increasing the falling value of the credits, which have been declining.

The LCFS remains under review after amendments were not approved by the Office of Administrative Law on Feb. 18, 2025, giving the California Air Resources Board 120 days to amend them.

The price of SAF in California has averaged $6.74/gal so far in Q2, down from the $6.98/gal average in Q1, according to assessments from Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-21 01:56:08.178119

“Projected obligations should accurately reflect the availability of feedstocks and ongoing investments in production capacity,” the lawmakers wrote. “Now more than ever, it is essential to identify and promote opportunities, like the upcoming RVOs, that lower costs for consumers and support economic growth.

“Even before you took office, the EPA was months behind meeting the statutory deadline to set RVOs, which only exacerbated market instability,” they continued. “Domestic biofuel production facilities have already idled, and further delays in action could result in additional closures, putting Americans out of work and disrupting key markets for farmers.”

Within the letter, the House members note that strong RFS RVOs will lower prices at the pump while creating and maintaining U.S. biomanufacturing jobs and driving economic growth. “A strong RVO will also support market growth for farmers at a time when global markets are experiencing uncertainty. The domestic biofuels industry stands ready to increase availability of affordable fuels options and support the administration’s goal of American energy dominance,” the added.

The lawmakers ask Trump to ensure the implied RVO for conventional biofuel is set at least 15 billion gallons. The RVO for biomass-based diesel should be set at 5.25 billion gallons in 2026, increasing to higher levels in future years to reflect the rapid growth of renewable diesel and soybean processing capacity. In addition, the House members are urging Trump to reject any abuse of small refinery exemption (SRE) authority and ensure any legitimate SREs have their volumes accounted for in the RVOs to prevent lost demand in key markets for farmers.

The U.S. EPA has begun the rulemaking process to set the 2026 RVOs.

What is wind tunnel testing?
Wind tunnel testing is crucial for validating digital simulation and modelling.","New propulsion systems including the open fan could further increase the fuel efficiency of a next generation aircraft. Airbus and engine partner CFM International are testing an open fan demonstrator, part of CFM’s RISE program, to explore its aerodynamic profile, acoustic footprint and ease of integration.

Next-generation aircraft propulsion systems play a big part in the aviation industry’s net-zero ambition by 2050.The open fan engine architecture is one such promising technology. It combines the fuel economy of a turboprop with the performance and speed of a turbofan. Ahead of real-world flight testing, Airbus and engine partner CFM are running wind tunnel tests on an open fan demonstrator to examine its aerodynamic and acoustic performance.

Compatible with alternative energy sources

Designing a future Airbus aircraft starts with reducing its fuel consumption. Improved aerodynamics make a big contribution, but the propulsion system can make a significant difference too. The open fan’s aerodynamic profile, acoustic footprint and ease of integration will all be decisive when it becomes time to choose between this technology and its rival, the ultra-high bypass turbo fan.

To that end, for the last three years Airbus partner CFM (a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines) has been developing an open fan demonstrator through its RISE technology demonstration program, or Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines.

The RISE program’s goals include reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by more than 20% compared to today’s most efficient engines, as well as testing compatibility with alternative energy sources including sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and hydrogen. The programme is supported by funding from the European Clean Aviation framework, the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC), and CORAC, the French Civil Aviation Council.

Wind tunnel tests provide highly accurate data

Airbus has partnered with CFM to evaluate open fan’s potential for use on a future aircraft. Before flight testing can begin, the open fan architecture and its integration onto the aircraft are subjected to wind tunnel testing. This test phase deploys two ‘minimum body models’: a 1:5.5 scale model for high-speed testing and a 1:7 model for low-speed testing.

Each model is tested both alone and with a scale-model wing to evaluate how the two interact. For the low-speed model, testing is extended to high-lift devices such as flaps and slats. The tests are held at wind tunnels belonging to French aerospace lab ONERA (high speed) and DNW, a Dutch-German facility located in the Netherlands (low speed). Both produce highly accurate data.

The high-speed tests were run at ONERA in early 2024. They gathered experimental data, enabling researchers to study the models’ installation effects and propeller performance. Then tests replicating take-off and landing were conducted at DNW from September to late November 2024. They focused on the open fan’s aero-acoustic performance and interaction with high-lift devices.

As open fan engines are unducted (they dispense with the cowling of conventional jet engines), addressing the noise of their larger rotor blades requires innovative design choices and new technologies at engine and aircraft level. Nonetheless the engines must still conform to acoustic regulatory and certification requirements.

Towards flight testing

After over 500 hours of testing, this ‘minimum body’ campaign – just the first – is coming to an end. The next step is to assess how an open fan propulsion system affects aircraft performance, using 1:11 (high speed) and 1:14 (low speed) full aircraft models. These models will be tested at ONERA’s high-speed wind tunnel and Airbus’ low-speed facility in Filton, UK, in 2026. Their design and production is already in progress.

Open fan testing will meet full-scale reality by the end of the decade, when a fully functioning engine will be fitted to an A380 flight test aircraft operating out of Toulouse, France. The process of modifying the aircraft to host the engine has already begun.

What is wind tunnel testing?

Wind tunnel testing is crucial for validating digital simulation and modelling. By blowing air over scale models, engineers observe and measure the forces of lift and drag, as well as stability and control.

This helps them to identify potential design flaws and optimise the aircraft's shape for better performance and fuel efficiency, before a full-size, expensive prototype is built. Wind tunnels simulate various flight conditions, helping to ensure the aircraft can handle different speeds, altitudes, and even challenging weather, ultimately leading to safer skies.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102359/707893-bs2jiejxye-preview.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 17:56:08.373589

“Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

eFuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labor jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market.

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer, said:

The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,

“We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s eSAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

Currently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027. Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.

Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources, said:

We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,

“The United States has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.”

Infinium selected leading electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production1. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, said:

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,

“At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of eFuels into the market.”

Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield, said:

Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,

“We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”

The Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonizing and utilizing products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling eFuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today.

Supersonic flight over land remains banned in the United States.
Because these routes are nearly 100 percent over water, they avoid the legal issues tied to mainland supersonic travel.
The future of Hawaii travel may be faster, more expensive, and more divisive than ever.
Environmental groups and noise critics remain vocal, and some lawmakers have been reluctant to support supersonic travel even under the promise of new technology.","Imagine flying from LAX to Hawaii in just three hours. That’s the promise Boom Supersonic keeps dangling. With live engine tests underway on the Overture, the dream moved closer to the runway. But not everyone’s buying it.

Skeptics say it’s a billionaire fantasy. The plane hasn’t flown, and the engine isn’t certified. FAA approvals could take years—if they happen at all. Even longtime backers are raising eyebrows, with the company’s CEO calling for the TSA to be abolished.

Still, there’s momentum. Boom is betting on new air travel: faster, greener, smaller, and more exclusive. And Hawaii may become more central to that vision than anyone expected.

Why Hawaii could be first.

Boom’s route maps have mostly emphasized transatlantic flights. But when considering where the Overture can legally operate at supersonic speeds—over water, not land—Hawaii suddenly becomes one of the most realistic early markets.

Flights between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii meet several strategic needs: long stretches over the ocean, demand from premium leisure travelers, no speed limitation, and no overland restrictions like those that apply to domestic routes.

Supersonic flight over land remains banned in the United States. Until or unless that changes, Boom needs oceanic corridors—and the Pacific is wide open. That makes Hawaii a uniquely viable option, even if it isn’t the company’s original target.

Engine testing moves the vision forward.

Boom’s new Colorado Air and Space Port test site is upgrading to support the current engine development phase. These are no longer simulations. The company is now running live trials with real hardware, including core components of the Symphony engine.

Symphony will run exclusively on sustainable aviation fuel, which Boom says is essential to its long-term strategy. That detail could play especially well in Hawaii, where tourism officials have doubled down on green messaging, cultural responsibility, and environmental protections.

While engineers were firing up the engine, Boom’s CEO stirred a different reaction. In a recent interview, Blake Scholl said, “We don’t need the TSA.” His comment was part of a broader critique of airport security and a call for private solutions to serve high-speed, premium travelers better.

The backlash was immediate. Some travelers said they welcomed the idea of streamlined screening. Others called the remark reckless, especially from a startup still working through the FAA’s regulatory pipeline. In Hawaii, where airports like HNL and KOA already struggle with crowding, Scholl’s comment tapped into real frustrations. But for Boom, the timing may have added unnecessary political baggage.

Hawaii keeps coming up in discussions.

Boom says its first commercial flights could launch as early as 2029. United and American Airlines have placed orders, but no routes to Hawaii have been formally announced.

Even so, Hawaii keeps appearing in Boom’s ecosystem. It’s shown up in earlier marketing maps, investor briefings focused on overwater corridors, and performance metrics that match West Coast–Hawaii distances almost perfectly.

A flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu could take around three hours. San Francisco to Maui would be only slightly longer. Because these routes are nearly 100 percent over water, they avoid the legal issues tied to mainland supersonic travel.

A changing Hawaii air market.

The Hawaii travel landscape could look very different when Boom’s jet is certified and ready to fly. Hawaiian Airlines is in the process of being absorbed into Alaska. Southwest is pulling back on several routes. Widebody service is shrinking. Long-haul comfort is being redefined.

This opens up a potential lane for Boom. If Alaska continues exploring widebody flying and long-distance markets—something it’s already doing with Europe—then Hawaii could become part of a premium strategy later on. With fewer seats and higher fares, Boom’s aircraft could be a natural fit for routes that need yield, not volume.

What readers have said.

Our earlier Boom coverage brought in a broad mix of reader perspectives. One traveler, Chris, told us he’d gladly pay double if it meant reaching Maui in three hours, adding that the flight was always the worst part of the trip. Another, Maya, said she doubted this would ever become a real option for average travelers and saw it as something designed for CEOs and influencers.

This story resonates because of the tension between hopeful innovation and real-world skepticism. The future of Hawaii travel may be faster, more expensive, and more divisive than ever.

Hawaii’s environmental edge.

Symphony is designed to run exclusively on sustainable aviation fuel, and Boom has pledged to meet net-zero carbon targets. That emphasis could play well in Hawaii, where eco-conscious travel is becoming part of the state’s identity.

Hawaii is actively reshaping its marketing between green fees, restricted access to natural sites, and visitor education efforts. If Boom is looking for destinations that align with its sustainability messaging, the islands check several boxes.

What could still go wrong?

Boom’s progress is real, but the challenges remain substantial. The Overture jet hasn’t flown. The Symphony engine isn’t certified. FAA approvals for supersonic commercial service are still multiple years away. Public sentiment is mixed, and the overland flight ban is still in place, with no clear timeline for reversal.

Environmental groups and noise critics remain vocal, and some lawmakers have been reluctant to support supersonic travel even under the promise of new technology. While Boom’s approach is very different from the Concorde era, the path forward is anything but smooth.

Would you fly Boom to Hawaii?

Would you pay more to cut your Hawaii flight time in half? Or are you waiting to see if this is just another airline fantasy?",https://beatofhawaii.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1000000673.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 16:56:56.489576

This map helps operators locate SAF supply points globally, supporting the industry’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

Since its launch in 2021, the map has expanded rapidly. Initially, fewer than 20 locations were listed. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, the total reached 114. These sites are spread across 92 airports, with 47 in the US, 43 in Europe, and a handful in Asia and the Middle East. About 50 locations added SAF in 2024, including 15 in the first quarter alone.

Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR, called the expansion an important milestone. He emphasized that increased SAF availability makes decarbonization solutions more accessible for aircraft operators. Ricci added that tools like the SAF map and the Assure SAF Registry aim to encourage industry-wide adoption of sustainable fuels.

The Assure SAF Registry helps operators track and verify their SAF consumption. Proper documentation supports environmental claims and regulatory compliance. Nancy Bsales, COO of 4AIR, highlighted the rapid growth of SAF sites. She noted the industry’s strong commitment to reducing emissions and fostering sustainability.

Industry leaders expressed support for SAF adoption. Scott Cutshall of Clay Lacy said SAF is one of the most impactful ways to cut industry emissions. Beatrice Batty of Signature Aviation discussed efforts to build a comprehensive SAF supply chain in private aviation.

“We understand that the ReFuelEU mandate is aiming to help the environment, which is important, but it is not a one-size-fits-all regulation,” said Daniel Coetzer, CEO of Titan Aviation International.
We aim to help them ensure compliance, simplify the SAF uplift process, and enhance budget management.” The mandate has changed the fueling landscape, Coetzer said.
Titan is working to identify the airports that can provide the SAF and those that can provide regular Jet-A fuel.
“It puts out-of-scope operators at a financial disadvantage to have to pay for SAF uplift when they don’t need to,” Coetzer said.","GENEVA—Titan Aviation Fuels International has launched a program to help business aviation operators comply with Europe’s complex ReFuelEU mandate.

The mandate, introduced January 2025, requires operators who fly more than 500 flights a year to uplift a 2% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at airports designated under the requirement.

Titan, based in Geneva, Switzerland, is providing information about the mandate, monitoring which airports must comply with the 2% SAF requirement, advising operators when they need to be compliant then helping them show their compliance by breaking out the cost of SAF on their invoices, it says. Operators can also use it as a marketing tool to show their commitment to carbon reduction.

The mandate impacts more than 60 airports in the European Union.

“We understand that the ReFuelEU mandate is aiming to help the environment, which is important, but it is not a one-size-fits-all regulation,” said Daniel Coetzer, CEO of Titan Aviation International.

Instead, “it’s a complicated issue,” Coetzer tells Aviation Week Network.

SAF remains in short supply. That means some of the airports do not have the SAF blend available, although in those cases operators still pay for the 2% blend but don’t receive it.

“I think there was never made a provision for the probability when there is no SAF available at the airport,” Coetzer says. “Provision was supposed to be made that it can be exempted ... so they’re still paying the fee for right now.”

On the other hand, some airports with the 2% SAF mix available may have only offered that option, which means even operators who do not fall under the ReFuelEU mandate must pay for it.

“Our customers include operators obliged to comply with the mandate, operators that don’t need to uplift the 2% SAF but who don’t have a choice in doing so at many airports, and operators that would like to uplift a higher blend of SAF but cannot find it as the supply isn’t there,” Coetzer says. “We’re pleased to be providing our clients with comprehensive advice in such a complicated operating environment. We aim to help them ensure compliance, simplify the SAF uplift process, and enhance budget management.”

The mandate has changed the fueling landscape, Coetzer said.

Titan is working to identify the airports that can provide the SAF and those that can provide regular Jet-A fuel.

“It puts out-of-scope operators at a financial disadvantage to have to pay for SAF uplift when they don’t need to,” Coetzer said. “We are noting changes in European flight paths, as these operators fly to a different airport to avoid incurring extra fees. Of course, we want to make sure our customers are complying with the mandate where they must, but equally, we want to make sure our customers have alternative options when they don’t need to comply, particularly as there is no version of a claim-back service as yet.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-05-20 15:56:24.933203

These measures sit alongside the requirements under the SAF Mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 should be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040.

The government also published its response to its consultation on how the SAF revenue certainty mechanism will be funded on 14 May. The response details that government will proceed with the variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers, relative to their market share of fossil-based aviation turbine fuels.

Logistics UK responded to the consultation, welcoming a revenue certainty mechanism to help de-risk investment in production.

Ellis Shelton, Logistics UK's Senior Policy Advisor said: ""Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as a drop in fuel, is a vital alternative to traditional kerosene jet fuel, reducing aviation lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%. With no zero-emission alternative currently viable for long haul flight, SAF is the most significant opportunity to reduce aviation emissions in the medium term.

""SAF reduces carbon emissions but also lowers other harmful pollutants, such as particulate matter and sulphur oxides, contributing to better air quality around airports and reducing the aviation sector’s overall environmental impact.

""By integrating SAF into the fuel supply chain, and adopting higher SAF blends, the aviation industry can make significant progress towards achieving international climate targets and support the UK's commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

""Producing SAF domestically in the UK carries several economic and strategic advantages. First and foremost, producing SAF in the UK will increase availability, addressing a key concern around security of supplies, as well as helping to reduce overall costs as the industry is scaled up.

""Domestic production of SAF can have wider national benefits too, such as stimulating economic growth by creating new jobs across the supply chain, from feedstock production to fuel distribution. This has the potential to benefit local economies, particularly in rural areas where biomass feedstocks are sourced, and in industrial regions where new SAF production facilities are established.

""Domestic production enhances energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. By developing a domestic SAF industry, the UK can insulate itself from global oil price volatility and geopolitical risks associated with fossil fuel imports.

""Furthermore, investing in domestic SAF production has the potential to position the UK as a global leader in sustainable aviation, allowing for the influencing of international policies and markets. Logistics UK has been calling for government to invest in UK production of SAF to achieve these aims, most notably to support the aviation sector by both increasing availability and reducing the cost of SAF.

""The rapid advancement seen in the implementation of SAF has largely been driven by robust governmental support, which must be maintained and expanded by the next incoming government. Consistency in policy and regulation is vital to ensuring long-term planning and investment stability, ensuring SAF is more competitive with conventional jet fuel.

""SAF is now a proven technology and used in aircraft today, therefore attention must turn to addressing barriers around costs and increasing production to meet rising demands. It will be essential to expand feedstocks beyond HEFA, to include other sustainable sources such as waste. These options should be explored without passing along costs to industry. The government must maintain pace with the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM), whilst also progressing the SAF mandate within the legislative process, to ensure that combined, both can help deliver the necessary UK SAF market.

""A key challenge for emerging SAF projects is the uncertainty of revenue streams, which can deter investment and hinder the growth of the industry. Implementing a SAF revenue certainty mechanism is crucial to reducing financial risks and attracting investment. A revenue certainty mechanism should be delivered earlier than Q4 2026, given the SAF mandate will be introduced from 2025.

""By ensuring revenue certainty, investors will have greater confidence in the long-term viability of SAF projects, leading to increased capital inflow and faster development of production facilities. This, in turn, helps to build a robust SAF supply chain, reduce production costs through economies of scale and achieve widespread adoption of SAF across the aviation sector.""

Accra, May 20, GNA – The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is set to begin feasibility studies on Ghana’s capacity to develop and produce Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

If successful, the studies will enable Ghana to begin developing and producing SAF as an alternative to fossil fuels.

Speaking at the two-day Capacity Building for SAF workshop in Accra on Tuesday, Madam Juliet Okine, Deputy Director-General for Finance and Administration, Ghana Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) expressed optimism that the feasibility studies would be successful to pave the way for SAF development.

She said that Ghana could develop and produce SAF to reduce airline dependence on fossil fuels because the feedstock, used cooking oil, and waste materials, essential for SAF production, are abundant in Ghana.

“The country has what it takes to promote SAF production.

“Ghana Civil Aviation Authority, as the agency of the Ministry of Transport responsible for regulating aviation in Ghana, remains optimistic that the feasibility studies will be successful,” she said.

The workshop, organised by GCAA in collaboration with ICAO, aimed to provide technical assistance to Ghana in harnessing its capabilities for SAF development and deployment.

It forms part of ICAO’s Assistance Capability Building and Training for SAF (ACT SAF) project, funded by the United Kingdom.

Madam Okine urged ministries including Finance, Food and Agriculture, Environment, Energy, and Green Transition to support GCAA in achieving its goals.

She noted that SAF development would create jobs, business opportunities for youth, and promote sustainable economic growth.

Mr. Joseph Bukari Nikpe, Minister of Transport, said aviation was a major contributor to global carbon emissions, posing threats to the environment, economy, and future generations.

ICAO estimates that aviation contributes two to three per cent of global carbon emissions.

Mr. Nikpe stressed the need for proactive measures to transition towards cleaner, sustainable fuels.

“SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel,” he said.

“It can power today’s aircraft engines without modification, making it an immediate and viable solution for greener air travel,” Mr. Nikpe added.

He called on the private sector to actively participate in the SAF project.

Mr. Cesar Velarde, ICAO ACT-SAF Project Coordinator, described SAF as both an environmental and socio-economic opportunity for Ghana.

For the next two days, industry stakeholders and government officials will meet to identify challenges affecting SAF production.

He also pledged ICAO’s assistance in helping Ghana realise its SAF goals.

“This workshop is just the kick-off of a six-month assistance project that will consist of a first feasibility study for SAF,” he said.

Mr. John Dumelo, Deputy Minister of Food and Agriculture, lauded the initiative, noting that SAF development would create new value chains in agriculture, stimulating demand for energy crops and agricultural residues.

“Our Ministry stands ready to work with GCAA, the Ministry of Energy, ICAO, and other partners to assess the availability and sustainability of agricultural feedstock for SAF production,” he said.

Mr. Hassan Tampuli, a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Road and Transport assured GCAA and ICAO of Parliament’s commitment to supporting SAF with the necessary legislation to maximise its benefits.

What is the new Fastmarkets European SAF price, announced by Fastmarkets?
Why is it the right time to launch a European SAF assessment?
Why is Fastmarkets’ SAF assessment Northwest Europe-based?
What is the methodology behind the Fastmarkets SAF spot price assessment?","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable fuel that can replace jet fuel – derived from crude oil. That makes it a key part of the fight to decarbonize our transportation networks, with the aviation sector a small but rapidly growing contributor of carbon emissions, but one that is difficult to abate as alternative propulsion methods are likely to be decades away.

As such, carbon reduction schemes and the fuel itself are at the forefront of efforts to lead on reducing the environmental impact of commercial flight. Governments across the world are investigating ways to decarbonize aviation, but it is the European Union that has taken the lead by setting an expectation that the bloc will be carbon neutral by 2050 and implementing an ambitious pathway of mandates to drive adoption.

As such, the expected growth in demand for SAF between now and 2050 is likely to bring profound consequences for the feedstock slate – the combination of waste-based or vegetable oil-based fats that are expected to be swept into the SAF production process.

What is the new Fastmarkets European SAF price, announced by Fastmarkets?

Fastmarkets recognises that such dramatic change needs effective pricing markers to enable those caught up in this transition to be able to understand the impact of price movements across regions, feedstocks and production margins. Reliable pricing information enables informed choices and paves the way for effective risk management solutions.

The value of a commodity can be established through analysis of physical price indications, or in other ways, such as calculating input and production costs to establish a finished product price. Fastmarkets is proposing to launch its first European SAF price based on a cost-of-production model, backed by the superior coverage of relevant feedstocks, which is the backbone of Fastmarkets agriculture and biofuel feedstock offerings.

This also aligns with our existing trio of US-based SAF prices, where we are already publishing a base cost assessment for ex-works US Gulf SAF, delivered Los Angeles SAF and delivered Chicago SAF.

What are the challenges in serving the developing SAF market with price assessments?

In a fast-evolving market such as SAF, there are challenges to capturing pricing data when a spot market – the physical market where excess supply can be traded – is relatively small and nascent, or where there are few players actively trading small volumes. Price reporting agencies such as Fastmarkets typically look for physical indications with bids, offers and confirmed trades providing evidence of where values are trading. By establishing a clear methodology, traders and other market participants can be confident that the price reflects an impartial view of those transactions

However, when a market is evolving rapidly, pricing information may be limited or only reflect buying patterns of a handful of counterparties, meaning that the price can be prone to sharp fluctuations. Under those circumstances, alternative ways of establishing a credible value can also be pursued, such as establishing a cost-of-production model, or an origin plus freight calculation.

What is the difference between a calculated price and an assessed price?

Fastmarkets has chosen to launch a calculated price to serve the European SAF market, allowing a transparent value to be established based on the assessed values of key feedstocks. We believe that this is the right solution for the current stage of the evolving European SAF market and allows Fastmarkets to establish an indicative price that is still grounded in real-world inputs and reflects a dynamic market. A calculated price ensures a regular, predictable, and logical assessment, but will not capture the dynamics of supply and demand that could result in a much higher or much lower price.

An assessed price is predicated on being able to capture enough pricing information from buyers, sellers, traders, and producers to power a transparent assessment under an agreed methodology. That price would consequently reflect dynamics of supply and demand and would likely price sometimes well below the cost of production, and sometimes well above it, according to market conditions. However, a reliable assessment would require access to a wide range of physical indications that can be transparently cross-checked and validated with trade sources. Until the market has reached that level of maturity, there is a risk that an assessed price could show dramatic swings.

Why is it the right time to launch a European SAF assessment?

From January 1, 2025, the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation policy entered into effect, requiring all European Union airports to ensure that a minimum of 2% of the overall supply of jet fuel supplied into departing aircraft with be SAF. The EU describes the increased use of SAF in the bloc’s aviation fuel supply as the “single most powerful tool to decrease aviation CO2 emissions.”

The mandate is expected to increase every five years through to 2050, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, 34% in 2040, before a final push raises the target to 42% in 2045 and finally 70% by 2050 – a mandate that would amount to millions of tonnes of SAF production and consumption in less than three decades.

While the mandate promotes both conventional jet fuel and so-called efuels – synthetic fuels achieved through complex production processes that blend carbon with hydrogen – the vast majority of the early stages of the EU mandate will have to be met through fuels that are reliant upon used cooking oils, tallows and other animal fats potentially alongside other crop-based vegetable oil or corn oils, where permitted.

Who should be interested in the launch?

Primarily, the launch should be of interest to those within the aviation sector – particularly airlines, aircraft operators and the wider freight and logistics industry, along with agriculture and energy trading companies, conventional oil and gas majors, airports and airport infrastructure, biofuel producers, transport and energy analysts and other players active in the renewable energy transition.

Further out, everyone that is currently using feedstocks identified as ‘waste-based’ will also be increasingly affected by this transition, such as packaged food or pet food producers, conventional biofuel producers, renderers, aircraft and engine makers, regulatory and government agencies and anyone else using the major feedstocks that will be pulled into the SAF production pool.

Why should they be interested?

The growth of demand for SAF will have profound implications for the current trade flows around mineral jet fuel, SAF and the typical feedstocks as they are pulled into the increasing production of renewable fuels. It will disrupt feedstocks in existing biofuel production and have a significant impact on anyone using feedstocks for any other purpose.

In turn, these changes will have a knock-on effect for a range of staple business activities from long term procurement planning, and carbon reduction strategies through to compliance with regulations. The changes will also have a major impact on risk management strategies.

Why is Fastmarkets’ SAF assessment Northwest Europe-based?

Geolocating the assessment in Northwest Europe means that we are able to provide a pivotal production, supply and logistics hub in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region, while also capturing demand side economics stemming from some of wider Europe’s busiest airports at Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London.

What is the methodology behind the Fastmarkets SAF spot price assessment?

Fastmarkets is proposing to use a calculated cost-of-production model to establish a price for European SAF basis the Rotterdam region. The assessment will combine Fastmarkets own assessments of key feedstocks such as used cooking oil and tallow with assumed costs for major inputs such as hydrogen.

Oil spills remain one of the most pressing environmental threats for the sea. The largest marine oil spill ever, the Deepwater Horizon slick in the Gulf of Mexico, spilled more than 134 million gallons of oil into the ocean.

Closer to home, oil spills are also a threat in the Netherlands too, particularly in the country’s ports and small waterways. These incidents pose risks to local ecosystems and demand swift action to minimise their impact. Traditional response methods – although effective – are often time-consuming, especially when a rapid cleanup can mean the difference between a minor incident and a major ecological disaster.

Recognising the urgent need for progress in the field, FruitPunch AI launched the ‘AI Against Oil Spills’ project, in collaboration with Rijkswaterstaat, the Dutch government body responsible for water management. The aim of the project was to try and understand how artificial intelligence could accelerate and improve oil spill detection and management in open seas, in ports and in inland waterways.

AI Against Oil Spills

To understand the opportunity for improvement, it is first key to understand the current way of working. Rijkswaterstaat currently deploys drone teams to capture aerial images of oil spills. Experts then manually review these images to estimate the volume of each spill, helping them determine the best cleanup strategy.

But this manual process is far from fast. While some inland spills can be assessed quickly using contextual information, spills at sea often require full segmentation of the affected area, an exercise that can take several hours. In a situation where time can be of critical importance, every minute lost is a missed opportunity to protect the environment and can spell the difference between a minor or major ecological disaster.

Valcon joined the ‘AI Against Oil Spills’ project, fielding a team of data experts to explore how they could potentially use AI for detecting oil spills and to improve the cleanup work at Rijkswaterstaat. The vision was to create an automated, AI-driven process that could replace manual inspection with real-time analysis, which could save hours of expert time and enable faster intervention.

A leading consulting firm with offices across Europe, Valcon developed a proof of concept to explore how to significantly reduce the time required to analyse drone imagery and estimate spill volumes. The proof of concept was developed through a three-stage approach:

Stage one: preparing the data

Like many real-world AI projects, the first hurdle was the data itself. The aerial images collected were not fully labelled and the scope of oil spills were often difficult to distinguish due to poor contrast or unclear boundaries. The Valcon team processed and edited the images to enhance the visibility of the oil, then manually re-labelled them to create a high-quality dataset suitable for machine learning.

Stage two: training the model

Next, Valcon trained several AI models to perform image segmentation, teaching the system to detect and outline oil spills from drone footage. The models learned to recognise patterns and textures indicative of oil, providing a visual map of the spill area in each image.

Stage three: estimating spill volume

The Valcon and Fruitpunch AI team developed a method to estimate spill volume based on the segmented images. By incorporating image metadata, such as drone altitude and camera settings, the AI could calculate a reliable volume estimate. Meaning that when a new drone image is uploaded, the AI tool can automatically outline the spill and calculate the volume within minutes.

The proof of concept

The proof of concept has demonstrated major potential for value added. The first major benefit is the speeding up of spill estimation. What currently takes hours could be done in minutes. The new AI-driven model provides Rijkswaterstaat with rapid volume estimates, enabling quicker and more targeted clean-up operations, which helps protect sensitive waterways before the damage spreads.

The second advantage of the proof of concept is the improvement of data collection. Valcon identified improvements to drone image collection that could boost the AI's accuracy, factors such as the shoreline comprising around 30% of the frame of each image, which could serve as reference points to locate the spill.

And while the model achieves around 70% accuracy in oil spill detection, it can help to guide the team, helping them make quicker decisions and hopefully reduce inspection time and enable faster environmental response.

AI to the use

“We are delighted to have supported FruitPunch AI and Rijkswaterstaat with the proof of concept. It showcases the powerful role AI could play in solving real-world environmental challenges, and how technology and human expertise can come together to co-create unique innovations.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-05-20-114910341-Using_AI_to_better_detect_and_tackle_oil_spills_in_open_seas_and_inland_waterways_spot.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 12:57:25.417643

The project, which includes investors Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, is located in Reeves County, Texas, near the city of Pecos.

The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

eFuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labor jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market.

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

“The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer. “We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s eSAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

Currently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027. Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.

""We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,” said Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources. “The United States has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.""

Infinium selected leading electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production1. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,” said Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. “At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of eFuels into the market.”

“Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,” said Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield. “We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”

The Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonizing and utilizing products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling eFuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today.

France consults on expanded biofuels mandate

London, 15 May (Argus) — France has opened consultation on the transposition of part of the recast renewable energy directive (RED III) into national law, which would replace the current system with a new one called ""incentive for the reduction of the carbon intensity of fuels"" (IRICC). The proposal introduces two separate sets of requirements for transport fuels. The first is for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, broken down by transport sectors — road, aviation, maritime, LPG and natural gas for vehicles, which could be CNG or LNG (see table). In the current draft, the GHG reduction target for the road sector will start at 5.9pc in 2026, rising to 10.6pc in 2030 and 18.7pc in 2035. For aviation, the target starts at 2.5pc in 2026, rising to 5.8pc in 2030 and 18.8pc in 2035. The GHG mandate levels include a gradual phasing-in of new fuel sectors – river and maritime fuels, fuel gasses, and aviation. To meet the overall RED III target of 14.5pc emissions reduction by 2030, the national French target includes the biofuels mandates, a share for rail transport, and a share or private vehicle charging. The second set of requirements is a renewable fuel requirement by energy content, which is broken down by fuel type — diesel, gasoline, LPG and natural gas fuels and marine fuel (see table). The blending requirements for diesel start at 9pc in 2026, rising to 11.4pc in 2030 and 16pc in 2035. For gasoline, the mandates start at 9.5pc in 2026, rising to 10.5pc in 2030 and 14.5pc in 2035. Finally, the proposal includes a set of sub-mandates for advanced fuels and renewable hydrogen . The advanced biofuels mandate would start at 0.7pc in 2026, rising to 1.95pc in 2030 and 2.6pc in 2035. Users of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) would not be subject to the advanced sub-mandate. In feedstock restrictions, the crop cap will rise to 7pc from 6.2pc in 2030 and 2035, while the limit for fuels made from feedstocks found in Annex IX-B of RED will be at 0.6pc in 2026, 0.7pc in 2030 and 1pc in 2035 for diesel and petrol. Aviation fuel will not have a IX-B cap until 2030, and from then it will be 6pc. Mandate compliance would be managed by a certificate system through the CarbuRe registry, with a compliance deadline of 1 March the following year. Public electric vehicle charging would also generate tickets, although the amount of tickets generated by charging light passenger vehicles would be reduced from 2031 to reach 50pc in 2035. Renewable hydrogen used in transport would also generate tickets counting towards the hydrogen sub-quota and reduce the overall GHG savings requirement. Public charging stations will start generating fewer tickets for electric passenger vehicles from 2031 to 50pc by 2035. France is also considering steep penalties for non-compliance, at €700/t CO2 not avoided for the GHG reduction requirement and at €40/GJ for the fuel targets. The penalty for not meeting hydrogen and advanced fuel sub-targets would be doubled, at €80/GJ. The consultation is open for comments until 10 June.

UK ethanol sector sees lower prices from US trade deal

London, 14 May (Argus) — The UK ethanol sector expects prices to fall because of the recent trade deal with the US, but participants are divided on the scale of the effect. The trade deal has cut import duties on US ethanol to zero on higher volumes than recent import levels, raising the prospect of large amounts of US product crossing the Atlantic. The UK was the second largest destination for US ethanol exports in 2024, taking more than 923mn l, or 13pc of all exports, according to US industry group Renewable Fuels Association. The UK imposed a duty of £16/hectolitre ($21/hectolitre) for undenatured ethanol and £8.50/hectolitre for denatured ethanol, which the trade deal will remove. Zero tariffs will be applied to up to 1.4bn l/yr. European renewable ethanol association ePure told Argus the deal presents a ""huge problem"" for UK and EU ethanol producers, a view echoed by some UK market participants. But some active in the UK ethanol market have said that while they do not expect greater amounts of ethanol to arrive in the country, they do anticipate lower prices and lower domestic production. The operators of the UK's two major ethanol-producing facilities, Vivergo and Cropenergies, said there will be zero tariffs on ""the size of the UK's whole ethanol market"", and said they may have to close. According to Argus data the total UK production capacity for wheat-based ethanol is over 736mn l/yr. The National Farmers' Union expressed concern about the deal's effect on arable farmers, and said it is ""working through what this means for the viability of the domestic bioethanol production."" Although a healthy share of the total import pool from the US is waste-based, the UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing the main waste feedstock imported from the US as eligible for double counting under its renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO). Staging post UK producers may still seek to maximise imports from the US for onward export into the EU. The current EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) allows for zero tariffs and quotas on all trade of UK and EU goods that comply with appropriate rules or origin. But with this new deal, there is an increased chance of US ethanol entering the EU via the UK, Epure said. ""Under existing customs rules US ethanol can be mixed with UK ethanol and thus avoid an EU duty,"" it said. This may include major proportion, which limits the share of non-originating materials to claim UK origin, or inward processing relief, which allows for imports to be processed without paying import duties or value added tax (VAT) before re-export. Some market participants contested the extent to which UK-EU flows of ethanol with partial US origin might happen, suggesting the imported ethanol would need to undergo a significant chemical change to be classified as duty free, such as being used as feedstock for products including ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). EPure said the EU should be wary, and called for ethanol to be included in a final list of products subject to EU countermeasures, as it was in a recent proposal from the bloc currently under public consultation.

Ampol imports Australia's largest SAF cargo into Sydney

Sydney, 14 May (Argus) — Australian fuel retailer and refiner Ampol imported a cargo of nearly 2mn litres (700t) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into Sydney Airport on 7 May, marking the largest ever commercial SAF import into Australia. The fuel — sourced from Malaysia — was imported into Ampol's Kurnell facility near Sydney Airport, where the former's oil refinery has direct pipeline access into the airports refuelling the supply chain. There are no plans to import more SAF cargoes into Sydney Airport in the near term, a source close to the matter said. Ampol's managing director and chief executive officer, Matthew Halliday, said ""this delivery marks Ampol's first major import of SAF into Australia and leverages our advanced supply chain infrastructure to deliver this product directly from a key domestic fuel terminal to the nation's busiest airport."" Sydney Airport accounts for nearly 40pc of Australia's total jet fuel consumption, according to the airport's chief executive officer Scott Charlton. The announcement came a day after Ampol said it is shifting its focus to electric vehicle charging and renewable fuels , by selling its electricity retail businesses in Australia and New Zealand. Australian airline Qantas is the end user of the imported SAF cargo.The fuel, once blended at a ratio of approximately 18pc, could power the equivalent of 900 flights from Sydney to Auckland on Qantas 737 aircraft, Qantas said. This will cut resulting carbon emissions from those flights by a total estimated 3,400t, it added. Qantas is targeting 10pc of its fuel use to come from SAF by 2030 and approximately 60pc by 2050. Qantas' chief executive officer Vanessa Hudson said ""the creation of a SAF industry is key to our efforts towards the decarbonisation of aviation, increasing Australia's fuel security and creating thousands of new jobs across our economy … we pick up 70pc of our fuel in Australia so we're looking forward to working closely with the government to chart the next course for SAF in Australia."" This import of SAF follows the signing of an initial agreement between Qantas and Sydney Airport to work together to further facilitate the development of a domestic SAF industry in Australia. If established, domestic SAF production has the potential to contribute approximately A$13bn/yr ($8.4bn/yr) in gross domestic product by 2040, while supporting nearly 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain and creating 5,000 new jobs to build and run the facilities, according to a Qantas and Airbus ICF report published in 2023. Consultations on a potential biofuels mandate in New South Wales (NSW) are expected to begin in the near future. NSW minister for climate change, energy and environment, Penny Sharpe, said ""we want to see a strong domestic SAF industry here in NSW, which is a win-win for jobs, fuel security and the planet"".

🟦 6) Green Hydrogen Applications Green hydrogen has several important applications.
First, green hydrogen can be subjected to liquefaction, resulting in green liquid hydrogen.
Furthermore, captured CO₂ can also undergo methanation with green hydrogen, leading to the production of e-methane (CH₄).
Lastly, captured CO₂ can react with green hydrogen via the Fischer-Tropsch process, resulting in e-kerosene, an ASTM D7566-qualified fuel.","From Hydrogen to SAF Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the production pathways of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). 🟦 1) Why Hydrogen? Decarbonized hydrogen produces no CO₂ and can reduce non-CO₂ emissions and persistent contrails. As production costs decline with increasing industry acceptance, hydrogen's versatility allows it to be used as Sustainable Aviation Fuel or directly in aircraft by 2050. 🟦 2) Hydrogen Application The HEFA process encompasses various catalytic reaction mechanisms, which require hydrogen as an input. In a similar fashion, the ATJ process also requires hydrogen for its operation. Conversely, the Fischer Tropsch processes do not need hydrogen when utilising biomass feedstock, like forestry residues or municipal solid waste (MSW). However, hydrogen is crucial when the feedstock is comprised of CO₂. 🟦 3) E-Fuels from CO₂ 1- Synthesis gas generation via eREACT RWGS H₂ ➕ CO₂ [Captured] ⇒ H₂O ➕ CO 2- Fischer-Tropsch Process 2nH₂ ➕ nCO ⇒ nH₂O ➕ (-CH₂-)n 3- Hydrocracking H₂ ➕ (-CH₂-)n ⇒ 2(-CH₂-)1/2n 🟦 4) e-fuel from Hydrogen and CO₂ E-fuel can be produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The process begins with water and renewable electricity, which undergoes electrolysis using solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOEC) to generate hydrogen and captured carbon. This is followed by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, leading to hydrocracking to create G2L e-fuels (FT-SPK). Hydroprocessing G2LTM then refines the products to produce e-jet fuel, e-diesel, and e-naphtha, which meet ASTM standards D975 and EN15940. 🟦 5) Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC) for eSAF production SOEC (Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells) represents the most efficient electrolyzer available, boasting a 30% increase in efficiency through heat integration compared to alkaline and PEM systems. Constructed from non-precious materials, its scalability does not raise concerns over material scarcity or cost escalation. Besides steam electrolysis, SOEC also converts CO₂ into carbon monoxide (eCO), enhancing carbon capture and enabling the production of e-fuels such as eJet, e-Diesel, and methanol. 🟦 6) Green Hydrogen Applications Green hydrogen has several important applications. First, green hydrogen can be subjected to liquefaction, resulting in green liquid hydrogen. Second, when nitrogen (N₂) combines with green hydrogen through the Haber-Bosch process, it produces ammonia (NH₃). Additionally, captured carbon dioxide (CO₂) can react with green hydrogen to synthesize e-methanol (CH₃OH). Furthermore, captured CO₂ can also undergo methanation with green hydrogen, leading to the production of e-methane (CH₄). Lastly, captured CO₂ can react with green hydrogen via the Fischer-Tropsch process, resulting in e-kerosene, an ASTM D7566-qualified fuel. Source: → see post image.

(NYSE: FDX) provides customers and businesses worldwide with a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services.","MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 20, 2025 — FedEx (NYSE: FDX) today announced an agreement with Neste, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, securing more than three million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for delivery at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to the world’s largest express cargo airline. Through this agreement, FedEx has purchased blended fuel from Neste, to include a minimum of 30% neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. As used in its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly a fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX* and is the largest SAF purchase executed by a U.S. cargo airline at LAX to-date. Delivery of the fuel began earlier this month and will continue over the next year.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions. As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial U.S. deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” said Richard Smith, chief operating officer, International, and chief executive officer, Airline, FedEx. “While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed—alongside other innovations—we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

“Neste is excited to work with FedEx and support their ambitious goal of reaching carbon-neutral operations by 2040 with our SAF. Recognizing the important role of air cargo in the global economy, FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation,” says Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This fuel purchase by FedEx builds upon years of the company’s efforts to co-create innovative sustainable aviation technologies with other industry leaders, including the ecoDemonstrator flight-test program with Boeing—the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100% SAF in both engines that was conducted in 2018. In addition to the procurement of SAF, FedEx is pursuing multiple avenues to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption in its aviation operations overall, including aircraft fleet modernization, fuel conservation initiatives, and flight planning optimization. Collectively, fleet modernization and fuel saving efforts enabled FedEx in fiscal year 2024 to successfully achieve its goal of a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. FedEx set its first aviation emissions intensity reduction goals back in 2008.

Sustainable aviation fuel, explained

Sustainable aviation fuel is a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel, largely driven by lower emissions from the feedstocks used in the fuel production process. Neat SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel before use and is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works within existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure without any equipment updates.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

While SAF production continues to grow in the U.S. and internationally, SAF accounted for less than 1% of all global jet fuel production in 2024. Amid the need for greater alternative fuel availability and accessibility for all airlines, FedEx will continue to advocate for expanded production and highlight SAF’s potential environmental and economic benefits.

Located in Pecos, Project Roadrunner is expected to be the world’s largest commercial green hydrogen-based SAF project from 2027.

Infinium said it “reached financial close” last September, following investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

Yesterday, Infinium selected Electric Hydrogen’s 100 MW PEM electrolyser plant for its flagship project. However, contract details were thin, with no information shared on how many plants will be provided, the timeline or the nature of the agreement.

The Roadrunner initiative is set to supply e-fuels to International Airlines Group (IAG), which owns British Airways, Iberia and more, under a 10-year deal.

Furthermore, the plant will be supported by 150 megawatts of new wind generation capacity from a NextEra Energy subsidiary under a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).

Project Roadrunner builds on the platform of Project Pathfinder, Infinium’s first commercial facility in Corpus Christi. In 2023, the company became the first to produce and ship commercial volumes of e-fuels to customers.

Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle said the start of construction will help ensure the US “remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

Construction begins as the US clean fuels industry faces growing uncertainty.

A House committee recently approved a tax package that would repeal the 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit, setting the stage for a congressional debate.

Under the proposal, hydrogen projects beginning construction after 31 December 2025 would no longer be eligible, severely undercutting the long-term value of the credit.

Infinium’s project, however, has broken ground ahead of the deadline.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/Screenshot-2025-05-20-at-10.53.50.png",N,,2025-05-20 11:58:16.992857

I thank the Supervisory Board for their trust and the opportunity to lead OMV into a new era.
It fills me with respect and pride looking at the achievements and the progress made across the OMV Group.”","After steering OMV since 2021 through what Lutz Feldmann, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of OMV Aktiengesellschaft referred to as ‘times of great challenge’ with ‘exceptional leadership’, OMV CEO and chairman of the executive board Alfred Stern has announced he will not seek reappointment to another term at the end of his current term on 31 August 31 2026.

“I deeply regret his personal decision. With Alfred Stern, we are losing a CEO who has positioned the OMV Group for the future with a clear, forward-looking vision,” said Feldmann. As CEO, Stern initiated the most extensive transformation in OMV’s corporate history, he added. “During his current term, he has pursued this path with consistency and remarkable success, achieving a series of historic milestones.”

Stern was name CEO of the OMV Group on 1 September 2021. He also holds the positions of Chairman of the Supervisory Boards of OMV Petrom and Borealis, and is a Board of Directors member at Air Products and Chemicals in Allentown, USA. Under Stern’s leadership, OMV has taken significant strides toward becoming an integrated company focused on sustainable chemicals, fuels, and energy, emphasising innovative solutions in the circular economy. Sustainability has been deeply integrated into the Group's strategy as a critical driver of innovation and growth. Despite a challenging geopolitical climate, Stern has adeptly accelerated the company’s strategic transformation and laid a solid foundation for its future.

During his tenure, Alfred Stern played an instrumental role in realising the landmark transaction of Borouge Group International (BGI) in partnership with ADNOC. This initiative resulted in the creation of a global polyolefin company valued at approximately USD 60 billion, representing a major advancement in OMV’s chemical strategy and offering a promising platform for future growth.

Under Stern's guidance, OMV achieved several strategic milestones, including effective management of the energy crisis by diversifying its gas portfolio and reducing reliance on single-source supplies. The company also invested in Neptun Deep in Romania, Europe's largest natural gas development project, and advanced flagship innovation projects such as ReOil (chemical recycling), the deeep joint venture (geothermal energy), and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“Together with my Executive Board colleagues and our employees, we are pursuing the shared goal of reinventing essentials for sustainable living — always with a focus on our customers and their security of supply,” Stern commented. “Our transformation is on track, and we have reached significant milestones that enable long-term economic success and sustainable growth.

Swiss startup Metafuels will develop a synthetic SAF plant in Rotterdam, aiming to scale greener jet fuel production in Europe.

Swiss aviation tech firm Metafuels AG is set to develop a new synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) plant at the Port of Rotterdam. The project, named Turbe, marks a significant step in the commercial rollout of Metafuels’ proprietary aerobrew methanol-to-jet technology.

Evos’ partnership enables scalable Sustainable Aviation Fuel production

Metafuels is partnering with Evos to integrate the plant into its existing Rotterdam terminal. Evos is a major European player in liquid energy and chemical storage, operating the continent’s largest ethanol storage facility and a key multimodal methanol hub.

Turbe will initially produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day, with a second phase targeting a tenfold increase to 120,000 litres daily. This expansion follows Metafuels’ 2024 announcement of its Denmark-based Pizol facility.

The company has raised $22 million since its founding, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, positioning it among Europe’s best-funded SAF startups.

Metafuels’ aerobrew process converts bio- or e-methanol into jet fuel with high energy efficiency and up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions. As a drop-in fuel, it is compatible with current aircraft and infrastructure, offering a scalable solution for aviation decarbonisation.

“The aviation sector accounts for over 2% of global CO2 emissions,” the company noted, highlighting the importance of e-SAF in climate mitigation. Bio-methanol can be derived from biological waste, while e-methanol uses renewable electricity and captured carbon.

The Rotterdam project supports EU decarbonisation goals under initiatives such as RefuelEU Aviation and CORSIA. Europe is expected to lead in e-fuel adoption, with the EU’s synthetic SAF sub-mandate rising from 1.2% in 2030 to 35% by 2050.

Metafuels CEO Saurabh Kapoor said: “This first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward… Europe has ambitious decarbonisation targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Evos Rotterdam MD Christiaan Kop added: “We are poised to support the deployment of Metafuels’ sustainable aviation fuel project.”

Port of Rotterdam CEO Boudewijn Siemons concluded: “This development contributes to the climate goals for aviation and further strengthens Rotterdam’s position as a leading hub for renewable fuels.”",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2320824307-1-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 06:56:53.511909

Paris-Orly Airport Facing Delays After Technical Issue

The Authority has also advised airlines to cut their flights down by 15% to alleviate the workload on Paris ‘second’ airport – following asking for a 40% reduction on Sunday.

In a statement, the DGCA said:

“The situation is improving. Despite these preventive measures, delays are expected.”

Paris-Orly predominantly focuses on internal and European flights, and with around 130 flights to Portugal, Spain, and Southern France being affected, the delays and cancellations will have a marked effect on the airport.

The good news is that, following specific cancellations to Porto, Helsinki, and Rome, amongst others this morning, fewer flights appeared to be delayed this afternoon.

Advice for Travellers

Under EU law, passengers will receive a refund for cancelled flights.

However, passengers will be unlikely to receive any further compensation for cancelled services at Paris-Orly. This is because airlines will argue that the air traffic control was under ‘extraordinary circumstances’ and that could not be avoided.

Meanwhile, any passengers facing a delay overnight, are obliged to contact their airline, who may find and pay for accommodation overnight.

More About Paris-Orly Airport

Initially home to two large Airship Hangars, Paris-Orly was opened as Villeneuve-Orly Airport in 1932.

During World War Two, the airport was occupied by the Luftwaffe, and predominantly used by both fighters and bombers, throughout the war.

Following the Allied victory, allied control was handed to the United States Army Air Force, before being returned to French control in 1947.

By 1958, Pan-Am, TWA, and Air France were regularly flying commercial flights to as far afield as New York, Los Angeles, and Tokyo.

Always considerably smaller than Charles de Gaulle Airport, with 33.1 million passengers in 2024 compared to Charles de Gaulle’s 70 million, the airport has seen a number of issues and difficulties in recent years.

In 2015, during foggy weather, the system used to communicate with pilots during adverse weather failed. As a result, with pilots unable to communicate with the airport, flights were cancelled and the airport briefly suspended operation.

Finally, in 2020, Paris-Orly was closed entirely during the Covid-19 Pandemic, with flights redirected to Charles de Gaulle for the duration of France’s lockdown.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Aeroport_Orly_Ouest_2011_04-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:13.058791

The son of a Finnair pilot, Kuusisto has a long history at the helm of successful businesses, not least the Finnish postal service. However, running the fifth oldest surviving airline (101 years old this year) has not come without its challenges and, in an enjoyable fireside chat, The Aviation Club UK’s James McCarthy dug into what Kuusisto had learnt in his first 12 months at the airline.

So close to Russia

Finland is in a unique geographical position, sharing a border with Russia but now effectively what Kuusisto referred to as “an island,” following the closure of Russian airspace due to its ongoing military aggression in Ukraine.

Although the invasion predated his time at Finnair, Kuusisto discussed the initial effect it had had on the airline. “We were just bouncing back after the pandemic and preparing to relaunch the pre-Covid services that provided the shortest connections between Europe and Asia,” he told the audience. “We were looking forward to near 2019 levels of demand but then faced another unforeseen existential crisis.”

The airline’s priority was to take immediate action to secure the safety of employees and crew and many of its aircraft were grounded immediately. “Many of our long-haul flights towards Asia leave during the evening,” Kuusisto explained, “and in a very short period of time, the decision was made to cancel all those flights. Only thereafter could we start to evaluate the effect of the so-called New World Order and plan to reconstruct the airline’s strategy.”

Many airline leaders are pessimistic about the possibility of Russian airspace opening in the near to medium-term. When pressed on the matter, Kuusisto described himself as “a realist, not a pessimist,” pointing out that “there was speculation about the opening of Russian airspace when the so-called Ukrainian peace process was first discussed but, unfortunately, very little has happened since.”

“My very decisive guidance to my organisation has been to ensure that our strategy, commercial approach and network design must contribute value, even if Russian airspace remains closed. If it opens, then it is a positive booster for our current business model and strategy – but one needs to be very realistic.”

However, he went on to explain that Finnair would be able to react very quickly if overflight rights are restored and the most immediate benefit would be that the airline could return to providing 24-hour rotations, flying its A350s from Helsinki to Asia.

Financial success

Finnair now operates 80 aircraft to around 100 destinations worldwide. (All via Finnair unless stated)

Ever the pragmatist, Kuusisto sees that reset as a way to achieve a more balanced network. “While Asia is still extremely important for us, at the same time we have become a much more important operator on the North Atlantic traffic routes.”

The strategy seems to have worked, with Kuusisto reporting that Finnair’s 2023 financial figures were very good. “In fairness it was pretty much a good year for all companies,” he accepted. “There was a lot of backlog after the pandemic with ticket prices and demand both extremely high but, at the same time, we feel that we did a very solid job in 2024, even though the ticket prices and yields started to normalise. So, we have two solid, robust fiscal years behind us.”

“The first quarter results for 2025 are a bit of a weak start,” he admitted, “but in many ways that was expected and hampered by prolonged industrial action. All in all, I would say that Finnair is back in the game and back to cruising altitude.”

How has Finnair achieved this turnaround, weathering the storm from what could have been a tumultuous commercial disaster to a healthy ‘new’ business? “It is all about attitude, agility, willingness and what we call in Finnish ‘sisu’ – I guess the best translation is ‘determination.’ The Finnair force really has ‘sisu,’” Kuusisto proudly told the audience.

However, the ongoing strike for better wages by members of the Finnish Transport Pilots’ Association (SLL), which began in the autumn of 2024, continues with action, including a standby ban. The airline has not ruled out furloughing staff as a result of the industrial action and Kuusisto confirmed that it has had to cut some 230 flights from its summer schedule as a direct result of the strikes.

Atlantic reliance

The longhaul fleet is made up of Airbus A330s and A350s (illustrated), although the latter is also used on the Helsinki to London route.

The growing reliance on North Atlantic traffic could be subject to turbulence in the months ahead, with volatility in the financial markets, following uncertainty over tariffs and reports of a growing unwillingness among Europeans to travel to the US in response to concerns over various Trump administration policies. However, at the time of speaking, Kuusisto said Finnair had not yet seen a drop-off in bookings. “It is too early to tell and we now follow the trend on a weekly basis but, so far, we have not witnessed a big shift in either consumer behaviour or demand.”

“We are continuing our investment in the transatlantic market,” he continued, “and for the forthcoming summer season we will be flying eleven weekly frequencies from Helsinki to Dallas, for instance. Unless something extraordinary happens we will continue to invest in the US market.”

Fleet renewal

A dozen ATR 72s are among the few non-Airbus aircraft in the fleet.

In 2025, Finnair operates a predominantly Airbus fleet of 80 aircraft. This includes A319s, A320s, A321s, A330s and A350s but its regional operations are supplemented by 12 ATR 72-500s and 12 Embraer E190s. In a February earnings call, the airline communicated the fact that it was about to begin evaluating options to replace 15 of its narrowbody Airbus types.

“Those aircraft are coming to the end of their life cycle, with an average age of 23 years,” confirmed Kuusisto. “So, during this calendar year, we need to make at least preliminary decisions about how we approach this renewal. Due diligence work is being conducted now and it all starts with our network design team. I asked them for an optimal network for Finnair to fly in the future to support both our core strategy and commercial strategy. Once we have that it in place, we will select the most suitable aircraft to fly that network.”

Sustainability vs competitiveness

Finnair's CEO cited concerns over the availability of useful levels of sustainable aviation fuel by the end of the decade.

A newer generation of aircraft will also help Finnair meet its sustainability targets. However, Kuusisto referred to the attitude towards sustainability as “perhaps my biggest surprise since joining the airline.”

“It is a complicated topic because aviation companies should obviously do their fair share when it comes to fighting the climate crisis,” he elaborated. “But at the same time, we need to be humble and realistic about what we can do with what is available in our toolbox. The affordability and availability of sustainable aviation fuel will most likely become a bottleneck towards the end of this decade and we need to understand that fitting solar panels on top of our offices and switching to LED bulbs is not going to help if we are not capable of solving the fuel issue.”

That said, he confirmed that Finnair remained committed to its Science-Based Targets Initiative validated CO2 reduction targets, which call for a 34.5% reduction in CO2 intensity by the end of 2033. “It's a very ambitious target,” he admitted, “and we most likely do not have all the tools available yet, so we need to maintain the technological developments. Above all, we need to accept that the development curve will not be linear and some type of revolutionary technologies will need to emerge.”

Kuusisto also urged against overregulation, saying “we need to secure the connectivity and competitiveness of the European carriers. For Finland – which is a small country with just 5.6m citizens – to remain competitive and relevant we need reliable and cost-effective connections to Europe.

The fact that the airline’s CEO was so hands-on with the running of the operation was evident when he explained how he makes a point of sitting in on the quarterly safety management and safety culture calls. “The previous CEOs had not done this,” he revealed, “but, for me, it is a window into the attitude and the pulse of the organisation. I find it heartwarming to hear the level of details and diligence our team is putting into the step-by-step process of flight safety. I guess, in an airline company, the biggest threat is actually when you have been so good previously that you become complacent – but the Finnair team is always pushing for better, safer performance.

“On that theme, I feel that regulators and airlines should only stipulate processes and procedures that are fit for purpose – and that operators need to not just stick with them but work towards improving them and creating an extremely robust management system. Meanwhile, we should also get rid of all the non-necessary bureaucracy.”

Recipe for success

Kuusisto described his workforce as the airline's biggest asset.

In recent years, Finnair has been recognised as the ‘Best Airline’ in Northern Europe by World Airline Awards for the 14th time and also won ‘Best Cabin Crew’ in Northern Europe in 2023. “There is something magical that my colleagues do in the cabin during the flight,” Kuusisto proudly told the audience. That is pretty much the heart of the service and operation that we provide for our customers. Of course, I am aware that we need to become better when it comes to the digital experience, as well as the before- and after-flight experiences – but when we really dive into the core product, it's all about the reliability and punctuality of our service and excellency of our cabin crew.”

Kuusisto sees AI as the key to future successes. “Our operations must become more intelligent and be backed up with both data and AI,” he explained. “But, at the same time, I believe that we have a lot of potential when it comes to improving the user interface towards our customers and passengers. Our mobile app will be key to our digital development, and not only for the core parts of passenger travel. We are looking at what else we could bring into the app, especially for our Finnair Plus loyalty scheme members. During the years to come, you will see great things coming up through our digital pipeline.”

At present, Finnair is operating the A350 from Helsinki to London, but Kuusisto was asked whether any thought had been given to a Stockholm to London City route, using one of Finnair’s narrowbody types. With 1.3m passengers flying between the two cities annually, the Finnair CEO agreed that it was an avenue that was being explored.

He also acknowledged that the volatile nature of geopolitics presented his airline with a mix of both threats and opportunities. “We are still feeling the ‘positive’ after-effects of the pandemic,” he explained. “Those with the available funds are still prioritising travel – particularly in the premium leisure travel market. We are continuously developing our premium offering and network and we believe that we could be the real champion in the Nordics. For instance, this summer we are offering 54 weekly frequencies from Finland to Norway and it is important to understand the attractiveness of the Nordic region during the summertime – it is not all about Lapland and Santa Claus and winter snow – there are exotic places to visit during the summertime.”

Staying humble

From its base at Helsinki Airport, Finnair now reached around 100 destinations worldwide.

In an era where airlines are increasingly merging to improve their competitive dynamics, Kuusisto was asked whether this was on the cards at Finnair – which is already part of the Oneworld Alliance.

“My core principles for Finnair are based on two things,” he elaborated. “Firstly, we have to assume that Russian airspace will remain closed for the foreseeable future and, secondly, we need to develop a sustainable standalone company. That said, we get a huge benefit from being a member of the alliance, but we need to stay extremely humble. At best we are a medium-sized airline company with around 100 destinations and a fleet of 80 aircraft but, through our partners and alliances, we can actually reach 1,000 destinations globally.”

“Over my first 12 months, I've learned that Finnair is actually a very valued Oneworld member and partner. Even though we are not the biggest in terms of fleet size or network size, we definitely punch above our weight when it comes to being a value creator in the ecosystem.”

Kuusisto says he has learnt a lot during his first year at the helm of Finland’s flag carrier, but none of it came as a surprise. “There is a sense of pride associated with this brand; you can almost touch it,” he said with a beaming smile. “To some extent it is a calling to be part of an airline, at least in Finland. Finnair has come through difficult times, but I have an extremely resilient and agile group of magnificent colleagues and I am really looking forward to taking this company to the next chapter.”",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26467/blog-finnair_a350_plane_from_behind_2-wheel_stoppers_removed.jpg,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:18.073368

“Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets""

Share

For more than half a century, the aviation industry has relied on traditional price reporting services to manage exposure to price risks in the fossil jet fuel market. But the SAF revolution demands a new approach. Unlike traditional fuels, SAF can be produced from a wide variety of certified technologies, each with distinct feedstocks, costs, CO2 reduction capabilities and production scalability – and, at the end, producing similar drop-in aviation fuels. A one-size-fits-all SAF index isn’t fungible in this complex emerging market.

ATOBA recognises that the immediate hurdle to overcome is unlocking investment and building confidence in bankable long-term offtake agreements for new production facilities. A key enabler to overcoming this challenge is bringing transparency and a level playing field to the industry through the creation of new SAF price indexes, developed by General Index. Each index will be designed to reflect the unique cost profile of the diverse SAF technologies and aggregated to create a benchmark that aligns with regulatory frameworks, regional nuances and market needs.

Neil Bradford, CEO & Founder, General Index, said: “Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets. We’re already a benchmark partner to the European Commission for the official 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Now, by partnering with ATOBA Energy, we’re helping to build the foundational infrastructure needed to attract investment, support offtake agreements, and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero.”

Arnaud Namer, CEO & Co-Founder ATOBA Energy, said: “Unlocking investment in sustainable aviation fuel starts with transparency, market confidence, and trusted pricing tools. That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies. These benchmarks are critical to ensuring SAF is competitively priced for airlines—an advantage we deliver thanks to our diversified portfolio of best-in-class SAF producers and long-term offtake aggregation strategy.”

Bayer uses these farmer practices to sell carbon credits to companies that wish to offset their carbon emissions.
“We've also added a nitrogen reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.” The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years.","Last summer, Robert Bonnie attended Farmfest, a farm show annually held near Morgan, Minn. So, what was the main thing on the mind of Minnesota corn growers that day?

“Carbon intensity,” says Bonnie, the former USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation during the Biden administration.

Bonnie, who addressed members of the North American Agricultural Journalists at their late April meeting, was struck by how much those farmers knew about the CI system that’s part of the Section 45Z tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It tracks the carbon footprint of the biofuels supply chain that includes on-farm greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane.

Fewer emissions used to produce a bushel of corn or soybeans also translates into fewer emissions with the resulting produced biofuel. This translates into more tax credits a biofuels manufacturer can glean, says Mitchell Hora, a Washington, Iowa, farmer and founder and CEO of the software company Continuum Ag.

These tax credits could spur potential shareable payments — split between farmers, biofuel producers, grain merchandisers, third-party verifiers and many others — potentially worth over $100 per acre, Hora adds.

“Sustainability is not just about the environment, it's about new markets for agriculture,” Bonnie says. The farmers Bonnie talked to in Minnesota were interested in the market opportunities from reducing their carbon intensity scores.

“They're getting very smart about it,” he says.

Strong bipartisan congressional support has accompanied this interest, Bonnie adds. The Clean Fuel Production Credit, or 45Z, took effect Jan. 1.

So far, though, 45Z’s potential for farmers and other supply chain partners hasn’t materialized.

“Some 45Z draft guidance was issued by the Biden administration, but it didn’t provide clarity as to how farmers and their biofuel feedstock production will be accounted for,” Hora says. “We are still waiting for the critical details required to let 45Z get off the ground.”

He’s hopeful more 45Z movement will result in the coming months.

One good sign: The U.S. House Ways and Means Committee released the text of tax policy changes in May as part of the budget reconciliation process. It extends the 45Z tax credit through the end of 2031.

Situation revamp

This 45Z situation sums up the uncertainty revolving around carbon farming and sustainability programs these days.

“Some programs have settled in, some have gone away, and some have let off the gas a little bit,” says Eric Gibson, farm input and crop production sustainability analyst for Rabobank. “The wait-and-see approach is kind of what's on everyone's mind. There is still opportunity there, but tomorrow could be different than today. We're still waiting on final guidance on some of these programs.”

CARBON INTENSITY: These days, a carbon intensification system can track the carbon footprint of the biofuels supply chain from the farm through processing.

So far, most U.S. farmers have not flocked to these programs. An October 2024 report by McKinsey and Co. showed that among U.S. farmers:

Federal changes also have heightened uncertainty in this space. In mid-April, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins canceled the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities that the Biden administration established. She added that certain projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.

USDA also announced the overhauling of the Biden-era Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities initiative into the Advancing Markets for Producers initiative. Existing grant agreement reviews will be based on three of what it terms Farmer First policy priorities:

Such moves accompanied by personnel cuts to USDA and other federal agencies concern Bonnie.

“I worry about the erosion of not only U.S. leadership [in carbon and sustainability programs], but U.S. expertise in those agencies,” he says. “I worry that if we start pulling back, whether it's [USDA or] [the Environmental Protection Agency] or the Department of Energy or Department of Transportation or elsewhere in ways that influence those biofuel markets, that farmers are going to pay the price.”

Potential exists

The good news is that low-carbon markets for agricultural commodities — such as sustainable aviation fuel — aren’t going away. Many companies are working with farmers and others to reduce the carbon intensity of biofuels or to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint, Bonnie says.

“There's a huge role for technology and innovation in the private sector,” he adds.

Some programs in which farmers are paid for adopting new practices do add more risk, Gibson says.

“The big question comes into where their comfort level resides,” he adds.

Bayer Carbon Program

In Bayer’s case, the Bayer Carbon Program pays farmers for sustainable practices they are already using on their own farm, says Alyssa Cho, Bayer sustainable agriculture field team lead. Examples include reduced tillage or cover crops. Bayer uses these farmer practices to sell carbon credits to companies that wish to offset their carbon emissions.

“We pay $6 per practice per year back to the fall of 2019,” Cho says. “We've also added a nitrogen reduction offer that pays an additional $4 per acre.”

The Bayer Carbon Program contract is for five years. If a grower decides to sign up again at the end of the contract, Bayer offers another $6 per acre bonus.

“We do this to ensure that the grower knows what to expect and that they can have a guaranteed payment,” Cho says. “This also allows us to generate an asset for our customers downstream, and also allows us to help generate revenue that flows back to the farm for the grower.”

Either Bayer or the farmer can exit the program before the contract expires. “We know that things can change on the farm,” Cho says. “Acreage can switch hands, or a grower may decide they need to switch practices.”

The future

Despite the uncertainty in this space, Cho sees farmer interest holding firm in voluntary programs.

“What we're seeing from our customers is that they're still committed to greenhouse gas emission reductions,” she says. “Whatever is happening elsewhere, companies are signaling they're committed and continue to expand with us.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/bltf34fe03e5747b03b/68263ef1f7d8e474c528859b/0519T-1690A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:31.949173

The aviation industry’s reliance on aviation turbine fuel makes it one of the most energy-intensive sectors in the world.","The aviation industry, a cornerstone of globalisation and modern transportation, relies heavily on one vital resource: aviation turbine fuel (ATF). Primarily derived from crude oil, ATF is a specialised kerosene refined to meet stringent quality and safety standards. With more than 100,000 flights taking off and landing around the world each day, understanding what fuels this immense operation—and where that fuel comes from—is critical.

What is Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF)?

Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), widely recognised as jet fuel, is an essential high-performance fuel for aircraft gas-turbine engines. The two primary types are Jet A and Jet A-1, with Jet A-1 being the global standard due to its exceptional cold-weather performance. These fuels, which range in colour from clear to straw-coloured, are rigorously tested to meet international standards set by leading organisations such as ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and DEF STAN (the UK Ministry of Defence Standard). Formulated with advanced additives, jet fuel effectively prevents static discharge, corrosion, and microbial growth, ensuring safety and reliability even in the most demanding conditions at 35,000 feet.

How is ATF produced?

ATF is formed during the refining of crude oil. The process starts in petroleum refineries, where crude oil is distilled into various fractions. One of these fractions is kerosene, which is then hydrotreated to remove impurities like sulphur. The resulting jet fuel is blended to meet performance requirements.

Refineries all over the world customise their output to include ATF, particularly those located near major airports or transportation hubs. Transportation from refinery to wingtip involves pipelines, ships, railcars and fuel trucks. Major fuel hubs near airports contain large tank farms that store and distribute ATF via hydrant systems on the tarmac.

Global sources of ATF

The demand for ATF is concentrated in countries with large aviation sectors, and these nations often maintain robust refining capacities to ensure fuel availability. However, not all aviation hubs produce their jet fuel; many rely on imports. Some of the key players in global ATF production and distribution are:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): The Future of Jet Fuel?

As the world shifts toward sustainability, the aviation industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a bio-based alternative to traditional jet fuel. Made from feedstocks like used cooking oil, plant waste, and even captured CO₂, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%.

Airlines like KLM, Lufthansa, and Delta have already begun incorporating SAF into their fuel mix. However, challenges such as high production costs, limited feedstock availability, and infrastructure compatibility hinder widespread adoption. Still, governments and industry players are investing heavily in SAF development, with ambitious targets set for 2030 and beyond.

The aviation industry’s reliance on aviation turbine fuel makes it one of the most energy-intensive sectors in the world. From the deserts of the Middle East to the refineries of the U.S. and the biofuel labs of Europe, the journey of ATF is complex and global. While traditional ATF continues to power the majority of aircraft, the rise of sustainable aviation fuels points to a cleaner, greener future. Ultimately, what fuels aviation is more than just kerosene — it’s a vast web of global supply chains, innovation, and a shared commitment to keeping the world connected through flight.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/ng4qu0/article69593615.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-05-06T220643Z_1704911303_RC2HICAMY4F3_RTRMADP_3_USA-NEWARK-AVIATION.JPG,N,,2025-05-20 06:57:40.334900

ATOBA recognises th​at the​ immediate hurdle to overcome is unlocking investment and building confidence ​in bankable​ ​long-term ​offtake agreements for new production ​facilities​. ​A key enabler to overcoming this​ challenge ​is ​​bringing transparency​​ and a level playing field to the industry​​ through​ the creation of new SAF price indexes, developed by General Index​.​ ​E​ach ​index will be ​designed to ​reflect ​the unique cost profile of the diverse SAF technologies and​ aggregated to create a benchmark that aligns with regulatory frameworks, regional nuances and market needs​.

“Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets. We’re already a benchmark partner to the European Commission for the official 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Now, by partnering with ATOBA Energy, we’re helping to build the foundational infrastructure needed to attract investment, support offtake agreements, and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero.”

“​​Unlocking investment in sustainable aviation fuel starts with transparency, market confidence, and trusted pricing tools. That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies. These benchmarks are critical to ensuring SAF is competitively priced for airlines—an advantage we deliver thanks to our diversified portfolio of best-in-class SAF producers and long-term offtake aggregation strategy.​​​”​​ ​

WATCH KATRINA'S STORY HERE

Will Reynolds sign Iowa pipeline bill?

CO2 is a byproduct of ethanol production. Capturing the CO2 and burying it underground improves the carbon index score of the ethanol, qualifying it for more products such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Rep. Steven Holt from Denison has championed restricting carbon capture pipelines. He says it ultimately comes down to property rights.

Monte Shaw is the executive director of the Iowa Renewable Energy Association. He said that this bill could make it harder for pipeline companies that aren't using eminent domain. Shaw said the SIRE ethanol plant in Council Bluffs, which has 100% voluntary participation from landowners, could also be limited by this bill.

Sherri Webb's family owns land in the path of the proposed Summit pipeline: “The idea that they want to put a pipeline through that land which would cause more erosion than anything — especially after decades of no-till — just really bothers me.”

BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT:

I'm Southwest Iowa neighborhood reporter Katrina Markel.

Property rights, the ethanol market, and carbon capture pipelines are pressing issues for Iowa landowners, and they don’t all agree.

Now neighbors wait to see if the governor will sign a bill that would restrict the use of carbon capture pipelines by the ethanol industry.

What’s interesting here is that the bill isn’t explicitly about banning eminent domain.

It’s a multi-faceted bill. A key feature: re-defining what counts as a common carrier pipeline — or a pipeline with a public use.

Rep. Steven Holt from Denison has championed restricting carbon capture pipelines.

Katrina Markel: “Why was it important to you?”

Holt: “Well, number one I love the constitution. I think the protections in the constitution are of extreme importance. George Washington said, many years ago, that freedom and property rights are inseparable.”

The bill also sets a high bar for insurance requirements for the pipelines.

Monte Shaw, the executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, says it would make the pipelines prohibitively expensive: “It’s a really crappy bill.”

Shaw says landowners who favor the pipelines see the potential for boosting corn ethanol markets.

“I also grew up in Shenandoah during the 1980s farm crisis and I remember how horrible that was, so I get pretty passionate when we have markets, that could drive corn prices for the next 30 years, within our grasp,” Shaw said.

“My sisters and my brother and I have talked about this over and over, and it’s not the money,” said Sherri Webb.

Her family owns land in the planned path of the Summit pipeline. She has been a vocal opponent.

Webb: “The idea that they want to put a pipeline through that land which would cause more erosion than anything — especially after decades of no-till — just really bothers me.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ae5923/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb8%2Fae%2F4744be7249d2b2a33e802641a497%2Fposter-image-5.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 22:56:08.381984

Nature-based boost – The UN Development Programme (UNDP) in the Philippines and Canada have launched the NatureNest Accelerator, a six-month programme aimed at supporting ten local enterprises to scale nature-based solutions (NbS) that promote climate resilience and ecosystem protection. NatureNest is expected to provide capacity building in business operations, climate resilience, and gender equality, alongside one-on-one mentoring to improve access to financing. Filipino government agencies, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, expressed support for the programme. Applications are open until Jun. 13.

Defining the roadmap – The Institute for Climate and Society Brazil and Nature4Climate held a roundtable Monday for climate journalists to underscore the importance of reaching the $1.3 trillion climate finance goal by 2035 established in Baku. The Baku-Belem Roadmap, which is developed by both the Azerbaijan and Brazilian COP presidencies, sets a vision and direction for COP30 in Belem, said Professor Josue Tanaka of the Grantham Research Institute. That vision will not only include novel ways to reach that target, but also define ways to more efficiently distribute existing dollars to developing nations, panellists said.

Nuclear new-build – The construction of two new nuclear power plants in the Netherlands will cost an estimated €20-30 bln, said climate and energy minister Sophie Hermans on Friday. This is the government’s first cost estimate. It is based on technical feasibility studies by EDF and Westinghouse, the two potential builders. Cost estimates will become more accurate once designs and locations are selected, said the minister. Overall however, the price tag corresponds to experiences in other European countries, she noted. The first plant is expected to be ready at the end of the 2030s at the earliest.

SAF in Rotterdam – Swiss start-up Metafuels plans to open its first commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) factory in the Port of Rotterdam, according to TNW. The facility will be built in collaboration with liquid energy storage provider Evos. Metafuels’ “aerobrew” technology converts renewable methanol into jet fuel, claiming up to 90% lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel. Its factory will be able to process both biomethanol (from biowaste) and e-methanol (from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2). Metafuels expects both its Dutch plant and a Danish facility to start producing fuel for commercial use from 2028.

Microbial impact – Equinor has partnered with the University of Manchester to study how microbes in underground storage sites could impact carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, responding to concerns that their response to CO2 injection remains poorly understood. While some microbial responses could provide CO2 storage benefits, others could possibly lead to methane production, infrastructure corrosion, or loss of injectivity. The two-year project will collect samples from saline aquifers and oil production sites to study how the microbes respond to high concentrations of CO2. Microbial monitoring is not yet included in the monitoring strategy for CCS sites as required by the UK’s North Sea Transition Authority, but gaining a deeper understanding of how microbial communities respond to CO2 storage is seen as critical to the industry’s long-term success. Equinor’s Northern Lights CCS project in Norway is set to begin operating this year, and it’s also working alongside BP and TotalEnergies on the Northern Endurance Partnership CCS project in the UK’s Northeast.

Record quarter – China installed 60 GW of new solar in the first quarter of 2025, analysis by Rystad Energy released Monday said, the highest ever recorded in a first quarter in the country’s history. Rooftop solar PV accounted for 60% of that total. The installations were the result of entities rushing to meet policy deadlines set by the National Energy Administration’s new guidelines which come into effect in May, the firm said. The rules encourage rooftop solar as a way to ease grid congestion issues, improve grid stability, and cut reliance on centralised power plants. Rystad predicts the surge in rooftop solar will continue, totalling 130 GW in 2025.

Disclosure urged – Kepco, South Korea’s largest electricity utility, has been accused of failing to disclose material climate-related risks in its $11 bln global medium-term note programme listed on the Singapore Exchange, with a whistleblower complaint filed Monday by non-profit Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC). The power company in the bond filings did not reveal its continued reliance on coal-fired power and financial exposure to LNG price volatility, SFOC said in a statement. Also, labelling hydrogen and ammonia fuel blends as “carbon-free” could mislead stakeholders, the statement said.

Pitch your ideas – Japan’s environment ministry is calling for feasibility study proposals for emissions reduction projects with synergy under the bilateral Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), according to a notice published Monday. The ministry said three feasibility study projects, each with costs of no more than JPY 20 mln ($138,142), will be selected. The Japanese government is also seeking JCM project proposals that can provide benefits beyond emissions reductions.

Speeding up – Nepal has submitted its third NDC to the UN, vowing – as previously reported by Carbon Pulse – to reach net zero emissions in 2045, five years earlier than its former target. The plan also lists a number of other climate commitments, most of which rely on financial contributions from abroad.

Reviving fallow lands – Indian portfolio company Hexa Climate has partnered with Asvata, a carbon credit venture of the RPG Group, to launch an afforestation project in the state of West Bengal, the partners told Carbon Pulse in an email. Under the project, around 500,000 trees will be planted to revive fallow land into forest ecosystems, thereby generating 375,000 credits over the next 20 years. The partners aim to register the project under carbon standard Verra, with plans of scaling up to 1.5 mln trees, they added.

Subsidy showdown – US House Republicans are preparing to modify their party-line budget reconciliation bill this week, potentially including a stronger rollback of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy tax credits, before attempting to pass it through the lower chamber, E&E News reported. The package, advanced by the House Budget Committee on May 18, includes provisions to cut climate-related grants, repeal parts of the IRA, and sell public lands.

Case dismissed – A Pennsylvania judge has dismissed a climate lawsuit brought by Bucks County against six major oil and gas companies and the American Petroleum Institute. The case alleged that the companies violated state consumer protection laws by misleading the public about the environmental risks of fossil fuel use. The judge found that the county’s claims could not be raised in state court. The decision marks at least the fifth dismissal of similar climate liability suits within the past year. (E&E News)

Electrolyser expansion – Electric Hydrogen, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of high-power electrolyser systems, announced that Infinium, a Texas-based producer of commercial eFuels, will use its 100 MW HYPRPlant electrolyser at Project Roadrunner, a large-scale eFuels facility in Pecos, Texas. The system is designed to lower total installed hydrogen project costs by up to 60% and aims to support the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), eDiesel, and eNaphtha from CO2, power, and water. The project, expected to be the world’s largest eFuels facility when it begins operations in 2027, is backed by Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst.

Cash to cut carbon – Scotiabank has opened applications for the fifth edition of its Climate Action Research Fund (CARF), which seeks to provide grants ranging from C$25,000 to C$100,000 ($17,900-71,700) to registered charities and non-profit organisations conducting research to support the transition to a lower-carbon economy. The fund, which allocates approximately C$1 mln annually over 10 years, aims to stimulate research on topics including decarbonisation pathways, carbon sinks, climate finance mechanisms, and regulatory changes. Projects must be novel, have clearly defined deliverables and timelines, and show potential to inform decarbonisation or financial institution efforts. Applications are due by May 22.

I’ll take that – Around six in 10 Americans view more stringent environmental laws and regulations to be worth the cost, but opinions vary significantly by party and region, according to a 2023-24 survey conducted by think tank Pew Research Center. The survey, which included some 36,900 participants, found that Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents think such laws are worth the cost (82%), while Republicans and GOP leaners opined that they cost too many jobs and hurt the economy (59%). Minnesota and Washington, DC showed the broadest support for stricter environmental regulations, followed by 28 other states. The think tank said that views diverged in 20 other states, while a majority of adults in Wyoming did not support the laws.

Wood you believe it – The Government of Guyana, in collaboration with the Global Green Growth Institute — an intergovernmental green finance organisation — and with funding from the UK’s Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions programme, recently launched a project to strengthen Guyana’s Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) systems. The initiative aims to improve GHG emissions reporting, sustainable forest management, and access to climate finance, with support from the Guyana Forestry Commission. The project seeks to expand data collection across land use and forestry sectors, including mangroves, and is expected to enhance reporting capacity and potentially unlock up to £46 mln in carbon financing. The project is scheduled to run until Dec. 2026.

Josh Shapiro’s proposed legislation to increase the supply of renewable energy would position the commonwealth well to ride out the turbulence.
Shapiro’s Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS) would create incentives for renewable energy development and add emerging technologies such as next-generation nuclear, fusion, and carbon capture technologies to the state’s range of renewable energy sources.

Taylor said he also opposes Shapiro’s plan to offer tax credits for renewable energy projects.","Pennsylvania electricity would be more reliable and affordable if more wind, solar and nuclear power are deployed as the regional grid faces an explosive growth in demand, state lawmakers heard Monday.

Testimony during a House Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee hearing suggested that Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s proposed legislation to increase the supply of renewable energy would position the commonwealth well to ride out the turbulence. But at least one industry representative pushed back on that premise.

PJM Interconnection, the organization that operates the electricity grid for Pennsylvania and 12 other states, has predicted its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven by the increased electrification of transportation and industry and the proliferation of data centers to satisfy the demand for computing power from artificial intelligence and other technologies.

“That’s like building Pennsylvania’s entire existing energy generating fleet, and then some additional 20,000 more megawatts over the next 15 years. That’s a huge amount of growth, and we do need all energy sources to play a part in that,” said Evan Vaughn, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, a nonprofit group representing wind, solar and battery storage developers and advocates for renewable energy growth.

Shapiro’s Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS) would create incentives for renewable energy development and add emerging technologies such as next-generation nuclear, fusion, and carbon capture technologies to the state’s range of renewable energy sources.

First introduced in 2024 and reintroduced as part of Shapiro’s broader Lightning energy plan, PRESS would require 35% of Pennsylvania’s electricity to come from clean sources by 2035. The updated standard would open Pennsylvania to new investment and create 14,500 jobs, the governor’s office said.

The Lightning plan would employ an existing state program, the Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, to to provide up to $100 million per facility for three years to encourage the addition of renewable energy to the grid and additional credits for projects in the two proposed regional hydrogen hubs and for sustainable aviation fuel.

Rep. Danielle Friel-Otten (D-Chester) and Sen. Steve Santarsiero (D-Bucks) are sponsors of companion bills in the House and Senate that would put PRESS into effect. Pennsylvania is not immune from the effects on the price of electricity of the growing global demand for energy and a plateau in petroleum and natural gas production, Friel-Otten said.

“We have an important task ahead of us to increase energy on the grid,” Friel-Otten said. “As we do that, we have a responsibility to continue to do the work to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.”

Vaughn said there are about 9,600 megawatts of solar, wind and storage capacity projects in the PJM queue in Pennsylvania.

“In many ways those are the fastest projects and the most concrete projects that can be brought online to help meet demand in the next five years or so,” he said, adding that utility scale wind and solar power projects are the least expensive options for new power plants.

Combined with Shapiro’s proposed Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition (RESET) Board, which would serve as a central authority to consider and approve applications for large generating facilities, the planned projects could be online quickly. That legislation was introduced as House Bill 502 by Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny).

Nick Cohen, president of Doral Renewables, a solar energy production and storage development company in Philadelphia, said local opposition to energy projects often stands in the way of the economic benefits to individual landowners and communities. Pennsylvania would benefit from a state-level reviewing body that other states have empowered to vet energy projects.

“The bill is encouraging. It’s a beacon that goes out to corporations who, in many cases, are the buyers of the energy. And it will bring companies to Pennsylvania who are looking for renewable energy,” Cohen said.

But David Taylor, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association, said the state’s retail choice energy structure has been a success, with electricity prices decreasing significantly since the industry was deregulated in 2005. In the 15 years that followed, greenhouse gas emissions from power generation decreased by more than 44%, Taylor said.

Shapiro’s plan would tamper with that success by placing mandates on the energy industry, forcing the early retirement of reliable generation assets such as natural gas and coal and replace them with what he said were problematic technologies, he said.

“To be clear, this is not an evolution of policy. It’s a revolutionary disruption that would dismantle our competitive electricity markets and replace them with government mandates that distort supply, limit choice and raise costs,” Taylor said.

The RESET Board would streamline the process for building energy projects by speeding permits and reducing red tape. Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states without a state entity to handle siting decisions for major energy projects, according to Shapiro’s office.

Solar and wind would require the development of millions of acres of open land, create waste as technology becomes obsolete and put the United States at the mercy of nations such as China that dominate the production of rare earth elements needed for batteries, Taylor claimed.

Although Pennsylvania ranks near the bottom among the states in energy from wind, solar and geothermal sources, according to a PennEnvironment analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the goal of 35% renewable energy includes nuclear and is lower than that of neighboring states. New Jersey, for example, has a goal of 50% renewable energy by 2030.

Taylor said he also opposes Shapiro’s plan to offer tax credits for renewable energy projects.

“Every time that the word incentive is used, I hear distortion. You are taking money from the taxpayers and essentially using it to bribe people to make choices that they would not otherwise make. And those things are fundamentally unhealthy for our economy,” Taylor said.

Rep. Thomas Mehaffie (R-Dauphin) said the unprecedented growth in demand means it’s crucial that the commonwealth act to speed development of all energy sources.

Mehaffie recalled his sponsorship in 2019 of legislation to update the then-15-year-old precursor to PRESS, the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, when “a big fight over a bunch of industries wanting more and more” resulted in inaction.

There’s no more time to fight, he said.

“Five years ago, we sounded this alarm, and no one did anything … if we continue to stick our head in the sand and do nothing, guess what’s going to happen? Nothing,” Mehaffie said. “And I’ll tell you, what’s going to happen is we’re not going to have power on the grid.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TURBINES-3-2048x1339.jpeg,N,,2025-05-19 22:56:28.217680

The FBO is a true fee-free tech stop: free of landing fees, handling fees, security fees and infrastructure fees.
ABOUT OVERLAND AVIATION Overland Aviation is a full-service fixed base operator, providing ground handling for both general aviation and commercial aviation aircraft, as well as aircraft refueling, aircraft maintenance, flight school, air charters, scenic tour flights and aerial patrol.
With a keen focus on safety and service, Overland Aviation has been providing the upper Midwest with world-class aviation services since being founded in 2011.
MEDIA CONTACTS Overland Aviation: Tanner Overland, President & Founder, 701-875-4334, tanner@overlandaviation.com, overlandaviation.com, facebook.com/overlandaviation","WILLISTON, N.D. / May 19, 2025 / Aviation News—Luxury North Dakota FBO, Overland Aviation (KXWA)—together with leading independent fuel supplier, Avfuel Corporation—proudly announces it accepted a delivery of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on May 12, expanding accessibility of the fuel in a new region within the United States.

The demonstrative, 8,000-gallon delivery marks Avfuel’s first Midwest location to receive a load of SAF, which comes ahead of the 2025 European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) where innovation and sustainability initiatives take center stage.

“We’re proud to help lead the charge in introducing SAF to the Midwest,” said Tanner Overland, president and founder of Overland Aviation. “Our goal is to provide world-class services that support a more sustainable future for aviation—this special fuel load is an important milestone in that commitment.”

Joel Hirst, Avfuel’s senior vice president of sales, said: “This announcement represents an exciting step forward in expanding SAF availability and accessibility across the U.S. We were thrilled to work with Overland Aviation to showcase the viability of SAF’s expansion into the Midwest while offering the FBO’s global customer base a more environmentally responsible fueling option.”

The fuel delivery was further made possible by the SAF supply agreement between Avfuel and Valero Marketing and Supply Company (Valero), a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO). The neat SAF produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR), is made using the HEFA SPK pathway process, meaning it uses lipids—like used cooking oil—to produce the fuel, and can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel. With target blend percentages of 30% neat SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel, SAF can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 24% when compared to conventional jet fuel.

ABOUT CASTLE & COOKE AVIATION Castle & Cooke Aviation is a part of the David H. Murdock family of companies.","VAN NUYS, Calif. / May 19, 2025 / AVIATION NEWS – Castle & Cooke Aviation, a premier provider of luxury FBO services, is proud to highlight its growing sustainability portfolio at Van Nuys Airport (VNY) as it joins forces with Avfuel Corporation—the leading independent supplier of aviation fuel and services—at EBACE 2025.

With a focus on operational elegance and environmental responsibility, the FBO is positioned as a go-to destination for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and clean energy advancements in Southern California.

Castle & Cooke Aviation VNY proudly offers SAF from Avfuel and the fuel supplier’s nearby production partner, Neste.* The fuel blend—averaging 30% concentrated SAF to 70% petroleum-based Jet A—provides a significant reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions without the need for aircraft or engine modifications.

“While SAF is not new to our facility, the difference lies in how seamlessly we can provide it,” said Tony Marlow, Castle & Cooke Aviation’s president of aviation operations and business development. “With close proximity to a Neste SAF blending facility and supply terminal, operators seeking high-volume SAF can count on Castle & Cooke Aviation VNY and Avfuel for quick, local access.”

In addition to its SAF capabilities, Castle & Cooke Aviation VNY has taken major steps toward more sustainable ground operations. The FBO outfitted the rooftops of its four largest hangars with photovoltaic (PV) solar systems, significantly reducing energy demand. Installed in 2019, the solar panels demonstrate Castle & Cooke Aviation’s long-term commitment to reducing its carbon footprint.

Complementing this renewable energy initiative, the FBO transitioned a significant portion of its ground support equipment (GSE) to electric-powered solutions. The current fleet includes three Lektro electric tugs, two Lektro charging units, two electric golf carts and one electric ground power unit (GPU).

Additional equipment, such as an electric baggage loader, is being evaluated for acquisition in the coming months. These updates reflect the FBO’s phased retirement of diesel equipment, replacing legacy systems with modern, low-emission alternatives as part of a broader, continuous transition strategy.

Furthermore, Castle & Cooke Aviation is now preparing to install electric vehicle charging stations across its VNY campus. The initial rollout—expected within the next three months—is aimed at air-side usage, catering to tenant and valet vehicles. The initiative aligns with California’s evolving transportation landscape and reflects the FBO’s foresight in accommodating the next generation of sustainable aviation travel.

Castle & Cooke Aviation’s sustainability efforts are matched by its unwavering dedication to world-class service. The VNY facility offers U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) clearance on site, making international operations both streamlined and convenient for its distinguished clientele.

“Castle & Cooke Aviation has always believed that operational excellence and environmental responsibility go hand in hand,” Marlow said. “We’re proud to offer an experience that is not only luxurious, but also mindful of the future of aviation.”Castle & Cooke Aviation welcomes visitors to the Avfuel booth (985) at EBACE 2025 to learn more about its premium services and sustainability initiatives at Van Nuys Airport, as well as premium FBO support services in Honolulu at PHNL.

*Neste MY Sustainable Aviation FuelTM is made from sustainably sourced, renewable waste and residue materials—such as used cooking oil. It is a fully approved drop-in fuel that, once blended with petroleum jet fuel, meets ASTM D-1655 specification for conventional jet fuel and performance standards under all operating conditions. This makes Neste MY SAF an optimum solution to directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aircraft, requiring no new investments, modifications or changes to the aircraft, fuel distribution procedures or airport fuel storage tanks. SAF is the most effective way to reduce a flight’s carbon footprint. In the future, SAF could deliver up to 80% less greenhouse gas emissions over its lifecycle versus traditional jet fuel if used in its neat, concentrated form. Those interested in learning more about sustainable aviation fuel are encouraged to visit Avfuel.com/SAF or contact Keith Sawyer, manager of alternative fuels, at ksawyer@avfuel.com for more information.

Electric Hydrogen’s innovative technology and modular manufacturing approach make the HYPRplant less expensive and more reliable than imported Chinese product, enhancing American energy technology leadership and competitiveness.
“We are very pleased to be working with Electric Hydrogen and have been impressed with the HYPRplant design and commercial package” said Robert Schuetzle, CEO of Infinium.
“This cutting-edge project exemplifies how low-cost, industrial-scale clean hydrogen production will drive new markets for American-made fuels and support the buildout of domestic manufacturing facilities” added Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO and Co-founder.
For additional information: Electric Hydrogen","Electric Hydrogen’s HYPRPlant is a complete solution that lowers hydrogen total installed project cost by up to 60 percent relative to other electrolyser solutions. The company manufactures HYPRPlants in the United States: its proprietary electrochemical stacks are built in Electric Hydrogen’s Massachusetts gigafactory while the chemical process modules are manufactured in Texas, drawing on strong local expertise from the oil and gas industry. Electric Hydrogen’s innovative technology and modular manufacturing approach make the HYPRplant less expensive and more reliable than imported Chinese product, enhancing American energy technology leadership and competitiveness.

“We are very pleased to be working with Electric Hydrogen and have been impressed with the HYPRplant design and commercial package” said Robert Schuetzle, CEO of Infinium. “Low-cost renewable hydrogen is a critical component to eFuel production, and the industry needs the kind of innovation and thoughtful execution we have seen from Electric Hydrogen.”

Once production begins, Project Roadrunner - expected to be the largest eFuels production facility in the world - will produce sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), eDiesel and eNaphtha from CO2, power and water for the aviation, heavy-duty trucking, plastics and maritime sectors. The project will bolster American technological advances and bring skilled jobs and economic growth to West Texas. Many of those workers are expected to bring skills and expertise they developed in the oil and gas sector. The facility is projected to commence commercial e-fuels production in 2027.

“This cutting-edge project exemplifies how low-cost, industrial-scale clean hydrogen production will drive new markets for American-made fuels and support the buildout of domestic manufacturing facilities” added Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen’s CEO and Co-founder. “We’re honoured to be selected as Infinium’s electrolyzer manufacturer of choice.”

Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst are financing partners for Infinium’s Project Roadrunner, making it the world’s first large-scale project-financed eFuels project. The project will supply sustainable aviation fuel over a 10-year period to International Airlines Group (IAG), one of the largest airline companies in the world through subsidiaries Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL and Vueling.

This project announcement follows the unveiling of HYPRPlant, the announcement of Electric Hydrogen’s strategic partnership with Texas-based Titan Production Equipment and the company’s selection as Uniper’s exclusive electrolysis partner for the 200 MW Green Wilhemshaven project in Northern Germany.

The site is expected to become the world’s largest eFuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner marks a huge achievement for the fuel industry,” said Infinium CEO Robert Schuetzle. “Not only will the project produce commercial eSAF for its customers, it will bring highly skilled jobs and economic growth to the Pecos community and state of Texas. This project demonstrates the ongoing commitment of Infinium, its investors, and partners to help ensure that the United States remains a global leader in energy security, resilience and innovation.”

eFuels are synthetic fuels, produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy, that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels. These drop-in fuels are used in the transportation and chemicals sectors, seamlessly integrating with existing engines, infrastructure, and manufacturing processes. Infinium eFuels provide an opportunity for energy diversification while leveraging the global infrastructure that powers the transportation and chemicals industries today. In 2023, Infinium became the world’s first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi, Texas.

The Roadrunner project reached financial close with investments from Brookfield Asset Management and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst and is now under construction. The project represents significant investment in the region and will support highly skilled direct labor jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics locally and across Texas. Commercial agreements for the project—including feedstock, vendor and offtake contracts — have been structured and de-risked to attract the infrastructure capital and debt required for the continued scaling of the eFuels market.

Infinium’s Project Roadrunner facility will convert waste CO2 and renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel, leveraging new renewable power assets purpose-built for the project. The fuels produced by the Roadrunner project will be sold domestically in the U.S. and exported to international markets. Under a landmark agreement with airline group IAG, the eSAF will be shipped to the UK to satisfy compliance requirements under the recently enacted UK SAF Mandate which requires that at least 10% of all jet fuel in flights taking off from the UK is sourced from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

“The construction of Project Roadrunner represents a real step forward in the production of sustainable aviation fuel at scale,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer. “We’re proud to be an early customer of Infinium’s eSAF and working hard to procure and invest in SAF to deliver our 10% 2030 SAF goal. The aviation industry is making progress, but continued support and stronger incentives are necessary to accelerate production at the scale and pace required to ensure a long-term, affordable supply.”

Currently under construction, the facility is expected to reach commercial operations in 2027. Roadrunner has secured 150 MW of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement.

“We are pleased to support Infinium’s Roadrunner project, which reflects a significant step forward for an emerging new market for renewable electricity,” said Petter Skantze, Senior Vice President, Infrastructure Development for NextEra Energy Resources. “The United States has tremendous potential to use its abundant energy resources to serve global demand, and we’re excited to expand our investment in Texas to enable Infinium’s industry-leading electro-fuels production facility.”

Infinium selected leading electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100 megawatt (MW) HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production1. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

“Infinium’s Project Roadrunner stands as a remarkable example of how next-generation technologies can rapidly evolve from proof-of-concept to finance-ready infrastructure,” said Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. “At BE Catalyst, we are proud to have partnered with Infinium from the onset to help shape this project, positioning it to attract the necessary infrastructure capital required to scale and accelerate the delivery of eFuels into the market.”

“Our investments in Infinium and Project Roadrunner are the first Brookfield has committed to sustainable aviation fuel,” said Laura Hellman, Senior Vice President at Brookfield. “We are excited about our partnership with Infinium which will help advance sustainability within the aviation sector consistent with the goals of our investment strategy.”

The Roadrunner project underscores expanded support for innovative solutions that meet the market’s growing demand for resilient energy supply chains, while decarbonizing and utilizing products that leverage the existing infrastructure and engines in use today. By enabling eFuels to be used as pure fuel or blended with petroleum-based products, Infinium solutions can be used to significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of the energy supply chain. Supported by top industry leaders in energy and infrastructure, Infinium is expanding its development of eFuel facilities both across the U.S. and internationally. This growth will not only contribute to the expansion and diversification of fuel market supply options but also offer low-carbon alternatives to augment conventional fuels relied on today.

Metafuels is collaborating with Evos to integrate the plant into its Rotterdam site.

Evos is a leading liquid-energy and chemicals-storage company in Europe committed to supporting innovative energy solutions.

This project builds on Metafuels’ expanding European footprint, following the 2024 announcement of Pizol—its planned production facility in Denmark.

The Rotterdam plant, named Turbe, will initially produce 12,000 liters (3,170 gallons) of eSAF per day, with plans for a second phase to increase production tenfold to 120,000 liters (31,700 gallons) per day.

Metafuels’ rapid growth is fueled by strong investment support.

In just over two years, the company has raised $22 million, including a $5 million grant from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, making it one of Europe’s best-funded SAF startups.

The Evos Rotterdam terminal is a dedicated multimodal methanol hub and the largest ethanol-storage provider in Europe.

It offers full connectivity across vessel, barge, truck and rail, with facilities to store renewable methanol that meets International Methanol Producers and Consumers Association specifications.

As a promising alternative to fossil fuels, renewable methanol plays a critical role in sectors where decarbonization is challenging, serving as a clean bunker fuel in marine transport and as an intermediate product in sustainable aviation fuel production, particularly within innovative eSAF pathways.

Metafuels’ aerobrew technology converts sustainably produced methanol into jet fuel with high-energetic efficiency and ultra-high carbon conversion.

The result is a drop-in fuel that reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 90 percent compared to conventional jet fuel without requiring aircraft reengineering or infrastructure changes.

“The justification for such technology is clear,” Metafuels stated. “The aviation sector accounts for over 2 percent of global CO2emissions—some 800 million tons.

When accounting for additional greenhouse gases and complex climate cofactors resulting from the nature and altitude of emissions, the sector’s total contribution to global warming rises to approximately 3.5 percent.

Aerobrew SAF plants can process biomethanol or eMethanol interchangeably, allowing the production of biobased SAF or eSAF, or both simultaneously, in response to market signals, according to Metafuels.

Biomethanol can be produced, for example, from biological waste, while eSAF uses renewable electricity and captured carbon to create synthetic fuels, offering a truly scalable and future-proof solution for aviation decarbonization.

The development of the Turbe plant is progressing steadily, according to Metafuels, with key milestones already achieved.

The next phase for Metafuels will be the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED), followed by a final-investment decision (FID) in mid-2026.

The project aligns with major European sustainability initiatives, including RefuelEU aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, and other legislation aimed at advancing the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.

Europe is expected to lead the adoption of synthetic or eFuels, according to Metafuels, driven by strong regulatory support.

Policymakers are relying on a substantial increase in eSAF capacity over the next decade, with the EU’s synthetic SAF submandate set to begin at 1.2 percent from 2030 rising to 35 percent from 2050.

“We have made excellent progress with our technology, and this first-of-a-kind commercial plant represents a major step forward in its commercial deployment,” said Metafuels CEO Saurabh Kapoor. “We are very excited about our cooperation with Evos as we work towards delivering the Turbe project. Europe has ambitious decarbonization targets, but without scalable and affordable SAF production, aviation will struggle to keep up.”

Christiaan Kop, the managing director at Evos Rotterdam, added, “Metafuels is addressing one of the aviation sector’s most urgent challenges. With our robust infrastructure, utilities and operational expertise, we are poised to support the deployment of Metafuels’ sustainable aviation fuel project. This cooperation demonstrates our commitment to supporting the implementation of scalable, efficient solutions that will drive the aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.”

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO Port of Rotterdam, said, “We are delighted that Metafuels, as an innovative producer of eSAF, has chosen Rotterdam for the development of a new production facility. We welcome their collaboration with Evos, allowing Metafuels to use Evos’ existing methanol infrastructure. This development contributes to the climate goals for aviation and further strengthens Rotterdam’s position as a leading hub for renewable fuels.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_a40b1e5e27194ff794b95585139c9b2f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_864,h_456,al_c,lg_1,q_85/80995f_a40b1e5e27194ff794b95585139c9b2f~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-19 12:57:17.533516

The company has established individual memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with 14 international airline carriers to promote sustainable practices within the air logistics sector.

This initiative is intended to mitigate the environmental impact associated with air freight transportation for its clientele.

The airlines involved in this collaboration include American Airlines, Air Canada, Air France Cargo, KLM Cargo, Atlas Air, Azul, Cargolux, Cathay Cargo, Delta Air Lines, LATAM Airlines Group, Lufthansa Cargo, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, and United Airlines.

The collaboration will concentrate on several critical areas to meet its sustainability objectives.

The mechanism builds on the DfT’s response to an initial consultation (which ran throughout March 2025), focusing on how a SAF revenue certainty mechanism might be funded.
Without the revenue certainty mechanism, SAF production costs could be prohibitively expensive; stifling growth.
With legislation expected to be in place by the end of next year, the DfT will also work to ensure “that both the SAF mandate and revenue certainty mechanism interact positively to avoid unintended consequences or perverse incentives when designing the revenue certainty mechanism and its funding mechanism”.
It noted that “collaboration with industry will be crucial in providing an effective revenue certainty mechanism as soon as possible”.","The UK Department for Transportation has published its SAF Bill, concluding that “as the aviation industry and its passengers, rather than the general taxpayer, will benefit the most from increased SAF production that the revenue certainty mechanism intends to support,” it retains its position that industry should fund the SAF revenue certainty mechanism strategy.

A new levy on aviation fuel suppliers “relative to their market share of fossil-based aviation turbine fuel” builds on the UK government’s existing SAF mandate, which entered into force at the beginning of this year. However, recognising that “the UK can face challenges sourcing investment into UK SAF production facilities, in part due to uncertainty over future revenues,” the new revenue certainty mechanism aims to “provide a launchpad for this sector to drive growth and investment”.

The mechanism builds on the DfT’s response to an initial consultation (which ran throughout March 2025), focusing on how a SAF revenue certainty mechanism might be funded. “The previous consultation response confirmed that the revenue certainty mechanism will use a guaranteed strike price (GSP), with the first tranche of contracts expected to be allocated to UK projects producing SAF using non-HEFA technologies and feedstocks,” outlined aviation minister Mike Kane. “A thriving SAF industry will drive economic growth, create good green jobs, and secure a domestic supply to meet the SAF mandate”.

The levy on aviation fuel suppliers (expected to impact some 20 companies) “may allow costs to be widely spread across the supply chain,” continued the DfT, adding that “this option is also less administratively burdensome than other options”. 58% of survey respondents agreed with this approach, with the DfT clarifying that “the levy will only be required if the price of SAF in the UK is low”. Without the revenue certainty mechanism, SAF production costs could be prohibitively expensive; stifling growth.

Notably, the DfT feel strongly against taxing alternative parts of industry (such as airlines, airports, passengers or ATC), believing that alongside administrational headaches, “there would likely also be challenges in differentiating airlines’ use of SAF from fossil kerosene and calculating market share based on other metrics could disincentivise airlines to increase their market share based on increased SAF usage”.

Additionally, the potential UK adoption of a similar scheme to Singapore (applying a levy on all air passengers) “does not align with the funding mechanism design principles of simplicity, affordability and fairness with market stability,” continued the DfT. Whereas Singaporean SAF procurement is controlled by the government, “the UK government is not currently set up to be a central SAF purchaser and supplier. Procuring and supplying fuels is currently effectively performed by industry and the market and there is substantial risk of government distorting the market by adopting this additional function,” the DfT added.

With legislation expected to be in place by the end of next year, the DfT will also work to ensure “that both the SAF mandate and revenue certainty mechanism interact positively to avoid unintended consequences or perverse incentives when designing the revenue certainty mechanism and its funding mechanism”. It noted that “collaboration with industry will be crucial in providing an effective revenue certainty mechanism as soon as possible”.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SAF-refuelling-at-London-Heathrow-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:57:21.225984

Once operational, the facility is expected to become the world’s largest commercial eFuels plant, producing up to 23,000 tonnes per year (approximately 7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other synthetic fuels.

A New Era for Clean Fuels

Project Roadrunner is a state-of-the-art “power-to-liquids” (PtL) facility that will convert captured waste carbon dioxide and renewable electricity into drop-in synthetic fuels—including eSAF, e-diesel, and e-naphtha. These eFuels are chemically identical to traditional petroleum-based fuels but emit significantly fewer lifecycle greenhouse gases.

The Pecos site repurposes an existing brownfield gas-to-liquids facility, adding new hydrogen and synthesis units. A centerpiece of the project is a 100 MW electrolyzer system supplied by Electric Hydrogen, which will generate green hydrogen on site. The system—Electric Hydrogen’s HYPRPlant platform—will be manufactured across Massachusetts and Texas in partnership with Titan Production Equipment.

Major Investment and Financing

While Infinium has not disclosed a precise total cost of its new facility, the scale of investment is clear. The project is backed by more than $275 million in equity financing, including over $200 million from Brookfield Asset Management and $75 million from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. Additional capital is expected from debt financing and monetization of U.S. federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

These investments make Roadrunner one of the most ambitious eFuels projects globally—both technologically and financially.

Economic and Local Impact

The facility is projected to have a transformational economic impact on Pecos and Reeves County. Infinium estimates the site’s assessed tax value will rise from around $15.9 million to approximately $180 million once operational—a tenfold increase that will dramatically expand the local tax base.

Also, the Infinium’s upcoming eFuels facility in west Texas represents a major investment in the region and will create highly skilled jobs in construction, fabrication, operations, and logistics—both locally in Pecos and throughout Texas.

Incentives and Support

To attract the project, Reeves County approved a suite of tax abatements, including:

60% ad valorem property tax abatement for 10 years, approved by the County Commissioners Court.

100% property tax abatement for 10 years on new project improvements, granted by Emergency Services District No.1, contingent on construction milestones.

Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone (TIRZ) designation to support infrastructure development.

At the federal level, the project leverages IRA incentives for clean hydrogen (45V) and sustainable fuels (40B/45Z), with Infinium monetizing part of these credits through pre-sale agreements with financial partners.

A NextEra Energy Resources subsidiary will supply 150 MW of newly built wind energy under a long-term purchase agreement to power the plant. Kinetik Holdings, a midstream gas processor in the Permian Basin, will deliver feedstock carbon dioxide via a dedicated pipeline from a nearby facility.

Customers and Market Reach

Infinium has signed long-term offtake agreements with global aviation leaders:

American Airlines, which will begin receiving eSAF from Roadrunner starting in 2026 under a 10-year deal.

International Airlines Group (IAG)—parent company of British Airways, Aer Lingus, Iberia, and others—will import eSAF from the site to meet sustainability requirements under the UK’s new SAF Mandate.

The EU Taxonomy sets out which economic activities can be considered “environmentally sustainable.” Until recently, aviation wasn’t included. That changed with a 2023 update that recognised certain aviation-related operations—like the manufacture or use of highly efficient aircraft, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending, and low-emission airport infrastructure—as eligible under “transitional” green criteria.

To qualify, however, aviation activities must meet stringent thresholds. For example, new aircraft must emit below a defined CO₂/km limit, be compatible with 100% SAF by 2028, and replace an older model on a near one-for-one basis. From 2030, flights using these aircraft must use at least 10% SAF to retain their “green” status.

Aircraft leasing, airport ground operations, and aircraft manufacturing are also included, but only when tied to demonstrable emission reductions or clean energy enablement. Notably, the taxonomy excludes private and business jets from green classification entirely.

So, what does a European sustainability checklist have to do with Gulf carriers?

Investors want green

While the taxonomy is EU legislation, it directly impacts the funding sources that many Middle Eastern aviation companies rely on, especially when dealing with European banks, leasing companies, or international capital markets. Under Europe’s sustainable finance rules, financial institutions are obligated to disclose how much of their portfolios are aligned with the taxonomy. This creates a strong incentive to prioritise clients and projects that tick the sustainability boxes.

That means a regional airline seeking to lease an aircraft from a European lessor or secure a loan from an ESG-focused fund may find itself subject to green scrutiny. If the aircraft, its operating emissions, or even the airport infrastructure it serves don’t meet the taxonomy standards, the financing terms could be less favourable, or unavailable altogether.

Conversely, carriers and operators that proactively align with these green standards could benefit. For instance, a new fleet of A350s ordered by a Middle Eastern airline could be deemed taxonomy-aligned if the aircraft replace older, less efficient models and support SAF integration. That would open the door to green bonds, lower-cost loans, and enhanced investor confidence.

The risk of inaction

It’s not just about access to financing. Over time, there’s a reputational and financial risk of being left behind.

Aircraft that don’t meet taxonomy criteria may face depreciating asset values as lessors and financiers avoid placing them. Airlines with older fleets may appear less attractive in investor disclosures. Even airport expansions may be scrutinised: is the project enabling low-emission operations, or merely adding capacity?

The taxonomy doesn’t just reward green alignment—it penalises misalignment by omission. And while Gulf carriers are not subject to EU compliance per se, being outside the “green” investment universe can erode competitiveness when fundraising or forming global partnerships.

Strategic moves for the region

The good news? The Gulf’s aviation sector is uniquely positioned to leverage this shift.

Carriers in the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia already operate some of the youngest, most efficient fleets in the world. Many are placing orders for new-generation aircraft that meet or exceed the EU’s emissions thresholds. With minimal adjustment, these investments can be framed and financed as taxonomy-aligned.

In parallel, several regional governments are ramping up their SAF agendas. The UAE has announced pilot projects for synthetic fuel, and Saudi Arabia’s NEOM is exploring green hydrogen production. These developments are not only climate-aligned; they’re also commercially opportune. With the EU mandating 10% SAF use by 2030, Gulf SAF producers could become preferred partners to European airlines and attract EU green finance to scale production.

Airports, too, can get ahead. Projects that prioritise electrified ground handling equipment, solar-powered infrastructure, or hydrogen refuelling capabilities are more likely to qualify for green funding. In an investment environment where ESG metrics are king, positioning infrastructure upgrades as taxonomy-compliant could unlock new revenue streams and partnerships.

A call to align

The EU Taxonomy may seem like a Brussels-centric initiative, but it’s quietly becoming a global reference point for what qualifies as “green” in aviation. For Middle East stakeholders, ignoring it is no longer an option.

Instead, regional aviation players should consider integrating taxonomy benchmarks into fleet planning, sustainability reporting, and financing strategies. Even voluntary alignment could yield tangible benefits, both in investor appeal and long-term asset value.

There’s a broader question here too: will the region develop its own taxonomy? The UAE is already working on one, and regulators across the GCC are watching closely. If they harmonise with EU criteria, regional compliance could become a formal necessity. If they don’t, market forces may still compel alignment.

In either case, the direction of travel is clear: capital is going green. And for the Gulf’s aviation industry to remain globally competitive, it needs to be green by design—or at the very least, green by association.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/05/19/espen-bierud-jGtUBwIAsA4-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 11:57:46.879377

“Sustainable fuel is the most critical solution we have to reduce emissions in our sector.

The report, titled Scaling Up Sustainable Fuel, provides a step-by-step guide for how businesses of all sizes—from hotels and tour operators to cruise lines and airlines—can contribute to a cleaner, greener future by adopting and promoting sustainable fuel use.

WTTC President and CEO Julia Simpson stressed the urgency of the situation. “Sustainable fuel is the most critical solution we have to reduce emissions in our sector. But the reality is, supply is nowhere near where it needs to be. If we don’t act now, we’ll see higher costs, restricted fuel access, and slower climate progress,” she said. “This roadmap gives every business a way to help. It’s time for governments to do more than set targets—they must support actual production.”

Currently, SAF makes up just 0.3% of global jet fuel use. To meet net-zero emissions goals by 2050, that figure must increase over 400 times—from 1.25 billion litres today to more than 450 billion litres annually. Achieving that will require around 6,500 new renewable fuel plants worldwide. Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF), also essential for cruise lines and shipping, faces similar challenges in availability and infrastructure.

SAF offers a unique advantage—it can be used in existing aircraft and engines without modification. However, production costs remain high, and access to raw materials is limited. Prices are still up to ten times higher than those of traditional fuels.

To address these barriers, the WTTC-ICF framework outlines clear actions for industry stakeholders, categorising them as Collaborators, Promoters, Adopters, or Investors. These range from simple steps like supplying used cooking oil or joining advocacy campaigns to more substantial investments such as funding SAF production facilities or purchasing sustainable fuel certificates.

Daniel Galpin, Managing Director at ICF, said collaboration across the sector is essential. “Reducing transport emissions is vital if we’re serious about sustainable tourism. While the aviation sector is making progress, the entire travel industry must now join in. Our partnership with WTTC highlights practical roles that companies can take to move us all forward.”

The report includes real-world examples of companies already taking action. In Asia, the Erawan Group is turning waste oil from hotels into SAF. In the UK, Jet2 has invested in a SAF facility that turns household waste into jet fuel.

However, the report also warns that inaction could have economic consequences. With several governments set to mandate a 5–10% SAF blend in aviation fuel by 2030, businesses that fail to prepare could face higher costs and reduced consumer options.

As the global travel and tourism sector is projected to generate $16.5 trillion and support over 460 million jobs by 2035, the push for sustainable fuel is not only about climate—it’s about safeguarding the industry’s future.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-5.png,N,,2025-05-19 11:58:03.530462

Метод ускорительной масс-спектрометрии базируется на подсчете количества атомов радиоактивного изотопа углерода С-14 в исследуемом образце.","Новосибирск. 19 мая. ИНТЕРФАКС - Ученые Новосибирского госуниверситета и РГУ нефти и газа (НИУ) имени И.М. Губкина (РГУНГ, Москва) планируют разработать стандартную методику определения биоуглерода в синтетическом авиакеросине (SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel, получаемого из растительного сырья), с помощью ускорительной масс-спектрометрии (УМС), сообщает пресс-служба НГУ.

Отмечается, что в РГУНГ разработана технология совместной переработки лигноцеллюлозного сырья PCH-SAF, основанная на процессах быстрого пиролиза, замедленного коксования и гидрокрекинга, традиционного нефтяного и растительного сырья.

В качестве исходной биомассы используются отходы - опилки хвойных и лиственных пород, подсолнечная лузга и прочее.

""Предложенная нами технология PCH-SAF за счет уже имеющейся инфраструктуры позволит в короткий срок совершить переход на выработку авиационного биотоплива со сниженным углеродным следом без значительных капиталовложений. В случае успешных испытаний и подтверждения снижения углеродного следа необходимо провести допуск такого топлива при участии ведущих организаций ФАУ ""25 ГосНИИ химмотологии Минобороны России"", ФАУ ""ЦИАМ им. П.И. Баранова"", ФГУП ГосНИИ ГА для применения в воздушных судах гражданской и военной авиации"", - приводятся в сообщении слова профессора кафедры технологии переработки нефти РГУНГ Михаила Ершова.

Керосин, получаемый по технологии PCH-SAF, должен соответствовать требованиям ГОСТ 10227, предъявляемым к топливам для реактивных двигателей, и ничем не отличаться от нефтяных керосинов. Для производства SAF требуется сертификация и контроль за выполнением требований на минимальное содержание доли ""биоуглерода"".

В Центре коллективного пользования ""Ускорительная масс-спектрометрия НГУ-ННЦ"" впервые провели анализ содержания биоуглерода в образцах устойчивого авиационного топлива (SAF). В ходе лабораторного исследования были проанализированы четыре образца различного происхождения.

""Полученные результаты показали, что метод ускорительной масс-спектрометрии может стать рутинным методом анализа биоуглерода в авиационном топливе SAF"", - говорится в сообщении.

Отмечается, что биогенный углерод от ископаемого отличается изотопным составом - прежде всего, концентрацией радиоактивного изотопа С-14 (радиоуглерода) относительно основного стабильного изотопа С-12.

В ЦКП УМС НГУ-ННЦ в качестве ознакомительных или тестовых экспериментов из РГУНГ поступили четыре образца, из них два реперных (стандартных), представляющих собой керосин, полученный исключительно из биологического сырья, и керосин из ископаемой нефти, а также два образца керосина, полученных смешением первых двух в неизвестных новосибирским ученым пропорциях.

Из каждого образца было изготовлено по три графитовых катода и проведен УМС-анализ всех проб.

""Наши экспериментальные результаты совпали с расчетными соотношениями, по которым специалисты РГУНГ приготовили смесевые образцы, что подтверждает правомерность применения метода УМС для определения биоуглерода"", - отмечает директор ЦКП УМС НГУ-ННЦ Екатерина Пархомчук.

Как сообщалось, Международная организация гражданской авиации (ICAO) приняла программу компенсации и сокращения выбросов углерода для международной авиации (CORSIA), к которой присоединились 107 стран. РФ, Индия и Китай программу пока не приняли, однако с 2022 года все участники ICAO обязаны выполнять все требования программы CORSIA.

С 2025 года рейсы из ЕС должны использовать 2% SAF, к 2050 году эта доля достигнет 63%.

ЦКП ""Ускорительная масс-спектрометрия НГУ-ННЦ"" - единственный в России, только он располагает установками УМС. Метод ускорительной масс-спектрометрии базируется на подсчете количества атомов радиоактивного изотопа углерода С-14 в исследуемом образце. Ускорительный масс-спектрометр работает только с графитовыми мишенями. Поэтому образец органического вещества должен быть предварительно очищен и пропущен через так называемый графитизатор.

Предварительно из костей извлекают коллаген, из почвы - гуминовые кислоты, из древесины - целлюлозу, углекислый газ, растворенный в подземной воде, преобразовывают в карбонаты металлов, из органического вещества почв или осадков получают углекислый газ. Затем все эти вещества проходят многостадийную процедуру зауглероживания, или графитизации.

Morocco is rapidly emerging as a frontrunner in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production within North Africa and the broader MENA region. As the global aviation industry intensifies efforts to reduce carbon emissions, sustainable aviation fuel offers a tangible path toward decarbonizing one of the hardest-to-abate sectors.

Morocco’s strategic location, abundant renewable energy resources, governmental commitment, and growing industrial ecosystem collectively position the country to become the regional hub for SAF production and supply.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources such as biomass, agricultural residues, waste oils, or through synthetic processes powered by clean energy. It can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a vital solution in the aviation sector’s quest for net-zero emissions.

1.Strategic Geographic Location:

Morocco’s geographic position at the gateway between Africa and Europe, along with proximity to the Middle East, is a critical asset. The country’s airports serve as key transit points on major flight routes connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas. This prime location allows Morocco to efficiently distribute SAF to airlines operating within these corridors, facilitating easier and cost-effective supply logistics.

Royal Air Maroc’s pioneering SAF-powered flight from Marrakech to Paris in early 2025 highlights how Morocco’s location allows it to integrate sustainable fuels into high-traffic international routes. Morocco’s potential to become a regional SAF hub aligns with increasing SAF mandates in the European Union and other global markets that require minimum blending percentages of sustainable fuels in aviation.

Renewable Energy Potential

Morocco ranks among the global leaders in solar and wind energy development. The Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex, spanning over 3,000 hectares, is one of the world’s largest concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, delivering massive clean energy capacity. Complemented by extensive wind farms across the country, Morocco’s renewable energy supply is both abundant and reliable.

SAF production, particularly e-fuels synthesized from green hydrogen, requires vast amounts of clean electricity. Morocco’s renewable resources enable the production of SAF with minimal carbon footprint, ensuring the fuel’s sustainability credentials are robust. By leveraging solar and wind energy, Morocco can produce SAF at scale without exacerbating fossil fuel dependence, a key differentiator compared to countries reliant on carbon-intensive grids.

Strong Government Support and Policy Framework

Morocco’s government has embedded clean energy and sustainable transport into its national development agenda. The Moroccan Ministry of Transport and Logistics has explicitly prioritized the integration of renewable energies within transport systems, aiming to boost energy efficiency and reduce emissions.

High-level commitments have translated into action, with Morocco signing significant renewable energy and green hydrogen agreements with international firms. For example, the OCP Group Morocco’s phosphate giant is partnering with French energy multinational Engie in a multibillion-euro investment plan focusing on green hydrogen, e-methanol, and SAF projects. These agreements aim to kick-start large-scale SAF production plants by the mid-2020s, signaling robust governmental backing.

Regulatory incentives and compliance with EU sustainable aviation fuel mandates provide additional market drivers for Morocco to develop its SAF industry. The government’s proactive role in facilitating industry partnerships, infrastructure development, and funding frameworks further solidifies its leadership ambitions.

Emerging Industrial and Innovation Ecosystem

Morocco’s industrial ecosystem is rapidly evolving to support sustainable fuel production. The country’s chemical and energy sectors are adapting to new technologies such as green hydrogen electrolysis and biomass conversion processes.

Notably, Swiss clean tech company Synhelion is exploring Morocco as a key site for its solar-powered synthetic fuel production. Synhelion’s technology uses concentrated solar energy to convert water and CO₂ into synthetic aviation fuels, a revolutionary process that Morocco’s abundant sunshine makes possible at scale.

The presence of strong research institutions and increasing collaboration between Moroccan and international companies fosters innovation, positioning Morocco to develop cutting-edge SAF technologies. This ecosystem will be critical to reducing production costs and improving the commercial viability of sustainable fuels.

Early Adoption and Demonstration Projects

Morocco’s early SAF initiatives validate its readiness to lead in this space. Royal Air Maroc operated its first SAF-powered commercial flight in February 2025, utilizing fuel derived from sustainable biomass and waste oils. This milestone demonstrated operational feasibility, significant carbon reductions (up to 33%), and regulatory compliance with European SAF blending mandates.

Such demonstration projects build confidence among industry stakeholders, attract investment, and accelerate broader SAF adoption. Morocco’s experience in integrating SAF on a commercial scale positions it as a regional role model.

Economic and Social Benefits, Beyond Environmental Impact

Developing a local SAF industry offers Morocco substantial economic advantages. It aligns with the country’s broader goals of economic diversification and industrial modernization, reducing dependency on fossil fuel imports.

SAF production can spur job creation in renewable energy, agriculture (for biomass feedstock), advanced manufacturing, and research sectors. It also promotes rural development by engaging farmers and local communities in supplying sustainable feedstocks like agricultural residues and non-food crops.

Morocco’s leadership in SAF could attract foreign direct investment and partnerships, boosting the national economy and enhancing regional competitiveness in green technologies.

Regional and Global Environmental Leadership

Morocco’s SAF ambitions carry significant environmental implications. The aviation sector accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, and its growth trajectory risks undermining climate goals. By scaling SAF production, Morocco can contribute to a substantial reduction in aviation emissions regionally and globally.

Morocco’s success can also inspire neighboring countries in Africa and the Middle East to adopt similar sustainable energy pathways, accelerating the continent’s clean energy transition. Its leadership in SAF production places Morocco at the forefront of Africa’s climate action efforts, strengthening its geopolitical standing as a green energy pioneer.

Challenges and the Path Forward

While Morocco’s potential is clear, several challenges must be addressed to realize its SAF leadership:

High Production Costs: Current SAF production costs remain significantly higher than conventional jet fuel, requiring technological advancements and economies of scale.

Infrastructure Development: Building the necessary supply chains, storage, and blending facilities demands substantial investment and coordination.

Feedstock Availability: Ensuring sustainable, non-food feedstock supply without impacting food security or biodiversity is critical.

Policy Harmonization: Aligning regional policies and securing international market access will be key to scaling exports.

Despite these challenges, Morocco’s strong foundational assets, proactive government, and growing partnerships provide a solid roadmap. Continued investments in technology, regulatory support, and international collaboration will be pivotal.",http://africaenergynews.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMAGE-2-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 07:56:48.704507

Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, says he wants to see a clear path forward on tax credits for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production.
“45Z is a tax credit that goes to the producer of a clean fuel,” he says.
“To qualify for the tax credit, you have to be producing a fuel that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent.
For sustainable aviation fuel in particular, it has a higher value.","Airplanes are running on sustainable aviation fuel right now, and they want more of it!

Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, says he wants to see a clear path forward on tax credits for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. In order to make that happen, RFA needs some updates from the federal government, particularly when it comes to 45Z.

“45Z is a tax credit that goes to the producer of a clean fuel,” he says. “To qualify for the tax credit, you have to be producing a fuel that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent. As that greenhouse gas reduction increases, the value of the tax credit increases. For sustainable aviation fuel in particular, it has a higher value. So if a SAF producer is making aviation fuel that is net-zero emissions or a 100 percent greenhouse gas reduction, that’s worth a $1.75 a gallon to that producer.”

RFA wants Congress to give 45Z a longer shelf life — it’s set to expire in 2027 — so that the U.S. Treasury can make the ruling giving tax credits to SAF producers.

“We don’t have final rules on 45Z. All we have today is a ‘notice of intent’ to propose regulations from the U.S. Treasury, and that’s not enough for the industry to hang its hat on and make these huge investments, which are often hundreds of millions of dollars,” Cooper says. “So, we’re waiting for the Treasury to follow through with the next steps in that process, which would be a formal proposal and then ultimately a final rule.”

Cooper adds that RFA believes the final 45Z regulations must recognize the realities of today’s biorefining and agriculture sectors and the complexities of the transportation fuels marketplace. At the same time, final regulations must maintain an intuitive and manageable approach to registration, reporting, and recordkeeping that creates the kind of dependable value that empowers businesses to invest.

Welcome to the one hundred twelfth edition of the Japan FinTech Observer.

To receive individual articles straight to your inbox when released, please subscribe to the Japan FinTech Observer on its own website.

We are almost through earnings season, with mainly the three mega insurers scheduled for this week. So you will find quite a few highlights of financial results in this edition, and we are hosting a webinar on Tuesday, May 20, to discuss key developments. Registrations are open on Luma.

Undisputed highlights this week were (I) the Sumitomo Mitsui Card (Olive) partnership with Softbank (including PayPay), bringing together the leaders in credit & debit cards and QR code payments, and expanding Olive beyond financial applications towards super app status; and (II) Sony providing a detailed schedule and mechanics for the spin-off of its financial services business — the business plan for the standalone entity will be revealed at a later investor day.

Here is what we are going to cover this week:

Venture Capital & Private Markets: Acompany has completed its Series B round; AgeWellJapan has secured new funding; ASUENE has acquired 100% of the shares of NZero; new funds from MPower Partners and CryptoGames

Insurance: Dai-ichi Life Holdings has decided to make an additional investment of approximately 10.3% in Capula

AgeWellJapan has secured new funding; this round marks the first investment from the “Region, People, and Future CJS2 Fund” and UNERI Corporation, bringing the total amount raised to 310 million yen; moving forward, the company will focus on promoting business co-creation to realize an Age-Well society and strengthen talent acquisition

ASUENE has acquired 100% of the shares of NZero, a US-based climate tech company providing real-time GHG emissions visualization and AI energy management cloud services; through this acquisition, ASUENE will accelerate the visualization of CO2 emissions and implementation of reduction measures for US companies; by combining ASUENE’s achievement as Asia’s №1 in CO2 emissions visualization business with NZero’s top-class AI-powered energy management system technology implemented by US state governments, ASUENE will build a world-class decarbonization platform

JETRO has published an “Overview of Japanese Startup Investments for US Venture Capitalists”; the publication, coming out of JETRO’s San Francisco office, was prepared to dispel the prevailing perceptions among U.S. investors regarding Japanese startup investments; by describing the characteristics of Japanese startup legal practices from the perspective of U.S. startup legal practices, the publication aims to provide U.S. and international investors with a clearer and more detailed understanding of the Japanese startup legal practices

New Funds

Not FinTech

Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking (MUTB) has entered into a Preferred Shares Investment Agreement with Euglena in which MUTB invests up to USD 30 million in preferred shares issued by Euglena Sustainable Investment Limited (ESIL), Euglena’s overseas special purpose company (SPC); by engaging in a project to construct and operate a biofuel manufacturing plant in Malaysia through the investment in ESIL, MUTB will support establishing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply chain and contribute to Japan’s decarbonization together with Euglena

Mitsubishi UFJ Capital participates in ARCS’ funding round: ARCS, which aims to automate assisted reproductive technology, has raised an additional 270 million yen following its 1st close of the Pre-Series A round (approximately 530 million yen) conducted on January 17, 2025, bringing the total for the Pre-Series A round to approximately 800 million yen

Insurance

Sony Group is embarking on a significant strategic shift by partially spinning off its Financial Services business; the motivation behind this move is multifaceted, encompassing a desire for greater focus on core entertainment and technology areas, enhanced operational agility for both Sony and the financial services entity, and an improved capital allocation strategy; the decision follows a period where Sony Financial Group Inc. (SFGI), a wholly-owned subsidiary, achieved operational successes after initially becoming fully integrated within Sony; despite this integration, Sony believes a spin-off is the next logical step to unlock further value and drive sustainable growth; Sony emphasizes that the Financial Services business, while valuable, has somewhat constrained Sony’s ability to efficiently allocate capital toward its highest-growth potential areas, primarily the entertainment sector (including gaming, music, and movies) and the image sensor business; these sectors are seen as holding the key to Sony’s future innovation and market leadership; by separating the financial services arm, Sony aims to free up resources to invest more aggressively in these core areas

Dai-ichi Life Holdings has decided to make an additional investment of approximately 10.3% in Capula, a leading UK-based alternative management firm with world-class expertise in fixed-income arbitrage, crisis alpha and global macro strategies, while agreeing to transfer all shares held by Dai-ichi Life International in Ocean Life Insurance, a Thai life insurance company, to the founding family of Ocean Life, who are the controlling shareholder

Sustainable Lab has signed an agreement with Tottori Bank to cooperate in helping regional companies achieve ESG and sustainability management; Sustainable Lab will collaborate with Tottori Bank to provide the opportunity to use “TERRAST for Enterprise” as a special benefit for the bank’s “Tottori Bank Sustainability Start Loan” program; companies using this loan will have the opportunity to visualize their ESG and sustainability management status through “TERRAST for Enterprise”

Hitachi ZeroCarbon and MUFG have joined forces to supercharge the global transition to electric vehicles by removing the technical and capital constraints to decarbonisation; in combining Hitachi’s technology and operational expertise with MUFG’s financial strength, fleets benefit from strategic EV guidance and support, and reliable access to low-cost capital that protects long-term asset value

Credit Saison’s Indian subsidiary has begun raising funds through External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) loans; the subsidiary has signed a contract to execute a 150 million US dollar ECB loan from Mizuho Bank, which is a capital participant in Credit Saison India; Credit Saison India has previously promoted diversification of its funding sources through borrowings from over 35 local financial institutions, as well as by issuing corporate bonds and commercial paper

The Bank of Japan has published “Recent Developments in Non-Bank Financial Intermediation and Initiatives to Enhance Its Resilience”, presenting an overview of NBFI’s financial intermediation, summarizing policy initiatives designed to enhance its resilience, and providing perspectives on issues surrounding NBFI through a review of the FSB’s regular issue of the “Global Monitoring Report on Non-Bank Financial Intermediation” and its policy recommendations

The traps will be placed in 36 counties in western and central Wisconsin from mid-May through early July. Trap locations are determined according to a grid- and data-based system. Most traps will be set along public roadside rights-of-way, but some will require placement on private property in areas where new infestations are suspected. DATCP requests that all traps remain undisturbed once they are in place.

“Traps are used both to monitor known spongy moth populations and to identify new populations in previously uninfested areas,” says Amanda Miller, DATCP Spongy Moth Trapping Coordinator. “Even though spongy moth populations drastically decreased last season, the total male moth catches still set a record. It was the second highest in recent program history. Data collected from traps this season will be crucial in the program’s effort to pinpoint new populations. As well as limit their spread before infestations become large enough to cause damage to trees.”

What The Traps Are

Spongy moth traps are small green boxes stapled or tied to trees. The trap emits the scent of flightless female spongy moths to attract and catch adult male spongy moths. The lure scent is undetectable to other insects, animals, and humans. Although these traps catch adult male spongy moths, the primary purpose is to gather data to inform follow up control efforts. It does not have direct, meaningful impacts on the population of this invasive species.

Trapping staff will monitor traps until male moths stop flying. This usually occurs around Labor Day. At that time the traps will be removed. DATCP trapping staff are easily identifiable, wearing fluorescent vests and carrying identification. Each trap is labeled with a phone number and QR code that property owners can utilize if they have questions, want to report a damaged trap, or would like to request the trap be removed from their property.",https://www.q106.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2369128857-300x200-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 22:56:09.723265

Mr Charlton said New South Wales’ strong canola-growing capacity made it a logical location for establishing a domestic SAF manufacturing industry.
She said the government was “committed to providing the support” required to develop a domestic sustainable fuels industry.
GrainCorp crush plans SAF importer Ampol is also a signatory to a memorandum of understanding with GrainCorp and IFM Investors to progress domestic renewable fuels industry.
He said the work to develop a potential renewable fuels refinery at Lytton had “progressed to the pre-FEED study phase”.","QANTAS, Sydney Airport and Ampol have marked Australia’s largest commercial import of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with nearly two million litres arriving last week.

The milestone has underscored growing domestic demand for sustainable aviation fuel, prompting renewed calls from industry for Federal Government policy support to help establish local manufacturing capacity.

Proponents of domestic SAF and renewable fuel production, including GrainCorp, have highlighted potential benefits for the grains sector, with canola already used as a feedstock and emerging crops like carinata and pongamia showing promise.

In the GrainCorp half year to March 31 results presentation on Thursday, chief executive officer and managing director Robert Spurway indicated the company’s proposed crush plant would only proceed once sufficient demand was confirmed to justify the investment.

Record SAF importation

The record SAF shipment was imported by Ampol from Malaysia to its Kurnell facility on May 7 and is currently being blended with conventional aviation fuel before testing and certification so that it can be distributed into the Sydney Airport supply chain.

It will then be used on flights departing from Sydney Airport over the coming weeks.

Sydney Airport chief executive officer Scott Charlton said the airport accounted for nearly 40 percent of Australia’s total aviation fuel uplift, giving it “a big opportunity to be a leader in the development of a domestic SAF industry”.

Mr Charlton said New South Wales’ strong canola-growing capacity made it a logical location for establishing a domestic SAF manufacturing industry.

“NSW is uniquely placed to develop this industry, as a major producer of important feedstocks like canola,” Mr Charlton said.

“Most of Australia’s canola harvest currently goes offshore to be turned into biofuels by other nations.

“With the right policy settings at a state and federal level, and governments working in partnership with industry, NSW can become a global leader on SAF – creating local jobs, supporting local industry, and fuelling more sustainable flights in the future.”

Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said the milestone was a proud moment for the company and the impact of collaboration across industries to achieve decarbonisation.

“We pick up 70pc of our fuel in Australia so we’re looking forward to working closely with the government to chart the next course for SAF in Australia,” Ms Hudson said.

“The alignment of industry and government will be critical to establishing and scaling an industry here.”

In response, the recently returned Federal Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Catherine King said the announcement was “a vote of confidence in the sector and a signal that demand is there” for SAF.

She said the government was “committed to providing the support” required to develop a domestic sustainable fuels industry.

“We made progress in our first term of government to develop a low carbon liquid fuel industry on our shores, and we look forward to building on that work as we build Australia’s future,” Ms King said.

GrainCorp crush plans

SAF importer Ampol is also a signatory to a memorandum of understanding with GrainCorp and IFM Investors to progress domestic renewable fuels industry.

The group is progressing the feasibility assessment for a renewable fuels facility, with capacity to produce over 450 million litres annually, at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Brisbane.

The MOU also includes working with GrainCorp to explore the supply of homegrown feedstocks, including increased crushing capacity for canola oil to the future plant.

GrainCorp is currently targeting a front-end engineering design phase in 2026, but this would be subject to favourable policy to accelerate supply and demand of low-carbon liquid fuels.

During the HY25 announcement, Mr Spurway noted the announcement by Qantas, Ampol and Sydney Airport commenting that this demonstrated the presence of demand from SAF consumers.

“It makes absolute sense over the medium term to see that demand manufactured in Australia, which will provide better economic outcomes, better carbon intensity outcomes and the opportunity for investment and job creation in Australia,” Mr Spurway said.

“We have an existing MOU with our partners in Ampol, IFM and we continue to work together with them on the deliverables of that MOU, particularly around developing an opportunity for supply to Ampol in the event that they convert the refinery in Brisbane to process renewable fuels.

“This also requires bringing many parts of the industry together, including having the right government policy frameworks in place.

“As we’ve always said, GrainCorp’s investment in a future crush plant will be reliant on the demand being in place.”

Mr Halliday echoed the calls for Federal Government intervention or signals during Ampol’s annual general meeting held on Thursday.

He said the work to develop a potential renewable fuels refinery at Lytton had “progressed to the pre-FEED study phase”.

“As is the case in other countries, the establishment of a renewable fuels industry in Australia requires effective policy to support both local demand and local supply, and this is an area we will continue to work on with government, together with our partners and our customers.”",https://www.graincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sustainable_Aviation_Fuel_SAF_STI_Marvel_Oil_Tanker_Kurnell_Kurt_Ams_070525_DSC01008-scaled-e1747282831641.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 20:56:09.382787

This season marks a significant advancement in the sport’s environmental efforts, building on trials from previous years.

Renewable energy system will power the pit and paddock areas, while both the Formula 2 and Formula 3 championships will continue to run on 100% advanced sustainable fuel, setting the stage for Formula 1 cars to use these fuels by 2026.

Commenting on the transition, head of ESG at Formula 1, Ellen Jones, said: “It is incredibly exciting to see our alternative fuel strategy deliver significant carbon reductions across the European season and beyond.”

“We remain on track to be Net Zero by 2030, and it is new technologies and innovations such as this that will see us hit our goal.

“Working with our partners, as well as all of our teams and the FIA, the sport is proving that you can grow sustainably, with no compromise to our on-track product or fan experience,” Jones said.

The Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix featured a new low-carbon energy system in the paddock, with the initiative expected to cut carbon emissions from energy use by about 90%.

This system is being put in place with Formula 1’s partner, Aggreko, after successful tests at the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix and similar events in Hungary and Italy in 2024.

These trials showed big drops in carbon emissions in key areas like the paddock and pit lane.

The new energy solution for the paddock centralises power from renewable sources including hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar energy, and battery energy storage systems (BESS).

This means Formula 1, its ten teams, and the FIA no longer need individual generators, leading to significant carbon reductions and less pollution from transportation.

On the other note, DHL’s biofuel trucks will also play a big role in Europe, further boosting Formula 1’s sustainability efforts by using more alternative fuels, these trucks achieved an average emission reduction of 83% compared to regular fuels during European races.

The fuel being developed is designed to be a “drop-in” option, meaning it can be used in existing road vehicles without any changes, offering a sustainable choice with global implications.

Lastly, Formula 1’s proactive alternative fuel strategy has been key to its ongoing efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Last year, the sport invested a lot in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which led to an estimated 80% reduction in carbon emissions per flight compared to traditional aviation fuels.

Working with global partners like DHL and Qatar Airways, Formula 1 has collectively cut over 8,000 tCO2e (tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) across flyaway events in the 2024 season, representing an approximate 19% decrease in total emissions from conventional aviation fuel.",https://ministryofsport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DHL-Biofuel-Trucks-169.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 20:56:13.397900

In March 2025, BPI successfully completed the deal with I Squared Capital (ISQ), a leading global infrastructure investment firm, to support the acquisition of Philippine Coastal Storage and Pipeline Corporation (PCSPC) from Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC) and Keppel Infrastructure Trust (KIT).

BPI served as the sole lender, while its investment banking arm, BPI Capital, acted as the mandated lead arranger for the transaction.

Furthermore, BPI Asset Management and Trust Corp. also served as the Facility Agent and Trustee.

But for the first time in decades, Malaysia has an industrial strategy with teeth, torque, and timing.","If you want to understand how Malaysia is trying to future-proof its economy in the postpandemic era, don’t look at GDP charts or trade figures—look at how it’s rethinking its industrial playbook.

In fact, Kuala Lumpur is doing something that would make the ghost of Billy Joel’s Allentown blink twice: it’s throwing out the old industrial-growth ladder and trying to build a new one—faster, greener, and smarter.

Five big strategies are leading the charge, and together, they reveal how Malaysia hopes to sidestep the fate of mid-income stagnation and premature deindustrialisation.

NIMP 2030

Start with the New Industrial Master Plan 2030—the nerve center of the whole policy machine. It’s Malaysia’s first mission-based industrial strategy, and it reads more like a tech company’s OKRs than a government white paper.

Four big missions—boost complexity, tech-up the economy, go net-zero, and secure inclusive growth—are broken down into 62 actionable plans and a portfolio of nine “mission-based projects,” including a locally-made EV.

The headline target: grow manufacturing GDP by 6.5% annually and raise total manufacturing value-added to RM587.5 billion by 2030. Think aerospace, specialty chemicals, EV components, semiconductors.

And to get there, Malaysia aims to retrofit 3,000 factories into smart, Industry 4.0 facilities. This is not your grandfather’s industrial plan—it’s a moonshot.

But the plan doesn’t fly without chips—semiconductors, that is. Enter the National Semiconductor Strategy, launched in 2024.

Malaysia already sits at the heart of global back-end chip assembly (OSAT), but the real money—and strategic leverage—is in moving up the value chain: advanced packaging, wafer fabs, even IC design.

The NSS is Malaysia’s bid to become the Switzerland of silicon: neutral, reliable, and indispensable. Backed by RM25 billion in fiscal incentives, the goal is to draw RM500 billion in total investments and nurture at least ten Malaysian chip design or packaging firms that can break RM1 billion in annual revenue. Alongside this? Training 60,000 engineers.

The message to Intel, Nvidia, and TSMC is clear: if you’re decoupling from China, you’re welcome in Penang.

All of this, of course, requires a massive digital backbone—which is where MyDIGITAL and the Industry4WRD masterplan come in. These initiatives aim to digitize the entire economy —factories, farms, finance, and everything in between.

Targets include lifting the digital economy to 22.6% of GDP, getting 875,000 MSMEs online, and creating half a million

digital jobs by the end of the decade.

Phase Three (2026–2030) is about embedding AI, robotics, and cybersecurity into real economic sectors—especially manufacturing. The pandemic turned this into a necessity. Years of digital transformation happened in just months.

Malaysia’s challenge now is making sure its smallest firms don’t get left behind on the wrong side of the analogue divide.

EV

Then comes the Electric Vehicle and Smart Mobility Agenda, driven by a suite of overlapping frameworks: the National Automotive Policy 2020, the Low-Carbon Mobility Blueprint, and NIMP’s EV missions. By 2030, Malaysia wants EVs and hybrids to make up 15–20% of new vehicle sales, with a long-term goal of 80% by 2050.

To get there, it’s not just about charging stations—it’s about creating an EV manufacturing ecosystem: battery assembly, power electronics (linking back to the chip strategy), and recycling infrastructure. In a world rushing to electrify, Malaysia wants to be more than a market—it wants to be a maker.

Finally, we get to the green engine of the whole transition: the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR).

Think of it as Malaysia’s way of turning climate pressure into an industrial opportunity. The plan lays out RM 120–180 billion in green-industry investments by 2030, tied to flagship projects in solar-PV manufacturing, sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, and grid-scale energy storage.

If successful, this strategy could add RM220 billion to GDP by 2050 and create over 300,000 jobs. Malaysia is already the world’s third-largest solar module exporter—now it’s trying to replicate that industrial success in next-gen clean tech.

What makes all five of these plans work together isn’t just good timing—it’s good crossstitching.

Talent pipelines from the NSS feed directly into MyDIGITAL and NETR. Industrial clusters from NIMP interlock with EV and chip strategies. The digital and green agendas reinforce each other: solar-powered factories that run on AI-optimized workflows are no longer science fiction—they’re industrial policy.

And perhaps most importantly, Malaysia is signaling a predictable investment environment—an antidote to the pandemic-era global scramble for resilience and redundancy.

The bottom line? Malaysia is betting big on “high-tech, green-tech, and supply-chain resilience” to keep its industrial base not just alive, but competitive.

The risk of failure is real—execution remains the Achilles’ heel of even the best-designed plans. But for the first time in decades, Malaysia has an industrial strategy with teeth, torque, and timing. And in a post-Allentown world, that could make all the difference. - DagangNews.com

The integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends into heavy-fuel aircraft piston engines (HF-APE) presents significant potential for decarbonizing general aviation propulsion systems. This study systematically investigates gaseous and particulate emissions to advance sustainable aviation and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies. A hybrid experimental and simulation methodology was employed to assess combustion characteristics and emission behavior in HF-APE fueled with SAF-biodiesel and SAF-RP-3 blends. Emission measurements, conducted in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 16 standards, utilized high-precision instrumentation across a range of engine speeds. The simulation framework was meticulously calibrated and validated, demonstrating strong correlation with experimental results in predicting combustion behavior, flow dynamics, and emission profiles. Experimentally, the 50% SAF + 50% RP-3 blend exhibited the most favorable emission characteristics, achieving up to 63% and 75% reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, respectively, relative to biodiesel-rich blends, while the 30% SAF + 70% Biodiesel blend exhibited up to 19% higher nitrogen oxide (NOₓ) emissions. Particle size distribution (PSD) analysis revealed that RP-3 blends reduced nucleation-mode particle concentrations by 30–40%, with total particulate matter (PM) number emissions (EIntotal) decreasing by approximately 38%. Microscopic evaluation confirmed smaller, less porous particulate structures for RP-3 blends, indicative of improved combustion completeness. Simulations further demonstrated that 50% SAF + 50% RP-3 achieved the highest intake (~10.7 g/s) and exhaust (~13.8 g/s) mass flow rates, along with superior cylinder performance, reaching ~81 kW brake power, ~230 g/kWh brake-specific fuel consumption, and a 28% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions at elevated speeds. Overall, 50% SAF + 50% RP-3 and 30% SAF + 70% RP-3 emerged as the most promising blends for enhancing HF-APE efficiency and environmental performance. Minor discrepancies between simulation and experimental results, particularly in CO, CO₂, and HC emission levels, were attributed to inherent modeling assumptions, yet the simulation reliably captured overall engine behavior.",https://cdn.ssrn.com/ssrn-global-header/11589acb53bc518aa22929bf19add113.svg,N,,2025-05-18 22:56:19.062668

The EU’s Renewable Energy Directive and associated funding mechanisms are stimulating R&D into integrating biogas and CO2-derived feedstocks with GTL catalysis, aiming for net-zero synthetic fuels (European Commission Directorate-General for Energy).

Looking ahead, strong policy tailwinds and strategic investments are expected to further boost GTL catalysis engineering over the next several years. Emphasis is likely to remain on catalyst durability, efficiency, and the lowering of process carbon intensity, while government-backed pilot projects and public-private partnerships will play a pivotal role in scaling up innovations from lab to commercial scale.

End-Use Applications: Transportation, Power, and Chemicals

Gas-to-liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering is entering a pivotal phase as end-use applications expand in response to decarbonization and energy security agendas worldwide. In 2025 and the coming years, the most significant drivers for GTL deployment are the transportation, power generation, and chemicals sectors, each leveraging advancements in catalysis for tailored, cleaner fuels and feedstocks.

In transportation, GTL-derived synthetic diesel and jet fuels are gaining traction due to their ultra-low sulfur content and favorable combustion characteristics. Major GTL projects, such as the Pearl GTL plant operated by Shell in Qatar, continue to supply significant volumes of GTL diesel and lubricants that meet stringent emissions regulations. The aviation sector is particularly interested in GTL-based synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK), an approved drop-in fuel for commercial flights. Qatar Airways has participated in demonstration flights utilizing GTL jet fuel, highlighting its role in reducing particulate and sulfur emissions.

For power generation, GTL naphtha and diesel are being explored as alternatives to conventional fuels, especially in regions where natural gas is abundant but infrastructure for direct use is lacking. GTL fuels burn cleaner, reducing NOx and particulate emissions in turbines and engines. Sasol continues to operate large-scale GTL facilities in South Africa and Qatar, providing consistent supply for both mobile and stationary power applications. Moreover, the modular GTL plants, such as those offered by Velocys, are expected to proliferate in remote locations or for distributed power generation, supported by advances in compact and robust Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysis.

Transportation: GTL fuels are forecast to supplement conventional diesel in heavy-duty trucking and marine sectors, thanks to their high cetane number and cleaner-burning profile. Regulatory shifts in Europe and Asia, including stricter sulfur limits, are likely to drive further adoption.

Power: Several utilities and independent power producers are trialing GTL fuels for backup and peaking power plants, where rapid deployment and emissions compliance are crucial. Modular GTL units allow local production and use of synthetic fuels, reducing logistical challenges.

Chemicals: GTL catalysis produces valuable feedstocks such as paraffins, waxes, and naphtha, which are integral to the petrochemical and specialty chemicals industries. For example, Shell supplies GTL base oils for premium lubricants, and Sasol markets GTL-derived waxes for coatings and adhesives.

Looking ahead, the outlook for GTL catalysis engineering in end-use applications is positive, with ongoing investments in catalyst efficiency, process intensification, and modularization. Companies are also exploring integration with carbon capture and renewable hydrogen, aiming to produce even lower-carbon GTL products for transportation, power, and chemicals in the years beyond 2025.

Regional Analysis: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Middle East

Gas-to-liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering is experiencing divergent trends across key global regions in 2025, driven by feedstock availability, energy transition policies, and technological investments. North America continues to capitalize on abundant natural gas resources, with companies such as ExxonMobil maintaining operational GTL units and investing in catalyst improvements to enhance process efficiency and reduce emissions. North American engineering activity is also influenced by policy support for lower-carbon fuels and the integration of renewable hydrogen in GTL processes.

In Europe, the focus is on the decarbonization of transport fuels and the utilization of stranded or renewable gases. Firms like Shell are leveraging their experience from large-scale GTL plants and advancing research for next-generation catalysts that enable lower operating temperatures and higher selectivity. European GTL catalysis engineering is closely linked to regulatory initiatives promoting synthetic fuels as a complement to electrification, especially in aviation and heavy-duty transport. The region also sees growing collaborations between catalyst suppliers and academic institutions to develop catalysts for small-scale, modular GTL units targeting biogas conversion.

The Asia-Pacific region, led by countries such as China and Malaysia, is investing in GTL catalysis to diversify energy portfolios and monetize natural gas reserves. National oil companies like PETRONAS are deploying advanced Fischer-Tropsch catalysts in commercial and demonstration-scale projects to convert offshore and remote gas resources into liquid fuels and chemicals. In China, government-backed initiatives are fostering partnerships with catalyst manufacturers and engineering firms to localize technology development and reduce dependency on imports. The region’s strong demand for cleaner transport fuels further incentivizes GTL catalysis R&D, particularly for integration with renewable feedstocks.

The Middle East, home to vast natural gas reserves, is increasingly targeting GTL as a strategic pathway for value addition beyond liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Companies such as Qatargas and Sasol (which co-operates the Oryx GTL plant in Qatar) are investing in catalyst life extension and process intensification to maximize plant reliability and economics. The region’s engineering efforts are also exploring synergies between GTL and blue hydrogen production to align with national decarbonization strategies.

Looking ahead, regional differences in GTL catalysis engineering will persist, shaped by feedstock dynamics, policy frameworks, and the pace of technological innovation. Across all regions, there is a clear trend toward the development of more robust, selective, and sustainable catalysts, with pilot and commercial demonstrations expected to expand over the next few years.

Barriers, Risks, and Competitive Threats

Gas-to-liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering faces a range of barriers and competitive threats as the industry moves through 2025 and into the coming years. A primary challenge remains the high capital expenditure required for commercial-scale GTL plants, which can reach billions of dollars. This is evident from the limited number of operational mega-scale facilities globally, with only a handful of companies such as Shell and Sasol operating large-scale units. The combination of expensive Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactors, advanced heat management systems, and highly specialized catalysts pushes up both initial investment and operational costs.

Catalyst deactivation and selectivity remain persistent technical hurdles. FT catalysts, typically based on cobalt or iron, are prone to sintering, carbon deposition, and poisoning by sulfur or other contaminants, which can lead to reduced efficiency and more frequent shutdowns for regeneration or replacement. As a result, companies such as ExxonMobil continue to invest in advanced catalyst formulations and process designs, but breakthroughs have been incremental rather than transformative.

Market risks also weigh heavily, particularly volatility in oil and natural gas prices. The economic viability of GTL hinges on a favorable spread between low-cost natural gas feedstock and higher-value liquid fuels. With global LNG markets and renewables reshaping the energy landscape, periods of low oil prices—as witnessed in past years—can quickly erode the competitiveness of GTL outputs, impacting investment confidence. Regulatory uncertainty, including evolving carbon policies and potential incentives for alternative fuels, adds another layer of risk. Producers must weigh the potential for future carbon taxes or emissions limits against the significant greenhouse gas footprint of conventional GTL processes.

Competitive threats arise from rapid advancements in alternative technologies. Renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuels produced via biomass or waste-to-liquid pathways are attracting increasing attention and investment due to their lower carbon intensity. Companies such as Neste are scaling up production of renewable hydrocarbons using feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fats, directly competing with GTL in premium fuel markets. Similarly, power-to-liquids (PtL) processes, which synthesize hydrocarbons from green hydrogen and captured CO₂, are gaining momentum as electrolysis costs fall and decarbonization pressures grow.

Looking ahead, the GTL sector’s growth will depend on its ability to overcome these engineering, economic, and environmental challenges, and to carve out a niche amidst a rapidly diversifying liquid fuels landscape.

Future Outlook: Game-Changing Advances and Roadmap to 2030

The landscape of Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) catalysis engineering is set for significant transformation as the sector moves through 2025 and plans for the next several years. Advances in catalyst design, process integration, and plant modularization are underpinning a new era of GTL technology that emphasizes efficiency, lower emissions, and economic viability for both large-scale and distributed applications.

Catalyst innovation remains at the heart of these developments. Companies are investing in next-generation Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts with improved selectivity and durability, aimed at maximizing conversion rates while minimizing by-product formation. For example, ExxonMobil has announced ongoing work to enhance cobalt-based FT catalysts, targeting higher yields of desirable middle distillates. Similarly, Shell continues to refine its proprietary catalysts, focusing on energy efficiency and process intensification for GTL plants.

In 2025, there is considerable momentum toward commercializing small- and micro-scale GTL units, which leverage modular engineering to monetize stranded or flared gas. Companies like Velocys are deploying compact FT reactors with advanced catalyst formulations, enabling economically feasible projects at scales previously unattainable by conventional GTL. This trend aligns with the industry’s decarbonization goals, as distributed GTL can reduce methane emissions from flaring and generate low-sulfur synthetic fuels.

Process intensification and digitalization are also shaping the GTL catalysis roadmap. Integration of real-time process analytics and advanced control systems is being adopted by operators such as Sasol to optimize catalyst performance, extend catalyst life, and reduce operational costs. These digital tools, combined with machine learning, are expected to further improve catalyst selection and process reliability by 2030.

The next few years will likely see pilot and demonstration projects scaling up novel catalyst types, such as those incorporating nano-structured supports or bi-functional sites for enhanced selectivity. The drive toward circular carbon economies is pushing R&D toward integrating GTL with renewable hydrogen and carbon capture, as seen in pilot initiatives by Shell Catalysts &amp; Technologies and Velocys.

By 2030, the GTL sector is anticipated to benefit from catalysts with greater resistance to impurities and longer operational lifetimes, supporting the economic and environmental case for wider adoption of GTL, especially as a pathway to sustainable aviation fuel and cleaner transportation fuels.

From Climate Necessity to Market Opportunity

With aviation emissions poised to triple by 2050 if left unchecked, SAF is no longer a luxury but a necessity. “We need molecules now and in the future,” said Frank Wouters, Director of the MED-GEM Network, kicking off the 14 May webinar hosted jointly with the International PtX Hub. “We cannot battery our way out of this.”

Indeed, while battery innovation supports short-haul flights, long-haul aviation—the sector's most carbon-intensive component—requires liquid fuels. SAF, produced either from bio-based waste or via synthetic pathways using green hydrogen and captured CO₂, offers the most viable alternative.

“The social cost of carbon is underestimated,” Wouters added, citing new research estimating real costs upwards of $1,300 per ton of CO₂—a figure over 16 times higher than current EU carbon credit prices. “That’s $52 trillion in costs annually if you multiply by our current 40 gigaton emission rate.”

Europe’s Stick and Carrot Strategy

The EU’s “RefuelEU Aviation” regulation has set clear SAF blending mandates: starting at 2% by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and 70% by 2050, including specific quotas for synthetic fuels (eSAF). These are backed by financial penalties for non-compliance that can reach €14,000 per missing tonne.

“Only one eSAF project in Europe is online today,” noted Frank Mischler, Director at the International PtX Hub. “We will not reach 2035 targets without imports. This is MENA’s moment.”

Yet, Europe’s stringent rules—especially around eligible carbon sources—make project alignment complex. “There are feedstocks that are CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation).compliant but not EU-compliant,” he warned. “Municipal solid waste, for instance, is still debated.”

MENA’s Strategic Advantage

Enter MENA—a region rich in solar and wind, with existing energy export infrastructure and an expanding hydrogen economy.

“Abundant renewable resources, proximity to EU markets, and existing refining capacity make MENA ideally suited for SAF and eSAF production,” explained Dr. Mustapha Taoumi, Key Expert at MED-GEM. “Countries like Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are already launching pilot projects.”

📂 Read the keynote https://drive.med-gem.eu/drive/s/wgzeg1zdKJKTD2stxmmvjfM0Jj7k1d

For Christian Pho Duc, CTO of Smartenergy Group AG, the SAF market is as much about momentum as policy: “Airlines like Lufthansa and Emirates are securing off-take agreements today. Young consumers want to fly clean. Companies are embedding SAF in ESG policies.”

Pho Duc emphasized that early movers can capture long-term advantage, even in a cost-intensive landscape: “Technology and scale will bring costs down. Solar costs fell by 95% in a decade—why not SAF?”

He also highlighted that projects like SkyPower, which brings together key European SAF stakeholders, demonstrate the value of integrated ecosystems. “This is not about fuel alone,” he said. “It’s about creating aviation ecosystems—from Co₂ sourcing to transport, certification, and end use.”

Policy Alignment: Simplicity, Certainty, and Speed

The panel agreed that to seize this opportunity, both MENA and EU actors must prioritize regulatory clarity and rapid coordination.

“Complexity kills momentum,” Pho Duc noted. “We need frameworks that de-risk first movers—not perfect policies, but implementable ones.”

Wouters echoed this: “The SAF train has left the station. The question is how fast it will run—and who gets on board.”

🔑 Key Takeaways

✅ SAF is not optional: It is the only scalable pathway for long-haul aviation decarbonization over the next 30 years.

✅ MENA holds natural advantages: Abundant renewables, energy infrastructure, and geographic proximity to Europe.

✅ The EU needs imports: Current European production will fall short of the 2030 and 2035 SAF and eSAF mandates.

✅ Invest now, not later: Early movers in MENA can secure off-take agreements and shape the value chain.

✅ Policy alignment is critical: Streamlined regulation, technical support, and cross-border incentives will determine success.

✅ The market is forming: Voluntary demand from corporates and airlines is rising—this is the moment to act.

Até o momento, a Vibra (anteriormente conhecida como BR Distribuidora) foi a primeira empresa a comercializar o SAF no Brasil, que, por enquanto, é importado e produzido a partir de óleo de cozinha usado. No entanto, para garantir a produção local, o Brasil investe em diferentes rotas tecnológicas que vão desde a conversão de etanol da cana-de-açúcar até o coprocessamento de óleos vegetais, como os utilizados na produção de biocombustíveis.

Expectativas e investimentos no setor

A Petrobras lidera o desenvolvimento do SAF nacional, com previsão de iniciar a produção comercial ainda este ano, utilizando refinarias em São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro e Minas Gerais. A empresa já planeja uma expansão na produção com o uso do etanol em suas formulações. Outra iniciativa importante é da Acelen, que pretende começar a produção de SAF na Bahia, focando na macaúba como matéria-prima até 2026, contribuindo para a solidificação do Brasil como uma plataforma de exportação.

Estudos indicam que a demanda nacional por SAF deve iniciar com 126 milhões de litros em 2027, podendo atingir 1,75 bilhão de litros anuais na década seguinte. Para as companhias aéreas, que enfrentam margens de lucro estreitas, essa demanda representa um custo adicional significativo, podendo alcançar US$ 1,4 bilhão até o final da década.

Um dos principais obstáculos a serem superados é o alto custo de produção do SAF, que ainda é de 2,5 a 3 vezes superior ao do querosene convencional. Especialistas, como Clayton Souza da L.E.K. Consulting, apontam que a viabilidade econômica do SAF depende de incentivos governamentais e regulamentações que favoreçam a cadeia produtiva.

Regulamentação e o futuro do SAF no Brasil

A transição para o SAF requer regulamentações claras e eficazes, e o governo brasileiro está em fase de elaboração de decretos complementares para a Lei do Combustível do Futuro, essencial para a implementação desse projeto. Em setembro, a ANAC e a ANP assinaram um acordo de cooperação técnica para regulamentar o uso do SAF no país, o que representa um passo significativo em direção à estruturação desse novo mercado sustentável.

Entretanto, ainda há desafios, como a necessidade de regras claras em relação aos créditos de carbono e a disponibilidade em escala do SAF. Além disso, a Gol Linhas Aéreas, que busca incorporar 5% de SAF até 2030, comentou que a regulamentação será crucial para garantir segurança jurídica para todos os envolvidos, desde os produtores até os operadores aéreos.

À medida que o Brasil se destaca na corrida global pela produção de SAF, a colaboração entre o setor privado e o governo será fundamental para criar um ambiente propício ao crescimento sustentável, capaz de apoiar a aviação em sua missão de alcançar a neutralidade de carbono.

Com esses avanços, o Brasil não só se posiciona como um líder na produção de SAF, mas também abre portas para exportação e colabora na luta global contra as mudanças climáticas, apresentando um modelo que pode inspirar outros países a seguir o mesmo caminho.",https://diario.dopovo.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/opengraph.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 12:56:14.403686

또 다른 중국 에너지 기업은 내년부터 연간 30만t 규모의 SAF 공장을 가동할 계획이다.
정유업계 관계자는 “중국은 SAF를 국가 차원에서 육성하고 있다.
EU는 이 비율을 2030년까지 6%, 2050년에는 70%까지 확대할 계획이다.
또 약 292억 엔의 기금을 조성해 SAF를 생산하면 리터당 30엔의 생산 세액공제 혜택을 지원할 계획이다.","기존 항공유보다 탄소 배출량이 적어 ‘미래 항공유’로 불리는 지속가능항공유(SAF·Sustainable Aviation Fuel) 시장을 선점하기 위해 미국, 일본, 유럽에 이어 중국도 뛰어들었다. 반면 한국은 SAF에 대한 정부의 지원이 적고 정유업계도 투자에 소극적이라 대응이 늦다는 평가가 나온다.

18일 정유업계에 따르면 SAF 시장을 선도하는 미국, 일본, 유럽 외에 중국의 움직임이 빨라지고 있다. 중국의 한 에너지 기업은 5월부터 연간 20만톤(t) 규모로 SAF 생산을 시작했다. 국내 최대 SAF 생산 능력을 갖춘 SK에너지의 배 수준이다. 또 다른 중국 에너지 기업은 내년부터 연간 30만t 규모의 SAF 공장을 가동할 계획이다.

정유업계 관계자는 “중국은 SAF를 국가 차원에서 육성하고 있다. 중국은 SAF 원료인 폐식용유의 최대 보유국인데 만약 폐식용유 수출을 줄이면 한국 정유사는 원료 조달조차 힘겨워지고 중국 기업이 SAF 시장을 선점할 수 있다”고 말했다.

SAF는 폐식용유, 농업 폐기물 등으로 만드는 항공유를 말한다. 기존 항공유보다 탄소 배출량이 최대 80% 적어 항공 부문에서 온실가스를 줄일 핵심 요소로 여겨진다. SAF는 기존 항공유와 화학 구조가 유사해, 기존의 항공기 엔진과 인프라(기반 시설)를 그대로 사용할 수 있다.

유럽연합(EU)과 영국은 올해부터 항공사가 사용하는 연료의 최소 2%를 SAF로 채우도록 하는 규정을 시행했다. EU는 이 비율을 2030년까지 6%, 2050년에는 70%까지 확대할 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 사용 전량을 SAF로 대체한다는 목표를 세웠다. 일본도 2030년까지 기존 항공유에 SAF를 혼합하는 비율을 10%로 늘릴 계획이다.

한국은 2027년까지 전체 항공유의 1%를 SAF로 채운다는 목표를 세웠다. 정유업계는 정부의 도입 목표가 낮다고 지적한다. 국제항공운송협회(IATA)에 따르면 SAF는 전체 항공유의 0.2%(2023년 기준)에 불과하고, 현재 가격은 기존 항공유의 2~3배다.

정유업계 관계자는 “SAF 수요가 증가해야 SAF를 대량으로 생산해 규모의 경제가 생기고, SAF 단가가 낮아지는 선순환이 이뤄질 수 있다”고 말했다.

SAF는 정유사의 미래 먹거리로 여겨지지만, 국제 유가 하락 여파로 실적이 악화해 투자할 여력이 없는 상태다. SK이노베이션, GS칼텍스, HD현대오일뱅크, 에쓰오일(S-Oil) 등 국내 정유 4사는 SAF 전용 시설 대신 기존 정유 설비에 석유 기반 원료와 바이오 원료를 함께 투입하는 코프로세싱(Co-Processing·공동 처리) 방식으로 SAF을 생산한다. 정유업계 관계자는 “SAF 전용 시설 수율(생산량 중 양품의 비율)은 60~80%지만, 코프로세싱 수율은 약 10%에 불과하다”고 말했다.

정유업계는 SAF 전용 공장 설립을 촉진하기 위한 제도 마련이 필요하다고 주장한다. 미국은 인플레이션감축법(IRA)을 통해 리터(L)당 440~615원의 생산 보조금을 지급한다. 이에 따라 전 세계 SAF 전용 공장 359개 중 30%에 해당하는 107개는 미국에 있다. 일본은 SAF 시설 투자, 판매와 관련해 연간 최대 40%의 법인 세액을 공제한다. 또 약 292억 엔의 기금을 조성해 SAF를 생산하면 리터당 30엔의 생산 세액공제 혜택을 지원할 계획이다.",https://thumb.zumst.com/1024x0/https://static.news.zumst.com/images/110/2025/05/18/e0f5b29ad6de4a78846b0a219b0d960a.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 11:56:13.734653

Narasi yang dibangun pun begitu memukau: SAF diklaim mampu memangkas jejak karbon hingga 80% dan menjadi kunci menuju penerbangan ""netral karbon"" pada 2050. Maskapai, pabrikan pesawat, hingga pemerintah ramai-ramai menyebut SAF sebagai primadona dekarbonisasi. Asosiasi Pengangkutan Udara Internasional (IATA) bahkan memperkirakan SAF bisa menyumbang 65% dari total pengurangan emisi yang dibutuhkan sektor ini. Namun, optimisme hijau ini patut dipertanyakan. Di baliknya, tersembunyi perhitungan karbon yang penuh tanda tanya, beban lingkungan yang terabaikan, dan dampak iklim penerbangan secara utuh yang kurang diperhatikan. Klaim ""berkelanjutan"" pada SAF sesungguhnya adalah ilusi murahan yang bisa menyesatkan kita semua.

Fatamorgana Pengurangan Karbon dan Dampak Tersembunyi

Andalan utama klaim ramah lingkungan SAF terletak pada metodologi Penilaian Siklus Hidup (LCA) yang digunakan. Teori ini menghitung emisi gas rumah kaca (GRK) dari penanaman bahan baku hingga pembakaran di mesin pesawat. Para pendukungnya berargumen, karena biomassa (bahan baku SAF) menyerap CO2 saat tumbuh, CO2 yang dilepas saat SAF dibakar hanyalah ""daur ulang"". Dari sinilah, muncul klaim bombastis pengurangan emisi ""hingga 80%"" atau bahkan, seperti disebut United Airlines, hingga 85% dibandingkan bahan bakar jet fosil. Akan tetapi, angka fantastis ini merupakan skenario paling ideal yang sangat bergantung pada jenis bahan baku, teknologi pengolahan, dan rantai pasok. Kenyataannya, hasilnya bisa sangat beragam. Sebuah studi LCA komparatif yang berjudul ""Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production from Different Biomasses"" pada jurnal MDPI menunjukkan variasi Potensi Pemanasan Global (GWP) yang ekstrem. Minyak sawit, misalnya, menghasilkan GWP 18,12 g CO2eq/MJ dan camelina 19,14 g CO2eq/MJ. Sebaliknya, kedelai justru menghasilkan GWP sebesar 390 g CO2eq/MJ, jauh melampaui bahan bakar fosil yang menurut standar Uni Eropa berkisar 83,8-105,7 g CO2eq/MJ. Artinya, beberapa jenis SAF justru bisa lebih merusak iklim ketimbang bahan bakar konvensional.

Persoalan krusial lainnya dapat ditemukan pada Perubahan Penggunaan Lahan Tidak Langsung (ILUC). Ketika lahan pangan dialihkan untuk tanaman bahan baku SAF, kegiatan pertanian pangan bisa tergeser ke area lain, berpotensi memicu pembukaan hutan atau lahan gambut yang melepaskan cadangan karbon dalam jumlah besar. Meskipun kerangka Skema Pengimbangan dan Pengurangan Karbon untuk Penerbangan Internasional (CORSIA) dari Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional (ICAO) telah memasukkan faktor ILUC, penghitungannya sangat rumit dan penuh ketidakpastian, seperti diakui dalam berbagai laporan Uni Eropa. Mengandalkan SAF tanpa perhitungan ILUC yang cermat sama saja dengan berjudi dengan nasib hutan dan keanekaragaman hayati kita. Lebih jauh lagi, fokus berlebihan pada CO2 telah mengaburkan dampak pemanasan non-CO2 dari penerbangan. Mesin pesawat tidak hanya mengeluarkan CO2, tetapi juga uap air, nitrogen oksida (NOx), partikel jelaga, dan lainnya. Di ketinggian jelajah, emisi ini memicu pembentukan jejak kondensasi (contrail) dan awan sirostratus yang memiliki efek pemanasan signifikan. Studi yang dipublikasikan di jurnal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP) oleh Copernicus Publications menyebutkan bahwa efek non-CO2 ini berkontribusi hingga tiga kali lebih besar terhadap pemanasan global dibandingkan emisi CO2 historis penerbangan. Selain itu, SAF memang diklaim bisa mengurangi jelaga. Studi ECLIF3 yang juga dilaporkan dalam jurnal ACP menunjukkan penggunaan 100% SAF jenis HEFA mengurangi jumlah kristal es di contrail sebesar 56% dan partikel jelaga sebesar 35%. Ini diproyeksikan bisa mengurangi efek pemanasan dari contrail sebesar 26% jika seluruh armada global menggunakan 100% SAF. Namun, manfaat ini baru optimal pada penggunaan 100% SAF, sementara standar ASTM International saat ini masih membatasi campuran SAF maksimal 50% dengan bahan bakar jet konvensional, bahkan ada yang hanya 10% untuk jalur produksi tertentu. Dampak SAF terhadap emisi non-CO2 lainnya seperti NOx juga tidak konsisten antar-studi, seperti yang diungkapkan dalam sebuah penelitian dari KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Jadi, mengandalkan SAF untuk mengatasi seluruh dampak iklim penerbangan jelas suatu kekeliruan.

Ancaman bagi Lahan, Pangan, dan Alam Liar

Keberlanjutan SAF sangat bergantung pada ketersediaan bahan baku yang diklaim ""berkelanjutan"". Visi yang disajikan mencakup pemanfaatan limbah pertanian, sampah kota, minyak jelantah (UCO), hingga tanaman energi khusus di lahan marginal. Namun, visi ini menabrak tembok kenyataan. Jika SAF diproduksi massal dari tanaman energi, kebutuhan lahannya akan sangat masif. Laporan dari National Farmers Union (NFU) Kanada, mengutip proyeksi U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), permintaan bahan bakar penerbangan global pada 2050 mencapai sekitar 230 miliar galon. Untuk memenuhi angka tersebut dengan SAF dari kedelai, kanola, dan jagung, dibutuhkan lahan seluas 2 miliar hektar. Angka ini setara dengan lima kali luas seluruh lahan pertanian di Amerika Serikat (AS) atau dua puluh kali luas lahan pertanian Kanada. Dari mana lahan seluas itu akan didapat? Tak pelak, ini akan bersaing langsung dengan lahan untuk produksi pangan, pakan ternak, dan bisa mengancam ekosistem alami seperti hutan.

Persaingan ini memicu dilema ""pangan versus bahan bakar"". Pengalihan tanaman pangan atau lahan subur untuk SAF berisiko mendongkrak harga pangan global. Laporan NFU Kanada menyebutkan bahwa SAF bisa berarti ""Mengorbankan Pangan Terjangkau"", karena dana pembelian pangan miliaran penduduk termiskin akan bersaing dengan dana liburan miliaran penduduk terkaya. Ini jelas memperburuk ketidakadilan sosial dan ancaman kelaparan. Dampak terhadap keanekaragaman hayati juga tak kalah mengerikan. Laporan Greenpeace menyatakan bahwa pertanian industri masih menjadi penyebab utama deforestasi global, menyumbang sekitar 80% dari total kerusakan hutan. Komoditas seperti kedelai dan kelapa sawit, yang menjadi bahan baku utama SAF, merupakan biang keladi deforestasi di kawasan tropis. Laporan Greenpeace lainnya, ""Bankrolling Ecosystem Destruction"", mengungkap bahwa konsumsi Uni Eropa saja pada 2017 terkait dengan 16% deforestasi tropis, utamanya akibat kedelai dan kelapa sawit. Ironisnya, lembaga jasa keuangan (LJK) besar Uni Eropa justru terus menyuntikkan miliaran dolar ke perusahaan-perusahaan yang terbukti terkait dengan deforestasi skala besar baru-baru ini, termasuk Bunge dan Cargill. Analisis Greenpeace juga menyebutkan, antara 2010 dan 2020 (periode di mana banyak janji ""nol deforestasi"" dibuat), sekitar 50 juta hektar hutan, atau seluas Spanyol, hilang untuk produksi komoditas.

Bagaimana dengan bahan baku ""canggih"" dari limbah seperti UCO atau sampah kota? UCO, yang kini mendominasi produksi SAF, ketersediaannya sangat terbatas. Menurut studi Transport & Environment (T&E), Eropa menggunakan hampir 7 juta ton UCO untuk biofuel per tahun, padahal jumlah itu delapan kali lipat dari yang berhasil dikumpulkan di dalam negeri dan empat kali lipat potensi pengumpulan teoretis maksimumnya. Akibatnya, T&E melaporkan bahwa 80% pasokan UCO Eropa kini berasal dari impor, dengan Tiongkok sebagai pemasok utama (60% impor). Analisis T&E juga menunjukkan bahwa satu maskapai seperti Ryanair diperkirakan membutuhkan seluruh potensi UCO Eropa hanya untuk memenuhi target SAF 12,5% pada 2030. Kelangkaan ini memicu praktik penipuan. T&E dan Wells Fargo menyoroti kekhawatiran minyak nabati murah seperti sawit diduga kuat sengaja dilabeli sebagai UCO untuk meraup insentif. Indikasinya, menurut analisis Stratas yang dikutip T&E, Malaysia mengekspor UCO tiga kali lebih banyak dari yang dilaporkan berhasil dikumpulkannya. Limbah lain seperti sampah kota atau residu pertanian menghadapi kendala logistik, biaya pengumpulan, dan teknologi konversi yang mahal dan belum matang.

Biaya Selangit dan Energi yang Boros

Secara ekonomi dan energi, SAF juga bermasalah. Laporan dari Departemen Energi (DoE) AS menyebutkan biaya produksi SAF 2 hingga 10 kali lebih mahal dibandingkan bahan bakar jet konvensional. ICF dan McKinsey juga menyebutkan angka serupa, sekitar 2-4 kali atau setidaknya 3 kali lipat. Data MSCI menunjukkan harga rata-rata SAF pada 2022 mencapai $2.400 atau Rp39,5 juta per ton, dua setengah kali lipat harga bahan bakar biasa. Mengingat bahan bakar menyumbang 20-30% biaya operasional maskapai, menurut IATA, premi sebesar ini jelas memberatkan. Akibatnya, pasar SAF sangat bergantung pada subsidi dan insentif pemerintah. Tanpa sokongan dana publik ini, pasar SAF dipastikan akan sulit bertahan. Laporan World Economic Forum (WEF) memperkirakan, untuk mencapai permintaan tahun 2030, dibutuhkan investasi modal $19-45 miliar atau Rp312,8-740,8 triliun untuk kilang baru, dan untuk target net-zero 2050 bisa mencapai $1,45 triliun atau Rp23.871,6 triliun (setara dengan PDB Indonesia) menurut Aviation Benefits.",https://assets-a1.kompasiana.com/items/album/2025/05/18/rolls-royce-successfully-completes-100-saf-test-programme-6829b685c925c469c41b0c03.jpg?t=o&v=1200,N,,2025-05-18 08:56:27.263159
