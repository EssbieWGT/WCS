Several carriers suspended flights in response, triggering Venezuela’s National Institute of Civil Aviation (INAC) to revoke their operating permits, a decisive step in asserting control over Venezuela airspace.

Airspace Control as a Strategic Tool

On November 21, 2025, the U.S. FAA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) warning of a “potentially hazardous situation” in Venezuelan airspace, citing increased military readiness, GPS interference, and U.S. deployments in the Caribbean targeting alleged drug trafficking. In response, several international carriers including Iberia, TAP Air Portugal, Turkish Airlines, Avianca, LATAM, and Gol temporarily suspended flights to Caracas (more details here).

Venezuela’s National Institute of Civil Aviation (INAC) responded by issuing a 48-hour ultimatum for the carriers to resume service. When the deadline passed without the airlines complying, INAC revoked their operating rights. Venezuela’s government accused the airlines of joining “actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States”

President Nicolás Maduro framed the Venezuela aviation ban as a demonstration of sovereignty. In a televised address, he declared Venezuela “invincible,” signalling to both domestic and international audiences that foreign carriers would not dictate operations within Venezuelan airspace. The government’s measures reflect how aviation is used as political leverage in ongoing negotiations with the U.S.

The move follows other actions in 2025, including public references to a “prolonged resistance” strategy. By grounding airlines and controlling flight routes, Venezuela ensures that Venezuela airline restrictions 2025 directly influence international mobility while amplifying its political stance.

Venezuela-US mounting Tensions

The airline ban comes amid growing U.S.-Venezuela tensions. The U.S. has increased its military presence in the Caribbean, assembling its largest military presence in the Caribbean since the 1989 invasion of Panama. This build-up, part of “Operation Southern Spear,” began in August 2025 with the deployment of the USS Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group, and was bolstered in November by the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group.

Sanctions and legal measures remain in place: U.S. indictments of senior Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, and a $50 million bounty on the president, continue to escalate pressures. These actions prompted the FAA advisory, which in turn sparked the Venezuela aviation ban and broader Venezuela airline restrictions 2025.

Aviation at the Center of the Standoff

After major international airlines voluntarily suspended flights to Venezuela following a U.S. safety warning, Venezuela retaliated by revoking their operating permits, demonstrating how aviation is used as a tool of political leverage. The decisions highlight the key strategic power commercial aviation can have in international diplomacy: controlling flight operations can send messages and enforce pressure without deploying hard military power.

For now, several international routes to Caracas remain suspended, with no timeline for reinstatement. While both the U.S. and Venezuela have indicated willingness to maintain dialogue, the Venezuela aviation ban shows how geopolitical tensions continue to spill into global airspace, intersecting with diplomacy, security, and state strategy.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Nicolas_Maduro_in_meeting_with_Iranian_President_Hassan_Rouhani_in_Saadabad_Palace.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 14:57:02.536137

The move follows as reported by BBC, the discovery that intense solar radiation could corrupt data linked to flight control systems, a risk that Airbus says requires a swift software update.

According to the BBC, more airlines are now reporting potential disruptions as Airbus begins recalling affected aircraft for the update. The recall applies to roughly 6,000 planes globally, nearly half of Airbus’s fleet, making it, as BBC’s notes, “a very unusual situation”.

Air India & Indico issue travel advisories

Air India and IndiGo have issued warnings of longer turnaround times and possible delays, according to The Mint. The publication reported that both airlines have advised passengers to check flight status before heading to the airport, noting that operations may be affected as Airbus’s directive is implemented. “The software/hardware realignment on part of our fleet will lead to delayed operations,” Air India said in a post on X, adding that it regretted any inconvenience caused to passengers.

Other airlines have also responded: American Airlines said about 340 of its planes are affected and warned of “some operational delays” but expects most updates to be completed today or tomorrow. Delta Airlines said it will comply with Airbus’s instruction and expects the impact to be “limited”. London Heathrow said its operations remain unaffected, while Gatwick Airport expects some disruption.

Airbus says the majority of affected aircraft only require a software installation, normally a three-hour process. But around 900 older planes will need computer hardware replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers until that is done. Availability of parts remains a concern, and it is currently unclear whether replacements can be sourced in time.

BBC reported that the software directive primarily targets the A320 family, which Airbus describes as the “aircraft family of choice for airlines around the world.” These planes can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km) and seat between 120 and 244 passengers. The A320 also flies using 50% sustainable aviation fuel, a figure Airbus hopes to raise to 100% by 2030.

The aircraft features advanced turbofan engines that offer 20% lower fuel burn compared with previous generations, one reason why it remains central to commercial fleets worldwide.

LanzaJet, a leading U.S. sustainable fuel innovator, has announced a major breakthrough: the successful production of jet fuel made from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia. This achievement marks the world’s first commercial-scale output of ethanol-derived jet fuel, delivering a renewable, non-petroleum aviation fuel that works seamlessly with today’s aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Backed by more than 15 years of research and development, the milestone validates LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, a platform capable of converting a wide range of sustainable feedstocks—including agricultural waste, purpose-grown energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon—into drop-in aviation fuel. LanzaJet highlights this advancement as a major step forward for farmers, biofuels producers, aviation stakeholders, and climate-focused innovators. “This achievement represents the culmination of 15 years of research, collaboration, investment, and scale-up—and it proves ethanol can be transformed into jet fuel at true commercial scale,” the company stated.

Why ethanol matters: a scalable solution for SAF production

Aviation faces urgent pressure to decarbonize, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains the only scalable near-term solution for reducing emissions from long-haul flights. However, the current dominant SAF pathway—HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)—depends heavily on limited feedstocks such as used cooking oil and waste fats. With global demand rising, these resources are quickly being constrained. LanzaJet’s ATJ pathway offers a critical alternative by leveraging widely available ethanol. Through a continuous catalytic conversion process, ethanol is transformed into Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) via: • Dehydration – converting ethanol into ethylene • Oligomerization – building longer hydrocarbon chains • Hydrogenation/Hydrotreating – refining chains into kerosene-range molecules The result is a fully certified SAF compatible with existing turbines, pipelines, and airport systems. CEO Jimmy Samartzis noted, “This milestone is a major win for global aviation and a sign of what’s possible for the industry’s future.” According to LanzaJet, ATJ is the most commercially ready, scalable SAF solution developed in the past decade, supporting energy security, domestic fuel production, and growth in agricultural economies.

Higher-quality fuel with lower emissions

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility stands as a first-of-its-kind (FOAK) integrated biorefinery, representing more than $300 million in investment. The plant incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as: • Technip Energies’ Hummingbird system (Ethanol-to-Ethylene) • A combined DOE/LanzaTech Oligomerization process By sourcing from a diverse blend of sustainable feedstocks, the plant delivers SAF with substantially lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-based jet fuel. When blended with Jet A-1, the resulting fuel meets all international aviation standards, offering a drop-in solution for airlines worldwide. LanzaJet reports that its SAF delivers higher energy density than conventional Jet-A, providing a superior-quality fuel while reducing environmental impact. Beyond its climate benefits, the Freedom Pines facility is generating economic value in rural Georgia—creating hundreds of construction jobs and supporting more than 65 permanent direct and indirect jobs in Treutlen County.

Global deployment and the road to net zero aviation

LanzaJet is scaling its ATJ technology worldwide, with projects already underway across: • United States • Australia • Japan • India • United Kingdom • Colombia • European Union • Middle East • Kazakhstan As the aviation sector targets Net Zero by 2050, LanzaJet’s success demonstrates that the technologies needed to accelerate deep decarbonization are not theoretical—they exist today.",,N,,2025-11-29 10:56:50.066521

The recall covers more than half of all A320-family jets in service and comes after an incident last month in which a JetBlue flight experienced an unexpected loss of altitude and diverted for an emergency landing.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency is preparing an Emergency Airworthiness Directive that will mandate inspections and software updates before affected aircraft can return to service.

Flight-Control Failure Triggers Global Response

The recall stems from an October 30 incident involving a JetBlue flight en route from Cancun to Newark. The aircraft abruptly descended due to corrupted flight-control data believed to have been caused by intense solar radiation exposure. Several passengers were hospitalized after the emergency landing in Tampa.

Airbus said the issue, while rare, could potentially affect any A320-family jet operating under certain environmental conditions. The manufacturer emphasized that correcting the vulnerability requires immediate action across the global fleet.

In a statement, the manufacturer said:

“Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls. Airbus has consequently identified a significant number of A320 Family aircraft currently in-service which may be impacted.”

Software Rollbacks and Hardware Fixes Expected

Airbus has instructed operators to install updated software without delay. Roughly two-thirds of affected aircraft will need only a rapid software rollback, allowing them to return to service quickly. However, hundreds of jets will require hardware modifications, a process that could ground them for weeks.

The company warned that the recall will likely cause schedule disruptions for airlines and passengers but reiterated that safety remains its top priority.

This, IATA said, would reduce incentives for airlines to cancel delayed flights, while aligning with passengers’ clear preference to arrive late rather than not at all.
This, it argued, includes phasing out passenger taxes that undermine connectivity; Sweden removed its levy in July, and IATA urged others to follow.
At present, airlines face a USD 2.9 billion premium for purchasing SAF compared with conventional jet fuel, on top of ETS costs.
IATA described the Commission’s recent STIP proposal as a positive signal, although it said concrete action remains to be seen.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the European Parliament’s proposed overhaul of EU261 risks moving the bloc’s passenger-rights rules in the wrong direction, arguing that the changes would raise costs for travellers and airlines while failing to address the issues passengers actually face.

According to IATA, the regulation’s shortcomings have been evident for years. European governments attempted to address these in June, when the European Council backed amendments designed to safeguard connectivity and strengthen the competitiveness of European aviation.

Although not perfect, that position aimed for a more balanced framework, notably by increasing the delay thresholds for compensation from three hours to four hours for short-haul flights, and to six hours for long-haul services.

This, IATA said, would reduce incentives for airlines to cancel delayed flights, while aligning with passengers’ clear preference to arrive late rather than not at all.

The Parliament, however, is pushing to scrap these threshold changes and introduce additional obligations, including a right to bring a cabin bag for free.

IATA noted that there is no evidence passengers are asking for such measures, and even less that they are willing to pay higher fares for them.

In its May passenger survey, 72 per cent said they preferred the lowest fare with the option to pay for extra services when needed.

At the same time, 97 per cent reported being satisfied with their most recent flight.

Eurocontrol data also shows that fewer than 1 per cent of flights face delays longer than three hours, meaning the remaining 99 per cent of passengers are funding a compensation scheme that only a small minority ever uses.

IATA argues this makes value for money even more important.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said the Parliament’s approach effectively “works as a reverse Robin Hood”, adding that “there is no such thing as a ‘free’ bag or ‘free’ compensation thresholds”.

He stressed that “MEPs are imposing things people haven’t asked for, and don’t want to pay for unless they choose to”, noting that passengers would rather pay lower fares in exchange for a less “gold-plated” scheme.

He added that the Council’s position should be upheld to support competitiveness and reflect the calls in last year’s Draghi report for fewer and smarter regulations.

IATA also linked the debate to broader concerns over Europe’s slowing air-connectivity growth. Its research shows that between 2014 and 2024, connectivity grew by only 2.2 per cent a year in France, 2.9 per cent in the Netherlands, and just 0.4 per cent in Germany, trends it says emphasise the need for action to help the industry remain competitive.

This, it argued, includes phasing out passenger taxes that undermine connectivity; Sweden removed its levy in July, and IATA urged others to follow.

It also called for changes to the ReFuelEU “Green Deal” Regulation and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, saying fuel producers should be incentivised to supply affordable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while airlines need to benefit from using it.

At present, airlines face a USD 2.9 billion premium for purchasing SAF compared with conventional jet fuel, on top of ETS costs. IATA described the Commission’s recent STIP proposal as a positive signal, although it said concrete action remains to be seen.

The precautionary move follows concerns about a potential flight-control issue linked to intense solar radiation. Airlines, regulators, and passengers across continents are monitoring the developments, with up to 6,000 jets worldwide requiring software or hardware modifications.

While some disruptions are expected, UAE carriers have responded quickly, prioritising safety and operational continuity.

Airbus issued the directive on Friday, calling for an immediate software update across the A320 fleet. The update affects aircraft equipped with a specific flight-control component known as the Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC). The precautionary order is being treated with urgency by operators across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Most jets will receive a software update taking approximately three hours, while around 900 older aircraft will require hardware replacement, temporarily grounding affected planes.

Airline responses

UAE-based confirmed it has initiated mandatory software and technical upgrades across its affected A320 aircraft. The Sharjah-based budget carrier operates 67 A320 family aircraft through its operations in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, making it one of the UAE’s largest operators of the model.

“We confirm that we have received the directive issued by Airbus concerning the A320 aircraft type operated by airlines worldwide, which requires a number of aircraft to undergo specific software and technical updates,” a spokesperson said. The airline assured travellers that measures were being implemented across the impacted fleet and that any schedule adjustments would be communicated directly to affected passengers. “We are working to ensure minimal impact on our customers. In the event of any schedule adjustments, affected passengers will be notified directly.”

Air Arabia expressed regret for any inconvenience, emphasising its commitment to the highest levels of safety.

Meanwhile, Airways announced that its A320 operations have already returned to a normal schedule after completing the required update swiftly. The Abu Dhabi-based airline credited its operational teams for minimising disruption, especially during one of the busiest travel periods at Zayed International Airport ahead of the long weekend.

“Thanks to the exceptional efforts of our operational and technical teams, the update was completed quickly and with minimal disruption,” Etihad said. The carrier highlighted the importance of passenger understanding and reaffirmed that safety remains the airline’s top priority.

According to aviation data and analytics firm Cirium, UAE airlines collectively operate 106 Airbus A320-family aircraft, a significant portion of the regional fleet. The A320 is a preferred model globally, known for its fuel efficiency, versatility, and range of up to 4,700 nautical miles. Globally, around half of Airbus’s total commercial fleet—some 6,000 aircraft—fall under the recall directive.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) explained that intense solar radiation may, in rare cases, affect data used by the ELAC system, potentially leading to uncommanded movement of the aircraft’s control surfaces. While no major accidents have been directly attributed to the issue, the advisory was issued under safety precaution guidelines.

Global response

Carriers across Europe, Asia, and North America have begun fleet assessments to determine the number of affected aircraft. In , operators including IndiGo, Air India, and Air India Express are implementing software and hardware realignments across around 200–250 aircraft, according to aviation authorities. Air India confirmed that over 40 per cent of its affected fleet has already been updated, with no flight cancellations reported so far. However, travellers have been advised to expect possible delays.

Similarly, Flynas in Saudi Arabia has begun carrying out software and technical recalibrations across part of its A320 fleet. The airline warned of longer turnaround times on a limited number of flights and said that any affected passengers would be contacted via SMS or email.

In Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) reported the cancellation of 65 domestic flights. The carrier confirmed that 34 of its A320-family aircraft required the update, affecting thousands of passengers travelling in and out of Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Japan Airlines, however, confirmed its fleet was unaffected.

Impact on airports

In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airport reported that approximately 80 aircraft were affected. While Heathrow confirmed no major operational impact, airlines are coordinating parking and overnight update schedules to minimise disruption.

In the United States, American Airlines reported that 340 aircraft would undergo inspection and update, with many expected to be completed by Saturday. Delta said fewer than 50 of its A321neo aircraft were affected and anticipates limited disruption. United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines said their fleets were unaffected.

Technical fixes

The required repair process primarily involves reverting aircraft systems to earlier software versions. The ELAC units receive a software patch to safeguard against corrupted flight-control data. For the older aircraft requiring hardware replacement, the process is more complex and may involve transporting aircraft to maintenance facilities. Ferry flights, where aircraft are flown without passengers to maintenance hubs, are permitted under regulated safety guidelines.

Regulatory oversight

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India has issued an airworthiness directive banning the operation of certain A320-family aircraft without the mandated modification. “No person shall operate any aircraft that falls under the applicability of this mandatory modification except those complying with the requirements,” the order said.

The directive listed multiple Airbus models, including A319, A320 ceos and neos, and A321 variants, underscoring the scale of the global impact.

Passenger advisory

As airlines work to implement the updates, passengers are advised to monitor notifications, maintain updated contact details, and check flight statuses before travelling to the airport. Carriers have reiterated that no major safety incidents have been linked to the issue and that the directive is precautionary.

The software anomaly came into focus after a JetBlue A320 experienced a sudden drop in altitude during a flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, in late October. The aircraft made an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida, with minor injuries reported for 15 passengers. The investigation pointed to potential data corruption within the ELAC system, prompting Airbus and EASA to issue a global directive.

Airbus describes the A320 family as the “aircraft of choice for airlines around the world.” With seating for 120 to 244 passengers, modern A320 aircraft already operate partially using sustainable aviation fuel, with Airbus targeting 100 per cent use by 2030.

During a multi-stakeholder validation workshop held in Addis Ababa’s Skylight Hotel on Thursday November 27, experts presenting the feasibility study told officials and industry representatives that Ethiopia could produce low-carbon aviation fuel using local agricultural crops, municipal waste, sugar byproducts and renewable energy sources.

The findings were presented to senior representatives from the ministries of Transport and Logistics, Agriculture, the Civil Aviation Authority, universities and private investors during a final validation workshop attended by international consultants and donors, including the European Union, which funded the study through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)

The feasibility study launched in December 2024 with a national workshop and followed by field consultations and a March 2025 stakeholder conference, where Ethiopian officials engaged with technical experts to review data and evaluate business readiness for domestic SAF production.

The research built on three previous studies including a 2019 WWF-South Africa assessment and two Ethiopian roadmap and feasibility studies conducted in 2021 and 2022, which first identified Ethiopian mustard as a viable aviation fuel crop.

Lead consultant John McKechnie stated that Ethiopia was selected for deeper analysis because of its agricultural base, expanding industrial capacity and unexploited renewable energy resources, which together position the country strategically in Africa’s energy transition.

Researchers confirmed that more than 30 million hectares of Ethiopian land are suitable for cultivating Ethiopian mustard without interfering with food production, making it one of the most promising non-food crops identified for sustainable aviation fuel feedstock.

Field trials already show the crop can be produced at scale, though further research is required to determine how national production can be expanded to serve commercial aviation demand.

Officials acknowledged challenges related to logistics and supply chains, noting that Ethiopia’s farmers are geographically dispersed and current transport infrastructure makes bulk feedstock collection difficult.

The study examined multiple production routes including alcohol-to-jet fuel derived from sugar molasses, waste-to-fuel systems using municipal landfill material, and electricity-based fuels derived from renewable sources.

Ethiopia’s sugar sector already has an annual ethanol production capacity of approximately 32.5 million liters, though current output remains constrained due to competition from food and beverage manufacturers willing to pay higher prices.

Municipal waste presented a dual opportunity allowing the country to simultaneously address urban waste problems while generating clean aviation fuel, according to the technical team.

Electricity-based fuel production was identified as one of Ethiopia’s strongest long-term options due to its high renewable energy potential, offering a future route for hydrogen-based synthetic fuel manufacturing.

Power-to-liquid technology is projected to be certified between mid-2026 and late-2026, placing Ethiopia within range of early commercial adoption provided investment mobilization begins promptly.

Consultants acknowledged current market prices for sustainable aviation fuel are roughly double conventional jet fuel rates, though they expect long-term costs to fall once production maturity is achieved.

An international benchmark drawn from India revealed that mandatory aviation fuel blending will begin at one percent in 2027 and rise to five percent by 2030.

Experts warned airlines that regulatory pressure will intensify across international airspace, with compliance becoming unavoidable by 2030 if Ethiopian carriers are to maintain global competitiveness.

The government confirmed the formation of a national technical committee on sustainable aviation fuel and announced plans to establish a project office staffed by aviation and energy specialists in the coming weeks.

Officials stated development partners would be invited to finance the project office and assist in converting research findings into industrial investment programs. Transport Ministry officials reiterated that aviation alone accounts for a large share of global emissions and that Ethiopia has committed to carbon-reduction targets under international climate agreements.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ETHIOPIA-READY-TO-GAMBLE-ON-SUSTAINABLE-AVIATION-FUEL.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 04:56:10.333204

Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.
Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.
Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.","Asian airlines scrambled on Saturday to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets as a sweeping recall by the European planemaker grounded aircraft across the region after disrupting travel in the U.S. during the busiest weekend of the year.

The recall of 6,000 planes covers more than half of Airbus' global A320 family fleet, the backbone of Asian short-haul aviation, particularly in China and India where economic growth has brought millions of new travellers into the skies.

Regulators around the world followed the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in directing their carriers to remedy the A320 software problem before resuming flights.

The Airbus recall, issued to 350 operators around the world, appears to be one of the biggest in its 55-year history and comes weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.

FIX IS SIMPLE BUT NECESSARY

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration told carriers to replace or modify software that controls the elevators and ailerons on A319, A320 and A321 airplanes.

India's aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected by the glitch but said the software reset will be completed by Sunday. The country's largest airline, IndiGo, has completed the software reset on 143 out of 200 aircraft, the regulator said.

Air India, which has 113 impacted aircraft, has completed the reset on 42 aircraft. Both airlines warned of delays on Saturday.

""There isn't any major impact on schedule integrity across our network,"" Air India posted on X. ""However, some of our flights may be slightly delayed or rescheduled.""

Taiwan's Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island's carriers are affected.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers.

ANA Holdings, Japan's biggest airline, cancelled 65 flights on Saturday and warned of more disruption on Sunday.

ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. Nationwide, 95 flights were cancelled, according to public broadcaster NHK.

Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again.

OCTOBER INCIDENT TRIGGERED RECALL, SOURCES SAY

Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia's flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected by the recall. The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported significant delays at Melbourne airport.

South Korea's Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule, with only 17 of its aircraft affected by the recall. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service.

South Korea's Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning.

Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.

The world's largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 340 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday.

U.S. carriers American, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue and United Airlines are among the world's 10 biggest A320-family operators.

Other airlines that said they would do the repairs include Germany's Lufthansa, and Britain-based easyJet.

Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70% of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.

Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on October 30, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.

The green aviation fuel levy introduced by Singapore is a bold move toward reducing the aviation industry’s carbon emissions and supporting the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.","Singapore is the first in the world to implement green fuel levies on air travel. With the new policy, travelers will pay an extra fee which will be determined based on the distance, starting with SGD 1 and going as high as SGD 41.60 for high travel classes. The charge will be used to purchase and promote the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The policy will be in effect by 2026. The goal is to connect the cost of flight travel and the pollution generated. With this, the authorities hope to promote responsibility and flight travel cost related to pollution.

In a significant step toward environmental sustainability, Singapore has announced the introduction of a green aviation fuel levy, which will come into effect from 2026. This move, set to be applied to air tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from October 1, 2026, marks a major initiative by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint.

Details of the Green Aviation Fuel Levy

The levy aims to promote the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), contributing to Singapore’s goal of achieving a 3% to 5% SAF adoption rate by 2030. To facilitate this transition, passengers will be charged according to the travel class and the distance they are flying. The levy will be added to the cost of air tickets, with charges varying for different regions and classes of service.

For flights within Southeast Asia, economy and premium economy passengers will pay SGD 1 (approximately HKD 5.97), while those flying to Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea will be charged SGD 2.80 (HKD 16.72) in economy class, and SGD 11.20 (HKD 66.86) in premium cabins.

European and Long-Haul Destinations

Passengers traveling to Europe, the Middle East, the Pacific Islands, and New Zealand in economy class will incur a charge of SGD 2.80 (HKD 16.72), while those in premium cabins will pay SGD 25.60 (HKD 152.82). For flights to the Americas, the levy increases to SGD 10.40 (HKD 62.08) for economy passengers and reaches a maximum of SGD 41.60 (HKD 248.34) for premium cabin passengers.

The levy is not applicable for passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore, allowing travelers with layovers to avoid any extra charges. Additionally, for passengers traveling on multi-stop flights, the levy will be calculated based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore, ensuring fair and precise charges.

Purpose Behind the Levy

The introduction of the green aviation fuel levy aligns with Singapore’s vision of becoming a leader in sustainable aviation. As the aviation industry is responsible for a significant portion of global greenhouse gas emissions, the move to incorporate SAF and establish a fuel levy is seen as a necessary step to address environmental concerns while supporting the aviation sector’s long-term sustainability goals.

The funds collected through the levy will be used to support the centralised purchase of SAF, helping airlines transition to greener alternatives without incurring significant financial burden. With global pressure on industries to cut carbon emissions, Singapore’s initiative serves as an example for other nations and the aviation industry as a whole to prioritize sustainability in their operations.

Aviation Industry’s Shift Toward Sustainability

While the aviation sector has traditionally been a high-emission industry, there has been increasing momentum toward reducing its environmental impact. Airlines globally are exploring ways to integrate sustainable fuels into their fleets, with many already committed to reducing their carbon emissions over the coming decades.

The green aviation fuel levy in Singapore is a part of a larger trend in which governments and aviation authorities are encouraging airlines to embrace SAF. As SAF has the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, its widespread adoption is crucial in achieving global climate goals.

Singapore’s commitment to sustainability in aviation comes at a time when many countries are rethinking how their transportation systems can become more environmentally friendly. The green fuel levy, alongside other sustainability initiatives, is likely to be an important element of the country’s broader strategy for reducing its carbon footprint and meeting international environmental targets.

Impact on Air Travelers

For travelers, the introduction of the green fuel levy may initially seem like an additional cost. However, the benefits are far-reaching. Passengers who opt for more eco-conscious travel can feel assured that their contributions are part of a larger effort to support cleaner aviation practices. As the industry moves toward greater reliance on sustainable fuel sources, travelers can look forward to a future where air travel is more aligned with global environmental goals.

The green aviation fuel levy is a crucial step in the ongoing transformation of the aviation industry, as stakeholders—from governments and airlines to passengers—work together to make air travel more sustainable. By directly linking the costs of flying with the environmental impact of each journey, Singapore’s innovative approach paves the way for a greener future in aviation.

Singapore is leading sustainable aviation with a revolutionary green fuel levy starting in 2026, ranging from SGD 1 to SGD 41.60, to reduce emissions and promote sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption. This initiative sets a new standard for eco-friendly air travel.

The green aviation fuel levy introduced by Singapore is a bold move toward reducing the aviation industry’s carbon emissions and supporting the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. While the levy will add a small charge to air tickets, it will ultimately play a significant role in transforming air travel into a more sustainable and environmentally responsible mode of transportation. This initiative marks a milestone in Singapore’s efforts to lead the world in sustainable aviation practices, setting an example for other nations to follow as they work toward a more sustainable future for the global aviation sector.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Singapore-Green-Aviation-Fuel-Levy-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 03:58:30.300573

Safran Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Safran, you need to believe that sustained investment in low-emission and sustainable engine technologies will keep the company at the forefront of aerospace innovation, supporting resilient growth and margin expansion. The Bell 505 SAF test milestone demonstrates progress on ESG initiatives, but for now this achievement does not appear to alter the most important catalyst, strong global air travel demand, or mitigate the biggest short-term risk tied to supply chain disruptions.

One recent announcement that connects closely with this news is Safran's raised guidance for 2025, which forecasts revenue growth in the low teens and an increase in projected operating income. This forward-looking stance supports the view that the company's technology efforts, such as SAF compatibility, may reinforce its competitive position amid rising demand, even as supply chain and integration risks persist.

Yet, unlike the optimism around sustainable engine progress, investors also need to consider the ongoing exposure to supply chain risks...

Safran's outlook anticipates €39.3 billion in revenue and €5.0 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection is based on a 10.2% annual revenue growth rate and an increase in earnings of €0.7 billion from the current €4.3 billion.

The move follows as reported by BBC, the discovery that intense solar radiation could corrupt data linked to flight control systems, a risk that Airbus says requires a swift software update.

According to the BBC, more airlines are now reporting potential disruptions as Airbus begins recalling affected aircraft for the update. The recall applies to roughly 6,000 planes globally, nearly half of Airbus’s fleet, making it, as BBC’s notes, “a very unusual situation”.

Air India & Indico issue travel advisories

Air India and IndiGo have issued warnings of longer turnaround times and possible delays, according to The Mint. The publication reported that both airlines have advised passengers to check flight status before heading to the airport, noting that operations may be affected as Airbus’s directive is implemented. “The software/hardware realignment on part of our fleet will lead to delayed operations,” Air India said in a post on X, adding that it regretted any inconvenience caused to passengers.

Other airlines have also responded: American Airlines said about 340 of its planes are affected and warned of “some operational delays” but expects most updates to be completed today or tomorrow. Delta Airlines said it will comply with Airbus’s instruction and expects the impact to be “limited”. London Heathrow said its operations remain unaffected, while Gatwick Airport expects some disruption.

Airbus says the majority of affected aircraft only require a software installation, normally a three-hour process. But around 900 older planes will need computer hardware replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers until that is done. Availability of parts remains a concern, and it is currently unclear whether replacements can be sourced in time.

BBC reported that the software directive primarily targets the A320 family, which Airbus describes as the “aircraft family of choice for airlines around the world.” These planes can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km) and seat between 120 and 244 passengers. The A320 also flies using 50% sustainable aviation fuel, a figure Airbus hopes to raise to 100% by 2030.

The aircraft features advanced turbofan engines that offer 20% lower fuel burn compared with previous generations, one reason why it remains central to commercial fleets worldwide.

But the true giant sits beneath those wings. In 2025, the aircraft with the world’s most powerful commercial engines is the Boeing 777X, powered exclusively by the GE Aerospace GE9X. It is the largest turbofan ever built, the current Guinness World Record holder for thrust, and the technological centerpiece of Boeing’s next-generation flagship.

Understanding why the GE9X stands alone requires comparing it with the engines it surpasses: the GE90 that defined the Boeing 777-300ER era, Rolls-Royce’s trent XWB family on the Airbus A350, and even Rolls-Royce’s future-facing UltraFan demonstrator. Each engine represents a different stage in widebody propulsion, but only one the GE9X combines unprecedented fan size, advanced materials, a record-setting pressure ratio, and efficiency gains that reshape what long-haul aircraft can achieve.

The Engine That Redefined ""Largest Ever Built""

Building on this foundation, the GE9X was designed from the ground up for the Boeing 777X family, and its defining feature is its scale. The engine’s fan measures 134 inches in diameter—wider than the fuselage of a Boeing 737—making it the largest turbofan ever produced. In testing, the GE9X generated 134,300 pounds of thrust, securing an official world record. For day-to-day service it is certified at 110,000 pounds of thrust, which still places it comfortably ahead of any other commercial engine.

That size is backed by a series of aerodynamic and material advances. The fan uses next-generation carbon-fiber composite blades that are thinner and stronger than the GE90’s 22 blades, and the fan case is also composite to keep weight in check. Deeper in the engine, ceramic matrix composites in the turbine section replace traditional metal alloys in some of the hottest zones, allowing higher operating temperatures with less cooling air.

A bypass ratio close to 10:1 the highest ever on a GE widebody engine, turns that physical size into real-world efficiency. More air bypasses the core and is accelerated by the fan, generating a larger share of thrust with less fuel burn. At the same time, the slow-turning, large-diameter fan reduces tip speeds and noise, helping the 777X meet tightening airport and environmental regulations.

How The GE9X Achieves Record-Breaking Efficiency

When passengers watch a Boeing 777X taxi past a terminal window, their attention often goes to its massive 64-meter wingspan and folding wingtips. But the true giant sits beneath those wings. In 2025, the aircraft with the world’s most powerful commercial engines is the Boeing 777X, powered exclusively by the GE Aerospace GE9X. It is the largest turbofan ever built, the current Guinness World Record holder for thrust, and the technological centerpiece of Boeing’s next-generation flagship.

Each engine represents a different stage in widebody propulsion, but only one the GE9X combines unprecedented fan size, advanced materials, a record-setting pressure ratio, and efficiency gains that reshape what long-haul aircraft can achieve.

Why The Boeing 777X Needed The World's Most Powerful Engine

The 777X is the largest twin-engine passenger aircraft ever developed, aimed at replacing earlier 777s and offering an alternative to very large four-engine jets. Its long composite wings generate exceptional lift and improve cruise performance, but they also demand significant thrust during takeoff, especially at maximum takeoff weights above 351,000 kilograms.

The GE9X provides the performance profile required by the 777X. Its large, slow-rotating fan generates high takeoff thrust while maintaining low noise and drag. As a result, the 777X benefits from strong takeoff capability at heavy weights, improved climb performance in challenging airport conditions, lower fuel consumption on long routes, and reduced operational noise impact.

For airlines, these advantages are more than technical milestones. They shape route economics. The 777X is expected to carry more than 400 passengers on routes competing directly with the Airbus A350-1000 and aging 777-300ER fleets. With the GE9X, Boeing can offer a widebody that combines very high capacity with fuel burn and emissions that fit into stricter regulatory frameworks and long-term sustainability targets.

In simple terms, the 777X needed an engine that could match its ambition on range, payload, and environmental performance. The GE9X was designed specifically to fill that role.

GE9X Vs Rivals: GE90, Trent XWB, And UltraFan

Comparing the GE9X to the GE90 highlights how far widebody engines have progressed in a single generation. The GE90-115B, which powers the 777-300ER, can deliver up to 115,540 pounds of thrust and features a 128-inch-diameter fan. Its bypass ratio sits closer to 9:1, and its overall pressure ratio is around the low-40s, impressive figures for its time, but below what the GE9X achieves.

The GE9X, by contrast, sacrifices a small amount of certified takeoff thrust while focusing on cruise efficiency. With a larger 134-inch fan, a higher bypass ratio, and a 60:1 pressure ratio, it extracts more useful thrust from each kilogram of fuel. In practice, that means lower fuel burn, lower emissions, and quieter operation, even though it is physically larger than the GE90.

Against Rolls-Royce’s Trent XWB-97, used on the Airbus A350-1000, the GE9X plays in a similar thrust class but leans on its bigger fan and higher pressure ratio to achieve its performance targets. The Trent XWB is widely regarded as one of the most efficient widebody engines in service, yet Airbus still has to consider that the GE9X gives the 777X a compelling economic story in the same long-haul market segment.

Looking ahead, Rolls-Royce’s UltraFan demonstrator shows where the next step might come from. It uses an even larger 140-inch geared fan and a 64-megawatt power gearbox, with a design target of a 25% fuel-burn improvement over early Trent engines and full compatibility with 100% sustainable aviation fuel from day one. However, UltraFan remains a testbed. It does not yet power a commercial aircraft and is unlikely to enter service before the early 2030s.

For now, that leaves the GE9X as the only certified commercial engine above 100,000 pounds of thrust and the clear leader in the “monster engine” category.

The GE9X Development Story: Materials, Testing, And Certification

The GE9X did not arrive overnight. GE formally launched the program in 2012 as a clean-sheet successor to the GE90, with the goal of pairing a much larger fan with a more efficient core and advanced materials. Engineers spent years iterating fan shapes, compressor layouts, and cooling schemes before the first full engine ran on a ground test stand in 2016.

Those early tests focused on aerodynamics, thermal management, and system behavior across a wide range of power settings. The program then moved to icing, crosswind, and endurance campaigns to validate real-world robustness. Flight testing started in 2018 on GE’s Boeing 747-400 flying testbed, the only platform large enough to carry a GE9X under one wing.

Not everything went smoothly. Early test results revealed wear in the high-pressure compressor, forcing hardware redesigns and contributing to delays in the overall 777X program timeline. However, the core design proved sound, and the test fleet eventually accumulated around 5,000 hours and 8,000 cycles across multiple engines.

The GE9X received Federal Aviation Administration certification in 2020. Since then, GE has continued endurance testing and ETOPS work so that the engine will be ready for extended over-water operations once the 777X enters service. By the time passengers see the GE9X on revenue flights, it will have already gone through one of the most extensive development regimes of any commercial engine to date.

What Comes Next For The World’s Most Powerful Engine?

In 2025, the GE9X stands unchallenged at the top of the commercial turbofan world. It is the only certified engine above 100,000 pounds of thrust, the size leader in fan diameter, and GE’s most thermally efficient large engine. No rival powerplant currently matches its combination of scale, pressure ratio, materials technology, and real-world test history.

That does not mean it will hold every record forever. UltraFan and other future concepts hint at engines that may surpass the GE9X in fuel efficiency, SAF readiness, and integration with hybrid-electric systems. But those designs still have to prove themselves in the same way the GE9X already has through thousands of hours of testing, certification, and long-term airline operation.

As the Boeing 777X moves closer to commercial service, the GE9X will become a regular sight at major global hubs and a new visual icon of long-haul flying. For most passengers, it will go unnoticed, a quiet, steady presence at the end of a wing. For airlines and engineers, it represents a clear milestone in what high-bypass turbofans can achieve.

In 2025, no engine matches the GE9X. For now, it remains the undisputed king of commercial jet power.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/777x-ge9x.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-29 03:59:13.220885

Brasília Sets the Stage for Brazil’s First Green Hydrogen Mobility Hub

Neoenergia, the Brazilian subsidiary of Iberdrola, and Honda Automóveis do Brasil have unveiled a joint programme to advance green hydrogen solutions for mobility and industrial use, anchoring one of the country’s most significant clean-energy R&D initiatives to date.

The collaboration centres on Neoenergia’s first green hydrogen refuelling station, now under construction in Brazil’s capital. The site forms part of ANEEL’s Research, Development and Innovation Programme, supported by an investment of more than €5 million (over 30 million reais). The station is expected to open in December 2025 and will serve as a testing ground for next-generation transport technologies.

Both companies describe the initiative as a pivotal step in accelerating Brazil’s transition toward low-carbon mobility. “This collaboration reinforces our commitment to innovative solutions that accelerate the electrification and decarbonization of the Brazilian economy. Together with Honda, we are joining forces to develop sustainable technologies that expand business opportunities and consolidate Neoenergia’s leadership in the energy transition,” said Eduardo Capelastegui, CEO of Neoenergia.

Fuel-Cell Vehicles Enter Testing Phase

Honda will deploy two models to the project: the CR-V and the CR-V FCEV, a plug-in hybrid SUV equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell system. The vehicles will undergo six months of technical testing to evaluate refuelling performance, driving behaviour, and the operational conditions required to scale hydrogen-based transport in Brazil’s urban environments.

The programme will extend beyond vehicle trials. Honda and Neoenergia will jointly conduct feasibility studies covering hydrogen production, logistics, storage, and new industrial applications, building a cross-sector platform for potential future pilots.

For Honda, which has spent more than 30 years developing hydrogen technologies, Brazil represents fertile ground. “We are very excited to begin this strategic collaboration with Neoenergia in Brazil, a country that has all the conditions to be a world leader in the development of Green Hydrogen,” said Arata Ichinose, CEO of Honda Automóveis do Brasil. “With more than three decades of experience and research in this field, we believe that initiatives like this are fundamental to expanding the possibilities of using hydrogen as a complementary path for the decarbonization of mobility and strengthening the path towards a carbon-neutral society.”

Why Green Hydrogen Matters for Transport and Industry

Hydrogen produced from renewable electricity is drawing rising attention as an emissions-free alternative to diesel and natural gas, particularly for heavy transport and industrial operations. Brazil’s energy mix, already dominated by hydropower, places the country in a strong position to produce green hydrogen at competitive costs.

Iberdrola, Neoenergia’s parent company, has been building hydrogen capacity in Europe and aims to replicate similar models in Latin America. The Brasília station is designed not only as a demonstration site but as a foundation for a wider national strategy around hydrogen corridors and industrial symbiosis.

Fuel-cell vehicles convert hydrogen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction. The process emits only water vapour, operates quietly, and offers high energy efficiency. These attributes make hydrogen an attractive complement to battery-electric mobility, especially in regions where charging infrastructure is sparse or long-range use cases dominate.

Implications for Investors and C-Suite Decision-Makers

Brazil’s hydrogen sector remains at an early stage, but government agencies, utilities, and international manufacturers are now moving with purpose. The Neoenergia-Honda partnership illustrates how public R&D frameworks, private investment, and industrial innovation can converge to test scalable solutions.

For executives overseeing low-carbon transition strategies, the project offers three clear lessons. First, hydrogen is gaining traction not as a replacement for battery electrification but as a parallel pathway for hard-to-electrify segments. Second, national utilities are emerging as central actors in hydrogen infrastructure, supported by regulatory-driven innovation programmes. Third, automakers are reassessing their decarbonisation models as global markets look for diversified clean-mobility options.

A Step Toward Brazil’s Emerging Hydrogen Economy

Brazil has stated ambitions to become a leading exporter and domestic user of green hydrogen. Progress has been uneven, but partnerships such as this one point to growing momentum. If successful, the Brasília station could serve as a reference project for replication across major cities, industrial hubs, and freight corridors.

As both companies reaffirm their target of carbon neutrality by 2050, the collaboration reinforces the wider shift underway in Latin America’s largest economy: accelerating the deployment of renewable-powered technologies, expanding choice in low-carbon mobility, and aligning industrial capabilities with global climate goals.

Brazil’s hydrogen landscape is still being shaped, but with utilities and automakers now moving into shared demonstration projects, the country is positioning itself more firmly in the global race to develop clean-energy transport systems.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Honda-logo-featured-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 23:56:29.380301

Between November 10 and 17, 2025, the Petrobras Transpetro carried out an operation considered a milestone for the Brazilian maritime sector: the refueling of three Transpetro ships with the renewable marine bunker fuel B24, composed of 24% biodiesel and 76% traditional bunker oil. According to an article published by the website Portos e Navios, the operation was carried out at the São Sebastião Waterway Terminal (Tebar), on the coast of São Paulo, and is part of the national strategy for decarbonizing maritime transport.

Transpetro ships are being supplied with B24 renewable bunker fuel.

This initiative signals real progress in Brazil's energy transition. The use of B24 renewable bunker fuel strengthens Petrobras' commitment to cleaner and more technological solutions for shipping, and positions the country among the leading developers of alternative fuels in the sector.

During the operation, three vessels were refueled: the tanker ship Zumbi dos Palmares received approximately 1.300 tons of fuel, while the ships Rômulo Almeida and Carlos Drummond de Andrade received approximately 400 and 300 tons of renewable bunker fuel, respectively.

This marine fuel was supplied by PBio, a Petrobras subsidiary specializing in biofuels. As a ""drop-in"" solution, B24 can be used directly in existing engines without the need for technical adaptations or equipment replacement—a decisive factor for immediate viability and reduced operating costs.

This characteristic has been considered one of the key points for accelerating the energy transition in maritime transport, since existing ships can operate with lower carbon intensity along national and international routes.

Petrobras initiative: technical characteristics and environmental certifications

The B24 renewable bunker fuel is composed of 76% conventional bunker oil and 24% FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester) biodiesel. In addition to meeting technical performance specifications, the fuel has international certification according to the ISCC EU RED standard, which guarantees traceability and compliance with rigorous socio-environmental criteria.

This certification is fundamental to broadening global acceptance and enables the fuel to be traded in international ports as well. The adoption of certified fuels demonstrates companies' concern for the environmental requirements of regulatory bodies and standards established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Another important feature is that B24 renewable bunker fuel has a lower sulfur content compared to traditional marine fuel. This contributes to the reduction of air pollutants, ensuring greater compliance with decarbonization policies and environmental targets that are already being implemented worldwide.

History of the adoption of sustainable fuels in the maritime sector.

The authorization for the commercialization of renewable bunker fuel with up to 24% biodiesel was issued by the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) in 2024. Since then, Petrobras and Transpetro have been conducting tests and gradual operations with marine fuels containing renewable content.

In 2025, Petrobras obtained international certification to formally market low-sulfur, high-renewable-content fuel at Brazilian terminals, consolidating the use of the B24 blend in commercial operations. Prior to this, tests had already been conducted on different ships, evaluating parameters such as stability, combustion, and engine performance.

These initiatives place Brazil in a strategic position, keeping pace with sustainability trends that are already advancing in major maritime markets in Asia, Europe, and North America.

Sustainability and carbon emission reduction

The environmental importance of adopting B24 renewable bunker fuel.

The use of B24 renewable bunker fuel represents a significant step towards reducing maritime greenhouse gas emissions. The shipping sector is historically associated with high emission rates due to the global transport of cargo. The use of biodiesel reduces carbon emissions compared to pure fossil fuels.

According to information released by Petrobras, the adoption of this renewable fuel blend can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% during ship operations. This reduction increases the environmental competitiveness of companies and helps meet international standards and requirements imposed by the IMO.

Furthermore, B24 promotes sustainability because it allows the inclusion of recyclable or sustainably sourced raw materials in the production chain, such as used cooking oil or agro-industrial by-products. In this way, it also contributes to strengthening the bioeconomy and the circular economy.

Impact of Petrobras' initiative on the Brazilian shipbuilding sector.

National leadership in the energy transition of shipping.

The supply of B24 renewable bunker fuel to Transpetro's ships demonstrates that the energy transition in the Brazilian maritime sector is already underway. This operation not only represents a technological milestone, but also paves the way for Brazil to strengthen its position in the global renewable fuels market.

The use of sustainable marine fuel also enhances port competitiveness and can attract more companies and shipping routes to operate in the country. Mastering this technology allows for the development of logistical and industrial capabilities linked to biofuel production, generating a direct impact on the economy and the production chain.

Furthermore, initiatives of this kind reinforce public and private policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions, meeting national environmental targets, and modernizing Brazilian port infrastructure.

Challenges and limitations for large-scale use

Despite the progress, the adoption of renewable bunker fuel still faces obstacles. Among the main challenges are:

Production and supply of sustainable raw materials in sufficient volume to meet growing demand.

Port and logistics infrastructure is still under development to ensure a regular supply of renewable fuels.

Cost and competitiveness of the fuel, which can vary depending on the biofuel market.

Despite these limitations, experts believe that initiatives like this make renewable fuel increasingly accessible and competitive, encouraging investment and public policies to expand the use of low-carbon alternatives.

What does this advance by Petrobras mean for Brazil now?

The operation carried out by Petrobras with Transpetro's ships shows that Brazil has the technical and industrial capacity to lead the adoption of renewable fuels In shipping, the B24 blend presents itself as a viable, immediate, and scalable solution for reducing emissions in the maritime sector.

This move demonstrates that sustainability can go hand in hand with operational efficiency, competitiveness, and innovation. By opting for B24 renewable bunker fuel, Brazilian companies in the shipbuilding sector are taking a leading role in a global market increasingly committed to decarbonization.

The challenge now is to transform this initiative into a standard, expand supply to other vessels, develop infrastructure, and continue advancing low-carbon fuels for the future of shipping.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Petrobras-Transpetro.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 03:59:17.073854

Live reporter

It's been a few hours now since Airbus announced it needs to implement an urgent software update to thousands of its planes. This comes after the discovery that intense radiation from the sun could corrupt data crucial to flight controls.

If you are just joining us, here's the latest:

Several airlines around the world have announced potential service disruption, including American Airlines, Delta, Air India and Wizz

But EasyJet says it has already completed the required software update and is planning on operating its flights as normal on Saturday

We've heard from London's two biggest airports - Heathrow and Gatwick - Heathrow says this has no impact on its operations, while Gatwick is expecting some disruption

The UK's Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says the impact on UK airlines seems limited, and advises passengers due to fly this weekend to check with carriers for more information

Around 6,000 planes are thought to be affected, which is about half of Airbus's global fleet, our business correspondent Theo Leggett says this is a very unusual situation

What is the Airbus A320?

Airbus describes A320 planes as the ""aircraft family of choice for airlines around the world"".

These planes can fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700km) and have a seating capacity from 120 to 244 seats.

The A320 also flies with 50% sustainable aviation fuel, which Airbus aims to use 100% of by 2030.

The planes feature a choice of two advanced turbofan engines, meaning they benefit from 20% fuel burn reduction when compared with previous generations of the aircraft.

EasyJet says it has 'already completed' software update to planes

EasyJet says it has ""already completed"" the software update on many of its planes and plans to operate its flights as normal on Saturday.

A spokesperson says: ""We plan to operate our flying programme normally on Saturday and ask that customers travelling continue to monitor their flights on flight tracker.""

The airline adds that safety is its highest priority and it ""always operates its fleet of aircraft in strict compliance with manufacturers guidelines"".

Responding to the technical issue with Airbus aircraft, the UK's Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander says:

“I am aware of the technical issue impacting certain aircraft and concerns over how this will affect passengers and flights this evening.""

She advises passengers who are due to fly this weekend to check with their carriers for the latest information.

The transport secretary says ""the good news"" is that ""the impact on UK airlines seems limited, with a smaller number of aircraft requiring more complex software and hardware changes"".

“I would really like to thank the experts, staff and airlines who are working at pace to address this and reassure passengers that work is ongoing.""

""It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally,"" she adds.

We've just seen an update from low-cost Australian airline Jetstar, which says some of its Airbus-operated flights are unable to depart at the moment.

""We’re working through the impacts on our fleet and to our customers. We'll have more information shortly,"" it says.

There is no impact to airline giant Qantas at this stage.

For context: Jetstar is Qantas's low-cost airline.

The latest from Heathrow and Gatwick airports

We've now heard from London's two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick.

""We are aware of a directive requiring some airlines operating Airbus A320 aircraft to update software on their fleet over coming days, which may result in some disruption,"" a spokesperson for Gatwick Airport says.

""This is only impacting a small number of airlines at London Gatwick. Passengers should contact their airline for more information.""

Separately, Heathrow Airport says the required maintenance on some Airbus aircraft currently has no impact on its operations.

'Potential for disruption immeasurable at this stage,' travel journalist says

""Dozens of big airlines use these aircraft,"" travel journalist Simon Calder tells the BBC.

""So the potential for disruption is, I'm afraid, immeasurable at this stage.""

Calder says that while British Airways' mainline fleet of short-haul flights that are at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports use entirely Airbus A320 series planes, ""my understanding is that only three of those are affected by this and as a result they'll be able to get the work done overnight, hopefully with no disruption"".

He adds he has spoken to Wizz Air and EasyJet, who we have reported are expecting some delays. ""Now the assumption, I'm glad to say, is that your flight will be going ahead as normal and the airline will contact you if there is any change to that.""

About 80 aircraft affected at Gatwick, BBC understands

Simon Browning

Transport correspondent

The Airbus software issue could take hours to fix on the planes themselves, which an industry source suggests means some cancellations are inevitable over the weekend.

It is understood UK-based airlines are currently working on their plans, with one airline being particularly affected.

Planes will arrive in the UK this evening as usual, but it appears some will not do their next turnaround tomorrow and depart from the UK again.

I've been told airports will need to play “a logistical game of Tetris tonight to free up space” to make sure incoming aircraft can be parked overnight. Airports “will be having to park them remotely to ensure incoming long hauls have space"", the industry source says.

It is unclear how many engineers will be needed at once to update software. The skies at this time of year are quieter after the peak summer period and before the Christmas festive rush begins.

It is understood about 80 aircraft are affected at Gatwick Airport.

Air Canada not expecting any impact to operations

Air Canada says it's not expecting any impact to its operations as ""very few of our aircraft use that version of the software"".

However, connecting flights with other airlines could still be delayed by a knock-on effect.

Other Canadian Airlines WestJet and Porter don't have any of the A320 planes listed on their websites.

How long will repairs take?

Theo Leggett

Business correspondent

This issue affects around 6,000 aircraft.

For the majority of planes, the fix will involve installing new computer software. This should normally take about three hours.

But around 900 older planes will need computers replaced and will not be allowed to carry passengers again until the job has been completed.

How long that takes will depend on the availability of replacement computers.

It’s not yet clear whether there will be enough parts to meet demand.

Why this is an extremely unusual issue

Theo Leggett

It was experienced on one flight, when an aircraft flying from Cancun to New Jersey was affected by a sudden and intense solar storm.

The radiation corrupted data in the ELAC - a computer used to operate control surfaces on the wings and horizontal stabilizer.

The fault caused the plane to go into a sudden descent.

Airbus says the plane had recently had its software updated. The issue had never arisen with the previous software.

But now, it insists it is acting out of an abundance of caution.

It took the issue to regulators itself and asked airlines to make changes.

EasyJet expects 'some disruption'

EasyJet says its aware of the communication from Airbus to airlines operating the A320 family aircraft and is ""currently working closely with the safety authorities and Airbus to implement the action we need to take"".

The airline says it is expecting this to result in some disruption and will ""inform customers directly about any changes to our flying programme tomorrow and will do all possible to minimise the impact"".

“Safety is our highest priority and EasyJet operates its fleet of aircraft in strict compliance with manufacturers guidelines,” its statement concludes.

Air New Zealand warns of disruption across number of flights today

Air New Zealand says it's currently affected by a ""global software issue impacting Airbus A320neo aircraft"", it says in a post on social media platform X., external

""As a precaution, all our A320neo aircrafts will be receiving a software update before operating their next passenger service,"" the airline says.

The statement continues by saying ""this will lead to disruption across a number of our A320neo flights today and we’re expecting a number of cancellations to services across that fleet"".

""If you’re travelling today, we will be contacting customers directly if your flight is affected,"" the airline adds.

There may be impact to some flights, CAA warns

Tim Johnson from the UK's Civil Aviation Authority tells the BBC that there may be disruptions to flights ""in some circumstances"".

""From a UK perspective, not all airlines fly Airbus A320 or the affected ones, so for some airlines there will be no impact at all,"" he says.

""For some, there may be some impact,"" he continues, adding that the CAA has been in touch with airlines and they're looking to make sure the maintenance is undertaken over the coming days.

He says the advice to customers is to ""check airline websites and apps for the latest info about what is happening"".

How did Airbus find the problem?

Theo Leggett

Business correspondent

The issue was discovered after a JetBlue aircraft en-route from Mexico to the United States in October experienced a ‘sudden drop in altitude’.

The plane made an emergency landing, with reports at the time suggesting 15 to 20 people suffered minor injuries.

It’s thought the incident was caused by intense solar radiation, which corrupted data in a computer used to help control the aircraft.

Now action is being taken to prevent further problems. About 6,000 aircraft worldwide are thought to be affected, all of them of the A320 family, which also includes the A319 and A321 models.

According to Airbus, the majority can be fixed with a relatively simple software update. However, some 900 older planes will need replacement computers, and will have to be taken out of service until they can be fixed.

Warning of disruption as thousand of Airbus planes require software update

Jamie Whitehead

Live reporter

Airbus says that flights will be disrupted after it requested immediate modifications to thousands of its planes.

The plane manufacturer says it has found that intense radiation from the Sun could corrupt data crucial to flight controls.

About 6,000 planes are thought to be affected, which is around half of the company’s global fleet.

It’s thought most will be able to undergo a simple software update.

But their impact on the environment cannot be denied. Greenhouse gas emissions, water quality impacts, and noise pollution are common helicopter-related issues that affect local communities and ecosystems.

Here’s the good news: the helicopter industry is constantly evolving, and many industry leaders are fighting to tackle these challenges head-on. Advancements like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hybrid-electric engines, and lightweight construction materials are improving efficiency, cutting emissions, and shrinking helicopters’ overall footprint.

Let’s explore how these rotary aircraft shape sustainability efforts, the innovations driving more climate-friendly operations, and the ways in which helicopters are powering the future of green energy.

The Environmental Impact of Helicopter Operations

Helicopters face many ecological challenges, from harmful emissions to wildlife disturbances. But ongoing innovations are helping to minimize their impact.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Helicopters emit greenhouse gases including CO₂, NOₓ, and carbon monoxide through aviation fuel combustion. While newer technologies have greatly improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, many older rotorcraft still operate with less efficient systems.

The Positives:

While aviation accounts for roughly 2–2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, helicopters contribute less than 1% of the aviation sector’s CO₂ emissions.

Plus, modern advancements like engine improvements and the development of lighter construction materials have reduced their CO₂ output by around 50% over the past 50 years.

Wildlife Disturbances

Frequent, low-altitude helicopter flights can significantly disrupt wildlife. Birds and mammals often experience stress, flee, or change their behavior in response to noise. This can cause them to abandon their habitats and miss critical feeding and breeding opportunities. Over time, this disruption can fragment ecosystems, lower reproductive success, and threaten the biodiversity of national parks and wilderness areas.

The Positives:

While helicopter operations certainly cause some level of wildlife disturbance, they also play a key role in conservation efforts. Their ability to hover, travel at low altitudes, and perform quick, precise maneuvers makes them ideal for many conservation missions. Helicopters are crucial for performing land and wildlife surveys, collaring and tracking, rescue and relocation, anti-poaching measures, and more.

Helicopters can limit noise and visual disturbance to wildlife by flying at higher altitudes, using sound-dampening technologies, and optimizing flight paths. These techniques minimize wildlife stress and mitigate the resulting behavioral changes.

Soil and Water Quality Impacts

Helicopter operations—particularly those near heliports—can compromise soil and water quality through fuel leaks, chemical residues, and runoff from maintenance areas.

The Positives:

Despite the risk of surface runoff, using helicopters in place of heavy ground equipment still offers numerous advantages, like minimizing the need for destructive land clearing and new road construction.

Using helicopters also helps prevent soil erosion and lessens the footprint left on surrounding land.

Noise Pollution

Helicopters are crucial for a wide variety of industries, whether releasing Bambi Buckets to extinguish forest fires or placing rooftop HVAC units with extreme precision for new skyscraper builds.

The problem? Helicopters are loud. In fact, people often perceive helicopter noise as being nearly twice as loud as it actually is. This is likely because the low-frequency sound of rotor blades cutting through the air can travel long distances and penetrate homes and buildings.

Residents who live in the flight path of helicopters—especially in dense urban areas—often report stress responses to helicopter noise, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, and property value concerns. Helicopter noise can also disrupt sensitive wildlife and ecosystems.

The Positives:

The aviation industry has made great strides in creating quieter, more efficient rotorcraft. Improved rotor designs, like blades featuring serrated edges or reshaped tips, smooth airflow and mitigate sound output.

The NOTAR (No-Tail-Rotor) helicopter system eliminates the tail rotor entirely, making for much quieter flight.

New sound-dampening materials are being constantly developed to absorb vibrations and reduce noise.

Electric and hybrid propulsion systems have been developed that are much quieter than traditional engines.

Noise reduction techniques in pilot training, stricter noise regulations in communities, and careful urban planning are helping minimize helicopter noise pollution.

Helicopter Innovations Driving Sustainable Aviation

As the aviation industry moves toward a greener future, helicopter manufacturers and operators are embracing technologies that limit emissions, improve efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. Let’s explore the innovations transforming how helicopters are built, powered, and operated.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One of the greatest advancements in low-carbon aviation is the development of biofuels, or eco-friendly fuels made from renewable resources. The biofuel used to power helicopters is known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a green alternative to the conventional jet fuel that has traditionally powered helicopter engines.

SAF is derived from non-petroleum organic material known as “feedstocks.” These include:

Algae

Agriculture, animal, and municipal waste

Plant oils

Recycled cooking grease

The critical benefit of SAF is that it’s made from carbon sources that already exist as part of the natural carbon cycle, resulting in drastically lower emissions. In fact, in the future, 100% SAF could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% when compared to conventional jet fuel.

Engine Efficiency Improvements

Aerospace manufacturers are designing new, more efficient helicopter engines with higher compression ratios, improved turbine designs, and better cooling systems. These advancements improve overall performance and reduce energy loss, requiring less fuel to create the same amount of power.

Fuel efficiency improvements lead to:

Fewer destructive greenhouse gas emissions

Decreased operating costs

Extended aircraft lifespan due to minimal engine strain

Reduced noise pollution as a result of quieter, more efficient engines

Hybrid-Electric and Fully Electric Propulsion Systems

Another promising advancement in the push for more sustainable helicopter operations is the creation of hybrid-electric and fully electric propulsion systems. These systems reduce the usage of fossil fuels by either combining traditional engines with electric motors or replacing them entirely.

These systems can reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% when compared to traditional flight. They help helicopters reduce noise pollution, lower operational costs, and produce fewer harmful emissions—without compromising power or performance.

Learn more about emerging helicopter innovations.

Aerodynamics Advancements

Helicopters are inherently less aerodynamic than airplanes due to their rotating blades and need for vertical lift. However, improvements in aerodynamics are resulting in significant fuel savings.

Engineers are reconfiguring and streamlining rotor blades to reduce drag and generate lift more efficiently, minimizing the energy required to keep a helicopter in the air. Additionally, tail design modifications are reducing drag and boosting aerodynamic efficiency, resulting in smoother airflow and increased stability.

These innovations allow helicopters to sustain flight using less engine power, resulting in more eco-friendly and cost-efficient helicopter operations.

Advanced Composite Materials

Helicopter manufacturers are also using lighter alloys and advanced composites to reduce the weight of helicopter engines, thereby reducing the amount of fuel needed to sustain flight.

They’re also incorporating environmentally conscious materials into helicopter builds, like ceramic matrix composites, or CMCs. These innovations not only enhance fuel efficiency but represent an important step toward more Earth-friendly helicopter design and manufacturing.

Carbon Offset Programs

Another way aviation teams can compensate for harmful greenhouse gases is to establish or join carbon offset programs. Carbon offsetting is a way to compensate for CO₂ emissions by funding carbon reduction projects elsewhere.

Examples include:

Planting new trees to naturally absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere

Promoting sustainable forestry to preserve forests’ capacity to store carbon

Investing in clean water projects that eliminate the need to boil water over open fires

Distributing energy-efficient cookstoves to reduce wood and charcoal use, cutting both air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions

Supporting the development of renewable energy, such as wind and solar farms

Carbon credit programs are becoming a key part of helicopter sustainability efforts.

Sustainable Aviation Training

Finally, many flight schools and programs at major helicopter training centers are incorporating eco-conscious operational awareness into their training programs. Sustainable aviation awareness topics covered often include:

Energy management

Eco-friendly operation procedures

Emission reduction practices

Efficient route planning

Optimized climb/descent profiles

SAF handling and compatibility

How Helicopters Are Powering the Future of Green Energy

As renewable energy projects expand into more remote and challenging terrain, helicopters are becoming essential partners in environmentally conscious construction. Their unique ability to lift, transport, and position heavy materials from the air makes them invaluable in building wind farms and solar farms that support the global clean energy transition.

Development of Solar Farms

The demand for sustainable energy continues to grow. Renewable energy made up 92.5% of all new power added across the globe in 2024, with solar power contributing to 77% of renewable additions.

So, how do helicopters support solar energy? One fast-growing trend in solar farm development is hiring heavy-lift helicopter services to assist with the building of solar farm infrastructure. Helicopters are especially vital in remote and hard-to-reach locations.

Helicopters can transport heavy equipment and place solar panels with precision—all while enhancing project safety and efficiency and minimizing their ecological footprint. While heavy trucks and ground-based equipment destroy the ground and disrupt ecosystems, helicopters reduce disturbances by delivering and placing solar panels from above.

Development of Wind Farms

Currently, wind energy accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity generation. But the development of wind farms continues to grow, and so does the need for more environmentally responsible methods of construction. One answer? Helicopters.

Heavy-lift helicopters’ agility, load capacity, and ability to safely suspend workers over tall structures make them ideal for constructing renewable energy solutions like wind turbines. One of the largest costs for wind farm owners—and a detriment to the environment—is the need for new roads to transport tower sections and turbine blades to the wind farm location.

Hiring heavy-lift helicopters for wind farm construction means that transporting equipment is faster, less expensive, and less detrimental to the surrounding environment. Essentially, helicopter lifting enables renewable energy companies to more efficiently build clean power solutions in areas that were previously largely inaccessible.

Currently, wind energy accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity generation. But the development of wind farms continues to grow, and so does the need for more environmentally responsible methods of construction. One answer? Helicopters.

Heavy-lift helicopters’ agility, load capacity, and ability to safely suspend workers over tall structures make them ideal for constructing renewable energy solutions like wind turbines. One of the largest costs for wind farm owners—and a detriment to the environment—is the need for new roads to transport tower sections and turbine blades to the wind farm location.

Hiring heavy-lift helicopters for wind farm construction means that transporting equipment is faster, less expensive, and less detrimental to the surrounding environment. Essentially, helicopter lifting enables renewable energy companies to more efficiently build clean power solutions in areas that were previously largely inaccessible.

McCormick: SAF is long-term answer for corn demand, not E15

An ag economist says updates to federal biofuels policies could have a big impact on commodity markets.

Jim McCormick with AgMarket.Net says year-round E15 isn’t the long-term answer for corn demand. He tells Brownfield it’s sustainable aviation fuel.

“Over the next 10 to 20 years, I fear you’re going to find more and more people using these hybrid and all-electric cars,” he said. “As the battery life gets better, we have to find a different use for corn besides ethanol. Aviation fuel is the answer to our problem.”

McCormick says the SAF market is still in its infancy in the U.S., but investments need to be made sooner rather than later.

“As you lose those car sales and that demand for ethanol in vehicles, the aviation fuel is there to offset that lost demand.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, SAF production in the U.S. is estimated around 20-to-30 million gallons per year. The country’s jet fuel consumption currently exceeds 16 billion gallons annually.

According to an analyst, China’s momentum towards green hydrogen has the potential to revolutionize heavy manufacturing and transportation in China’s upcoming 5-year plan (2026–2030).
The energy transition report from Agora illustrates that while the amount of renewable hydrogen produced in China is steadily increasing, the majority of hydrogen produced in the country still comes from coal.

However, it’s clear from recent Chinese government policy statements that the overall strategy is actually much more complex than simply building wind and solar farms, as it embraces several so-called ‘green fuels,’ such as hydrogen (green), hydrogen-containing ammonium, and sustainable aircraft fuel (SAF). FuelCellsWorks has described it as “the most diverse pivot” regarding green fuels for the country.

It’s not a case of greenwashing. It’s a bold statement. Green hydrogen produced using renewable electricity to split water can be fed into many different types of industries. It can be converted into ammonia for fertilizer and shipping, as well as fuel for aircraft, enabling cleaner travel for planes.

According to an analyst, China’s momentum towards green hydrogen has the potential to revolutionize heavy manufacturing and transportation in China’s upcoming 5-year plan (2026–2030).

Inside China’s uneasy transition to clean hydrogen

There is a paradox hidden within those numbers. The energy transition report from Agora illustrates that while the amount of renewable hydrogen produced in China is steadily increasing, the majority of hydrogen produced in the country still comes from coal. While the old dragon may have awakened and taken notice of its surroundings, it still hasn’t completely gone to sleep! There remains a risk that China locks itself into a fossil fuel dependency cloaked in a ‘green’ label.

Workers of change: Coal miners, engineers, and everyone in between

The lives of everyday Chinese people are impacted by the various plans and policies being created. For those who live in areas rich in coal, the fossil fuel industry is their source of employment, income, and identity, such as this adorable megaproject, smashing the global hydrogen race. The phased-out approach toward coal from an environmental viewpoint is seen as a threat to the way of life of these people.

Other parts of China see something less flashy but just as important happening right now. Engineers, along with their technicians, are creating some very large green hydrogen-to-ammonia complexes. In Inner Mongolia, many companies are constructing wind and solar systems to produce green ammonia, which will be used as either shipping fuel or even aviation fuel.

Local officials discouraged that option because “the material should be diverted to compost.” Raven then pivoted, applying for a biomass conversion facility permit instead.","RICHMOND, Calif. — Waste-to-hydrogen developer Raven SR has secured a crucial air permit and permission to begin building its first commercial-scale facility in California, marking a major step toward bringing hydrogen fuel derived from organic waste into the mainstream renewable energy market.

The $75 million facility, located on the closed West Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill in Richmond, is being developed in partnership with national waste management company Republic Services. Raven SR will lease the property and receive biomass feedstock from Republic’s transfer station already operating at the landfill.

The facility is designed to process up to 99 wet tons of biomass per day, including yard waste, agricultural residue and untreated construction wood, but excluding food waste. Once operational, the plant is expected to generate up to 2,400 metric tons of hydrogen annually. Company CEO Matt Murdock said construction is slated to begin early next year and noted that the final Richmond permit “should be straightforward to attain.”

Raven SR, founded in 2018 in Wyoming, has spent recent years moving its patented waste-to-fuel technology toward commercial use. The company converts organic waste into synthetic gas and then into hydrogen fuel — without the need for fresh water, an important environmental consideration in drought-prone California. Raven says its approach offers higher efficiency than conventional hydrogen production methods.

The company’s partners and supporters include Samsung Ventures, Chevron New Energies — which holds a 50% equity stake — and early investor Hyzon Motors, which developed the U.S.’s first hydrogen fuel cell refuse truck before shutting down. Chevron plans to market fuel from the Richmond plant throughout Northern California.

Murdock said the company learned key business lessons by observing the rise and fall of other renewable hydrogen ventures. He emphasized two takeaways: “don’t be dependent on government subsidies and don’t load your venture with debt.” He added that Raven is backed largely by equity rather than loans, and although tax credits are available, Murdock said “they’re not necessary to make the Richmond facility pencil out.”

The facility footprint will cover about an acre and a half — half of which will accommodate truck traffic for material delivery and hydrogen distribution. Raven expects to produce 60% to 70% of the facility’s energy needs on-site, supplementing the rest from renewable sources.

Long Path to Permitting

Permitting the facility took over three years — longer than expected, according to Murdock. The company initially tried to secure a solid waste facility permit and hoped to accept food waste as a feedstock source. Local officials discouraged that option because “the material should be diverted to compost.” Raven then pivoted, applying for a biomass conversion facility permit instead.

Throughout the process, Raven continued to fine-tune its system to maximize output and lower costs. Murdock acknowledged that excitement for hydrogen was initially high when the project was announced, but that enthusiasm has slowed. The delay comes as hydrogen funding has stalled nationally, including the suspension of California’s hydrogen hub after losing $1.2 billion due to reduced federal support under the Trump administration.

Still, Raven believes its facility could help revive momentum. Murdock said Richmond’s fuel “can be priced competitively to traditional hydrocarbons,” and he hopes the facility’s launch — planned for 2027 — will accelerate industry confidence. Raven already has additional sites in development, including a project in Spain, and intends to scale production nationwide. The company believes its system can also be modified to produce sustainable aviation fuel, methanol, and other next-generation fuels.

The CEO sees the launch as a potential turning point: “If we can produce a low-cost hydrogen and get it into the market... that’s going to be a big deal,” Murdock said. “My hope is that we can start pushing the dominoes the other way, and people start coming back into the market.”",,N,,2025-11-28 16:56:21.192512

Generation, a sustainable investment management firm, has released its 2025 Sustainability Trends Report, highlighting the year's most significant developments in climate action and technology.

Among the report's key findings, the electric vehicle sector emerges as a particularly striking example of how market forces and policy decisions are pulling in opposite directions, creating both opportunities and challenges for the automotive industry's transformation.

China dominates EV markets

The report positions 2025 as a critical test of whether global climate progress can continue without robust US leadership.

US President Donald Trump's second administration has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and moved to remove federal authority to regulate greenhouse gases, a development that could constrain future climate action if upheld in court.

Generation estimates that policy reversals have already triggered cancellations of nearly US$30bn of prospective clean-industry investment in the US, with modelling suggesting lost investment could reach US$500bn over 10 years.

This policy retreat has created space for China to consolidate its position as the world's leading force in sustainability technology. The report describes China as a future ""electrostate"", driven by aggressive industrial policy and expanding exports of renewable energy technology and electric vehicles.

EVs already represent close to 60% of new car sales in China, versus around 10% in the US in 2024, underlining the widening gap between the two markets.

According to International Energy Agency data, electric cars are expected to account for 25% of global auto sales this year, with cars with plugs already constituting well over half of new sales in China and around a quarter across Europe.

US electric vehicle adoption stalls

The contrast with the US could not be starker. The report notes that EVs made up only about 10% of US car sales in 2024, with a modest increase expected in 2025 as buyers rush to capture expiring subsidies before federal support is dismantled.

Tesla's once-dominant position began to erode this year, particularly in Europe where the company has suffered double-digit sales declines in several markets after people began boycotting the company due to Elon Musk's political activities. The fact that Chinese brands now offer very affordable models is not helping this situation.

Beyond passenger vehicles, decarbonisation in heavy-duty transport is finally beginning to gain traction, with electric lorry sales rising from a small base.

However, the report stresses that infrastructure for the kinds of high-power charging necessary to sustain electric heavy goods vehicles is at a ""barely-started"" stage in most countries.

Aviation and shipping, by contrast, remain way off course for net zero, despite Europe's ambitious mandates for e-kerosene and other sustainable aviation fuel, which still face financing hurdles and would cover only a small portion of demand, even if all planned projects were built.

Clean technology investment accelerates

While the political landscape has grown more hostile to climate action in some regions, the underlying economics continue to favour electrification. Global electricity generation from solar rose 28.3% last year, with China adding more solar capacity to its grid in a single month than any other country has ever built in an entire year.

Battery deployment is also fundamentally changing grid profiles in some advanced markets. In California, batteries already meet about 20% of peak evening demand on some days, rising to roughly 30% in parts of Australia, effectively displacing gas-fired generation during critical hours.

Benchmark data suggest clean energy is attracting around twice as much investment globally as fossil fuels, with solar costs plummeting year-on-year since 2009. Conversely, gas-fired power costs have barely moved, reinforcing the case for private capital to continue reallocating towards low-carbon infrastructure.

For corporate and financial audiences, the report's core message is that the physics and economics of the transition are pulling in one direction while politics pushes in another, creating both execution risk and competitive opportunity.

Companies that treat 2025's turbulence as an excuse to pause decarbonisation efforts risk finding themselves on the wrong side of what the report calls ""the race for the future"".",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/deae93146605e530b9e16fa983b73c6e:67fd1391b694c7f61203b2f9475f19e8/joshua-fernandez-nelvfxwaz8m-unsplash.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 11:56:10.873144

At the Jurong Island 25th Anniversary event, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong said the government aims to expand research capabilities, test new energy systems, and strengthen talent development, announcing six new partnerships that support Singapore’s strategy to increase specialty chemicals, sustainable materials, and next-generation fuels, such as hydrogen, ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel.

“These partnerships show how strategic collaboration across the ecosystem can accelerate the transformation we envision for Jurong Island,” Jurong Town Corp. (JTC) Chief Executive Jacqueline Poh said.

Jurong Island hosts more than 100 global energy and chemical companies and is one of the country’s most land-intensive industrial areas. According to JTC and the Economic Development Board (EDB), nearly 300 hectares have been allocated for future energy infrastructure. Growing demand for specialty chemicals — driven by Asian consumption and global sustainability trends — is expected to generate more than 1,000 jobs in the coming years.

JTC and the National University of Singapore (NUS) will begin a 2026 study on Phase 2 of the Sustainable Tropical Data Center Testbed, to be located on Jurong Island. The testbed will allow data center operators to pilot AI-ready, low-carbon technologies, such as immersion cooling, direct-to-chip cooling, predictive energy management, and intelligent workload optimization. The initiative supports Singapore’s plan for a 700-MW low-carbon data center park on Jurong Island, the largest in the country.

A*STAR’s Institute of Sustainability for Chemicals, Energy and Environment (ISCE²) and Surbana Jurong also signed an MOU to collaborate on the upcoming Low Carbon Technology Translational Testbed (LCT3).

Singapore is also drawing climate-tech startups into its industrial ecosystem with Third Derivative (D3), a global climate-tech accelerator run by the Rocky Mountain Institute, giving companies on Jurong Island access to more than 280 emerging startups working on decarbonization, clean energy, and advanced materials.

Keppel Ltd. joins JTC to study a renewable-energy microgrid testbed in 2026 to trial digital demand-response systems and explore thermal-energy networks to reduce cooling loads for energy-intensive users like data centers. These systems could redistribute surplus energy and reduce electricity demand across the island’s industrial facilities.

One of the largest commitments came from Aster, which is investing $150 million in a hydrogen-ready integrated gas turbine at its Jurong Island complex. The project will generate and utilize low-carbon electricity and supply excess power to Singapore’s national grid. Along with Air Liquide, it will explore producing low-carbon hydrogen using auto-thermal reforming technology combined with carbon capture, aligning with the country’s National Hydrogen Strategy.

The shift toward low-carbon manufacturing also requires new skills and training pathways. Under its MOU with JTC, NUS will explore creating training modules, internships, and a potential specialization in industrial decarbonization and sustainable digital infrastructure. Advario Singapore will work with Workforce Singapore to redesign jobs and upskill 150 employees to prepare for handling next-generation fuels, including ammonia.

Food processing company ADM is working with energy company Tallgrass to transport CO2 from its Nebraska Corn Processing Complex in Columbus to Tallgrass’s Sequestration Hub in Eastern Wyoming.

The project will use Tallgrass’s 640 km “Trailblazer” pipeline, formerly a natural gas transmission line and now converted into a dedicated CO2 pipeline.

Chris Cuddy, ADM’s North American president, said: “CCS is an important part of our strategy to decarbonise our operations and help meet global demand for low-carbon ingredients and we are proud to work with Tallgrass to find innovative solutions at facilities like Columbus.

“This is an exciting project for the industry and for the future of CCS technology.”

ADM's sustainability plans

To date, ADM says it has captured and stored more than 3.9m t of CO2 – and is looking to expand its capacity further.

The company is also working with renewable energy company Gevo to develop 3.4m L/y of ethanol from its various plants, including the Nebraska plant, into around 1.8m L/y of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

By 2035, ADM aims to rapidly decarbonise across its supply chain, targeting a 25% reduction in Scope 3 emissions.

CO2 pipeline

Tallgrass’s new CO2 pipeline is already in operation and runs through Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska.

The US$1.5bn line received its first shipment of CO2 from Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland in early October.

Biofuels producer Poet also connected its bioprocessing facility in Fairmount, Nebraska to the line, where it will capture CO2 from its biogenic waste streams.

Beyond bioethanol and biofuels, Tallgrass has been awarded funding by the US Department of Energy to design a commercial-scale carbon capture for a hydrogen-producing facility using autothermal reforming technology.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/23181/piepline.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-11-28 11:56:26.316962

The ethanol solution The aviation industry has an urgent problem.
Moreover, the plant uses a wide variety of sustainable feedstocks to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.
“Our SAF has a higher energy density than traditional Jet‑A fuel, making it a better quality fuel,” the company’s website noted.","LanzaJet, a US-based fuel producer, announced successful production of jet fuel from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia.

This milestone marks the world’s first commercial-scale production of jet fuel derived from ethanol as a feedstock. Furthermore, it offers the first non-petroleum renewable solution that is compatible with existing aircraft.

The achievement is the culmination of 15 years of R&D and validates LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology.

The ATJ technology can utilize a broad range of sustainable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon.

The development offers great promise to innovators, farmers, fuel producers, and the aviation sector.

“This achievement marks the culmination of 15 years of research and development, collaboration, investment, and scale-up, and represents a critical breakthrough for the aviation industry with evidence that ethanol can be transformed into jet fuel at commercial scale,” the company stated.

The ethanol solution

The aviation industry has an urgent problem. Currently, SAF is the only viable near-term solution for decarbonizing long-haul flights.

But the dominant production method, Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), faces rapidly constrained supplies of feedstocks like used cooking oil.

Hence, the world needs a scalable alternative. LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet technology aims to solve this issue.

The conversion of ethanol to Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK), a type of SAF, is accomplished through a continuous catalytic process (Alcohol-to-Jet).

This process involves a series of chemical reactions, often including dehydration (to convert ethanol to ethylene), oligomerization (to build longer hydrocarbon chains), and hydrogenation/hydrotreating (to saturate the molecules and refine them into kerosene-range fuel).

“This is an important milestone for LanzaJet and our investors, and it’s a major win for global aviation – perhaps serving as a beacon of hope for the future,” said Jimmy Samartzis, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaJet. ​

The company says that the ATJ technology is one of the most promising commercially ready solutions in a decade, offering a scalable way to decarbonize aviation by utilizing widely available ethanol.

It could enable nations to enhance energy security, control domestic fuel supply chains, and boost their agricultural sectors through economic development.

Better quality fuel

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility is a First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) integrated plant that required over $300 million in investment. It incorporates FOAK technologies, such as Technip Energies’ Hummingbird (Ethanol-to-Ethylene), and a joint DOE/LanzaTech Oligomerization solution.

Moreover, the plant uses a wide variety of sustainable feedstocks to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

The resulting fuel, once blended with Jet A-1, is a fully certified solution compatible with current planes and infrastructure.

“Our SAF has a higher energy density than traditional Jet‑A fuel, making it a better quality fuel,” the company’s website noted.

The plant is a significant economic engine for rural communities. It created hundreds of construction jobs. It is now sustaining over 65 direct and indirect jobs in Treutlen County, Georgia.

LanzaJet is deploying its technology globally, with current projects in the US, Australia, Japan, India, the United Kingdom, Colombia, the European Union, the Middle East, and Kazakhstan.

Aviation’s path to Net Zero by 2050 is a challenge of colossal scale. LanzaJet’s success demonstrates that the foundational technology exists today to finally accelerate the transition.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IE-30.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 10:56:56.879727

Globally, we generate between 2.1 and 2.3 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste per year.
This could grow to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050.
Only 7% of the 106 billion tonnes of materials used annually worldwide come from recycled sources.
This gives way for a more streamlined and successful circular economy, when waste is appropriately recovered and reintroduced into the community.","Waste collection has long been seen as a background service; removing what society no longer values. Globally, we generate between 2.1 and 2.3 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste per year. This could grow to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050.

Knowing that waste contributes to 3-5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is clear change must happen quickly. And in a world facing rapid population growth and escalating climate pressures, how we collect and manage waste is emerging as one of the most powerful levers for sustainability and even a potential solution for climate change challenges.

Waste is a vital source, and the beginning of value creation. Our perception of this material must change to no longer be viewed as the end of the journey, but the start of an exciting new chapter in this cycle.

Only 7% of the 106 billion tonnes of materials used annually worldwide come from recycled sources. There is an abundance of untapped potential when diverting waste from landfill, reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), municipal solid waste across countries exceeded 770 million tonnes in 2023 -about 552 kg per person - and yet landfilling remains the primary disposal method, accounting for around 40% in many countries.

When intelligent routing systems, real-time data, predictive fleet analytics, and rigorous safety standards work in harmony, collection becomes strategy. These innovations optimise efficiency, drive diversion from landfill, enhance material recovery, and redefine what service excellence looks like.

What was once seen as a cost centre is now an engine of environmental and economic value. This is the model Tajmee'e was built to deliver.

In the UAE, collection is the entry point into bigger opportunities, including material recovery facilities, waste-to-energy systems, and a circular economy framework. This shift supports national ambitions such as the UAE Net Zero by 2050 initiative, and the Circular Economy Policy 2021-2031.

When disposed of appropriately, waste is an alternative resource which can be converted to hydrogen, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), electricity, and more, contributing to the UAE's increasing rise in energy demands.

In the words of H.E. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, Chief of ADNOC, during his opening speech at ADIPEC, the demand for energy, including new grids and data centres, will require up to $4 trillion in investment annually. Waste can be part of this solution.

Further, taking collection to the next level for the UAE and the economy requires aligning operational transformation coupled with the vision of the national strategy. Embedding advanced collection models boosts the green economy, upskills local talents, and reinforces national leadership in sustainable resource management.

The most profound change lies in shifting the community's mindset around waste. The global economy is only about 7.2% circular today despite the fact that 90% of the materials entering our systems are raw, valuable materials.

By influencing behavioural change among the public to recycle, and embedding technology during collection through sensor-enabled bins, digital tracking, and route optimisation, materials becoming traceable, streams become clean and contamination drops. This gives way for a more streamlined and successful circular economy, when waste is appropriately recovered and reintroduced into the community.

In this light, Tajmee'e marks a decisive turning point in terms of how we define progress. It signals our evolution from a standard collector to a national champion of unlocking the value of waste. The journey begins at collection, yet its impact reverberates across the entire sustainability chain.

We are building the backbone for smarter, safer, and greener cities - proving that waste isn't an endpoint, but a resource waiting to be reimagined. We are engineering a cleaner, more sustainable tomorrow.",https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1764270544-LEADIMAGETEMPLATE-2025-11-27T230848830.png?format=pjeg&auto=webp,N,,2025-11-28 11:56:40.126588

The University of Hawaiʻi Warriors’ recent loss on the road to the UNLV Raiders marked more than a fall to a Mountain West Conference foe.

The game also had the kind of environmental implications that increasingly concern organizers of big-time sports events: a massive carbon footprint. That’s an inescapable reality for Hawaiʻi’s athletics program, where the Warriors’ air travel for that game alone produced an estimated 122,732 kilograms of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of driving a Tacoma pickup truck from Kaimukī to Haleʻiwa and back more than 5,000 times.

That doesn’t account for the fans who traveled 2,700 miles to the disappointing away game, which dropped UH’s conference record to four wins and three losses.

Jeff Mikulina, a climate consultant who helped craft Hawaiʻi’s energy policy, says it’s important not to vilify sports events as polluters, but instead take a look at their impact to gain a better understanding of aviation’s role in the state’s carbon footprint.

“People love sports,” Mikulina said. “Let’s not demonize it, but let’s use it as a catalyst to say, ‘How can we travel and enjoy this entertainment and this pastime without burdening our climate?’”

That idea has animated a growing movement. The International Olympic Committee has announced goals to reduce emissions related to the Olympic Games by 50% by 2030 and created webpages outlining wide-ranging climate action policies and reports on recent games. Academics at big football universities, meanwhile, have started studying how expanded, transcontinental conferences have increased emissions linked to major football games.

University of Hawaiʻi Athletic Director Matt Elliott wasn’t familiar with the work the IOC is doing but said it is something the UH athletics department might look into. More broadly, he said, assessing sustainability related to UH’s sports team travel “is … I think something that we can absolutely think about.”

“What are we doing to help protect this environment here?” he said. “What can we do as an athletics department?”

The work is unfolding as the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation struggles to comply with a legal settlement requiring the state to decarbonize transportation in Hawaiʻi entirely by 2045. Dealing with aviation has proven to be the biggest challenge, and the transportation department has said the technology doesn’t exist to meet the settlement requirement.

Impacts of Tourism Are Enormous

Sports events are far from the only contributor to aviation emissions in Hawaiʻi. In 2018, Civil Beat estimated the carbon footprint of travel to and from the islands by tourists using emissions calculators from a United Nations aviation agency and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, as well as 2017 travel data from the Hawaii Tourism Authority.

The analysis found that the 3.8 million visitors from the western U.S. alone that year produced emissions roughly equal to those produced by driving a car around the equator 225,000 times. Gov. Josh Green is now seeking to address tourism’s negative side effects with an additional hotel tax to go toward environmental mitigation.

Like tourism, sports are considered optional activities by many, compared to travel for work and family. Sports-related travel provides another window into carbon emissions, in part because of college football, which has captured the attention of sustainability researchers. Although all sports-related travel generates carbon emissions, football is the biggest, given the small army of players, coaches and staff that travel for games.

Formulas and studies offering insights have followed. Last year, Molly Russell and Paige Greenberg, two graduate students at the University of Michigan’s Center for Sustainability Systems, studied the carbon emissions of air travel by their popular college team, the Wolverines.

Motivated by the prospect of big television deals, USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington had just joined the Big 10 Conference, originally the exclusive domain of Midwest universities, joining relative newcomers such as Rutgers and Maryland to create a transcontinental, 18-team super-conference. A non-conference home game against the University of Texas piqued the grad students’ interest in air travel after a Michigan news site reported a parade of private jets landing at local airports.

They decided to tackle the question of what conference expansion meant for the planet, using a formula created by researchers at Arizona State University. A central question was how public policies designed to decrease carbon emissions jibed with having students fly all over the continent to play football.

“Institutions like the University of Michigan (U-M) are increasingly committed to sustainability,” they wrote, “raising questions about how to reconcile environmental goals with the realities of increased carbon emissions.”

They found that the conference’s geographic expansion would more than double emissions related to Michigan football games.

Solutions Include Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The University of Hawaiʻi doesn’t need to shift conferences to face this quandary because it’s always had to travel a long way to the continent, regardless of what conference it was in. While that has always been costly, Elliott doesn’t see distance and location as a disadvantage — especially when it comes to recruiting players, hosting games and being central to the community.

“The story is there’s a huge advantage to being here,” he said. “Students want to be here. We get to retain our local athletes. We can recruit students who want to come play in this special place.”

Hawaiʻi’s isolation also makes home games particularly special.

“Because we are isolated, because we are kind of in our own space, I think it brings people with this energy and passion for the university,” he said.

With that comes the inconvenient reality of a gigantic emissions impact. Using the formula created at Arizona State in consultation with the University of Michigan’s Russell, Civil Beat found that football teams and staff traveling to and from Hawaiʻi for games in 2025 will have produced an estimated 1.5 million kilograms of CO2. Mikulina pegs that to the amount of emissions produced by providing electricity to 400 Oʻahu homes in a year.

Mikulina says the point of the calculations isn’t to deride UH football but rather raise awareness as motivation for change. He points to the International Olympic Committee as an example.

The 2024 Paris Olympics were powered entirely with renewable energy, the IOC’s website devoted to event says. Where generators were needed, it relied on biofuel, hydrogen or batteries. Organizers used existing venues to cut construction-related emissions and low-carbon construction methods to build a new aquatics center. Bike lanes were built for visitors so they could ride carbon-free to venues. Athletes were ferried to competitions via electric, hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Air travel remains a major contributor to the International Olympic Committee’s corporate carbon footprint, accounting for about 61% of its emissions, which the IOC openly discusses on a website laying out its climate action plan.

Regardless of whether this amounts to greenwashing or significant change, Mikulina said, the IOC’s efforts are raising awareness.

“Everybody loves the Olympics,” he said. “And now people are thinking about the impact it has and the opportunities we have to reduce emissions.”

For now, airlines and policymakers are looking at lower carbon sustainable aviation fuel, essentially the jet equivalent of biodiesel, to replace traditional jet fuel. And the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation is calling for tax incentives to help refine more bio-jet fuel locally. The department also is looking at running airports more sustainably by adding more electric support vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations.

Hawaiʻi has made some big gains in reducing climate impacts in the electricity sector, he said. But concerning aviation, he said, “we’re on first down with the whole field in front of us.”",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2014/11/UH-UNLV-FOOTBALL2.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:22.814551

Following evidence that subsidised imports are causing material injury to UK biodiesel producers, the TRA’s Statement of Essential Facts sets out its intended final recommendation for a fixed duty measure, with proposed countervailing duties of between £257.80 and £303.56 per tonne.

Interested parties are invited to comment on the initial findings via the Trade Remedies Service by 19 December 2025.

Separately, the TRA has terminated its parallel investigation into dumped imports of HVO biodiesel from the USA due to a lack of significant evidence of dumping.

Notes to editors

Investigation period: 1 January to 31 December 2024; injury period: 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024.

The investigation, launched on 17 March 2025, covers HVO biodiesel—also known as renewable or green diesel.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biodiesel is a renewable fuel that can replace mineral diesel.

The product covered in the investigations includes: biodiesel (or paraffinic diesel fuel / gasoil) obtained from synthesis or hydrotreatment of oils and fats of non-fossil origin, in pure form or as included in a blend, originating in the United States of America (US). This biodiesel is commonly known as hydrotreated (hydrogenated) vegetable oil diesel (HVO), renewable diesel or green diesel. Synthetic paraffinic kerosene (also known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)) is excluded from this description of biodiesel.

Countervailing duties are one of three trade remedy tools used to address goods that are being unfairly subsidised by overseas governments and causing injury to UK industry.

Termination of investigation – the TRA will propose terminating a dumping or subsidy investigation if, at any stage during the investigation, we find that the dumping margin or subsidy amount for all relevant goods (cumulatively and per country) is below de minimis levels. We will publish a notice to explain why the investigation has been terminated and notify the Secretary of State and interested parties accordingly.

Following the verification and analysis of exporter data the TRA has determined that all three US exporters that took part in the case presented a negative dumping margin. Therefore, there was no significant evidence of dumping by US exporters Diamond Green Diesel LLC, St Bernard Renewables LLC, and Phillips 66.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:27.114654

These fuels are intended to decarbonise sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as maritime shipping and aviation. The planned 200 MW plant is expected to establish Oulu as the largest hub for synthetic fuel production in the Baltic Sea Region, based on the number of Power-to-X (PtX) projects currently in development.

Hege Økland, Managing Director of Hy2gen Nordic, said, “Hy2gen is very pleased to have secured a site for our project at the Port of Oulu. We would like to thank the City of Oulu and the Port of Oulu for choosing us as their partner in developing this area. We look forward to future collaboration in bringing our project to life.”

Hy2gen specialises in developing, financing, constructing, and operating facilities that produce Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs) and other PtX fuels for clients worldwide. Its portfolio includes renewable hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, and PtX derivatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF).

The company already has projects underway in Germany, France, Norway, and Canada. Its current pipeline includes 3.4 GW of projects in planning and construction, with an additional 15 GW in development. In 2023, Hy2gen acquired the Werlte facility in Germany, which at the time was the world’s largest operating power-to-e-methane plant. In spring 2025, CertifHy certified the facility as the first RFNBO e-methane producer in Germany, in line with EU regulations.

Oulu emerges as a hub for hydrogen derivativesMarko Kilpeläinen, Director of Urban Environment Services for the City of Oulu, stated, “With this announcement, Oulu now hosts more synthetic fuel production projects than any other city in the Baltic Sea Region.” Other companies that have announced preliminary plans for hydrogen and hydrogen derivative plants in the area include French company Verso Energy, German firms Energiequelle and ABO Energy, and Finnish companies P2X Solutions and Oulun Energia.

Singal’s portfolio includes renewable energy initiatives tied to Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction, helping to rebuild energy independence through decentralized generation and smart-grid technologies.
Technologically, the mix of methanol-to-jet fuel, gasification, and eSAF represents a pragmatic evolution of renewable energy, one that integrates circular-economy principles.
Such integration could also help stabilize energy markets in regions where volatility has been the norm.
In Africa, for instance, renewable infrastructure tied to local employment and capacity-building creates a buffer against political instability.","Where others see fragmented markets and regulatory complexity, Singal sees opportunity. His strategy involves both technological and geographical diversification. In doing so, this creates a network of renewable assets tailored to the resources and realities of each region. While much of the industry remains fixated on solar, wind, and hydrogen, Singal is pivoting toward more commercially resilient and politically viable alternatives, including methanol and methanol-to-jet fuels via gasification, eSAF (electrically powered sustainable aviation fuel) plants, HEFA-based SAF, and renewable diesel, as well as nuclear power. These are being coupled with digital infrastructure projects such as energy-efficient data centers and blockchain-based tokenization to enhance transparency and liquidity across the global energy trade.

“Governments and corporations are rethinking how they approach renewables. You can’t rely on one or two technologies and expect to solve global energy demand. What we’re building is a framework that works across geographies and is scalable, flexible, and financially sustainable.” Explained Singal.

That framework is already taking shape. Singal’s portfolio includes renewable energy initiatives tied to Ukraine’s post-war reconstruction, helping to rebuild energy independence through decentralized generation and smart-grid technologies. In Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Azerbaijan, his teams are working with local partners to introduce next-generation fuels that support industrial decarbonization and reduce reliance on imported hydrocarbons. In the Middle East, projects in Dubai and Qatar complement government-led diversification programs by offering scalable, private-sector solutions. Meanwhile, in the United States, development is advancing in Texas, Louisiana, and California; the latter of which is home to a fire-forest feedstock gasification plant that converts forest waste into clean energy, transforming an environmental hazard into a valuable resource.

Each initiative is designed to operate independently yet contribute to a unified global ecosystem. Financing structures often tie into export-import frameworks, enabling projects to move capital efficiently between regions. The inclusion of tokenization models that digitize project assets and energy credits aims to make the traditionally slow-moving energy sector more transparent and accessible to global investors.

Africa remains a cornerstone of this strategy. Long seen as the next frontier for renewables, the continent’s potential is finally aligning with investor interest. There has already been large-scale HEFA-based SAF and renewable diesel production in Ethiopia and South Africa. In Ethiopia, local feedstocks such as castor oil and Ethiopian mustard are being explored for conversion into sustainable fuels. At the same time, South Africa’s existing Fischer-Tropsch infrastructure provides an ideal foundation for processing related feedstocks. The Congo, meanwhile, represents a region where renewable projects could deliver both immediate and long-term benefits, from job creation to regional stability.

“The key is localization. Africa has the resources and the talent. What it needs are frameworks that connect local potential with global markets, and that’s what we’re helping to create.” Says Singal.

This approach reflects a growing recognition that the energy transition cannot rely solely on public funding or top-down policy. Many governments, particularly in emerging markets, lack the infrastructure or capital to scale renewables at the necessary pace. By introducing private investment backed by export-import financing and international partnerships, Singal’s model bridges the gap between national ambition and financial reality.

Technologically, the mix of methanol-to-jet fuel, gasification, and eSAF represents a pragmatic evolution of renewable energy, one that integrates circular-economy principles. Methanol-to-jet fuels and HEFA pathways utilize waste biomass and oils, reducing lifecycle emissions while providing a stable, energy-dense alternative to fossil fuels. Nuclear power, often overlooked in short-term political cycles, offers baseload stability critical to balancing intermittent renewables. Together, they form a hybrid energy architecture capable of supporting everything from regional grids to digital infrastructure like data centers, which are increasingly energy-intensive.

“This isn’t just about replacing fossil fuels. It’s about designing an entire ecosystem that works technically, financially, and environmentally. That means integrating generation, financing, and technology under one umbrella.” Added Singal.

Such integration could also help stabilize energy markets in regions where volatility has been the norm. In Africa, for instance, renewable infrastructure tied to local employment and capacity-building creates a buffer against political instability. In Eastern Europe, decentralized grids and hybrid systems can protect national energy supplies from disruption. And in the U.S., a new generation of decentralized projects could make clean power more resilient to natural disasters and grid congestion.

Beyond the technical elements, Singal’s initiatives carry broader geopolitical significance. Energy has always been a tool of influence, so by establishing renewable and nuclear projects that link continents, private investors are increasingly shaping the future of global power, both literally and figuratively.

“If we’re going to hit Net-Zero targets, we need collaboration, not competition between regions. HEFA-based SAF, renewable diesel, methanol, and eSAF can all play a part. Kenya Airways recently flew a 50% locally sourced SAF blend, so that’s proof it can be done. The challenge now is scaling that success across continents.” Concluded SIngal.

From Africa’s renewable corridors to the industrial hubs of Eastern Europe, Singal’s global portfolio illustrates the next phase of the energy transition. It is no longer defined by single technologies, but by systems thinking. It’s a model where private capital, public policy, and innovation align. It’s also a model where the future of energy is being rewritten, one region at a time.

A couple months after the election, Houston started talking more explicitly about his vision for natural resource development, and a flurry of government action ensued.
The province needs a stronger economy, his refrain goes, to pay for things like schools, housing and health care.
Has health care been sidelined?
Katherine Fierlbeck, the McCulloch professor of political science at Dalhousie University, gives the PC government ongoing credit for its commitment to health care in its first term.","In the 12 months since the Houston government won its second mandate, it’s made progress or fully delivered on many of the promises made during last fall’s election campaign.

The platform suggested the government would put its heft into making life more affordable, with attention also going to housing and health care. It gave nods to soaring rates of violence in schools and gridlock traffic in the capital region.

The Progressive Conservative government has indeed followed through, to varying degrees, with promises related to all those issues. But the focus of the government’s second term has been on natural resource development, which was given only a vague reference in the campaign platform.

First, what’s been delivered. In spring 2025 Nova Scotia saw a one-point cut to provincial sales tax, an increase to the basic personal amount for income tax and a one-point cut to the small business tax rate.

Tax cuts might be popular among voters, but the resulting revenue losses are probably to the chagrin of the Finance Department, which is now grappling with a $1.2-billion deficit. As it works on next year’s budget, the department has already directed departments to slow down hiring and explore some potential cuts.

The PC government also delivered free shingles vaccines for people 65 and older, a two-step increase to the minimum wage (bringing it to $16.50 this fall), and did away with bridge tolls and parking fees for hospital patients and visitors.

Another checkmark goes beside the promise to make more vacant public land available for affordable housing, though it’s a case that shows a promise kept doesn’t always equate to instant gratification or impact.

Yes, the PCs offered up two new pieces of land in the past year. No, there aren’t any new housing units to show for it. The land-for-housing program started in 2021 and land added in the government’s first term has so far resulted in a total of 18 new units, with nine of them renting below market rates.

For people now living in those units, the program likely seems worthwhile, but overall it would be hard to call it a runaway success. And given how acutely some people are still feeling the housing crisis, some might have expected more from the PC platform on housing.

The only other housing promise was to help first-time homebuyers to make a smaller down payment. That hasn't yet happened, although the province says ""news will be coming very soon"" about the program.

Another pledge that received mixed reviews was free hospital parking. While it wouldn't be a problem in smaller communities, in Halifax it underscored a shortage of parking spaces around hospitals and spurred staff complaints about being squeezed out of lots and parkades at their workplaces.

Other promises show signs of progress, or the government at least says it intends to follow through. See the full list below.

The PCs are, after all, just one year into a mandate that could last as long as four, so they still have time to make good on all their pledges, even if there’s no sign of movement yet.

The big pivot

One section of the election platform talks about strengthening the economy through natural resource development, but it didn’t garner much attention during the campaign. That’s probably partly because the party didn’t give it the platform of a stand-alone announcement — as it did with items such as a menopause centre of excellence and nixing bridge tolls — and partly because there were no concrete promises.

“We will realize the potential of our natural resources to produce the energy of tomorrow,” one campaign document said. “We are focusing on building the economy for the long term by taking advantage of our natural resources.”

Campaign materials referred to the province’s critical mineral potential, and the possibility of kick-starting local hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel industries.

Premier Tim Houston has said it wasn’t yet apparent at campaign time how necessary the push for resource development would be. But a year on, it’s now clear this work is the fulcrum of this mandate.

A couple months after the election, Houston started talking more explicitly about his vision for natural resource development, and a flurry of government action ensued.

The government lifted restrictions on fracking and uranium exploration and mining, streamlined environmental assessment and industrial permitting processes, opened a new call for offshore oil and gas exploration, and crafted an ambitious plan for offshore wind development — the list goes on.

Many of those actions have faced significant pushback over fears about environmental protection and human health, but Houston has been insistent that anything pursued will be done safely. It’s necessary, he says, to find new revenue streams as population growth and the economic boom of the past few years slows.

The province needs a stronger economy, his refrain goes, to pay for things like schools, housing and health care.

Has health care been sidelined?

The issue that helped drive the Tories into government in the first place may appear to have taken a back seat this time around. Health-related promises are fewer than they were in 2021, and even among the new promises, one is not directly related to health care (free parking) and another is already behind schedule (legislation for independent evaluations of the health authority was supposed to be tabled by earlier this year).

But sitting in the back seat isn’t the same as stopping or being left behind.

Katherine Fierlbeck, the McCulloch professor of political science at Dalhousie University, gives the PC government ongoing credit for its commitment to health care in its first term.

“It takes some time to be able to see the net effect of whether this is going to work well or not,” she said.

Fierlbeck, who studies health policy, said meaningful change in health care requires governments to “pump the money in,” which could be more challenging to do in the face of a sizable deficit and a contraction of money coming in. But momentum could carry the system forward for some time, she added.

How long things can coast before the big bet on natural resources will have to prove its worth — that might be a subject for the next election.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/0bd00902-84d6-415a-8bb9-14bf5377bff7,1764274669304/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C278%2C5343%2C3005%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-28 08:57:02.066235

Airbus' sustainability targets

Airbus has established sustainability targets that have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as outlined in its 2025 Pioneering Sustainable Aviation report.

Goals include a 63% reduction in its Scope 1 and 2 absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and the neutralisation of any residual emissions. Furthermore, Airbus aims to decrease its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% by 2035, using 2015 as a baseline year.

Safety remains a primary focus in its operations for its employees, products and services. Airbus's aircraft, helicopters and satellites are built to meet stringent regulatory standards with safety integrated into the design, testing and production phases.

Airbus is actively contributing to the wider aerospace industry's long-term objective of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.

Guillaume Faury, CEO at Airbus, says: “This means expanding production of these new, fuel-efficient aircraft to help airlines accelerate the renewal of their fleets.

He adds: “Airbus is advocating for and investing in sustainable aviation fuels, which are critical to making progress in reducing emissions today. Our core principles of safety, quality, integrity, compliance and security will guide us in all we do.”

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and the energy transition

A key component of Airbus's strategy is its decarbonisation roadmap, designed to support the energy transition in aviation. Airbus is focused on increasing the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) throughout the sector.

Currently, its aircraft can operate on a blend of up to 50% SAF and conventional fuel. Airbus has set a target for all its aircraft and helicopters to be capable of flying with 100% SAF by 2030.

The use of SAF could lead to a potential reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional kerosene, according to the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

To advance this goal, Airbus is collaborating with fuel producers, airlines, governments and researchers to accelerate SAF production and improve its availability on a global scale.

A circular economy approach to aircraft manufacturing

Airbus incorporates a lifecycle approach in its manufacturing process, designing its products for longevity with a lifespan intended to exceed 20 years. Airbus seeks to minimise environmental impacts across its operations and supply chains.

It has been working on enhancing supply chain resilience from the sourcing of materials through to the end-of-life management of its products.

A primary objective for Airbus is to reduce waste and the consumption of raw materials, thereby extending the lifespan of its services and products. Airbus also encourages its customers and partners to adopt similar circular economy principles.

Specific targets include a 20% reduction in waste collection and achieving 0% landfilling and incineration without energy recovery by 2030 compared to 2015 levels.

Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus, says: “We want to do business in a way that benefits society as a whole.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b8ca38c972e9f9d52119202571a93dac:d0b3b4ad50bd7063173a0b6157e2346a/airbus-beluga-plane.JPG.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:57:06.489555

The terminal and airfield run on power generated by more than 760,000 solar panels, supported by one of the world’s largest off-grid battery systems.

Red Sea Global, the airport’s developer, has said the airport “will be powered using renewable energy alone,” part of its plan for the entire destination to operate on 100% renewable electricity.

It is also the first airport in the Kingdom to supply 35% sustainable aviation fuel, with the operator stating the blend “reduces the emissions produced by each aircraft… by up to 35%.”

Dubai’s solar build-out

In the UAE, Dubai Airports has begun installing nearly 63,000 solar panels across both DXB and DWC in what it called “the world’s largest rooftop solar installation project at an airport.”

The system, with a capacity of 39 MWp, is expected to generate more than 60,000 MWh annually. Dubai Airports says this will meet 6.5% of DXB’s power demand and 20% of DWC’s needs, cutting 23,000 tonnes of CO₂ a year.

Chief executive Paul Griffiths said the effort is about “embedding sustainability into the core of everything we do,” and reducing the hub’s long-term energy dependency.

The model follows Terminal 2’s earlier 5 MW solar installation, which already reduces the building’s grid electricity use by around 29%.

Car parks as power plants in Abu Dhabi

Abu Dhabi has taken a more decentralised approach. At Zayed International Airport’s new terminal, a solar-powered car park uses 7,542 panels generating 3 MW of capacity.

The installation supplies the parking structure and exports excess power to the terminal, saving around 5,300 tonnes of CO₂ annually.

Abu Dhabi Airports CEO Shareef Al Hashmi said the new terminal was designed with “technology which enables sustainability, protects the environment, and creates a cleaner, greener… building.”

The result is an airport where shaded parking doubles as distributed generation infrastructure.

Saudi Arabia’s off-grid test case

Red Sea International is even more ambitious. The entire airport is designed to operate off the national grid, supported by large-scale solar farms and battery storage.

The wider destination is expected to avoid up to 600,000 tonnes of CO₂-equivalent emissions each year once operational.

The airport’s renewable-first model shows what a new build can achieve when energy is treated as central infrastructure rather than a utility bill.

Airlines push the fuel transition

While airports build electricity capacity, Gulf airlines are tackling the fuel challenge.

Emirates has conducted several high-profile demonstration flights using 100% SAF in one engine, including a Boeing 777-300ER and an A380.

After the first 777 demo flight, Emirates COO Adel Al Redha called it “a milestone moment… and a positive step for our industry,” highlighting the need to cut aviation’s carbon footprint.

Industry-wide, SAF production remains small. IATA estimates global SAF output could reach 2 million tonnes in 2025, still less than 1% of expected airline fuel demand.

That gap illustrates why airports capable of hosting renewable generation, storage and SAF supply will become critical nodes in aviation’s energy transition.

Why the Gulf is positioned to lead

The Gulf has a combination of advantages that few regions can match. Its solar resources rank among the strongest in the world, and both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have government mandates that push renewable deployment at scale.

Many of the region’s flagship megaprojects are being built from scratch, allowing energy systems to be designed around clean power from day one rather than retrofitted later.

Large areas of available land make it feasible to install solar fields, battery storage and district-scale utilities, while airports themselves are increasingly planned as components of integrated city districts rather than stand-alone transport hubs.

Saudi Arabia aims to add 130 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2030, and the UAE’s Energy Strategy 2050 targets a 50% clean-energy share in the national mix, creating a policy environment in which airport-level generation becomes a natural extension of wider national goals.

At destinations such as Amaala, entire utility networks, from energy and water to cooling, waste and airport systems, are being developed as one unified platform, positioning the airport as an active contributor to a clean-energy ecosystem rather than a passive consumer of power.

Pilot projects and operating models

Most Gulf airports are still early in the journey. Dubai’s rooftop programme and Abu Dhabi’s solar car park cover only part of each hub’s needs. But the direction is unmistakable.

As Abu Dhabi’s leadership put it, “net zero development has been a central ethos” in terminal design, a phrase now repeated across the region.

Red Sea International shows what a fully renewable airport can look like. Dubai shows how the biggest hubs can retrofit at scale.

Together they point to a future in which Gulf airports act not only as passengers’ gateways but as energy producers, storage sites and fuel hubs, infrastructure that powers both the grid and the aircraft it serves.

Why Should You Know About Australia Biofuel Market?
In short: the biofuel market is not just about fuel — it’s about energy security, sustainable agriculture, emissions reduction, industrial transformation and long-term value creation.","Australia’s biofuel market is entering a period of strong expansion as demand grows for sustainable, lower-carbon fuel alternatives in transport, industry and energy sectors. The Australia biofuel market size reached USD 2.79 billion in 2024, and is projected to grow to USD 9.29 billion by 2033, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% during 2025–2033.

This growth underscores how biofuels — including biodiesel, bioethanol and emerging advanced biofuels — are becoming central to Australia’s low-carbon fuel strategy, leveraging local feedstocks, regulatory support, and rising environmental awareness.

Why the Market Is Growing So Rapidly

Several key forces are fueling the rapid expansion of the biofuel market in Australia:

Strong Policy Support & Regulatory Mandates for Renewable Fuels

One of the primary drivers is government regulations and blending mandates that require or incentivize the use of bioethanol and biodiesel blends in transport fuels. These mandates create a consistent baseline demand for biofuels, encouraging investment in production capacity and supply infrastructure.

Moreover, national and state-level renewable energy and emissions-reduction targets are pushing stakeholders to adopt cleaner fuel options. This regulatory push helps make biofuels economically viable, even when competing with traditional fossil fuels.

Availability & Diversification of Feedstock — Agricultural Residues, Oilseeds, Waste Oils

Australia benefits from a diverse and abundant feedstock base: oilseeds (such as canola), sugar-based residues, used cooking oil, tallow, and potential non-food crops like Pongamia for advanced biofuels.

Recent efforts to develop renewable feedstock sources — including plantation of biofuel-suitable crops and recycling of waste oils — are helping scale production sustainably, reduce raw-material costs, and strengthen supply security.

Rising Demand for Cleaner Transport & Energy Security

As awareness of climate change grows, consumers, businesses and governments are increasingly open to cleaner, greener energy. Biofuels offer a drop-in alternative to conventional petrol and diesel — usable in existing internal-combustion engines — making transitions easier.

Additionally, for sectors that are harder to electrify (heavy transport, industrial vehicles, aviation, agriculture), biofuels present an immediately deployable low-carbon solution. This demand helps fuel investments and infrastructure expansion for biofuel production and distribution.

Technological Advances & Development of Advanced Biofuels

The biofuel industry in Australia is gradually evolving beyond first-generation bioethanol and biodiesel. There's increasing interest in advanced biofuels — including renewable diesel, waste-to-fuel conversions, and next-gen feedstocks like Pongamia.

New production processes, improved yields, waste-derived feedstock utilisation and sustainability-linked innovations are making biofuels more cost-effective and scalable, attracting greater investment and accelerating adoption.

What the Opportunities Are

The expanding Australia biofuel market offers several distinct opportunities for producers, investors, supply-chain players, agricultural stakeholders, and policy-makers:

1. Scale-up of Biodiesel & Bioethanol Production Capacity

With demand growing, there is room for expanding existing refineries and establishing new plants — especially those leveraging local feedstock (oilseeds, waste oils, agricultural residues). Producers focusing on efficient, sustainable operations can capture significant market share.

2. Advanced & Second-Generation Biofuels Development

Investments into advanced biofuels — using non-food oilseed crops (e.g., Pongamia), waste biomass, or waste oils — offer long-term potential. These fuels, especially renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), can cater to sectors that are hard to electrify, offering high-margin opportunities.

3. Feedstock Supply Chain & Agricultural Integration

Farmers, agri-commodity companies, waste-oil recyclers and feedstock-suppliers can benefit from increased demand. Cultivating oilseed crops or collecting and processing used cooking oil/waste fats for biofuel feedstock creates new revenue streams for rural and agricultural communities.

4. Infrastructure & Distribution Network Expansion

As demand rises, so does the need for blending, storage, transport, distribution — including refineries, blending terminals, logistics, and fuel-station support. Infrastructure investors and logistics providers have opportunities to build and upgrade networks to support scaled biofuel distribution.

5. Low-Carbon Transport & Heavy-Duty Sector Adoption

Biofuel producers and distributors can target heavy-duty transport, agriculture equipment, marine, aviation and industrial applications — where electrification is difficult and biofuels offer immediate decarbonization.

6. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) & Export-Ready Biofuel Supply

As global demand for sustainable aviation fuel grows, Australia’s biofuel sector — particularly those producing renewable diesel or SAF-ready feedstock — is well positioned to serve export markets, especially in Asia-Pacific.

Recent News & Developments in Australia Biofuel Market

• June 2025: A new report highlighted that biofuel blending mandates and supportive regulatory reforms have increased investor interest and pipeline projects for biodiesel and ethanol capacity expansion across Australia — reinforcing long-term demand structure.

• August 2025: Several agricultural and energy-sector stakeholders announced pilot programmes cultivating non-food oilseed crops (like Pongamia) for renewable diesel feedstock — marking a shift toward sustainable, locally grown biofuel inputs and reducing reliance on imported oilseeds.

Each item and material every bit as effective and reliable as their fossil-based alternatives. Each of them circular and climate-friendly by design.

And what if we could do all that while supporting rural communities, delivering quality jobs and green growth, and reducing our carbon footprint at the same time?

It’s much closer than you might have thought. Welcome to the bioeconomy — an innovative solution to a fossil-based problem that we quickly need to leave behind.

In 2023, the EU bioeconomy generated €863 billion, representing 5% of EU GDP and supporting over 17 million jobs. But it has the potential to be so much more.

The EU is well-positioned to lead the global bioeconomy: powered by science and innovation, based on our own natural resources and raw materials, and supported by our single market.

More than two-thirds of EU member states have committed to national bioeconomy strategies. Ireland has a Bioeconomy Action Plan and the National Development Plan also highlights the sector’s potential. We want to support more breakthroughs to make the leap from innovation to growth.

The EU’s new Bioeconomy Strategy aims to supercharge this growth. We will work with farmers, foresters and other small businesses to bridge the gap from lab to market and turn ideas into industrial reality.

The strategy will ensure a robust financial ecosystem, combining public and private investment. It will also provide regulatory clarity; delivering simple, coherent rules that speed up approvals for innovative solutions.

Europe needs to nurture those bio-based sectors with the greatest potential for economic expansion and environmental benefit. But this growth must be guided by a firm commitment to sustainability.

Europe’s forests, soils and other ecosystems need to be managed wisely, and within ecological limits. We have one eye on green growth and the other on a sustainable future, and that means the bioeconomy must combat biodiversity loss and pollution.

That also requires a strong focus on circularity and better use of leftover biomass like organic waste or agricultural residues such as cereal straw or sawdust. Instead of being dumped, these can fertilise our crops, feed our animals or form the basis for biomaterials. We can turn waste into wealth and help Europe to produce more value with fewer primary resources.

The bioeconomy can boost European prosperity and sharpen our competitive edge. And it will reduce our reliance on vulnerable global supply chains and on other countries for raw materials.

I see it as a defining pillar of the European project to build strategic autonomy and tackle climate change; a society-wide investment in our rural communities and regions, in our environment and ecosystems, and most of all, in our future.

Think about it as you go about your day, surrounded by countless fossil-based products. And imagine a cleaner, more sustainable, more resilient Europe.",https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9753/4876659_11_seoimageog_XAV_8769_1_.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 21:56:10.801191

Q & A Highlights

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with PSKOF.

Is PSKOF fairly valued? Test your thesis with our free DCF calculator.

Q: What are Orlen's plans for Ukraine in terms of gas and crude oil, and will there be any strategic adjustments or organizational restructuring? A: We are selling gas to Ukraine and preparing to purchase crude from there, though it involves third-party countries like Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The European Union's financing for Ukraine's gas purchases hasn't started yet, but Polish companies are preparing to participate. Our strategy will be reviewed next year, with adjustments expected by mid-2026. Organizational restructuring is ongoing, with procedural barriers being addressed, and we aim to complete this by the first quarter of 2026. (Unidentified Company Representative)

Q: Can you explain the reasons behind the increase in refining margins and the status of agreements with Naftogaz? A: Several factors influence refining margins, including the supply of Russian fuels and the destruction of Ukrainian production units. The agreement with Naftogaz was postponed due to security concerns but will be signed soon. Regarding potential acquisitions of Lukoil assets in Europe, it's too early to comment as we await Lukoil's approach to the process. (Unidentified Company Representative)

Q: What is Orlen's approach to distribution tariffs in electricity, and how might they compare to this year's tariffs? A: Discussions are ongoing, and while I can't provide specifics beyond what the Minister of Energy has stated, energy transition requires expanding and upgrading the distribution network. Any decrease in working capital affects our CapEx projects, and we remain flexible in our approach to regulations. (Maciej Markiewicz, Bloomberg)

Q: Why did Orlen not meet its CapEx target this year, and what is the target for 2026? A: We missed the target by about PLN 2 billion due to lower spending in upstream and the reallocation of projects. The lease of gas carriers also shifted some CapEx to 2026. Our strategy outlines higher ambitions for 2026, so we expect CapEx to increase compared to 2025. (Unidentified Company Representative)

Q: What is the status of the arbitration processes with Venture Global and Gazprom? A: The Venture Global arbitration is ongoing, with a positive outlook following BP's recent success. We expect the first stage of this process to conclude by late 2026. The Gazprom process is complex, involving mutual claims, and details are available on our website. Supplies under the Venture Global contract have started, with full delivery expected by 2027. (Unidentified Company Representative)

Calgary, Alberta, Nov 27, 2025 –TheNewswire - Expander Energy Inc. (“Expander”) ispleased to announce that a letter of intent has been signed with EastFraser Fiber Co. Ltd. (“EastFraser”) to secure the required biomassfeedstock and land for the Mackenzie Biofuel Project, a proposed BiomassElectrolysis to Liquids (BETL®) Bio-Synfuel facility in Mackenzie,British Columbia (BC).

BETL is an innovative, patented and patent pendingprocess for making low carbon bio-synthetic fuels developed byCanadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) and Expander which leveragesExpander’s technology for biomass gasification, bio-synthetic fuelproduction, and electrolysis technology. The resulting fuel will becomprised entirely of carbon sourced from biogenic (atmospheric)sources and is expected to have very low life cycle carbonintensity.

The proposed facility will utilize the BETL®technology to convert 84,000 dry tonnes per year of forestry woodwaste into 30 million litersper year of renewable diesel, renewable naphthaand bio-wax with life cycle carbon intensity of the fuel to levels80% lower than fossilequivalents (as low as 14 gCO2e/MJ using the BC Low Carbon FuelsBranch (BCLCFS) GHGenius LCA model). The biofuel production isintended to displace fossil derived fuels (e.g., diesel, aviationfuel) and could result in a net avoidance of up to 90,000 tonnes of carbon dioxideannually. The 100km area surrounding Mackenziehas significant fiber resources. Expander will assess the potentialto scale the Mackenzie Biofuel Project to process a total of 336,000tonnes of dry biomass per year to produce 120 million litres per year Bio-Synfuelproduction and net avoidance of 360,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide peryear.

Growing global demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel(SAF) makes the addition of Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT- SPK)production to the facility commercially appealing. Expander iscurrently working with key strategic commercial partners from theaviation industry to assess initial market interest in 18 million liters/year of SAF, with potential opportunity to expand SAF to 72 millionliters/year production. The Mackenzie Biofuel Project will become thefirst of kind low carbon clean fuel production in British Columbia andCanada using forestry wood waste biomass (cellulose). This facility could meet much of the short-term SAF targetfor British Columbia.

Expander is also very pleased to announce thatcommunity and Indigenous leaders / organizations have provided theirsupport for the MackenzieBiofuel Project. The McLeod Lake Indian Band(“MLIB”) and the District of Mackenzie (“Mackenzie”) haveprovided letters of support for further development of theproject.

The Mackenzie Biofuel Project is one of the three projects

identified in the feasibility studycompleted earlier this year. Expander aims to continue the developmentof the project with the goal to secure funding early in 2026, withproduction by 2029. Natural Resources Canada through the Clean FuelsFund program supported the completion of a feasibility study thathelped to identify several prospect locations across Canada, one ofwhich was this Mackenzie site. The Clean Fuels Fund has alsosupported the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study that isexpected to be complete in early 2026 and will result in acomprehensive facility design, cost, schedule and business plan forthe Mackenzie BiofuelProject.

The completed facility will be a global showcase fornext generation biomass based E-fuel production.

“We are thrilled to announce significant progress onthe Mackenzie Biofuels Project. Over the past 18 months, ourdevelopment team has worked tirelessly, and we are on track tocomplete the fully funded $8 million FEED study by Q1 2026. With landand feedstock secured, and strong support from key community andIndigenous leaders, we are now able to accelerate the project.” saidSteve Kresnyak, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer,Expander Energy Inc. “In addition, Expander Energy Inc. is activelyengaging with strategic partners to secure project funding. We lookforward to sharing more details as these partnerships are finalized,marking another step toward delivering price competitive Biomass basedE-fuels for Industry and Aviation”

“It is truly exciting to see the BETL® Bio-Synfuelprocess progress to this stage. Achieving this new supply agreementbrings the technology another step closer towards the production ofeconomical, ready-to-deploy, renewable fuels,” commented Dr. StephenBushby, CNL’s Vice-President of Science and Technology. “Thisproject leverages Canada’s expertise and capabilities in hydrogenand hydrogen isotopes – originally built in support of the nuclearsector, to advance bold, innovative ideas towards deployment. Thisdemonstrates the true spirit of collaboration, working together toovercome challenges and find solutions.”

“East Fraser Fiber sees the production of Biomass based E-fuels as

an important compliment to existing commercial operations in the

Mackenzie BC area, with the potential for additional facilities at

other Parallel Lumber Group facilities in Canada and the USA.” Said

Ante Cirko – Vice President - East Fraser Fiber Co. Ltd.

“The MacLeod Lake Indian Band is

committed to environmentally responsible development of natural

resources within our traditional lands that are consistent with the

values of the Tse’khene people and provide significant economic

opportunities in the region for decades to come.” Said Chief Harley

Chingee – MacLeod Lake Indian Band

“The District of Mackenzie is thrilled to welcome a

Biomass Electrolysis to Liquids Plant to our community. The past few

years have been extremely challenging as residents watched our tax

base shrink and community members suffer job losses. The Mackenzie

Bio-Synfuels facility is a huge step forward in promoting economic

growth for our community and the region. Their advanced proven

technology will also provide additional support to our forest industry

with their utilization of forest harvesting residuals. We are

excited our community will be a participant in this sustainable

solution that will reduce use of fossil fuels, while removing

“wildfire fuels” from the forests surrounding Mackenzie.” said

Mayor Joan Atkinson – District of Mackenzie

« Les biocarburants représentent les deux tiers de la solution de décarbonation de l’aérien à l’horizon 2050 »

Selon TotalEnergies, à peine 0,7 % de SAF est actuellement incorporé sur le marché alors que la réglementation européenne appelle à 10 % d’incorporation à l’horizon 2030. Et la « déclaration de Toulouse », en février 2022, engage 42 États, dont la France, à la neutralité carbone en 2050.

Le Béarn à la pointe

« Le SAF représente les deux tiers de la solution de décarbonation de l’aérien à l’horizon 2050 », appuie Antoine Jaeglé. Et le Béarn, comme la France, sont loin d’être en retard dans cet enjeu d’avenir de l’aviation. « Décarboner l’activité est notre priorité numéro 1 », affiche Nicolas Jeuland, de Safran. La R & D de l’industriel œuvre à la construction de moteurs capables de faire voler des engins avec 100 % de biocarburants.

Déjà, plusieurs de ses moteurs sont certifiés pour une intégration de 50 % de SAF et Nicolas Jeuland annonce le 100 % pour la fin de la décennie. Parallèlement, le bassin de Lacq s’apprête à accueillir la production de biocarburants pour avion avec le projet BioTjet porté par Elyse Energy. L’ambition est de produire du biokérozène à partir de biomasse composée de résidus issus majoritairement de la sylviculture locale et de déchets de bois en fin de vie. Il combine la production issue de biomasse avec l’injection d’hydrogène bas-carbone pour optimiser le rendement matière.

Du biocarburant à Lacq en 2030

« Nous allons déposer notre demande d’autorisation environnementale dans les jours à venir », a confié au salon GAD son cofondateur, Benoît Decourt, qui espère voir la production démarrer en 2030. Elyse Energy présentera d’ailleurs, ce vendredi, l’étude d’impacts sociaux économiques de son projet E-CHO à Pau. Pascal Clee, directeur du programme aviation chez le constructeur bigourdan Daher, souligne l’enjeu du prix des SAF dans leur développement.

The move follows the revival of a previously grounded A380 – number eight – to meet rising passenger needs across this busy route. Instead of just economy seating, flyers now get everything Etihad’s high-end service offers: roomy cabins or even private living areas known as The Residence. With these upgrades, trips to Japan become way more comfortable and attractive for those crossing continents as well as connect the two economic hubs.

What’s pulling people to Tokyo?

The decision to deploy the A380 to Tokyo highlights the strong customer interest in ease of travel between Abu Dhabi and Japan.

As Arik De, Chief Revenue and Commercial Officer at Etihad Airways, noted:

“We’ve seen strong demand from customers for more seats to Japan, and the A380 allows us to deliver that. The aircraft is particularly well-suited to this route, given the importance of business travel between the UAE and Japan, two nations with deep economic and cultural ties.”

This step increases room while making Abu Dhabi a go-to pick for Japanese travelers checking out the UAE’s main city.

Since Japan keeps drawing both vacationers and professionals who fly with Etihad, launching this flight shows the carrier plans to stay active there for good.

Inside the A380: What Travelers Can Expect

Etihad’s A380 delivers top-tier travel in every cabin, built for ease during the nearly 10-hour trip.

First Class Apartments: Nine cozy cabins with fancy dish sets, plus a comfy leather seat turning into a full-size flat bed. Each comes with its own makeup area, while guests get special entry to a private wash space.

Business Studios: 70 personal spots upstairs, each near The Lobby – your go-to lounge with service and drinks when you need a break. Keep online using solid Wi-Fi coverage.

Economy Class: A cozy cabin offering 68 seats with added legroom – four inches wider or 337 Smart seats featuring adjustable headrests plus big cushions so you can relax easier.

The Residence: It is the top choice – three rooms maxed for two people, like a living space plus a sleep area, then your own washroom with a shower way up at 40K feet. Skip the menu – you pick what you want to eat; there’s bubbly, fancy fish eggs, maybe morning meals brought right to your bed, all handled by staff just for you.

Aviation fans or those after comfort, this design makes flying the best part of traveling. Whether you love planes or fancy perks, this plane makes soaring through air feels like checking into your hotel.

Route Details and Schedule

The A380 is flying every day, just right for busy summer trips. You can reserve seats today, adding to Etihad’s current big plane routes that hit London, Paris, then Toronto, also Singapore.

This timetable gives workers and holiday-goers smooth links, while leaving plenty of hours to check out both spots.

Broader Impacts for Aviation

This A380 rollout reflects strong ties between the UAE and Japan, where extra seats may boost business trips along with commerce.

The hope seems to be that the flight upgrade can lift tourist numbers, convincing more travelers to Japan to make the stop over in Abu Dhabi while helping locals reach Tokyo easier.

Still, as airlines lean toward greener planes, doubts remain about using such a big jet on such a long flight, running a bigger engine is not cheap and this could put Etihad at a disadvantage versus rivals like Emirates or Qatar Airways across key Asia-Middle East routes. However, with rising tensions between Japan and China bringing a halt to popular Chinese airlines operating their routes to Japan, Etihad’s new route may be coming just at the right time to pick up a few passengers.

“Data centers, for example, require massive amounts of energy and water—and the Northeast faces water scarcity.","Renowned worldwide for its leadership in renewable energy, Brazil now generates more electricity than it consumes. Even so, it continues to struggle to attract the “powershoring” investments sought by energy-intensive industries aiming to clean up their carbon footprint.

According to industry specialists, the country’s privileged position is also at risk. The Brazilian electricity sector faces mounting pressure from subsidies for renewable generation, which not only raise energy costs but also intensify the need for mandatory production cuts at existing plants—known in the sector as curtailments.

A survey by Volt Robotics shows that 5,900 GWh of wind and solar energy went ungenerated in October, equivalent to 37% of the capacity of these farms. Generator losses for the year have reached R$5.4 billion.

Despite this, Casa dos Ventos, Omnia, and Pátria announced earlier this month a R$50 billion data center project in Pecém (Ceará) to serve ByteDance, owner of TikTok. Other global tech giants—including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon—have also been expanding investments in the country to meet their energy demand, drawn by its clean-energy potential. According to Brasscom, Brazil’s current data center capacity of roughly 800 megawatts could triple under Redata, the federal government’s incentive program launched in September.

The attraction goes beyond the surge in artificial intelligence. Entire sectors facing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint view Brazil as an opportunity to “green” their operations. The steel industry alone accounts for 7% to 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to World Steel. Aluminum (2%), cement (7%-8%), and fertilizers (5%) are also among the energy-intensive sectors that could benefit. Emerging industries—green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and green methanol—could support the decarbonization of aviation and shipping, which account for 2.5% and 3% of global emissions, respectively.

Alongside abundant and affordable renewable energy, Brazil offers strategic advantages such as proximity to major consumer markets in the United States and Europe and distance from geopolitical conflict zones, experts note.

Still, the country’s surplus power comes mainly from new renewable sources—solar and wind—that run only part of the day, making it difficult to anchor highly energy-dependent industries, says Paulo Pedrosa, president of the Association of Large Industrial Energy Consumers and Free Consumers (Abrace).

“Powershoring is for heavy industry, which targets the global market. It requires massive investment—investment that only pays off if production runs 24 hours a day.”

There are ways to address this challenge, such as investing in energy storage systems. But battery technology remains relatively expensive, and debate continues over who should bear the cost—consumers or generators. It is one of the sector’s many unresolved issues.

Another bottleneck is geography. Most of Brazil’s solar and wind farms are located in the Northeast. In theory, industries could draw power from other regions when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing, but the national transmission system is not yet robust enough to support that.

“It’s no use developing a green hydrogen project and installing a solar plant next to it; that won’t solve the problem. You need access to the grid, because the sun goes down at 6 p.m., and operations cannot stop,” said João Carneiro, head of infrastructure at the IFC, the World Bank arm focused on private-sector lending. “Today, that capacity doesn’t exist. In our view, the four main green hydrogen projects planned for Pecém alone require 8 GW, but available capacity is between 1 and 3 GW,” added Carneiro, speaking at a powershoring seminar held in Fortaleza in October.

Also at the event, State Grid Brazil CFO Chen Mingming said the country is the company’s most important market outside China. State Grid is currently investing R$23 billion in a transmission line connecting the Northeast to the Central West, which will increase current capacity by 40%, from 13 GW.

“Northeast, please let the national grid be the battery of your powershoring strategy,” the executive said, addressing state officials, development banks, and business leaders.

Beyond expanding transmission capacity, the system must also offer redundancy, says infrastructure specialist and Inter.B partner Claudio Frischtak—ensuring that “if one line fails, another is available to guarantee supply.”

The transmission market is strong from a regulatory standpoint, and project acceleration is possible. But execution is slowed by broader national constraints, including a shortage of EPC contractors specializing in large-scale projects, he notes.

In his view, however, this is not the primary obstacle to powershoring. The central challenge is ensuring system stability—a task that will grow more complex as investments in distributed generation expand. To address this, he says, subsidies and incentives in the generation market must be reviewed.

“The alternative would be to invest in battery systems. But they don’t exist here because they’re expensive—and because the sector is addicted to subsidies. Why doesn’t the private sector offer batteries together with intermittent systems? Why does demand risk have to be transferred to the government when what we have is an excess of intermittent energy?” asks Frischtak.

“We need to stop digging the hole—stop increasing the supply of distributed generation,” adds Pedrosa of Abrace. “Yet last week, Congress approved Provisional Presidential Decree 1,304, which forces us to pay for more expensive sources, including coal. And there is still the possibility of approving PDL 365, which would revoke Aneel’s resolutions on the locational signal and reduce energy prices in the Northeast. It would be a complete demoralization of Aneel on the tariff front.”

A study by PwC for the industry association identified 30 industrial routes capable of adding R$1 trillion to GDP and generating more than 3 million jobs by 2030.

For Pedrosa, the report reinforces that the energy transition is not simply an industrial strategy—it is a national project. “This is what will generate jobs, tax revenue, and transformation at a scale far larger than any single sector. It breaks with our traditional model of setting quotas for specific products and forcing everyone to pay—driving up consumer costs. We need to rethink this logic and offer competitive prices, because the world will not buy expensive goods. We can produce goods that are both affordable and green.”

Industrial electricity prices in Brazil are slightly above the average observed among OECD members in 2023, according to Abrace and Aneel data. They are also higher than in countries such as the United States and South Korea. Still, Brazil benefits from a much cleaner power matrix—about 90% renewable—compared with 9.6% in South Korea and 24.1% in the United States, according to Ember. In Germany, a developed economy investing heavily in decarbonization, renewables account for 57.5%; in China, a global exporter of solar and wind technologies, the share is 33.6%.

Even so, Brazil must increase predictability and improve coordination to attract large-scale investment, says Maria Netto, executive president of the Climate and Society Institute (iCS).

“International investors naturally want to feel more comfortable about business-ecosystem conditions and alignment with national industrial policy,” she says. “Fertilizer makers, for example.”

“The traditional industry, which relies on minerals, could be very interested in coming to Brazil to produce fertilizers—taking advantage of renewable energy, supplying the local market, and becoming an exporter. But to make that move, companies need certainty: real demand and the infrastructure required to distribute what they produce.”

To help coordinate powershoring strategies, the iCS, the Northeast Consortium, and Banco do Nordeste do Brasil have launched a new forum.

“The region has ports and market access, but it doesn’t even have local transmission lines to move energy within its own borders. States often conduct studies and launch initiatives individually, or else remain dependent on the federal government. The region needs to look after itself—and understand that its potential is regional, not isolated,” she says.

For the president of Abrace, recent signals from the Executive Branch and from Senator Eduardo Braga, rapporteur of Provisional Presidential Decree 1,304, indicate that governments may finally be waking up to the issue.

“We need to take this debate out of the electricity sector—which is highly influenced by congressional lobbying—and move it into the country’s strategic agenda, where development and competitiveness come first. The private sector has also been very fragmented. The last provisional decree had drawbacks for consumers, but it also brought advances, such as improving price signals and curbing the growth of subsidies. And in the offshore wind bill, President Lula vetoed several items that would have made energy more expensive. So maybe we are at a turning point.”

Netto, from iCS, also argues that Brazil would benefit from prioritizing specific powershoring chains to build structural capacity. “Biomethanol for the maritime transport of green fertilizers, for example, is a chain that could serve Brazilian demand as well as international demand. Brazilian industries can participate; it doesn’t have to be only foreign players. These are win-win relationships.”

At the same time, she warns that not every initiative is realistic in the short term. “Data centers, for example, require massive amounts of energy and water—and the Northeast faces water scarcity. Could this create competition with local demand for energy and water? And if so, what social or technological compensation will exist?”

Minister,

Re: Unifor Meeting on Alberta’s Energy Sector

On behalf of Unifor’s Energy Industry Council, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to meet on November 24 to discuss the priorities of our energy worker members. Unifor Energy Council represents 15,000 members working in oil and gas extraction, natural gas distribution, electric utilities, and petroleum refineries across Canada.

Unifor is committed to an energy strategy that protects good, unionized jobs while ensuring a sustainable future for Alberta’s energy sector, specifically:

Evolving regulations addressing methane leaks in the sector.

Supporting public procurement that supports a sovereign and secure nuclear supply chain.

Ensuring continued biofuels investment through domestic content requirements.

Expanding the use of existing rail infrastructure for the transport of energy products within Canada.

1. Keep it in the Pipe

Unifor’s Keep it in the Pipe campaign advocates for smart regulations to support investment in reducing methane emissions.

We are interested in continued engagement with the government through any working groups that examine best practices for leak detection and repair. This includes supporting the research and deployment of new leak detection technologies and ensuring regulations cover the entire supply chain of natural gas, including distribution.

2. Prioritizing CANDU technology

Unifor believes reliance on foreign developed and owned nuclear technology presents risks to energy sovereignty. Reliance on foreign-owned designs forces reliance on foreign intellectual property, supply chains, and enriched nuclear fuel imports. All of which are subject to U.S. export controls.

We caution against the current trend of expanding M.O.U.s for American-owned technology such as Small Modular Reactors by GE-Hitachi (BWRX-300) or Westinghouse large reactor development (AP-1000).

Unifor advocates for prioritizing Canadian (CANDU) technology that maximizes domestic economic benefits and ensures nuclear energy supply chain security.

3. Biofuel domestic content and investment

Alberta are home to key biofuel facilities, however the industry faces an existential threat from subsidized American imports.

Unifor supports the continued development of this sector through domestic content requirements, diversification of product including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, and countering U.S. subsidies.

4. The transport of oil and energy product

Unifor supports the continued commercial investment and maintenance of pipelines if they also meet the needs of workers and the communities and environment they pass through.

However, we believe Canadian oil and gas should be refined and transported from extraction to regions where Canadian industry needs oil and chemical inputs without that product travelling through other countries.

To fill the immediate demand for these products across Canada, Unifor also supports the transporting of oil and chemical product east, west, and north by rail.

Unifor looks forward to continuing this dialogue to build Alberta’s energy strategy.

Sincerely,",https://www.unifor.org/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph_image/public/images/shield-banner_0_4_2.png?h=e92c2de8&itok=5W0owfSN,N,,2025-11-27 17:57:12.908514

With the stock up strongly this year and trading just below analyst targets, is Safran undervalued given its innovation in sustainable aviation, or is the market already factoring in its future growth potential?

Most Popular Narrative: 12% Undervalued

Safran’s widely followed narrative points to a fair value above its last close price, reflecting strategic optimism about future growth and margin resilience. With analysts factoring in upcoming catalysts and robust sector tailwinds, the current share price appears to lag their broader outlook.

The recent acquisition of Collins' actuation and flight control assets, along with other targeted acquisitions and strategic partnerships, will broaden Safran's mission-critical offering, drive cost synergies through 2028, and further diversify revenue streams. This is expected to result in higher EBIT margins and more stable earnings.

Result: Fair Value of €328.67 (UNDERVALUED)

However, ongoing supply chain pressures and significant integration challenges from recent acquisitions could still threaten Safran’s projected earnings momentum and valuation upside.

Another View: Multiple Approach Challenges the Outlook

Taking a look through the lens of the price-to-earnings ratio, Safran appears well-priced compared to both its direct peers and the industry average. However, it trades above its fair ratio (27.9x vs 27x). This small premium suggests there could be less upside left than the growth narrative implies. Is the current optimism already priced in, or is there still room for a surprise?

“CEVA Logistics’ decision to scale up its use of SAF reflects a clear commitment to advancing the decarbonisation of air freight.
The agreement strengthens their joint effort to deliver verifiable CO₂ reduction and deepen cooperation on sustainable logistics.","Lufthansa Cargo and CEVA Logistics have turned their summer Memorandum of Understanding on sustainable aviation fuel into a binding agreement. The deal was signed on November 21 during CEVA Logistics’ Airfreight Annual Strategic Partners Council in Paris. CEVA has committed to using SAF credits in 2025, representing an emissions reduction of 8,000 tonnes of CO₂.

The MoU has now been formalised into a long-term framework agreement that runs through 2028. Both companies describe it as the result of a long-standing relationship built on transparency, steady collaboration and shared learning. “This agreement marks an important step in our sustainable partnership with Lufthansa Cargo. It allows us to cut emissions in a measurable way and strengthen the sustainability of our supply chains, supported by a partner committed to transparency, strong standards and credible certification,” said Loïc Gay, Global Air & Ocean Products VP at CEVA Logistics.

For Lufthansa Cargo, the agreement reinforces its close cooperation with CEVA, especially on future-focused topics such as sustainability. “CEVA Logistics’ decision to scale up its use of SAF reflects a clear commitment to advancing the decarbonisation of air freight. Protecting the climate depends on strong partnerships and determined action, and this agreement gives us a solid base to move forward together,” said Anand Kulkarni, Head of Global Markets.

The framework also sets out how both sides will continue to collaborate on SAF and plan additional measures over time. The fuel used is produced only from waste and residual materials, contains no palm oil and meets leading international sustainability standards. Emission reductions will be validated for CEVA through audited mitigation certificates, supported by Lufthansa Cargo’s certified Proof of Sustainability process. The agreement strengthens their joint effort to deliver verifiable CO₂ reduction and deepen cooperation on sustainable logistics.

According to Ghodawat, the airline operates 56 daily flights, with 65% of these falling under the UDAN scheme. “Today we have 56 daily flights, with 65% being UDAN, in our network of 31 cities,” he said.

The Bengaluru-based carrier has four 50-seat ERJ-145s and seven E175s. These jets began arriving on lease in 2023 in a two-class configuration (12+64), but in 2025 four aircraft with 88 seats in a single class were received.

However, Ghodawat did not specify which aircraft are being evaluated at Embraer. Besides the already operated E175s, other alternatives include the E190-E2 for approximately 110 passengers, and the E195-E2, with up to 146 seats.

The E2 models, however, are more expensive, although they offer a lower operating cost per seat. Embraer has not yet secured an order from Indian airlines, a situation that Star Air could also take advantage of.

Star Air recently completed the first tranche of a funding round. The company has outlined plans to develop proprietary facilities for maintenance, repair, and crew training to support its growth trajectory.

Thirty Eighth Report

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill

1. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill was brought to the House of Lords on 20 October 2025. Second reading was on 20 November and Committee Stage is scheduled to begin on 10 December.

2.Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”) is a lower carbon aviation fuel and the Government considers its use to be “one of the most effective ways to reduce aviation emissions right now”. However, in the Government’s view a number of risks discourage investment and hinder the development of a market in SAF production. One of these perceived risks is revenue uncertainty risk.

3.The Bill is intended to establish a revenue certainty mechanism to support SAF production and long-term investment in the United Kingdom. The Bill will enable the Secretary of State to designate a contractual counterparty, wholly owned by Government, and direct it to enter into contracts with producers that guarantee a price for their SAF over a set period; under the contracts the counterparty will pay producers the difference between the market price and a guaranteed “strike price” (if the strike price is higher) or receive the difference from the producer (if the strike price if lower). A levy on suppliers of aviation fuel will fund the mechanism and its administration.

4.The Department for Transport has provided a Delegated Powers Memorandum (“the Memorandum”) explaining and justifying the Bill’s delegated powers. The Bill includes twelve delegated powers two of which, in clauses 1(8) and 11(4)(a), are Henry VIII powers. Both of these appear to be justified and comply with our frequently cited presumption that such powers should be subject to affirmative procedure unless there is compelling justification to the contrary. However we are disappointed that the Memorandum does not acknowledge that the Bill includes Henry VIII powers. Our Guidance for Departments requires that such powers are clearly identified.

5.This note draws the House’s attention to one delegated power.

Clause 11(4)(b)–determination of turnover

6.The Bill confers delegated powers to raise and dispose of levy funding. Exercise of these powers will necessarily involve imposing statutory duties on suppliers of aviation fuel. Clause 11(1) confers a power on the Secretary of State to enforce these duties by imposing a financial penalty on suppliers who are in breach. The maximum amount of the penalty appears on the face of the Bill in clause 11(3) as the lesser of:

£100,000, and

an amount equal to 10% of turnover of the person on whom it is imposed.

7.Clause 11(4) is a delegated power that allows regulations to be made:

(a)amending the figure of £100, 000 in the light of inflation, and

(b)setting out how turnover is to be determined.

8.Regulations exercising the power in (a) are subject to affirmative provision and those exercising the power in (b) are subject to negative procedure.

9.We have consistently taken the view that the maximum amount of any financial penalty should be set out on the face of a Bill with, where necessary, a delegated power subject to affirmative procedure to vary that amount. The approach taken by the Government to clause 11(4)(a) accords with this principle.

10.It also seems reasonable in our view for the Government to seek the delegated power in clause 11(4)(b) to set out how turnover is to be determined since doing so is likely to involve technical detail and will involve judgments about fair treatment of those subject to the levy. However, clause 11(4)(b) is of at least equal significance to 11(4)(a) in setting the maximum amount of any financial penalty so it appears to us inconsistent that its exercise is subject to negative procedure.

11.In our report on the Online Safety Bill, we discussed a power to set the definition of “qualifying worldwide revenue” which term was used in that Bill as “turnover” is in this: to partially determine the maximum level of financial penalty for breach of statutory duty. We concluded, noting precedent in the Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure Act 2022, that the definition should be set in regulations subject to affirmative procedure because it went to the “highly significant matter of the level of financial penalties”. The close similarity to setting out how turnover is to be determined in setting a maximum financial penalty is in our view clear.

12.The Memorandum does not seek to justify the use of negative procedure for exercise of the power in clause 11(4)(b). It is concerning that instead it wrongly suggests that the power to set how turnover is determined is subject to affirmative procedure.",,N,,2025-11-27 15:56:42.037657

On November 26th, 2025, Salvador International Airport tornou-se o primeiro do Brasil a abastecer voos comerciais com sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provided by Vibra Energy. A operação inaugural representa um marco inédito para a aviação brasileira e um avanço significativo na agenda de decarbonization of air transport. A iniciativa envolve rotas regulares operadas com uma mistura de 10% de SAF e 90% de querosene tradicional, já sendo aplicada nos voos diários para Brasília e São Paulo.

Por que o SAF representa um avanço imediato para o Brasil

De acordo com as informações divulgadas pela empresa e pelo governo da Bahia, o uso do combustível sustentável pode reduzir até 80% of greenhouse gas emissions ao longo do ciclo de vida do produto. Além disso, a prestação desse serviço coloca Salvador como referência nacional ao se tornar o primeiro aeroporto brasileiro a ter um fornecimento constante de SAF para voos comerciais.

O uso do SAF é considerado hoje a forma mais rápida e prática de reduzir as emissões da aviação comercial. Isso ocorre porque o combustível sustentável pode ser utilizado em aeronaves convencionais sem exigir qualquer modificação técnica ou substituição de infraestrutura aeroportuária. Esse aspecto torna o combustível um aliado estratégico para acelerar a transição energética do setor aéreo.

O SAF fornecido pela Vibra Energy é produzido a partir de resíduos renováveis, como óleos usados, gorduras residuais e restos da agroindústria. Por utilizar materiais de baixo impacto ambiental, o ciclo de vida do produto emite menos carbono, o que resulta na redução significativa de gases de efeito estufa ao ser comparado ao querosene fóssil.

A certificação internacional aplicada ao combustível assegura rastreabilidade e comprovação de sustentabilidade. Isso significa que a origem da matéria-prima, o processo de produção e o transporte são verificados por entidades independentes, garantindo credibilidade aos resultados ambientais apresentados.

Operação diária no Aeroporto de Salvador com combustível sustentável

A operação inaugurada no Aeroporto de Salvador não se limita a voos simbólicos ou experimentais. Em vez disso, estabelece um padrão diário, com dois voos abastecidos regularmente com a mistura de 10% de SAF. Essa constância demonstra que o mercado brasileiro está preparado para integrar o combustível sustentável à rotina operacional da aviação.

O fornecimento inicial previsto para a fase de implementação chega a alguns milhões de litros, destinados exclusivamente para as rotas que partem da capital baiana. Isso demonstra que há planejamento de longo prazo, e não apenas projetos pontuais.

A Vibra Energy, que é responsável por abastecer mais de 90 aeroportos no país, estruturou sua cadeia logística para garantir o fornecimento contínuo do combustível sustentável. Como a empresa foi a primeira a disponibilizar SAF comercialmente no Brasil, Salvador se tornou o local ideal para iniciar a operação regular.

A companhia também avança em negociações para expandir a oferta de SAF para outros estados e aeroportos. Caso esse processo evolua, Salvador pode se transformar em um polo nacional de abastecimento sustentável, incentivando a expansão da aviação verde no país.

Impactos ambientais do combustível sustentável (SAF)

O impacto ambiental do SAF é a principal razão para sua adoção global. Mesmo com apenas 10% de mistura, há uma redução perceptível nas emissões de carbono. Quando utilizado em proporções maiores — o que é tecnicamente possível — o benefício se torna ainda mais expressivo, aproximando a aviação das metas globais estabelecidas por organismos internacionais.

Estudos indicam que o combustível sustentável pode reduzir até 80% das emissões de CO₂, dependendo da matéria-prima utilizada no processo produtivo. Essa redução considera todo o ciclo de vida do produto, desde a produção até a queima nos motores.

Para Salvador, a operação cria oportunidades de desenvolvimento econômico e ambiental. A cidade já é reconhecida como um polo turístico e logístico, e agora reforça o seu papel estratégico em iniciativas de inovação e sustentabilidade.

Para o Brasil, a iniciativa representa um avanço alinhado às metas de redução de emissões assumidas internacionalmente. A aviação é um setor conhecido por sua dificuldade de descarbonização, e o SAF desponta como a alternativa mais eficaz no curto e médio prazo.

Aeroporto de Salvador como referência nacional em aviação sustentável

Ao inaugurar essa operação, o Aeroporto Internacional de Salvador se posiciona como pioneiro no país e reforça sua relevância no cenário nacional. A iniciativa soma-se a projetos que já vinham sendo implementados no terminal, incluindo sistemas de eficiência energética, modernização da infraestrutura e práticas sustentáveis de gestão.

Ser o primeiro aeroporto brasileiro a oferecer abastecimento regular com combustível sustentável é mais do que um título simbólico — é um reconhecimento da capacidade técnica, da articulação institucional e do compromisso com a agenda climática.

Com a operação já em curso, outros aeroportos podem observar o modelo adotado em Salvador para replicá-lo em suas estruturas. A experiência prática facilitará a elaboração de políticas públicas, ajustes regulatórios e incentivos fiscais que favoreçam o uso do SAF em todo o país.

À medida que a oferta e a demanda crescem, o custo tende a diminuir, tornando o combustível sustentável mais competitivo e ampliando seu uso no setor aéreo.

Desafios para o avanço do SAF no país

Apesar dos benefícios ambientais, a ampliação do uso do SAF enfrenta desafios. O principal deles é o custo de produção, que ainda é superior ao do querosene convencional. Como o mercado brasileiro está em fase inicial, o volume disponível também é limitado.

Outro ponto relevante é a necessidade de políticas públicas específicas, capazes de estimular a produção nacional e reduzir a dependência de importações. Incentivos tributários, financiamentos e parcerias entre empresas e governos são fundamentais para impulsionar a cadeia produtiva.

A operação em Salvador, contudo, mostra que mesmo com os desafios, é possível estruturar um modelo viável e tecnicamente seguro.

A relevância do uso de SAF para o futuro da aviação brasileira

A operação iniciada no Aeroporto Internacional de Salvador representa um marco decisivo para o setor aéreo. O uso do SAF fornece benefícios ambientais comprovados, reforça a competitividade do país no cenário internacional e demonstra que a transição energética na aviação já está em andamento.

Ao adotar o combustível sustentável de forma regular, Salvador estabelece uma referência para todo o território nacional. A iniciativa demonstra que a inovação ambiental pode caminhar ao lado da operação comercial, mantendo a segurança, a eficiência e a regularidade dos voos.

b. Equinor – deployment of autonomous robotics systems across all refinery sites in Norway

Equinor’s innovation team in Norway has successfully deployed autonomous robotics systems to conduct routine tasks such as monitoring and inspection. The robots use onboard sensors to conduct acoustic, visual and leak detection while also allowing for collection of routine sample points and taking them to a non-hazardous location for testing. The main purpose of the project is to remove personnel from being exposed to hazards in process areas during these routine tasks.

The innovation of this project is not just in the utilisation of robots, but the process Equinor went through, along with it project partners, for determining the suitability of non-ATEX certified or assessed robots to be used in Zone 2 areas. Equinor identified that due to gaps in the current methodologies used for certification of systems for use in hazardous areas, it is not always clear how to apply hazardous area requirements to these systems but also that existing certifications may have gaps to be able to determine that all ignition risks have been defined and managed to acceptable levels. This approach has satisfied equivalence to certification and satisfied all Equinor’s procedural requirements for deployment of equipment in hazardous areas, as with any other devices. Equinor is now supporting DNV in spearheading a Joint Industry Project with multiple operators and robotics companies to develop a recommended practice for assessment of robotics systems for use in hazardous areas.

c. ExxonMobil – £800m investment in Fawley Petrochemical complex

Representing a more than £800m investment, ExxonMobil has constructed a new low-sulphur diesel facility at its Fawley refinery. The energy major said increasing low-sulphur diesel production at Fawley by 40 percent should reduce imports into Britain by a quarter while helping to meet demand from sectors including heavy transport, emergency response, agriculture and industry. The project also involved the construction, completion, and commissioning of a Steam Methane Reforming Hydrogen Plant. The new hydrogen plant builds on over 50 years of experience with hydrogen production onsite and could enable the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as the energy transition evolves.

d. INEOS – £30 million investment at Hull manufacturing site to cut emissions by 75%

INEOS has completed a major £30 million investment at its Hull manufacturing site, converting the facility to run on clean-burning hydrogen instead of natural gas. The result is a 75% cut in carbon emissions – the equivalent of taking around 160,000 petrol cars off the road and a huge step towards INEOS’ net zero commitment, well ahead of 2050, the company says. This investment will deliver a transformational step change improvement in the site’s product carbon footprint, INEOS said. The hydrogen used at the site is produced as a co-product from existing manufacturing processes, a model which INEOS believes can be replicated across the industry.

e. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority – use of Spot the robot ""dog"" to reactivate equipment at Dounreay nuclear site

Spot, the robot ""dog,"" assisted personnel in Dounreay’s Fuel Cycle Area by reactivating a crucial building crane in a reprocessing plant. The crane had been deactivated at the switchboard in 2023 due to concerns about the ageing asset at the nuclear site. Safety restrictions prohibited human interaction with the switchboard, which further delayed its reactivation. However, the facility required the crane for waste shipment and for ongoing decommissioning efforts. Following consultations with NRS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, it was decided to use Spot for the task. As the site’s Spot was not equipped with an “arm” handling device, the team asked the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Collaboration (RAICo) for support. After conducting a week of trials on a non-live switch mock-up in a nearby substation storeroom, Spot used a gripped pole to flip the switch, successfully restoring power to the crane.

Contrails and the cirrus clouds they can develop into are among aviation’s largest climate-warming factors. Yet their formation depends on multiple variables, including engine type, fuel composition, altitude, and atmospheric conditions. The new campaign is designed to help untangle these influences.

Using specialised onboard instruments, the DLR research aircraft will analyse exhaust particles, ice crystals, temperature and humidity levels, and how different engine technologies behave in real time. The data will ultimately feed into models that could shape future aircraft design and airline operations.

According to TUI and DLR, the findings may support new engine concepts, alternative fuels, and climate-optimised flight routes—for example, avoiding areas of the atmosphere where contrails are most likely to persist and warm the planet.

The partners describe the project as an important step toward identifying concrete, scalable solutions for more climate-efficient flying. Further test flights and evaluations will continue over the coming months as researchers assemble what is expected to become one of the most comprehensive contrail datasets in Europe.",https://www.aviation24.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Wind-turbine-with-contrails.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 12:56:53.660176

When quantifying and discussing this climate impact, ongoing academic and societal discussions of how to define successful climate change mitigation for aviation must be considered (see Aviation climate targets, below).
We also reviewed related aspects in previous works which discuss aviation climate mitigation pathways (Table 1).
Aviation climate targets Achieving so-called ‘climate-neutral’ or ‘net-zero’ aviation by 2050 are recurring concepts without a universal definition.
For use on hydrogen aircraft, hydrogen is liquefied after distribution82.","The air transport sector has become a linchpin of the global economy, but it is also a large contributor to environmental degradation, including climate change1,2. The climate change mitigation required to limit global warming to well below 2 °C, following the Paris Agreement3, is commonly interpreted as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to ‘net zero’ by 2050. In a net-zero scenario, any greenhouse gases emitted through human activities must be ‘offset’, i.e., balanced by an equivalent reduction of greenhouse gases. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is among industry organisations making a voluntary net-zero commitment, with a considerable reliance on offsetting4. Furthermore, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is demonstrating the practical implementation of a climate change mitigation framework through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)5. This scheme aims to offset carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from international aviation in excess of a yearly limit, currently defined as 85% of such emissions in 2019. Coverage of climate forcers other than CO2 and lifecycle phases beyond the combustion phase is limited6. CORSIA maintains eligibility criteria aligned with its (limited) scope7, yet the legitimacy of offsetting as an effective climate mitigation tool is challenged by the abundance of low-quality efforts where offset sales do not result in the promised reduction of atmospheric greenhouse gases8,9,10. Broadly, the value of offsets in long-term impact reduction is debatable11,12. As such, the reliance on offsetting and the focus on CO2 at the expense of other climate forcers limits the suitability of these targets to the Paris Agreement.

In addition to offsetting, aviation industry roadmaps focus on measures centred around energy efficiency and substituting fossil kerosene with alternative aviation fuels (AAF)13,14,15,16. Industry actors have set ambitious non-binding targets for these two measures in past decades, but these targets have not been met17. In contrast to these voluntary targets, the European Union (EU) formalised legal requirements in 2023, under the so-called ReFuelEU Aviation initivative18. Following this regulation, EU airports must meet a minimum share of AAF in the fuel they supply, increasing from 2% in 2025 to 70% in 2050. This minimum can be met with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), defined in the EU as drop-in fuels which meet certain sustainability requirements, or with select non-drop-in alternatives to fossil kerosene. Still, the development of AAF infrastructure faces logistical and technological challenges. Currently, most production methods are based on biomass feedstocks19, but the scale at which these feedstocks can be supplied sustainably is limited20. Therefore, there is great interest in fuels that do not rely on biomass. Hydrogen (H2) can be such a low-impact fuel if obtained from water electrolysis powered by renewable energy21. However, the relatively low volumetric energy density of hydrogen, even in liquid form, presents a challenge for aviation22,23. New technologies are needed to adapt aircraft accordingly, with the market entry of narrow-body hydrogen-powered aircraft expected for 203524. Hydrogen can also be used to produce synthetic drop-in fuels by combining it with a carbon source. This source can come from industrial flue gas, resulting in the delayed emission of fossil carbon, or from biomass or the direct air capture (DAC) of atmospheric CO225,26.

We do not yet know how the adoption of ReFuelEU Aviation will influence the climate impact of future aviation, nor how this future will compare to other targets for climate mitigation. The mitigation of aviation’s climate impacts has been addressed in multiple recent studies27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37, but these cannot necessarily be extrapolated to this context. First, the European scope matters. Understanding that access to aviation is distributed highly unequally38, we argue that a just transition towards sustainable aviation should be understood differently across regions. To illustrate, Åkerman et al.27 present a scenario where, within their definition of successful climate mitigation, per capita air travel is around 3000 km in 2060. Compared to the levels before the COVID-19 pandemic, this represents a tripling of global air travel, yet at the same time almost halving it for the Swedish population27. Assuming that commercial aviation will evolve differently across regions, we avoid describing the sector in terms of global trends.

Second, the analysis of mitigation pathways is inherently tied to how these pathways are conceptualised and understood. For example, we assume that the introduction of AAF—including the potential deployment hydrogen-powered aircraft—is driven by ReFuelEU, with additional measures to eliminate the use of fossil kerosene by 2060. Other studies consider different logic for the deployment of AAF (see Table 1 in Methods) and further mitigation measures. Here, we focus on AAFs, air traffic volumes, and aircraft technology. We do not consider contrail avoidance, although it could be a viable mitigation strategy39. Following the challenges introduced above, we exclude carbon storage and other offsetting techniques, despite their prominence in sectoral roadmaps (see also Discussion). Beyond technical and social dimensions, coverage of environmental dimensions varies too. CO2 is a common focus of aviation climate targets, thereby neglecting other climate forcers. Simultaneously, climate forcers such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and persistent contrails stemming from aviation have a relatively short-lived effect, which presents a challenge to conventional climate metrics when trying to compare the impact of mitigation scenarios40. As a result, the use of climate metrics for aviation is the subject of active scientific debate41,42. To circumvent this challenge, we compare climate forcers in terms of warming equivalence and introduce two complementary criteria for successful climate change mitigation. First, we assess the ambition to achieve net-zero targets by 2050 by evaluating whether aviation’s contribution to temperature change increases from 2050 to 2070. Second, we use sectoral emission limits to evaluate a proxy warming budget for the coming decades. This allows for a comprehensive discussion of climate impacts, although introducing additional assumptions and limitations (see Discussion and Methods). However, considering impacts from diverse emissions is not sufficient when important sources of such emissions are excluded. Concerning aviation, simplifications which leave out the production phase of fossil kerosene or the use phase of alternative fuels are common29,43, yet such assumptions prevent both a consistent comparison between fuels and a holistic assessment of the sector44. To address this, our analysis integrates a forward-looking approach called prospective lifecycle assessment (pLCA)45,46,47. Such a method enables, for example, the conclusion that the synthesis of synthetic fuels must be powered by a low-carbon energy system in order for the fuel’s climate impacts to be below that of fossil kerosene29,48,49.

With these considerations accounted for, our analysis has a consistent coverage of the aviation system and its resulting climate impact. We describe future European aviation across various socio-technical scenarios, quantifying its evolution and climate impacts by integrating pLCA with a stock-and-flow model. Our analysis includes diverse projections for aircraft technology and air traffic volume. We compare hydrogen-powered aircraft with hydrogen used for drop-in synthetic fuels. In doing so, we deliberately exclude bio-based AAF. This is a deviation from commonly envisioned futures, but has a limited influence on the discussion of overall climate impacts. From this comparison, we observe that per unit air travel, e-fuel uses more hydrogen and has a higher overall impact than hydrogen-powered aircraft. Thereby, fulfilling ReFuelEU in part with hydrogen-powered aircraft results in reductions of yearly hydrogen consumption (13-26%) and CO2 emissions (23-32%), as well as temperature change in 2070 (13–16%). With or without hydrogen-powered aircraft, we find that most scenarios meet our definition of climate neutrality when replacing all fossil kerosene by 2060. However, we are hesitant to qualify this as successful climate mitigation: the target set for CO2 emissions is frequently exceeded and climate neutrality is highly sensitive to our assumptions surrounding non-CO2 impacts. We conclude that, in order to limit the climate impact of European aviation, additional measures must join ReFuelEU and limit the near-term use of fossil fuels. When faced with limits to the pace of decarbonisation, we recommend that such measures focus on demand management.

We developed a dynamic system model to estimate possible futures for European aviation. A stock-and-flow model generates fleets of aircraft and fuel infrastructure in order to meet the imposed air traffic volumes (Fig. 1a). Characteristics of the aircraft and fuels introduced are governed by two additional scenario parameters: the advancement of aircraft technology and the evolution of AAF use. The resulting flows are used to scale technology-level LCA data, covering both direct aircraft emissions and emissions across the lifecycles of aircraft and fuel infrastructure. Figure 1 provides an overview of the key parameters, parameter values, and the system boundary. We briefly elaborate on this in the following paragraphs. Detailed descriptions are given the corresponding parts of the Methods section.

Our definition of European aviation covers departures of scheduled passenger flights from select countries in Europe. We model flights for 2024-2070 by scaling the air traffic patterns of 2019 according to high-level forecasts. We combine EUROCONTROL’s seven-year forecast (up to 2031)50 and the long-term forecast (up to 2050)51. We assume that the long-term year-on-year growth remain representative until 2070, i.e., ‘low growth’ of 0.7%, ‘base growth’ of 1.6%, and ‘high growth’ of 2.2%. Following public support for suppression of commercial aviation as a climate mitigation strategy52,53,54, we also considered an additional ‘degrowth’ trajectory, in which air traffic from 2035 onwards remains constant at 70% of the 2019 demand (Fig. 1b).

Technological improvements in aircraft efficiency vary from a business-as-usual scenario, with progress following historic trends55, to scenarios that include substantial improvements, from ‘optimistic’ expert estimates30, to speculative ‘breakthrough’ advances55. Future hydrogen-powered aircraft are correlated to these general trends, having a lower efficiency under business as usual and a higher efficiency under breakthrough. The latest aircraft generation we include is introduced in 2050, which is why we do not forecast beyond 2070. The fuel supply follows the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, aiming to reduce fossil kerosene to 30% of the fuel supply by 2050. Although ReFuelEU does not extend past 2050, we consider an extended version of ReFeulEU, in which additional measures lead to the elimination of fossil kerosene by 2060 (Fig. 1c). In our scenarios, the alternatives to fossil kerosene are drop-in e-fuel and non-drop-in liquid hydrogen. Both alternative fuels are produced from electricity, modelled after a grid with a highly ambitious transition towards renewable energy.

Future scenarios

In order to effectively discuss possible futures, the scenario space is reduced from all possible combinations of scenario parameters to a few distinct sets, following principles of compatibility and distinctiveness, as demonstrated by, e.g., Delpierre et al.56 and Langkau et al.57. First, we consider the compatibility of the technology and demand scenario parameters. Transportation efficiency improvement is considered to stimulate demand, limiting its effectiveness as a climate change mitigation measure58. However, experts disagree on how introducing novel aircraft and fuel technologies interacts with measures to limit air traffic growth. Some argue that, with projected growth, the energy demand of aviation could become incompatible with the available energy resources29,36. Others argue that the higher cost associated with AAF will somewhat slow growth but that further limitations would delay the sector’s sustainability transition by diverting financial resources13,14. At least in some European countries, there appears to be public support to increase barriers to flight52,53,54, although political uptake is limited59,60. Based on these perspectives, we decide to positively correlate air traffic demand with the development of aircraft technology, leading to three technology-demand pairs (Fig. 1a). This correlation can be described narratively as follows: ‘In a high-growth scenario, the fuel efficiency imperative of the aviation sector enabled it to maintain its substantial growth, which in turn provided space for revolutionary aircraft technologies to mature. In combination with broad public support, this enabled the construction of AAF infrastructure at rates thought impossible. Conversely, in a degrowth scenario, the aviation sector lacked financial resources, which reinforced the slow development of AAF infrastructure and halted technological breakthroughs. Limited access to clean technology, in turn, limited the air traffic that could be achieved within stringent environmental regulations, further restricting available resources.’ This correlation is introduced in order to effectively explore the scenario space and not to imply a preference over alternative narratives.

Nine scenarios are selected by combining the three sets of demand-technology pairs with three distinct fuel mix scenario values (Fig. 1a). These fuel mixes consist of (1) a baseline, where the share of AAF is not increased, (2) the implementation of an extended version of ReFuelEU Aviation (Fig. 1c), but with no commercial introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft, meaning that all AAF is modelled as e-fuel, and (3) the extended version of ReFuelEU Aviation, also featuring commercial hydrogen-powered aircraft in future generations, meaning that the share of AAF is met through a combination of liquid hydrogen and e-fuel.

Aircraft fleets

Future aircraft generations are introduced into the fleet with a bottom-up stock-and-flow model: each year, aircraft past retirement (which we assume to be after 22 years of use) are removed from the fleet and—to the extent that additional aircraft are needed in order to meet the current air traffic demand—aircraft from the latest generation are added. This creates an interaction between air traffic demand and the introduction of new technology. In a scenario with consistent high growth, a new generation increases its share of the fleet more rapidly than in a scenario with consistent slow growth—compare the introduction of the 2050 generation (gen. 3) in Fig. 2b and Fig. 2d.

In scenarios which start with a strong decline in air traffic, few new aircraft are required during this period. Once these aircraft need replacing, 22 years after the decline started, we see that once again few new aircraft are introduced—observe the period around 2050 in Fig. 2e, leading to a small share of the 2050 generation in 2055 (Fig. 2f). Conversely, however, the aircraft retiring in the years following the decline were already in the fleet before the decline started. As the overall fleet shrunk, the retirement of this segment represents the turnover of a sizeable portion of the fleet as a whole. This results in the periods of slow replacement being alternated with periods or rapid replacement, to the extent that the share of the 2035 generation (gen. 2) initially increases the fastest for the degrowth scenarios (compare 2040 in Fig. 2b, d to the same year in Fig. 2f). Of course, the simplifications we make mean that such a pronounced ripple effect is not necessarily representative of reality, but this illustrates a possible consequence of prolonged shifts in the air traffic demand.

In scenarios featuring hydrogen-powered aircraft, these are introduced with consideration for the aircraft type and flight destination. We assume that the initial introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft is limited to intra-European flights serviced by narrow-body aircraft—a segment which represents 48% of air traffic in terms of revenue passenger-kilometres (RPK) (see Table 2 in Methods). Because hydrogen-powered aircraft are introduced to the extent required to meet demand, only a fraction of European airports require hydrogen infrastructure in 2035. However, we do assume that this can extend to all European airports as time goes on, as well as some extra-European destinations after 2050 (see Table 3, as well as associated text, in Methods). With these ambitious assumptions, the share of air traffic powered by hydrogen rapidly grows from around 10% in 2040 to over 60% in 2070 (Fig. 2).

Fuel demand

Figure 3 illustrates how different parameter combinations affect fuel use and hydrogen demand. In the baseline scenarios—where AAF is not scaled up—total fuel demand initially diverges but then stabilises around 2035 with the introduction of future aircraft (Fig. 3a). This shows that demand plays a substantial role in the short term, while the contrast in fuel efficiency of aircraft technology becomes more influential over time. The business-as-usual scenario stabilises fuel use with 0% demand growth, while the breakthrough scenario stabilises fuel use with a year-on-year growth of 2.2%.

In the scenarios following our extended version of ReFuelEU, the required AAF share (Fig. 1c) is achieved by introducing hydrogen-powered aircraft and by replacing fossil kerosene by e-fuel. The combined AAF used across scenarios with or without hydrogen-powered aircraft is therefore similar (Fig. 3b), with some divergence emerging due to differences in the energy demand for hydrogen-powered and hydrocarbon-powered aircraft. Hydrogen-powered aircraft could require less energy per available seat-kilometre (ASK) than their contemporary hydrocarbon-powered counterparts (see Methods). This is why the introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft reduces the total demand for aviation fuel when assuming breakthrough future technology. In optimistic and business-as-usual scenarios, this is not the case, and introducing hydrogen aircraft increases the total fuel demand. Since ReFuelEU defines a share of AAF, such changes to the total fuel demand influence how much fossil kerosene can be used (Fig. 3a).

Because the initial fleet composition is identical across scenarios, the number of aircraft reaching their retirement age is also the same up to 2046. When combined with the differing energy demands of hydrogen-powered aircraft, this leads to similar use of hydrogen as AAF in 2035-2046 across scenarios (see the desaturated lines in Fig. 3b). Consequently, hydrogen makes up over 50% of the 2042 AAF supply in the degrowth scenario, with a temporary peak of 70% in 2045, while in the high-growth scenario it first exceeds 50% in 2056. This illustrates how future aircraft efficiencies, fleet compositions, and the incentives set for AAF use are all closely related in determining how the sector takes shape.

The total hydrogen required across scenarios also relates to aircraft energy efficiency. However, another dimension to consider here is the efficiency with which hydrogen is used to fuel aircraft. In the production of drop-in e-fuel, hydrogen is first used in a reverse water-gas shift reaction to obtain carbon monoxide (CO) from CO2, which is then combined with additional hydrogen in a Fischer-Tropsch reaction to obtain hydrocarbons. This leads to a consumption of 1.61 MJ hydrogen per 1 MJ of e-fuel. On the other hand, fuelling an aircraft with 1 MJ of liquid hydrogen requires only 1.02 MJ hydrogen, with minor losses in transportation and liquefaction steps (see Methods). As a result, the introduction of hydrogen aircraft always leads to a reduction in the overall hydrogen production required (Fig. 3c). Nonetheless, the hydrogen demand remains substantial across all scenarios. By 2050, hydrogen demand in aviation could exceed 20% of European production following a net-zero emissions pathway21 in both low-demand and high-demand scenarios.

Climate impacts of fuels

Environmental flows of climate forcing agents are added up across the aviation system, spanning the full lifecycle of fuels and aircraft. We use the computational framework of Smith et al.61 to express the combined impact of climate forcers as time-dependent warming-equivalent emissions, using aviation-specific parameters based on Arriolabengoa et al.42. These warming-equivalent emissions are multiplied by the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions62, thereby obtaining the aviation system’s contribution to temperature change (Fig. 4b). However, since contemporary climate targets often focus on CO2, we also consider yearly CO2 emissions (Fig. 4a) and their accumulation (Fig. 4b) in relation to sectoral targets. We further elaborate on the rationale and implementation of these choices in their corresponding parts of the Methods section.

Initially, the CO2 emissions from fossil-powered scenarios are comparable to those of AAF-powered scenarios (Fig. 4a). In fact, the CO2 emitted per RPK slightly increases initially (Supplementary Fig. 4c), given the high impact of an AAF value chain which still makes considerable use of fossil energy (Supplementary Fig. 5). As the energy mix rapidly transitions to renewable sources and the AAF share increases, AAF-powered scenarios begin to show substantial benefits, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions and temperature change (Fig. 4).

AAF scenarios with hydrogen-powered aircraft emit 23-32% less CO2 annually than those without, but this reduction is modest compared to the reduction of roughly 80% relative to scenarios without ReFuelEU (Fig. 4a). Differences such as the diverging hydrogen demand (Fig. 3c) are limited in their influence on climate change, since we assume that AAF value chains are largely free of fossil resources by the time that hydrogen-powered aircraft enter the fleet. The difference in temperature change is more noticeable: we assume that a turbine burning hydrogen produces 90% less NOx emissions in cruise than one burning the same energy content in hydrocarbons63, leading to a distinct change in NOx impacts (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, such assumptions about the non-CO2 effects of AAF are highly uncertain (see Methods).

CO2 limit and air traffic volumes

We combine the ICAO and IATA targets mentioned earlier into a single annual CO2 limit (Fig. 4a), which does not consider other climate forcers (see Methods). This limit can be translated into a corresponding budget, equivalent to 2.4 Gton CO2 or a temperature change of 1.1 mK (Fig. 4b). Figure 4 shows that both the low-growth and high-growth scenarios consistently exceed the combined ICAO/IATA target, overshooting the budget in 2043 and 2038, respectively. In contrast, AAF-powered degrowth scenarios stay below the annual CO2 target for several decades, helping to offset the overshoot seen between 2045 and 2070 (Fig. 4a). As a result, the degrowth scenarios with and without hydrogen-powered aircraft reach the budget in 2067 and after 2070, respectively. Additional representations of this limit for different scenarios can be found in Supplementary Fig. 6.

It is notable that the fossil-powered degrowth scenario exceeds the CO2 budget later (2050 versus 2038) and to a lesser degree (overshoot in 2070 of 1.3 versus 2.3–2.5 Gton CO2) than either of the AAF-powered high-growth scenarios. This is closely related to fossil kerosene use (compare Fig. 4a to Fig. 3a). As discussed above, the assumed differences in technological development can largely compensate for growth, but only beyond 2035, leading to these distinct differences in cumulative CO2 emissions. This highlights the crucial influence of future air traffic on the resulting impacts. This influence is even more prominent when considering non-CO2 effects, which we discuss in the following section.

Climate neutrality and non-CO2 effects

In addition to CO2, aviation affects the climate through emissions such as methane (CH4), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrogen (H2), and the formation of persistent contrails (see Methods). When considering these non-CO2 effects, the overall temperature change is much higher (Fig. 4b), mainly due to the inclusion of NOx and aviation-induced cloudiness (Supplementary Fig. 5). Although non-CO2 effects are still highly uncertain, we assume that their impact is lessened with the introduction of AAF63,64. In addition to the reduction of NOx emissions from hydrogen-powered aircraft, mentioned above, AAF could result in lower impacts from persistent contrails: soot particles act as condensation nuclei in contrail formation, and as synthetic fuels undergo cleaner combustion, less soot is emitted (see Methods). As a result, temperature change sees a (temporary) reduction in AAF-powered scenarios as the AAF share increases (compare Fig. 4b to Fig. 3c), reaching a relative minimum by 2060 (Fig. 4b). In the degrowth and low-growth scenarios, temperature change stabilises at this lower level, while in the high-growth scenario, it increases again as air traffic continues to rise.

To assess climate mitigation beyond the target of net-zero CO2 emissions, the temperature increase can be used to define ‘climate-neutral aviation by 2050’: if the temperature increase does not exceed its 2050 level in subsequent years, the system could be considered climate neutral29,32. From 2050 to 2070, temperature change reduces by 13–20% for the AAF-powered degrowth scenarios and by 11-18% for those with low growth. A high-growth scenario can stay 1% below its 2050 temperature change with hydrogen-powered aircraft; without hydrogen-powered aircraft, the temperature change in 2070 is 7% higher than in 2050. However, when discarding the assumption that AAF reduce contrail impacts, temperature change follows the traffic trajectory past 2050 (Supplementary Fig. 6). In this case, only the degrowth scenario with hydrogen-powered aircraft could be considered climate neutral (Supplementary Fig. 7).

Aside from the uncertainty of AAF non-CO2 impacts, the fact that climate neutrality as defined here can be achieved under any growth scenario, despite large differences in impact, suggests that this is not a robust measure of successful climate mitigation. Because this definition of climate neutrality defines success with respect to a future reference year, it neglects the harmful effect of emissions which occurred prior to this reference year. A more meaningful measure of success requires a budget-based target. The CO2 budget is an example of this, and appears here as though it could be a good indicator of success. However, because it excluded non-CO2 impacts, overshoots appear smaller than they actually are. If the CO2-based budget applied to aviation’s full climate impact in 2070, CO2 represents just 15-19% of the total overshoot (Supplementary Table 1)—except for AAF-powered degrowth scenarios, where this is less than 2% due to CO2 emissions remaining close to the budget.

We model the period 2024-2070 using a time resolution of one year. The sectoral model has a general workflow which starts by quantifying the air transport volume at each time step, depending on the traffic projection used. This feeds into a connected stock-and-flow model, creating persistent fleets of aircraft and fuel infrastructure to meet the required air transport and fuel supply. Time-explicit lifecycle inventories are generated and aggregated for the matching stocks and flows, creating timeseries of emissions. These time series are used to calculate warming-equivalent emissions, leading to a value for the change in temperature over time.

Modelling requirements and comparison to previous work

As outlined in the introduction, we conducted this work in order to understand the implications of ReFuelEU for the climate impact of European aviation. When quantifying and discussing this climate impact, ongoing academic and societal discussions of how to define successful climate change mitigation for aviation must be considered (see Aviation climate targets, below). For our assessment of the sector to be robust, it should consider diverse trends for air traffic demand and improvements to aircraft technology. Within these trends, it is relevant to consider the possibility of hydrogen-powered aircraft, given the European focus on hydrogen13,74. Based on these considerations, we formulated requirements for our modelling setup:

1.

A consistent trajectory for the AAF share, regardless of other factors. This is necessary in order to align the deployment of AAF with the requirements of ReFuelEU.

2.

A consistent system boundary and coverage of impacts. In order to address the impacts of flight from a lifecycle perspective, all energy carriers must be considered with a so-called well-to-wing system boundary, spanning from infrastructure and production to use of the fuel, with coverage of all related climate impacts without a priori assuming that a fuel has zero impact.

3.

A consideration for the role of air transport demand in the introduction of novel aircraft. This is necessary in order to understand the possible impact of fleet dynamics on the diffusion of future aircraft generations. For example, growing demand necessitates a growing fleet, with more new aircraft coming in than are being retired. Such behaviour can affect the rate at which new generations make up a given share of the total fleet.

4.

The inclusion of hydrogen-powered aircraft. The inclusion of such aircraft must, of course, also comply with the other requirements.

5.

An evaluation of climate mitigation which considers:

5.1

. An equivalent to goals which include the immediate future. Such goals do not focus (exclusively) on achieving a climate-neutral sector, but set targets for gradual climate mitigation.

5.2

. An equivalent to net-zero 2050 goals. With such goals, impacts are evaluated starting from a future year. This places the focus on an advanced state of the transition towards climate neutrality.

The details of how we implemented each of these requirements are given in the following sections. We also reviewed related aspects in previous works which discuss aviation climate mitigation pathways (Table 1). These articles provide insightful perspectives on the future of aviation’s impact on climate change, although none meet all of our requirements. This is natural, considering differences in research objective.

Aviation climate targets

Achieving so-called ‘climate-neutral’ or ‘net-zero’ aviation by 2050 are recurring concepts without a universal definition. Industry roadmaps are typically defined in terms of CO2 emitted during flight, with the only coverage of other climate impacts being AAF fuel production13,14. This approach neglects other activities supporting flight, as well as non-CO2 effects such as contrail formation. We consider the 2050 net-zero goal using what Sacchi et al. term ‘warming neutrality’, which ‘requires that the [radiative] forcing is stabilised at the 2050 level’29, considering all climate forcers associated with the aviation system. This definition is conceptually similar to the ‘Bronze’ standard for climate neutrality, defined by Brazzola et al.32. In other words, we consider commercial aviation to be climate neutral if the temperature change resulting from the sector does not increase past its 2050 level. We evaluate this by comparing the temperature change in 2050 and 2070, the end of our temporal scope.

In addition to the trend in warming beyond 2050, which the above definition considers, there is the question of what magnitude of warming the aviation sector should remain within. This is an emerging subject of discussion69 and cannot be fully operationalised within the scope of this study. As a proxy, we follow the reasoning of Kito et al.28, who created a CO2 budget based on the emission limits for CO2 of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The limits are based on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). In short, this scheme, which currently extends to 2035, sets a yearly limit to emissions from international aviation, covering CO2 and a few other greenhouse gases6. In response to the disruptive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation, this yearly limit was adjusted to 85% of covered emissions in 20195. IATA has set the goal that, after 2035, this limit will be linearly reduced such that it reaches zero in 20504 (Fig. 1a). Using our model, we estimate 150 Mton CO2 emissions for 2019. We use this value to scale the yearly emission limit, rather than the 147 Mton CO2 reported by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency75. This yearly emission limit creates an equivalent warming limit (Fig. 1b). Since this limit is specific to CO2 emissions, it does not apply to other climate forcers.

System boundary

As described above, sectoral targets often do not adopt a consistent lifecycle perspective. Nevertheless, we attempt to amend this, using a so-called well-to-wing perspective for fossil fuel and AAF, which spans the cradle-to-grave construction, operation, and decommissioning of fuel production infrastructure in addition to fuel use (Supplementary Fig. 1). Additionally, the lifecycles of the aircraft structures are included, as their share in environmental impacts has been speculated to increase with the use of AAF76. Due to a lack of prospective data, airports and the construction of new fuel distribution infrastructure are excluded. These are known to make a small contribution to the climate change impact of the sector55. When considering the environment more broadly, their share becomes more prominent55,76, but this falls outside the scope of the present work.

Despite their prominent role in sectoral narratives, offsetting and negative carbon technologies are excluded from our analysis. As discussed in our introduction, we make this choice based on the inefficacy of past offsetting measures. Sacchi et al.29 include a detailed description of carbon capture and storage across various scenarios, illustrating that this shifts the climate burden to ‘excessive pressure on economic and natural resources’. Although our inventories allow the quantification of additional environmental impacts (Supplementary Fig. 9), we focus on climate change and do not quantify economic indicators but further discuss these limitations (see Discussion).

Impact mitigation measures relating to passenger occupancy rate and technological improvement of AAF infrastructure were assessed, but excluded from the main results due to their limited influence (Supplementary Fig. 10). Several other possible measures were not quantified here, including increased aircraft replacement rates, improved air traffic management, and the introduction of electric aircraft. However, this does not mean that these measures are unimportant.

European aviation and air transport demand

International agreements generally define the aviation emissions allocated to a particular region based on the flights departing from that region. This approach is used here as well. In the context of this research, ‘Europe’ is defined as a selection of countries closely aligned in their approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, being the EU, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and additionally, the United Kingdom. This geographical definition is adopted from the Destination 2050 report13. Note that the United Kingdom is not subject to ReFuelEU, but does have a similar approach to decarbonising aviation, setting targets for the AAF share of the fuel supply, with its target of 75% AAF in 205077 being comparable with ReFuelEU minimum of 70%.

The volume of air transport is estimated by processing flight data78 from 2019 and scaling this according to the demand for 2024-2070. To evaluate commercial aviation, the scope is limited to the most common types of flight, being passenger transport on scheduled flights. It can, therefore, be described in terms of RPK. As we approximate the sector as generic narrow-body and wide-body aircraft, the RPK for these generic aircraft is determined based on the movements of the most commonly used narrow-body and wide-body aircraft79. For both aircraft types, a number of flight segments are created (Table 2), which are used to generate aircraft fleets (see Fleet dynamics). Flights are divided into distance segments, each given a representative flight distance, used when modelling the segment’s flights (see Aircraft performance and aircraft product systems). Furthermore, separate segments are identified for intra-Europe or extra-Europe flights, using our definition of ‘Europe’, as this factor is considered in the introduction of hydrogen aircraft, shown in the last column of Table 2 (see Fleet dynamics). A generic seat occupancy of 80% is assumed. This value is in line with historic trends55 but below aspirational goals16. However, this does not influence the comparative assessment between scenarios. Seat occupancy was found to have a relatively limited impact on the overall results when compared to other variables (Supplementary Fig. 10).

The demand for 2024-2070 following the EUROCONTROL pathways (‘low growth’, ‘base growth’, and ‘high growth’) is determined by combining EUROCONTROL’s seven-year50 and 2050 forecasts51. For 2024-2031, the 2019 data is scaled according to the projections for en-route service unites. For 2032-2070, the projected growth rate in flight numbers is used; by scaling the 2019 data as a whole, we neglect the trend towards larger aircraft and further flight distances13. Our ‘degrowth’ pathway strongly deviates from any industry forecast. This pathway is based on a panel consultation of the Dutch population on achieving national climate targets54. Several of the options most widely chosen by participants involve the suppression of commercial aviation, aligning with public support in France and the United Kingdom to disincentivise air travel52,53. The authors report this as two measures: a ban on flights to destinations within 600 km and a reduction in the number of flights by 30%54. We, therefore, opt for a linear reduction in yearly RPK from 2024 to 2034, after which it stagnates at 70% of the 2019 value. No distinction is made among distance segments when applying these growth trajectories.

Fleet dynamics

There are several ways to represent the technological development of aircraft as a function of time. We use a dynamic stock-and-flow model representing long-lived capital goods, covering both aircraft and key AAF production infrastructure (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Fleets are formed by combining stocks that perform the same function, e.g., representing different generations of narrow-body aircraft. After defining an initial condition for each fleet, its composition changes at each time interval: units which pass their maximum age leave the fleet, after which enough units enter the fleet so that the fleet can meet its required output (see Table 2). To this end, the seating capacity, yearly distance flown, fuel type, and operational lifetime are key aircraft characteristics (Table 3), while plants in the AAF supply chain are described by their yearly production capacity and operational lifetime (Table 4). Generally, an older aircraft is replaced before reaching its design lifetime, in the range of 25-30 years, provided that the airline operating it can afford the new model28,55,80. Several economic factors feed into this, which are beyond our scope. Instead, we use a constant maximum age of 22 years for all aircraft and set up an initial fleet with a mean age of around 11 years30.

The fuel type of aircraft factors into their fleet dynamics based on the compatibility of hydrogen aircraft with the flight segments. The value used here (Table 2) indicates what share of aircraft introduced to satisfy the segment’s demand is hydrogen aircraft, provided a suitable hydrogen aircraft exists for the specified time and scenario (Supplementary Fig. 3). Following the Destination 2050 report13, we assume that early hydrogen aircraft exclusively service intra-Europe routes. A potential of 1 implies that all intra-Europe flights are eventually serviced by hydrogen aircraft. However, this does not require all European airports to immediately accommodate hydrogen aircraft, as the new aircraft introduced yearly only represent a minority of the total fleet. Furthermore, to reflect that there could be hydrogen-compatible airports outside of Europe, the extra-Europe wide-body segments are given a hydrogen potential of 0.5.

Fuel supply and fuel product system

We base the introduction of AAF on the ReFuelEU Aviation rules. These describe the minimum volume of compliant AAF that must be used in a given period. This is generalised to a set share per year (Fig. 1c). To evaluate this share, ReFuelEU Aviation specifies that hydrogen should be considered based on energy content18. We extend this to e-fuel, assuming a lower heating value (LHV) for each fuel: 43 MJ/kg for fossil kerosene, 45 MJ/kg for e-fuel, and 120 MJ/kg for hydrogen.

The logical order applied when quantifying the fuel supply starts from the reference flow, with the air traffic demands being used to construct the aircraft fleets (see Fleet dynamics). For each time interval, the activity of the aircraft fleet requires a certain volume of hydrocarbon fuels (here, fossil kerosene and e-fuel) and liquid hydrogen. In scenarios that comply with a certain minimum volume of AAF, all liquid hydrogen contributes to this minimum, with the remainder achieved through e-fuel as part of the total hydrocarbon demand.

Having determined the volume of each fuel required per time interval, the fuel production chains are quantified. For fossil kerosene, this is done by connecting a relevant background process (see Prospective background lifecycle inventories). For the AAF, fleets of key production plants are created. The efficiency of production plants based on emerging technologies is defined as a function of the plant’s construction year. As estimated performances vary, this is considered as sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Hydrogen is assumed to be produced through water electrolysis using proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers. The performance of the electrolysers, including future improvements, is based on literature46,56,81 (Supplementary Table 2). The oxygen molecules (O2) obtained from electrolysis are not considered a co-product but are left out of the inventory. Hydrogen distribution is based on Sacchi et al.29, requiring 3.2 kWh/kg electricity for compression. For use on hydrogen aircraft, hydrogen is liquefied after distribution82. Liquefaction is represented by its operational energy demand alone (Supplementary Table 2). Transportation and boil-off losses are each estimated at 1%, resulting in hydrogen emission to the air.

The sorbent-based direct air capture (DAC) system is based on the inventories of Terlouw et al.83. We estimate its performance and learning rates by comparing and combining several sources84,85,86 (Supplementary Table 3). Fischer-Tropsch plants are also described by combining several sources87,88,89. Several products are created in such plants. To isolate impacts related to the production of e-fuel, physical allocation centred around lower heating value (LHV) is applied, in line with the literature. The production process is simplified to flows of CO2, H2, and electricity (Supplementary Table 4). Due to a lack of data, cooling water and wastewater are cut off.

The fuel tank-to-wing phase (i.e., combustion) distinguishes between the three fuels while accounting for the aircraft using the fuel and aspects of the flight itself. The flight is split up into the landing and take-off cycle (LTO), where emissions are relatively low to the ground, and climb/cruise/descent (CCD), where emissions are higher up. Fuel use for LTO is assumed to be consistent across flights, while CCD scales with the flight distance. Inventories for hydrocarbon fuels are based on the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook90. Metal impurities released when combusting fossil kerosene, taken from the ecoinvent 3.9.1 database91, are also included in these inventories but do not affect climate change. E-fuel is assumed not to have these metal impurities nor sulphur impurities, meaning that no sulphur oxides (SOx) are formed. Inventories for hydrogen use assume a gas turbine63, resulting in NOx emissions and contrail formation, although we make no further distinction with a fuel cell-driven electric powertrain.

Aircraft performance and aircraft product systems

The present fleet is represented using the fuel use, emissions, and seating capacity of common aircraft, used as proxies. These are the Airbus A320 and A320neo narrow-body aircraft and the Boeing 777-300 and Airbus A350-900 wide-body aircraft (Table 3 and Table 5). This choice of reference aircraft is adopted from Grewe et al.30. The newer of these aircraft (meaning the A320neo and A350-900) are also used as reference for future generations (Table 6). The business-as-usual scenario is based on the historical trends in performance observed by Cox et al.55. Grewe et al.30 provide expert estimates for the improvements that could be achieved in conventional aircraft over the course of the coming decades, which forms our optimistic scenario. Speculatively, larger improvements are possible when introducing new aircraft concepts, represented in the breakthrough scenario, which uses values obtained from Cox et al.55.

For hydrogen aircraft, estimates reported by ICAO are used92. These express three scenarios for the fuel use of hydrogen aircraft relative to their contemporary conventional aircraft while accounting for payload capacity. The resulting range aligns with values reported elsewhere82,93,94. To streamline the scenario space, hydrogen and hydrocarbon aircraft performances are combined into a single variable.

Cradle-to-gate and end-of-life processes are included for each aircraft entering and leaving the fleet. We adapt aircraft material composition (Supplementary Table 5) and the energy demands of these processes from Cox et al.55. Industry estimates95,96,97 are used to quantify manufacturing waste through so-called buy-to-fly rations: 8:1 for aluminium alloy95, 1.5:1 for composites96, and 2.2:1 for other materials97. Since hydrogen aircraft are likely to have a higher operating empty weight (OEW) than contemporary hydrocarbon aircraft, their mass is increased by 10%22, but no change to their relative material composition is considered. For the sake of simplicity, aircraft cradle-to-gate and end-of-life processes, including OEW, are considered independent from aircraft performance.

Prospective background lifecycle inventories

The inventories created through the methods described above use economic activities not modelled within this work, but directly adopted from another source. Through these activities, the service system connects itself to the background. The background databases used here are each generated using the Python library premise46. This library enables the transformation of an ecoinvent database to align with the regions and scenarios of an integrated assessment model, adding several additional activities in the process.

The ‘SSP2-PkBudg1150’ pathway of the REMIND model98 is used to generate background databases for the narrative scenarios. In this pathway, the global mean surface temperature increase by 2100 is around 1.7 °C, thereby achieving the goal of the Paris Agreement. Databases are generated for five-year time intervals. Selected flows which connect to the foreground are then exported and linearly interpolated to align with the one-year time interval. The ‘EUR’ region of REMIND is assumed to be representative of the geographic region considered. As a sensitivity analysis, a prospective hydrogen market generated for this pathway by Wei et al.21 is used instead of the assumption that all hydrogen is created through electrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Impact assessment

Aviation has several environmental effects, noise, air quality degradation, and climate change being among the most prevalent. Focussing on climate change, a topic of interest is the non-CO2 effects of aviation. The most prevalent of these are caused by nitrogen oxides (NOx) and by condensation of water into contrails, resulting in aviation-induced cloudiness (AIC)2. However, the short lifespan of these climate forcers raises conceptual challenges41. For example, calculating the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of a climate forcer simplifies its impact to a static number, but makes it dependent on the chosen time horizon and misrepresents its impact over time40. In order to address these challenges, Allen et al.40 introduced the concept of GWP*, which scales according to the change in emissions over time, rather than the absolute quantity emitted. In the following years, Cain et al.99 and Smith et al.61 expand and refine the calculation of warming-equivalent emissions, focussing their calibration on the impact of methane (CH4). Quantifying climate impacts in terms of warming equivalence is useful in obtaining an impression of the temperature response within the temporal scope considered. This temperature change is calculated by multiplying the warming-equivalent emissions with the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) factor. Likely, TCRE falls in the range of 0.27-0.63 K per 1000 Gton CO2—here, we use the best estimate of 0.45 K per 1000 Gton CO262. A drawback of expressing impact following warming equivalence is that climate forcing beyond the temporal scope at hand is obfuscated.

Klöwer et al.31, Sacchi et al.29, and Arriolabengoa et al.42 have each assessed aviation based on warming-equivalent emissions, although the details of their implementations vary substantially. We base our calculations on Arriolabengoa et al., directly adapting their code in ours100, defining warming-equivalent emissions as:

$${E}^{* }\left(t\right)=\frac{g(s)}{{{{\rm{AGWP}}}}_{H}}\left[H\left(1-s\right)\frac{\Delta F\left(t\right)}{\Delta t}+{sF}\left(t\right)\right]$$

(1)

where

$$g\left(s\right)=\frac{1-\exp \left(\frac{-s}{1-s}\right)}{s}$$

(2)

As such, warming-equivalent emissions are made up of two terms: the extent to which warming equivalence is determined by a change in radiative forcing ∆F(t) due to variations over a time period ∆t, and the extent to which it is determined by the immediate forcing of those emissions, F(t). The unitless parameter s determines the proportional contribution of each term. AGWPH is the Absolute Global Warming Potential of CO2 with respect to a time horizon H, here, 100 years. We use values for s and ∆t proposed by Arriolabengoa et al. as ‘updated settings’. These represent impacts relating to the lifetime of CH4 (such as the effect of NOx on decreasing atmospheric CH4) following the calibration of Cain et al.99 (s = 0.25, ∆t = 20), while modelling climate forcers with shorter-lived effects (such as persistent contrails) based entirely on year-on-year changes in emission (s = 0.0, ∆t = 1). This is conceptually similar to the approach Sacchi et al. take to very-short-lived effects29.

However, the parameters of Arriolabengoa et al. only extend to non-CO2 effects stemming from flight itself42: contrails, NOx, H2O, soot, and SOx. In order to adequately represent the impact of ground-level activities beyond CO2, we reintroduce the parameters for CH4 and introduce new ones for the direct emission of H2. To do so, we use the radiative efficiency of Paulot et al.101. Hydrogen influences radiative forcing indirectly, by affecting the production of methane, ozone, and stratospheric water. We therefore give it the same warming-equivalent parameters as CH4 and the more persistent effects of NOx. Since the contribution of CH4 and H2 to the results is minimal (Supplementary Fig. 6), we consider it unnecessary to include additional climate forcers, which we expect to have comparable or smaller contributions.

The principle used by Sacchi et al.29 to consider the effect of fuel composition on ice crystal formation64 is adopted. This is estimated using the hydrogen mass fraction of the fuel, which is taken to be 13.73% for fossil kerosene and 15.29% for e-fuel. Following the relation of Sacchi et al., using e-fuel instead of fossil kerosene would reduce AIC impacts by 65.95%. For hydrogen-powered aircraft, we furthermore adopt the assumption of Kossarev et al.22 that e-fuel and hydrogen result in similar AIC impacts. However, Kossarev et al. estimate this reduction to be no more than 40%, indicating that our estimates for AIC of AAF are relatively optimistic. Even with this large reduction, AIC remains the most prominent contributor to temperature change (Supplementary Fig. 6). It must be stressed that the AIC impact of future fuels is a subject of ongoing research, with additional uncertainty added by the possibility of contrail avoidance strategies, which are not covered in this work.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02935-5/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2935_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-11-27 13:58:52.519063

Silk Way West Airlines orders two additional A350F freighters

Silk Way West Airlines, based in Baku, Azerbaijan, has signed a firm contract for two additional Airbus A350F freighter aircraft, taking its total order to four. The agreement underpins the airline’s fleet modernisation and expansion strategy as it looks to strengthen its position in the global air freight market.

Wolfgang Meier, president of Silk Way West Airlines, said: “We are delighted to extend our partnership with Airbus on the A350F programme. This order, bringing our total commitment to four aircraft, marks a major milestone in our company’s growth and reflects our confidence in the future of sustainable air freight. The A350F will strengthen our leading position in the global air freight market as we continue to modernise our fleet and reduce our carbon footprint.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus executive vice-president of sales (Commercial Aircraft business), said: “This repeat order from Silk Way West Airlines, the largest cargo airline in the Caspian Sea region, is a great vote of confidence at a time when the A350F is physically taking shape in our assembly lines. The A350F will ensure the airline maintains its leading position in the global air freight market and further enables its key role in developing Azerbaijan as a major global cargo hub at the heart of the Silk Road.”

The A350F features the largest main deck cargo door in the industry, with fuselage length and capacity optimised around standard pallets and containers. Over 70% of the airframe is made of advanced materials, resulting in a 46-tonne lighter take-off weight than competing derivatives. It is also the only freighter aircraft that will fully meet ICAO’s enhanced CO2 emissions standards, which come into effect in 2027. Assembly of the test aircraft is currently underway in Toulouse.

The A350F can carry a payload of up to 111 tonnes and fly up to 4,700nm. Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, the aeroplane will deliver up to 40% lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to previous-generation freighters with similar payload-range capability. It will be able to operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at entry into service, with the aim of achieving 100% capability by 2030, in line with all Airbus aircraft. By the end of October 2025, the all-new A350F had secured 74 orders from 12 customers worldwide.

The project, known as Eq.flight, will be led by Equilibrion, which NEG8 Carbon said is pioneering the drive to decarbonize aviation using low-carbon nuclear energy through small and advanced modular reactors.

Equilibrion was awarded £1 million (USD$1.32 million) for Phase 1 of the Eq.flight project as part of the U.K. Department of Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund 2025 investment of £63 million (USD$83.1 million) in 17 clean-aviation initiatives, bringing to £198 million (USD$261.3 million) the total value of state investment in this area since 2022.

NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology is particularly suitable for this project as it uses low-carbon heat and electricity from nuclear, which the company said greatly reduces the cost and increases efficiency of the DAC process.

“This positions NEG8 Carbon as one of the leaders in the field to produce sustainable aviation fuel using direct air capture of CO2,” said Ray Naughton, NEG8 Carbon founder and managing director. “The potential in this market is driven by the EU and U.K. government mandates to airlines to use more SAF in their fuel mix progressing to 70 percent in the EU by 2050. This creates a global SAF market with a value of $400 billion by 2050. NEG8 Carbon is now positioned to be a major player in this market.”

Philip Rogers and Caroline Longman, co-founders and directors at Equilibrion, said, “We are committed to developing solutions that enable the aviation sector to offer lower-emission flights to customers around the world by leveraging low-carbon nuclear electricity and heat. Power-to-liquids (PTL) powered by advanced nuclear reactors offers the potential for the scale of production needed to make a major impact on climate change.”

Direct air capture is a technology that extracts carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air.

NEG8 Carbon’s DAC technology works by using fans to draw in large quantities of air and passing it through NEG8’s revolutionary low-cost CO2-extraction system.

The extracted CO2 is either permanently stored underground or used practically in carbon-utilization processes.

SAF is produced from a broad range of materials and feedstocks, whereas eSAF is made from CO2 captured from the air and green hydrogen.

DAC is the only technology that can provide a large-scale source of green CO2 at million-ton scale at the eSAF production location.

Equilibrion is a U.K.-based project developer and consultancy focused on using the potential of nuclear power to mitigate climate change.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_fb3406b968f7423bae99ecb7c58dabf1~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_840,h_540,al_c,lg_1,q_85/80995f_fb3406b968f7423bae99ecb7c58dabf1~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-27 13:58:59.442869

HEFA SAF requires approximately 50 kg of hydrogen per ton to support hydrotreating, while AtJ SAF also consumes hydrogen during the hydrogenation step to stabilize alcohol-derived intermediates.
In contrast, PtL SAF, produced from green hydrogen and captured CO₂, requires roughly 660 kg of hydrogen per ton of SAF7.
To meet India’s 1% SAF blending target (~112 kilotons of SAF), this translates to ~5.6 kilotons of hydrogen for HEFA/AtJ SAF and ~74 kilotons for PtL SAF.
Overcoming these challenges will require coordinated policy support, technology demonstration, and investment signals, without which hydrogen’s potential to anchor India’s SAF roadmap will remain unrealized.","India’s aviation sector has grown rapidly over the past decade, with domestic passenger numbers increasing from around 50 million in 2010 to approximately 230 million in 20241. To address the sector’s rising emissions, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, Government of India, set an indicative target of blending 1% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 for international flights2.

While modest compared to the European Union (EU)’s ReFuel EU mandate (2% by 2025, 20% by 2035), this step is ambitious in India’s context, translating into around 140 million liters (112 kilo tons) of SAF annually3,4. Meeting even India’s initial target will require a rapid scaleup in SAF production, but the availability of sustainable feedstocks remains a critical bottleneck.

India’s Feedstock Dilemma

Major SAF technologies differ in their feedstock requirements. Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) primarily rely on oils and fats, including plant oils, animal fats, and waste cooking oils. Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) uses alcohols derived from sugars or starches, while Fischer-Tropsch (FT) depends on gasified biomass5. Given India’s immature supply chain coupled with infrastructural constraints for suitable oils, fats, and biomass, scaling aviation fuels remains challenging.

This underscores the need to diversify into hydrogen-based Power-to-Liquids (PtL) as a complementary pathway, particularly if India aims to achieve even the initial 1% SAF blending target.

Hydrogen’s Role in SAF Production

Hydrogen is not only a future aviation fuel in its own right, but also a critical enabler of SAF production across all major pathways. In the HEFA route, which produces most of today’s SAF, hydrogen is used in hydrotreating to remove oxygen from oils/fats. In the PtL pathway, green hydrogen combines with captured CO₂ to create syngas that is converted into synthetic kerosene. In the AtJ pathway, hydrogen is required in the hydrogenation step to stabilize intermediates from ethanol or iso-butanol. Together, these pathways highlight hydrogen’s critical role in producing aviation-ready fuels, making the alignment of India’s SAF and hydrogen strategies essential5.

Globally, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects SAF to contribute nearly 65% of aviation’s emission reductions by 2050, with the remaining ~35% coming from hydrogen propulsion, efficiency gains, new aircraft technologies, etc6.

Hydrogen-based PtL Fuels are Essential

The hydrogen requirement for SAF production varies significantly depending on the production pathway. HEFA SAF requires approximately 50 kg of hydrogen per ton to support hydrotreating, while AtJ SAF also consumes hydrogen during the hydrogenation step to stabilize alcohol-derived intermediates. In contrast, PtL SAF, produced from green hydrogen and captured CO₂, requires roughly 660 kg of hydrogen per ton of SAF7.

To meet India’s 1% SAF blending target (~112 kilotons of SAF), this translates to ~5.6 kilotons of hydrogen for HEFA/AtJ SAF and ~74 kilotons for PtL SAF. Looking further ahead to 2030, with an estimated 16 MMT of ATF consumption8, achieving a 5% SAF blend (~800 kilotons) would require around 40 kilotons of hydrogen for conventional HEFA/AtJ SAF and roughly 528 kilotons for PtL SAF.

This represents about 0.8% of India’s projected 5 MMT (by 2030) green hydrogen target for HEFA/AtJ SAF and roughly 10.6% for PtL SAF, illustrating the substantially higher hydrogen demand for synthetic SAF production, and the critical role hydrogen will play in enabling scalable, sustainable aviation fuels in India.

Why Hydrogen Matters for India’s SAF Roadmap

With India setting its SAF blending targets, the critical question is not just how much SAF is needed, but how it will be produced at scale. Hydrogen provides a unique lever here, not as a competing fuel, but as the backbone of synthetic SAF pathways that can complement limited bio-based options.

Hydrogen strengthens India’s SAF strategy in several critical ways:

Feedstock security: Relying on HEFA technology is not a sustainable long-term strategy for India, given its dependence on a weak and underdeveloped supply chain for oils and fats. These feedstocks are in limited supply and face high competition from the food and industrial sectors, placing additional stress on an already fragile system.

Scalability: Unlike bio-based SAF, which is capped by land and feedstock availability, hydrogen-based PtL can scale in line with India’s renewable energy expansion. With ambitious targets of 500 GW of renewables by 2030, India has the potential to anchor a robust PtL supply chain for aviation.

Policy alignment: India has already launched four hydrogen valleys in Pune, Kerala, Odisha, and Rajasthan, as regional innovation clusters for hydrogen production, storage, and use. These could anchor future SAF production units by supplying hydrogen directly to airport-linked blending facilities.

Export opportunity: Mandates in the EU (2% by 2025, 70% by 2050), the UK (10% by 2030, 22% by 2040), the US (3 billion gallons by 2030 under the SAF Grand Challenge), and Japan (10% by 2030 for international flights) will create sustained global demand for SAF9. By aligning its SAF and hydrogen strategies with these international targets, India can position itself as a reliable contributor to global supply chains while strengthening its own energy transition.

Roadblocks on India’s Hydrogen-to-SAF Journey

While hydrogen offers a long-term solution for scalable SAF, its adoption faces significant economic, technological, and policy hurdles. Addressing these barriers is critical if India is to move beyond pilot projects and establish PtL as a viable pathway for aviation decarbonization.

High costs: Green hydrogen in India today costs around $4–5/kg, which translates into PtL SAF costs of $8–10/l. This is far higher than the conventional process. For PtL SAF to be commercially viable, hydrogen prices need to fall closer to $2/kg, a level not yet achieved.

Capital intensity and infrastructure needs: PtL production requires investment in large-scale electrolysers, CO₂ capture systems, and Fischer–Tropsch or methanol to jet conversion units. Developing this infrastructure involves multi-billion-dollar outlays and long construction timelines, making financing difficult without strong policy support or long-term offtake agreements.

CO₂ supply chain: PtL SAF depends on a steady stream of concentrated CO₂. In India, carbon capture and utilization infrastructure is still nascent, and transporting CO₂ from industrial clusters to SAF plants adds cost and complexity. Building reliable CO₂ logistics is therefore a major bottleneck.

Technology maturity: Unlike HEFA and AtJ, which are already proven at or near commercial scale, PtL remains at TRL 6–7 globally, with only a handful of pilot and early demonstration plants in operation. India lacks experience with such projects, creating uncertainty over efficiency, yields, and integration with refinery or airport operations.

Overcoming these challenges will require coordinated policy support, technology demonstration, and investment signals, without which hydrogen’s potential to anchor India’s SAF roadmap will remain unrealized.

The Way Forward: Unlocking Hydrogen-enabled SAF

To translate ambition into action, India must create the right policy, financing, and infrastructure environment. Key priorities include:

Global positioning: Leverage India’s potential for low-cost green hydrogen to tap into export opportunities. With the EU, UK, US, and Japan setting ambitious SAF mandates, India can position itself as a competitive supplier to meet the emerging demand gap.

Policy integration: Extend support under the National Green Hydrogen Mission (NGHM) to SAF projects, ensuring hydrogen use in aviation is explicitly recognized. This will align India’s aviation decarbonization with its broader hydrogen strategy.

Demonstration at scale: Fund and fast-track 1–2 PtL pilot projects (similar to Norsk e-Fuel in Norway or Atmosfair in Germany) to build local experience, validate technology performance, and de-risk investment.

Market creation: Provide targeted incentives for airlines through viability gap funding and tradable carbon credits to offset the current cost premium of SAF and send a clear demand signal.

Hub development: Position refineries and major airports as dual decarbonization hubs. Refineries bring hydrogen expertise and proximity to CO₂ sources, while airports can host SAF blending and hydrogen pilots with major hubs. Together, these can create integrated supply chains linking hydrogen, CO₂, and aviation fuel demand.

Conclusion

India’s aviation sector is at a pivotal moment in its energy transition. With surging domestic air travel and established SAF blending targets, the challenge lies not in ambition, but scale, and here hydrogen is the critical unlock. Conventional SAF routes like HEFA are constrained by weak and underdeveloped oil/fat supply chains, while AtJ depends on biomass, which is already stretched across other programs.

Hydrogen, by contrast, enables PtLs, a pathway independent of traditional biomass-based feedstocks, scalable with India’s renewable energy growth, and capable of meeting both domestic and global SAF demand. By aligning SAF ambitions with the NGHM, and leveraging airports and refineries as decarbonization hubs, India can establish hydrogen as the cornerstone of a sustainable aviation future.

Regional economic transformations The rise of private aviation in the Middle East cannot be separated from the region’s economic transformation.
In this transformation, the Middle East is not simply participating in a global trend; it is helping define it.","Private aviation has long occupied a distinctive corner of global air transport. For most of its history, it served a narrow group of users: government leaders, corporate executives and high-net-worth individuals who required discretion, direct routing and time efficiency. Its scale was modest and its growth uneven. The economics of the sector rose and fell with corporate cycles, and demand was concentrated in the United States and Western Europe. For decades, private aviation was important to those who relied on it, but it remained peripheral to the wider aviation system.

Its limitations were technical as much as economic. Early jets could not fly long distances without multiple stops, and their operational flexibility was heavily constrained. They were true premium assets, but they were not yet strategic tools. The industry operated according to the rhythm of business travel in mature economies, and few expected that its global geography would one day shift.

Technology and wealth redraw the map

The first major turning point arrived in the early 2000s, when manufacturers introduced long-range, large-cabin aircraft capable of connecting distant financial and industrial centres.

The Gulfstream G550, Bombardier Global Express and Dassault Falcon 7X redefined the limits of private aviation. Journeys that once required multiple segments—Dubai to London, Jeddah to Singapore—became nonstop. Private aviation could now offer significant time savings, with considerably lower operational friction.

At the same time, global wealth distribution was becoming increasingly unequal. Emerging markets generated new investors, entrepreneurs and family conglomerates whose activities were increasingly international. Many were based in regions where commercial aviation was not fully aligned with executive requirements. Private aviation began to expand beyond its historical centres, establishing footholds in the Middle East, China, India and parts of Africa. The sector was no longer exclusively tied to Fortune-500 travel patterns; it was becoming part of the global investment landscape and cross-border business.

The pandemic and the rewiring of demand

The COVID-19 pandemic created the most significant shock in the history of private aviation. Commercial networks contracted sharply, and scheduling became unpredictable. Cross-border travel has become more complex, from testing requirements to limited routing options. In this environment, private aviation became not merely an alternative but a necessity for travellers who required certainty.

A substantial number of first-time users entered the market during this period, and many remained active even after commercial aviation recovered. Charter utilisation increased, fractional ownership expanded, and membership programmes gained momentum. By 2023, private aviation had moved from the fringes of the industry to a central position in the mobility strategies of corporations, investors and high-net-worth individuals.

This global restructuring created new questions about which regions would shape the next decade of growth. It soon became evident that the Middle East had the right mix of geography, wealth, and infrastructure to emerge as a leading centre of private aviation activity.

Why the Middle East

Several fundamental characteristics explain why the Middle East has become one of the world’s fastest-growing private aviation markets.

Geography is central. The region is positioned at the intersection of Europe, Asia and Africa, and its most common business routes are long-haul rather than short-distance. In this context, large-cabin and ultra-long-range jets offer clear advantages. No region outside North America relies so heavily on this upper segment of the private-jet fleet.

Economic structure reinforces this geographical advantage. The Gulf is home to some of the world’s highest concentrations of wealth, including sovereign funds, family offices and multinational corporate headquarters. These institutions operate across continents and require mobility that aligns with complex investment flows and project oversight. Private aviation enables direct travel between strategic locations without the constraints of commercial scheduling, making it an essential tool rather than a discretionary luxury.

Infrastructure that supports scale

The expansion of private aviation in the Middle East has also been accelerated by modern, well-financed infrastructure.

Countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia have invested heavily in fixed-base operators, private terminals and maintenance facilities that match or outperform those in more established aviation markets. This infrastructure reduces operational delays, enhances reliability and supports higher fleet utilisation. In turn, it has encouraged operators to expand their presence and invest in new aircraft.

These developments have enabled the region to support rapid, stable demand growth. Data shows that the Middle East and Africa business-jet market is valued at approximately $1.4 billion in 2025 and is expected to exceed $2.1 billion by 2030. This trajectory implies annual growth close to 9%, significantly higher than the global average. Projections for 2026 to 2035 indicate that the region will acquire roughly 160 new business aircraft valued at $8.6 billion, with the majority being long-range models suited to regional travel profiles.

Diversification of business models

One of the most important developments in the Middle Eastern private-aviation sector is the diversification of its customer base and business models.

Charter activity has expanded as digital platforms simplify access and reduce the administrative barriers associated with traditional private-jet booking. Fractional ownership and jet-membership schemes have also gained ground, creating more predictable revenue streams for operators and lowering the financial threshold for customers.

These shifts matter because they make the industry less vulnerable to economic cycles. While private aviation will always reflect broader macroeconomic trends, the expansion of charter and membership models has introduced a degree of stability that was not present two decades ago. The sector is evolving into a more mature, structurally supported component of the regional economy.

Regional economic transformations

The rise of private aviation in the Middle East cannot be separated from the region’s economic transformation.

Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 has created large, geographically dispersed industrial and tourism projects requiring frequent senior-level travel. The UAE’s continued development as a global business and tourism hub generates constant movement between international markets. Qatar’s growing investment portfolio reinforces similar patterns of mobility. In each case, private aviation enables the speed and flexibility required to manage projects, partnerships, and capital flows.

Tourism and events further strengthen demand. The Middle East has become a global host for investment conferences, major cultural gatherings and high-profile sporting events. These occasions significantly increase private-jet arrivals, and their frequency signals the region’s long-term role as an international events hub.

The next decade

As the region continues to expand its private-aviation footprint, several long-term trends will shape the next decade. One of the most visible is fleet modernisation. Operators are increasingly investing in aircraft with greater fuel efficiency, advanced avionics and improved operating economics. These upgrades reduce long-term costs and align with the region’s ambition to establish a modern, resilient aviation ecosystem.

Sustainability will play an increasingly important role in shaping both operational decisions and regulatory frameworks. Although private aviation faces scrutiny over emissions, manufacturers have begun producing aircraft that are compatible with higher blends of sustainable aviation fuel. The Middle East’s early investment in SAF production, particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, suggests that supply chains will gradually expand, enabling cleaner operations.

Advanced air mobility represents another shift. Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft are expected to appear in the Gulf within the next decade. These aircraft will complement, rather than compete with, long-range business jets by providing short-distance connectivity between airports, city centres and coastal developments. Their integration into private-aviation networks could reshape how high-net-worth travellers move within metropolitan areas.

A moving market

Private aviation has travelled a long distance from its origins as a narrow, cyclical segment of global aviation.

The Middle East’s rise as a private-aviation hub reflects deeper economic and geographic trends: diversified economies, high levels of cross-border investment, world-class infrastructure and a strategic location between major global regions. As the industry modernises, adopts cleaner technologies and integrates new mobility systems, private aviation is becoming more embedded in the mechanisms of regional growth.

The next decade will not only bring more aircraft and higher utilisation, but also greater efficiency. It will reshape mobility in the Gulf’s economic model, making private aviation a structural element of investment flows, tourism development, industrial strategy, and global connectivity. In this transformation, the Middle East is not simply participating in a global trend; it is helping define it.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/11/27/Global-Express-XRS-Exterior-Australia-Sunset_1-scaled-1-scaled.webp,N,,2025-11-27 14:56:48.035118

All the aircraft, like the rest of the Qantas fleet, will carry Australian products and suppliers on board.
Making Australians proud of Qantas is what we are really purposeful about.” Vanessa Hudson is chief executive and managing director of Qantas.","Ms Hudson told The Australian that Qantas – which spends $5bn a year on fuel – believed Australia was well placed to develop its own local sustainable aviation fuel resource.

But ongoing government support would be crucial to make the fuel commercially viable.

“We think there is a great opportunity to work with the Australian government to find more of those opportunities and really set a course to create a new industry of sustainable aviation fuel in Australia,” the CEO said, citing a fledgling north Queensland operation turning sugar cane by-product into ethanol as the basis for aviation fuel.

“We are a country that should be able to lead technically in this space because we’ve got significant agriculture and feedstock for such an industry, which could create economic growth and 13,000 more jobs.

“If we think about fuel and fuel security, we think there is a national interest that could come from that as well. These things are never easy, it is new technology and the government has taken really positive steps so far on this journey and we are looking forward to continuing to work with them.”

It was revealed in September that after years of lobbying by the aviation industry, the federal government announced it would contribute $1.1bn to power the production of “greener” fuel that would help airlines reduce their carbon footprint.

Meanwhile, Ms Hudson confirmed that Qantas was on track with its plans to complete a historic fleet renewal, including the ambitious Project Sunrise, enabling direct flights from Sydney and Melbourne to New York and London from next year using the Airbus A350-1000.

“The fleet renewal that is under way is the largest renewal we have ever done in our history,” Ms Hudson said.

“We are renewing the Jetstar fleet, we are renewing the domestic narrow-body fleet, we’re introducing the breakthrough Project Sunrise long-range aircraft next year. Then we will start to renew the international fleet from there.”

As Airbus builds the aircraft in Toulouse, the Australian-based Project Sunrise team busily preparing for the historic flights include fleet programs teams, flight planning, network, flight operations, cabin crew, operations centres, airports, lounges, engineering and operational readiness teams. All the aircraft, like the rest of the Qantas fleet, will carry Australian products and suppliers on board.

Ms Hudson, celebrating two years in the top job, says her team made a decision to have a laser-focus on the basics to turn the airline’s fortunes around.

“We have stabilised things and we’ve got our customer satisfaction and our performance back to a really good place, but what is really important looking forward is that we get this fleet renewal done.

With the high profit margins giving VAM producers a positive outlook for increasing production and, therefore, flexibility to offer lower prices, many consumers were remaining cautious about making large purchases.

The decline in VAM prices was happening at the same time as there was a lot of available supply. Most of the needs were satisfied by domestic suppliers. There were no disruptions in either the Gulf Coast ethylene supply or natural gas supply. The moderate prices of energy helped maintain healthy operating profit margins for VAM producers, who therefore continued to operate at high levels of production capacity.

The combination of changes in feedstock dynamics contributed to the softness within the industry. Acetic acid's price decrease was rather limited, while ethylene experienced significantly larger drops, translating into lower costs for production. As a result, with both items decreasing, there is now less cost support from Acetic Acid and Ethylene, plus VAM's only remaining support will be competitive pressure.

The VAM demand signals are mixed with steady consumption in PVA applications such as packages, construction, adhesives, and detergent pods, indicating a degree of resiliency. However, the overall market confidence is being brought down by weakness in the EVA segment, where, due to declining orders for photovoltaic and foam products, there has been a slowdown in the production and sales of these products. The competitive nature of the overseas offers further adds to this pressure and restricts the potential for any domestic pricing rebound.

In November, Celanese, an industry-leading producer of VAM, announced its 3rd quarter results for 2025. These results are indicative of the larger difficulties being faced by chemical markets. For the 3rd quarter, Celanese had net sales for the quarter of $2.4 billion, representing a 4% decrease from the previous quarter; both volumes and prices have declined. Celanese indicated that demand headwinds are impacting all its end-use sectors, and thus, has created a cautious purchasing environment, which has affected the way VAM is being traded in the month of November.

As we move forward, the recent bearish trend for VAM prices will likely continue short term because of the influx of bears and the reliability of plants. However, given that a significant portion (61%) of VAM production comes from the industrial-grade market, there is still strong demand within the coatings and adhesives markets to help offset pricing decreases.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-27 11:57:39.379436

The report concludes that the global energy transition will only be fair and effective if it acknowledges the diversity of pathways.","The Bioeconomy Observatory of Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV) releases a groundbreaking study analyzing the effectiveness of tropical bioenergy in the global energy transition and the distortions caused by international policies that, under the guise of sustainability, end up favoring selected technologies over more effective alternatives for emission reductions.

The report, titled ""Tropical bioenergy and the dilemmas of the energy transition: technological neutrality and global valuation of national solutions,"" warns of the risks of an asymmetrically driven transition marked by climate barriers that could penalize low-carbon solutions developed by tropical countries. The study argues that climate and energy policies must be guided by technological neutrality and the evaluation of the effective climate performance of different decarbonization pathways—not by geopolitical, technological, or regional preferences.

""The energy transition needs to be guided by performance, not by preferences. Brazil demonstrates that it is possible to utilize local solutions to reduce emissions on a large scale with economic sustainability, social inclusion, and local innovation,"" summarizes Luciano Rodrigues, research coordinator.

Mobility: tropical efficiency exceeds global powers

The report takes vehicle mobility as an example and highlights how tropical solutions can be effective, accessible, and scalable in decarbonization.

Based on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)—which considers emissions from vehicle and fuel production to usage and disposal—the study shows that new vehicles sold in Brazil emit, on average, 31% less CO₂ per kilometer than those in the European Union, 34% less than those in the United States, and 42% below the Chinese average.

A hydrated ethanol vehicle (E100) emits about 85 gCO₂e/km, a value nearly three times lower than that of gasoline vehicles in developed markets, whose averages range from 232 to 241 gCO₂e/km. Even flex-fuel models (E50)—fueled with half ethanol and half gasoline—maintain an advantage of 60 to 70 gCO₂e/km over international averages.

For hybrids (HEVs), Brazilian performance is even more impressive: a hybrid powered exclusively by ethanol (E100 HEV) emits only 79 gCO₂e/km, surpassing pure electric vehicles (BEVs) in the markets of Europe, the U.S., and China, where emissions range from 128 to 233 gCO₂e/km when including the footprints of battery production and disposal.

""Sustainable biofuel and electrification deliver immediate efficiency with competitive costs, existing supply networks, and low climate impact. It is a tropical solution with global results,"" adds Rodrigues.

Share of different classes of new vehicles in sales in 2024 and average GHG emissions (sales in % and emissions in g CO2 eq./km)

Distortions and barriers in global policies

The analysis challenges recurring narratives, such as the supposed ""food versus fuel"" dilemma—according to which the production of biofuels competes with food production. Data show that this hypothesis does not hold: bioenergy has contributed to generating jobs and income, elevating agricultural productivity, and strengthening food security, provided it is produced sustainably.

Another sensitive point is the application of so-called indirect land use change (iLUC) factors with generic parameters and without scientific consensus that disproportionately penalize biofuels. The study notes that these criteria are rarely applied to other energy sources that also alter land use and do not reflect the specificities of the Brazilian model, such as the use of second-crop corn and the recovery of degraded pastures.

In the European Union, recent policies impose strict limits on the use of agricultural biofuels and apply multiplication factors that artificially increase the weight of electricity and synthetic fuels in renewable energy targets. The ReFuelEU itself excludes conventional biofuels from the definition of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In the United States, Brazilian corn ethanol is treated the same as American ethanol, imposing penalties based on indirect emissions that do not reflect the tropical reality.

""Although Brazil's results are concrete and verifiable, biofuels are still viewed with suspicion by some countries. There is bias and an absence of objective criteria in defining what is ‘green’ or ‘clean’,"" emphasizes Rodrigues.

Technological neutrality and energy integration

The study recommends that technological neutrality be adopted as a guiding principle of decarbonization policies, ensuring equitable conditions of recognition and incentive for all pathways that demonstrate measurable and scientifically proven climate efficiency.

For Brazil, the authors propose strengthening structural programs such as RenovaBio, sustainable mobility policies, the biogas program, and the development of the market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), ensuring regulatory predictability and eliminating fiscal distortions that favor technologies without proof of lower carbon intensity.

The importance of integrating bioenergy and electrification in mobility is also emphasized, creating a hybrid decarbonization model capable of uniting efficient combustion engines and complementary electric traction.

Climate diplomacy and the leadership of the Global South

The authors highlight that Brazil must strengthen its international role to reposition tropical solutions in the global climate agenda. This movement involves coordinated diplomatic action with emerging countries to harmonize criteria for recognizing sustainable biofuels and consolidate bioenergy as a legitimate tool for decarbonization.

The study emphasizes that Brazil should play an active leadership role in multilateral forums, advocating for metrics based on real emission performance rather than technological preferences. This strategy should be accompanied by knowledge generation regarding Brazilian systems and structured international communication, supported by comparative data, verifiable life cycle analyses, and scientific evidence.

Performance, equity, and recognition

With over 60% of the country's renewable energy deriving from bioenergy and nearly 30% of the internal energy supply connected to agribusiness, Brazil is already a green power, although not always recognized as such.

The report concludes that the global energy transition will only be fair and effective if it acknowledges the diversity of pathways. It is not about choosing a technology, but about measuring results fairly, transparently, and comparably.

The Bishop of Chester, the Rt Revd Mark Tanner, then rose to give his maiden speech during the first half-hour.
“I confess that sustainable aviation fuel was not a subject that I imagined I would be addressing when various noble Lords have given me advice about maiden speeches,” he began.
“We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome these steps to decarbonise our aviation industry, including investment in sustainable aviation fuels,” Baroness Pidgeon said.
“The Bill will kick-start the UK SAF industry, attracting investment and creating jobs,” he concluded.","THE world’s population has not been given “a spare planet” by God, a bishop said during the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill debate in the House of Lords last week.

Introducing the session, the Rail Minister, Lord Hendy, described the “huge economic benefits for the wider low-carbon fuels industry” of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and the UK’s initiatives “to decarbonise aviation”.

The Bishop of Chester, the Rt Revd Mark Tanner, then rose to give his maiden speech during the first half-hour. “I confess that sustainable aviation fuel was not a subject that I imagined I would be addressing when various noble Lords have given me advice about maiden speeches,” he began. “They said I would be working with high-flyers . . . that not everything was rocket science. Sustainability matters: the good Lord provided us with many things, but a spare planet was not among them, at least in this age.”

He referred to “this balance of pragmatisms” and the “need to be real about air travel being vital to modern life. It builds community, enables encounter, and crosses divides.” One such example was “Manchester Airport, where one actually lands in the diocese of Chester but disembarks in the diocese of Manchester”.

He said that “air travel does more than build community: it enables partnership and commerce. It is a vital part of the defence of our nation, as I witnessed when offering chaplaincy to our Armed Forces.” At the same time, “its environmental impact must be addressed. This means that Net Zero matters, but it is not the only sustainability consideration.”

He welcomed the “creation of an economic framework in which SAF becomes a viable investment”, but warned that “by itself, the Bill does not do nearly enough.” He spoke out for investment “in rail and in environmental road transport” and “timescales for substantive provision of third-generation SAF”: “Our infrastructure must line up with our fundamental identity and core vocation if we are to thrive.”

A former Transport Secretary, Lord Grayling (Conservative), said that the “aviation industry is under growing pressure over its carbon footprint” and it was subject to “flight shaming” from younger customers. “Our aviation sector is . . . a key part of our economy: it is the strongest sector in Europe; it is fundamental to our regions and to the economy of so many different parts of the country.” He urged the Government “to encourage serious investment here”.

Lord Berkeley (Labour) wanted to link the Bill to housing and domestic fuel with “a win-win solution for aviation and home heating”. For the Green Party’s Baroness Jones, the Government’s “aims for a greener, cleaner future for aviation” were “a very noble aim, but . . . impossible unless we radically rethink how we are going to deal with it”.

Viscount Trenchard (Conservative) was concerned that “the effect of the Bill is to distort the market for sustainable aviation fuel” and that “the cost of this distortion will be borne ultimately by consumers”. For Viscount Hanworth (Labour), the Bill was “a weak proposal for addressing a crisis”.

“We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome these steps to decarbonise our aviation industry, including investment in sustainable aviation fuels,” Baroness Pidgeon said. “However, we see SAF as just the first step: we want it to offer a real low-carbon alternative.”

Many of the speakers praised the Bishop of Chester’s first remarks in the Lords.

In summing up, Lord Hendy said that he agreed with Bishop Tanner “that sustainability matters” and that he was “sorry about his train service” where there were often delays. “The Bill will kick-start the UK SAF industry, attracting investment and creating jobs,” he concluded. “By addressing the market and investment uncertainty in SAF production, it will enable the UK to lead the way to greener aviation.”

Having been read a second time, the Bill will return to the Lords on 10 December, for the Committee Stage.","https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/media/5704233/3c0jc99-20251126115715501_web.jpg?center=0.39906103286384975,0.403125&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134087056010000000",N,,2025-11-27 07:56:43.067536

He noted that airplanes on this route emit four times the greenhouse gases compared to railways. Vaidya highlighted the difficulty of decarbonising the aviation sector. Global consumption of aviation turbine fuel currently stands at about 70 lakh barrels per day and is projected to rise to 90 lakh barrels due to the exponential growth in air travel. He added that battery technology is not a viable replacement for jet fuel ""by a long shot"" as it would make flying economically unviable. Instead of relying solely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — which he estimates will contribute only 1% of total fuel needs —Vaidya suggested that the government must incentivise rail travel. He urged India to replicate the high-speed rail networks of Japan and China to reduce the carbon footprint. ""In India, 60% of flights are between the top eight metro cities. If we replicate high-speed rail infrastructure in these cities, it will reduce flight frequency. Even if railways replace 10-30% of these flights, it will be a major step towards decarbonisation,"" he said. On the topic of energy security, Vaidya addressed India's dependency on crude oil imports. He suggested looking to Asian peers like Japan, China, and South Korea by creating substantial strategic oil reserves to buffer against global price volatility. He also advocated for a policy of ""equity oil"" — buying stakes in offshore oilfields — to reduce import costs. ""This is the right time for implementing such policies, as oil prices are relatively stable and several new countries are discovering oil,"" he said.

The City of Energy Foundation (CIUDEN), based in Ponferrada and with a technology center in Cubillos del Sil (León), has launched the development of a synthetic fuels pilot plant designed to decarbonize air transport and other sectors where direct electrification is very difficult.

This new facility is part of the European energy transition strategy and will have the support of Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan through funds Next Generation USThe objective is clear: test on a semi-industrial scale technologies that allow the generation of next-generation renewable fuels, especially SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), ready to replace fossil kerosene without drastic changes to the current fleet.

A pilot plant for synthetic fuels in the heart of El Bierzo

CIUDEN's initiative envisions the construction of a experimental pilot plant at the Technology Development Center of Cubillos del Sil, conceived as a testing ground for the production of sustainable synthetic hydrocarbonsThe installation will allow working with both advanced biofuels derived from biomass as with non-biological renewable fuels (NBRF), all of which are compatible with current energy infrastructures.

The project has been awarded to the Eurecat Foundationwhich will be responsible for supplying and implementing the plant's main technology. The contract amounts to 823.895 Euros and sets as the execution horizon June 2026, the date on which the facility is expected to be fully operational for continued testing.

CIUDEN, an agency dependent on Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, emphasizes that the plant will be used to obtain technical data at near-industrial scale, an essential condition for making the subsequent leap to larger commercial projects in Spain and the rest of Europe.

According to the entity, the plant is designed as a flexible environment, capable of adapting to different synthesis gases and configurationsThis will allow the study of various technological routes towards sustainable aviation fuels and other energy products.

In parallel, the initiative is integrated into the just transition strategy for the Bierzo basin, seeking to transform a territory affected by the closure of thermal power plants into decarbonization innovation hub linked to green hydrogen and renewable fuels.

Fischer-Tropsch technology: the heart of the plant

The technological focus of the facility will be a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactor, a technology known in the industry but which will be applied here with synthesis gases from renewable sourcesThis reactor will allow the transformation of different gas streams into sustainable liquid fuels, suitable for further refining and use in aviation or heavy transport.

The green synthesis gas that will fuel the reactor will be generated via four complementary routes, designed to test combinations and maximize the system versatilityOn the one hand, it will be used green hydrogen produced at CIUDEN through PEM and solid oxide electrolysers (SOEC), which will be combined with CO₂ captured to form the appropriate mixture. In addition, synthesis gas from the biomass gasifier already existing in the center.

These currents are in addition to the gas generated by the engine itself. SOEC electrolyzer in co-electrolysis modewhich allows the direct production of a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide from renewable electricity and CO₂. Finally, the installation is designed to hybridize these four paths, which makes it one of the most pilot plants flexible and unique in Europe in this ambit.

The design takes into account the possibility of test multiple catalysts and advanced materialsBy varying pressures, temperatures, and operating conditions, different configurations can be evaluated to optimize both performance and selectivity for specific hydrocarbon fractions.

The plant will have sampling systems capable of separating up to six different hydrocarbon fractionsThis will allow for a detailed study of the resulting mixtures. Overall, the planned processing more than 40 tons of gases per yeara sufficient quantity to carry out representative testing campaigns under near-industrial conditions.

Integration with methanol and synthetic natural gas in a power-to-X ecosystem

The sustainable aviation fuel plant will not be alone. CIUDEN is working in parallel on the commissioning of two other pilot installations intended to produce green methanol y synthetic natural gasalso from renewable hydrogen and CO₂ capturedThese plants have been awarded in previous phases and will be integrated with the new SAF facility.

The result will be a genuine ecosystem biomass/power-to-X, in which renewable electricity and the area will be transformed into different high value-added synthetic fuelsThis approach seeks to maximize the use of available resources and offer flexibility in the face of future energy demand.

Production renewable methanol It is considered especially relevant, both as a basic chemical and as a potential marine fuel and energy storage medium. In parallel, the synthetic natural gas It can be injected into gas networks or used in industrial applications, facilitating the gradual replacement of fossil gas.

The interaction between these three plants —SAF, methanol and synthetic natural gas— will allow us to study operational synergiesEnergy integration schemes and flexibility strategies that can then be replicated in commercial initiatives in other parts of Spain and Europe.

In addition, CIUDEN and the technology center Eurecat They had already made progress in the design of a specific high-purity green methanol plant, which strengthens the position of both players in the race to develop sustainable synthetic fuels at the European level.

Renewable energy, advanced storage and SAF production

One of the key points of the project is that the entire system will be powered by electrical energy from renewable sources generated within CIUDEN's own facilities, primarily from photovoltaic plantsTo manage this electricity efficiently, the foundation will deploy a advanced energy storage system based on various battery technologies.

Specifically, batteries will be installed lithium-ion, sodium-sulfur y vanadium fluxThese batteries will allow hydrogen production to be adapted to the availability of renewable energy, smoothing out the variations inherent in these sources. They will power the... PEM and SOEC electrolyzers, responsible for producing the green hydrogen that acts as the central energy vector in the project.

This renewable hydrogen will be used to generate three types of sustainable synthetic fuels: SAF or e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), renewable methanol y synthetic natural gasThe possibility of producing them in an integrated way in the same environment makes Cubillos del Sil a privileged laboratory for the transportation decarbonization and from the industry.

In the case of SAFThe goal is to obtain a fuel that can for direct use in aircraft engines existing, complying with international standards and contributing to the mandatory blending targets set by the European Regulation ReFuelEU AviationThis approach is especially relevant for airlines and operators that need short- and medium-term solutions to reduce their climate footprint.

The Ministry for Ecological Transition and CIUDEN emphasize that this set of facilities will operate in a semi-industrial environment, with a scale sufficient to assess the technical and economic viability of the technologies before their mass deployment in the European market.

Calendar, European funding and the role of Eurecat

The development of the pilot plant of sustainable aviation fuel It relies on funding from PRTR, the Spanish instrument for channeling funds Next Generation USThis European contribution allows for investments in R&D&I applied to decarbonization which could hardly be undertaken with national or private resources alone.

El supply contract The contract for the plant has been awarded to the Eurecat FoundationA technology center with expertise in advanced chemical processes and catalyst development. The amount totals 823.895 Euros, and the document sets an execution deadline that extends until June of 2026, at which point the installation must be completed and ready to operate.

In previous phases, CIUDEN and Eurecat had already collaborated on the design of a pilot plant for green methanolThe project began with an initial phase focused on the development and validation of reactors and catalysts, and a second phase dedicated to the construction of the facility in Cubillos del Sil. This prior experience is now being leveraged to accelerate the deployment of the new plant, which is geared towards SAF and other renewable fuels.

The project will not only have a technological impact, but also territorial impact, by contributing to consolidating in El Bierzo an industrial fabric linked to the energy transition, with the potential to generate skilled employment and new opportunities in an area marked by the closure of the old Compostilla thermal power plant.

Alongside the CIUDEN initiative, other production projects are being promoted in the same region. e-SAF and renewable hydrogen derivatives, which reinforces the idea of ​​turning Cubillos del Sil and its surroundings into a strategic hub for sustainable fuels at a national level.

International benchmark in decarbonization of aviation and heavy transport

La coordinated implementation The SAF plant and the methanol and synthetic natural gas facilities are planned for mid 2026Once operational, the complex will transform the CIUDEN center in Cubillos del Sil into a national and international benchmark in emerging technologies for the decarbonization of sectors where there are currently few alternatives.

The focus is especially on the commercial aviation and the long-haul heavy transportThese are sectors that cannot be easily electrified and require fuels with high energy density. The development of synthetic fuels compatible with existing infrastructure is presented as one of the most realistic ways to reduce emissions in these activities over the next decade.

As pointed out Alberto Gómez-Barea, technical director of CIUDEN's R&D&i area, the plant will allow the Bercian center to be consolidated as international reference facility in the production of sustainable synthetic fuels, a key piece on the path towards climate neutrality in sectors such as aviation.

The project aims to obtain detailed technical information The study examines the performance of different technologies under conditions close to industrial reality, including process efficiency, catalyst stability, integration with renewables, operating costs, and potential design improvements, among other aspects. This data will be essential for guiding future investments in commercial plants.

With this combination of Technological innovation, European funding and a territorial approachCIUDEN places Cubillos del Sil on the European map of applied research in sustainable fuels for aviation and other energy-intensive uses, opening the door to new industrial developments linked to green hydrogen and the use of residual biomass.",https://www.meteorologiaenred.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CIUDEN-planta-piloto-de-combustible-sostenible-para-aviacion.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 06:56:34.912369

With 158 million litres already consumed, the remaining need is 119 million litres.
The UK’s SAF market is entering a pivotal stage.
The UK’s SAF policy is achieving its goal — prompting real uptake, strengthening the market and signalling producers to expand capacity.","The UK’s transition toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is gathering pace, and the impact is now visible in the market as prices climb sharply, reports ResourceWise Blog.

The Department for Transport (DfT) has released the second edition of its provisional 2025 SAF report, offering the most detailed view so far of how obligated suppliers are progressing toward this year’s targets. The update, which includes data up to mid-September, outlines trends in jet fuel demand, SAF usage, fuel sources and the technologies used to produce SAF. Although the numbers are provisional, they remain the most reliable gauge of the UK’s progress toward meeting the 2% SAF blending requirement.

By mid-September, the UK had consumed 158 million litres of SAF. While this suggests steady growth, it still falls short of what is required for full compliance.

A true measure of progress requires comparing SAF consumption with three key metrics: fossil jet fuel usage, actual blending rates and mandated blend levels.

So far this year, only one reporting period has surpassed the 2% blending requirement. The national average blending rate stands at 1.63%, well below the target. With the year nearing its end, suppliers now face mounting pressure to close the gap — and that pressure is shaping market behaviour.

Throughout the previous year, SAF prices hovered around USD 1,800 per tonne. Beginning in July, however, prices surged from the steady USD 1,800 level to above USD 2,900 per tonne. This jump reflects the last-minute rush by obligated parties that postponed SAF procurement earlier in the year and are now working urgently to meet blending requirements.

The financial impact is significant:

A 2% blend at USD 1,800/t cost roughly USD 36/t.

At today’s prices above USD 2,900/t, the cost rises to about USD 58/t.

The USD 22/t difference is due entirely to timing, a major burden for an industry where profit margins are often very narrow.

The trend underscores the need for better planning. Delayed purchasing is proving costly for suppliers.

UK Still Needs 119 Million Litres of SAF This Year

A clearer picture of the supply gap emerges when projecting full-year jet fuel use:

Jet fuel consumed so far: 9.83 billion litres

Estimated consumption for the remainder of the year: 4.02 billion litres

Total projected 2025 consumption: 13.849 billion litres

A 2% SAF mandate requires 277 million litres of SAF for 2025. With 158 million litres already consumed, the remaining need is 119 million litres.

This means that 43% of the entire annual requirement must be supplied in the last 29% of the year — a key driver behind the current price spike.

The UK’s SAF market is entering a pivotal stage. Usage is increasing, mandates are tightening and suppliers are still adjusting to the new compliance landscape.

Prices are climbing not because supply has collapsed, but because demand is now concentrated in a compressed timeframe as parties try to meet the mandate before the year ends. As long as this pattern continues, price volatility is likely to persist.

However, the broader significance is clear: rising prices reflect rising demand. The UK’s SAF policy is achieving its goal — prompting real uptake, strengthening the market and signalling producers to expand capacity.

The key question now is whether suppliers will change their procurement strategies in time for the next compliance cycle.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-11-27 07:57:06.162661

Jurong Island is Singapore’s flagship energy and chemicals hub. And it is marking its 25th anniversary with a sweeping set of initiatives designed to reposition the island for a low-carbon future. Why is this important to CleanTechnica readers? Simply because despite all our desire for renewable energy, the path leading to that is to “defossil-fuelize” ourselves. And Jurong Island is a grounded and well thought of approach.

CleanTechnica visited Jurong Island in April 2024 and saw how the reclaimed island once defined by petrochemicals and refining is now being reimagined as one of Asia’s most ambitious testbeds for decarbonization technologies — including hydrogen, ammonia, microgrids, sustainable data centers, and advanced specialty-chemicals production.

Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, speaking at the Jurong Island 25th Anniversary Dinner, witnessed the signing of six new partnerships involving global companies, government agencies, universities, and climate-tech solution providers. The agreements reflect Singapore’s effort to turn an industrial zone built for the fossil-fuel age into a proving ground for climate-aligned manufacturing.

A shift from hydrocarbons to higher-value, lower-carbon industries

When Jurong Island officially opened in 2000 after a massive land-reclamation program, Singapore’s goal was clear: anchor multinational petrochemical companies and build an integrated chemicals value chain. The model worked. Over 100 global firms now operate on the island, and the energy and chemicals industry remains a cornerstone of Singapore’s manufacturing sector.

But the global energy landscape is changing. Petrochemical demand is under pressure, plastics are facing regulation, and industrial emissions are coming under increasingly strict scrutiny. Singapore’s response is to pivot the island toward specialty chemicals, sustainable materials, and next-generation fuels — sectors with higher value and lower carbon intensity.

According to JTC and the Economic Development Board, specialty-chemicals investments in manufacturing and R&D are expected to deliver more than 1,000 new jobs. Meanwhile, nearly 300 hectares have been designated for new-energy infrastructure — including hydrogen production, ammonia storage and handling, sustainable aviation fuel pathways, and advanced battery systems.

For a country with limited land, devoting this much space to next-generation energy is a signal: Singapore sees Jurong Island not just as an industrial district, but as a platform for its national energy transition.

Testbeds as a competitive advantage

Three of the newly announced partnerships center on experimental platforms that allow companies to prove, validate, and scale low-carbon technologies under real operating conditions.

The Sustainable Tropical Data Center Testbed is among the most notable. JTC and the National University of Singapore are preparing to launch Phase 2 of the testbed, located directly on Jurong Island. With AI workloads straining power grids worldwide, Singapore is planning a 700-MW low-carbon data center park on the island. The testbed will allow operators to pilot immersion cooling, direct-chip cooling, smart energy-management systems, and AI-optimized workload distribution — all critical for reducing heat and energy use in a tropical environment.

Another major effort is A*STAR’s Low Carbon Technology Translational Testbed (LCT3), developed with Surbana Jurong. LCT3 will provide a turnkey environment for piloting industrial decarbonization solutions — from carbon-capture systems to low-emission thermal processes — with the engineering support needed to move from experimentation to commercial deployment.

Singapore is also planning a renewable-energy microgrid testbed in collaboration with Keppel. This system will explore advanced demand-response controls as well as thermal-energy networks capable of redistributing cooling loads across multiple industrial facilities — an approach that could reduce overall electricity demand significantly.

Hydrogen is the spotlight

Aster announced one of the most significant industrial investments: a SG$195 million (US$150 million) hydrogen-ready integrated gas turbine for its Jurong Island facility. The turbine will allow Aster to generate its own low-carbon electricity and export surplus to Singapore’s national grid.

Aster also signed an MOU with Air Liquide to explore producing low-carbon hydrogen using auto-thermal reforming (ATR) paired with carbon capture. ATR is one of the few commercially viable pathways capable of achieving high capture rates — a key requirement if hydrogen is to play a meaningful role in Singapore’s energy system.

Singapore’s National Hydrogen Strategy identifies hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels as long-term options for power generation, heavy industry, aviation, and maritime bunkering. Domestic production will not replace imports, but it could become an important complement, especially for industrial users on Jurong Island.

Startups, talent needed in industrial decarbonization

In a move that differentiates Jurong Island from traditional industrial parks, JTC is partnering with Third Derivative (D3), a global climate-tech accelerator supported by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI). The collaboration will connect more than 280 cleantech startups with large industrial players on Jurong Island.

For startups developing technologies that need industrial-scale testing, access to Jurong Island’s infrastructure could be transformative. For industry players, the partnership creates a pipeline of early-stage innovation that can be tested and adapted quickly.

Singapore’s strategy recognizes that new infrastructure is only as effective as the workforce that operates it. JTC and NUS are co-developing training modules, internships, and a potential specialization in industrial decarbonization and sustainable digital infrastructure to prepare future engineers and technicians.

Advario Singapore will work with Workforce Singapore to redesign roles and upskill 150 employees for handling emerging fuels such as ammonia — a critical capability as global shipping lines explore ammonia-powered propulsion.

A new blueprint for industrial regions worldwide

As older energy and chemicals hubs in the United States, Europe, and Asia grapple with decarbonization, Singapore is turning Jurong Island into a showcase of what a coordinated industrial transition can look like. Singapore is also looking at nuclear energy in its mix, because currently it generates 95% of its electricity from natural gas. And less than 3% of its energy comes from renewable source, particularly solar. The island nation is, however, actively expanding its solar capacity and plans to import wind energy from Vietnam, solar from Vietnam, and hydropower from Malaysia.

Wednesday, 26 November 2025 - 11:00 AM

The Australian Government co-hosted two Women Peace and Security (WPS) activities with Vietnam in Hanoi last week as part of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2025.

Representatives from Australia’s Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade met with the Vietnam People’s Army to share experiences in a bilateral seminar on implementing a Women Peace and Security National Action Plan.

Together, Australia and Vietnam then co-hosted a minilateral Women Peace and Security seminar with participants from Cambodia, Laos and UN Women, as well as observers from Canada, Japan and New Zealand. The seminar focused on enabling activities for the full and meaningful participation of women in peace processes, including the consideration of effective recruitment and retention policies, as well as employing gender advisors.

Head of the visiting Australian delegation, Colonel Karen Such, said this year marked 25 years since the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.

UNSCR 1325 recognises the disproportionate impact of conflict on women and girls, and affirms the vital role women play in preventing conflict, building peace and supporting recovery efforts.

“Despite progress since Resolution 1325, the transformative potential of WPS remains underrealised. As such, it was incredibly meaningful to see Australia and Vietnam collaborate to continue to push the boundaries of WPS in a regional context,” Colonel Such said.

Australia is grateful to Vietnam for hosting these important seminars and greatly values working with Vietnam to build a more inclusive, peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.

Aviation safety on the agenda in Thailand

Wednesday, 19 November 2025 - 15:30 PM

A Mobile Training Team from the Australian Defence Aviation Safety Authority recently completed a three-day Aviation Safety Training Seminar in Bangkok, Thailand.

The four-member team from the Education and Training Directorate delivered a tailored program on topics designed to strengthen bilateral engagement and aviation safety knowledge as part of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 25 (IPE25).

Participants included representatives from all three services of the Royal Thai military, with ranks ranging from group captain to pilot officer.

Key subjects covered included aviation safety management systems, human factors, aviation risk management, data collection and analysis, and the aviation safety investigation process.

Seminar lead Major Andrew Jones said air safety in the region was becoming increasingly important as regional partners expanded capabilities within complex environments to meet the needs of self-defence, as well as providing support to humanitarian and disaster response activities.

“With this increased capability comes a need for increased interoperability as partnerships and coalitions meet the needs of the Indo-Pacific region,” Major Jones said.

“It was a great opportunity to introduce the way the Australian Defence Force approaches aviation safety and share some of our lessons learned.

“It was also a great opportunity to network with our partners in the region on an increasingly important and complex area of work.”

Deputy Defence Attaché at the Australian Embassy in Bangkok Wing Commander Fernando Lay said it was fantastic to see the Australian contingent in Thailand engaging with counterparts.

“Indo-Pacific Endeavour’s Aviation Safety Seminar continues to strengthen bonds between Australian and Thailand while sharing expertise to enhance collective aviation safety knowledge,” he said.

The Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program was pleased to host South-East Asian delegations for the Australasian Military Medicine Association (AMMA) Conference in Adelaide.

Nineteen representatives from Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam converged on the Adelaide Convention Centre from October 17-19.

Major General Nishat Jubaida, the only female two-star general in the Bangladesh Army, said she was delighted to see female representation among senior leadership across the many nations represented at the AMMA conference.

Senior medical officers from each nation attending the conference held talks with ADF Surgeon General Rear Admiral Sonya Bennett.

Delegates also joined the AMMA program in specialised workshops that aligned with their respective medical specialisations.

Lieutenant Wan Nurul Naszeerah, from the Royal Brunei Land Forces, presented her research titled Listening to the Force – which uses artificial intelligence to categorise sentiment in health communications – at the conference.

In addition to military health personnel, the AMMA audience included civilian medical providers, contractors, state and federal health officials and emergency services personnel and academics.

The visiting IPE delegations were supported by IPE personnel and joined other host officers from the ADF’s Joint Health Command who have experience working alongside military health experts in South-East Asian nations.

Having deployed to Vietnam on IPE earlier this year, Captain Brendan Nguyen, a psychologist from 3rd Health Battalion, was on hand to assist the Vietnamese delegation alongside fellow Vietnamese-Australian Major Jacob Choi. Both members said it was a privilege to host officers from their parents’ country of birth, giving them a sense of meaningful purpose.

Developing a peacekeeping capability

Friday, 17 October 2025 - 15:30 PM

The Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program brought a delegation from the Lao People’s Army to Canberra to observe UN-accredited peace operations training, supporting Laos’ interest in developing its peacekeeping capability.

Department of Defence policy advisor to IPE25, Jordan Anderton, said the visit gave the delegation valuable insights into how Australia conducts UN-accredited training at the Peace Operations Training Centre (POTC).

The delegation watched participants from Thailand, the Philippines and Timor-Leste undertaking the United Nations Staff Officer Course and UN Military Observer Course at the Majura Range Training Area.

Ms Anderton said the simulated learning allowed the delegation to see role players in scenarios drawn from real UN missions, and Australia’s unique approach to preparing students for UN peacekeeping operations.

“Students learn how to conduct the [UN Military Decision-Making Process] UN MDMP and planning for activities for a UN mission. They also use a [simulation] SIM virtual vehicle patrol and avatar, simulating a military observer patrol and interactions with local people,” she said.

The program is a mandated peacekeeper observer’s course that prepares ADF and international personnel for the complexities of UN peacekeeping missions.

Participants were tested on critical skills including negotiation, mediation and dispute resolution, all under simulated operational conditions.

“The delegation was impressed with the training and said that the course appeared to prepare its participants to meet the complex situations and challenges of being deployed on a UN mission,” Ms Anderton said.

“It was great to have Lao representatives visit us and observe our courses. This visit is a concrete example of our growing Defence relationship with the Lao People’s Army.”

Strengthening people-to-people links through IPE25

Wednesday, 8 October 2025 - 16:00 PM

Australian Defence Adviser to Sri Lanka and Maldives Colonel Amanda Johnston reflects on IPE25 conducting knowledge exchanges in the north-east Indian Ocean:

Hot on the heels of a high-level visit by our Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Australian Defence Force personnel were back in the north-east Indian Ocean region to exchange knowledge and build people-to-people links through Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) 2025.

Australia’s 2024 National Defence Strategy highlighted the strategic importance of the north-east Indian Ocean and directed increased defence engagement with countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives. IPE is a practical symbol of the deepening defence relationships with both.

In Sri Lanka, IPE included a number of different activities, all focused on knowledge-sharing. Army Engineers from the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment visited Sri Lanka’s School of Military Engineering for a workshop on humanitarian demining and search operations, while ADF personnel were embedded in a US-led multilateral exercise, Pacific Angel, to participate in subject matter expert exchanges in military medicine, mass casualty evacuation, aeromedical evacuation, and combat search and rescue operations.

Additionally, Australia led a bilateral knowledge exchange focused on maritime surveillance using the former-RAAF KA350 aircraft that Australia gifted to Sri Lanka in 2024. In a neat twist, RAAF Squadron Leader Glenn Canfield, who delivered the KA350 to Sri Lanka last October, returned to the island for a professional exchange with Sri Lanka Air Force’s 3 (Maritime) Squadron. The Sri Lanka Air Force pilots were thrilled to have the chance to pick Squadron Leader Canfield’s brain on everything about the aircraft and its maritime surveillance role.

Across the Laccadive Sea, ADF personnel also visited the Maldives for workshops focused on human capital. Royal Australian Navy Chaplain Mogamat Majidih Essa reached ‘celebrity imam’ status delivering televised Friday prayers and leading several command sessions in mental health and wellbeing, while staff from the Indo-Pacific Centre for Military Law and ADF workforce modellers guided Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) staff through discussions on their respective areas.

Commander IPE Brigadier Jen Harris also visited the Maldives and met with senior MNDF leaders and hosted a gender, peace and security forum.

As the only named activity on the ADF calendar for both countries, IPE is a key engagement activity that enables us to pursue specific National Defence Strategy objectives, in particular raising the visibility of the ADF in the north-east Indian Ocean and deepening the people-to-people links. IPE is a practical symbol of our deepening defence relationships with north-east Indian Ocean countries and demonstrates Australia’s commitment to a safer and more secure maritime backyard.

We look forward to IPE26!

Engaging with counterparts in Cambodia

Monday, 29 September 2025 - 12:00 PM

ADF personnel from the Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program and the Defence Section from the Australian Embassy to Cambodia visited the Multi-National Training Centre at Ream Naval Base, Cambodia, to collaborate with Royal Cambodian Navy personnel on maritime security and military diving capabilities.

Lieutenant Colonel Paul Henry, who led the IPE contingent, said it was great to be back in Cambodia, connecting with colleagues and workshopping ideas to develop capabilities in particular areas of mutual interest.

“Our team was accompanied by Australian Ambassador to Cambodia, H.E. Derek Yip, and we were fortunate to meet with the Commander of Ream Naval Base, Rear Admiral Mey Dina, to discuss IPE support to the Royal Cambodian Navy in the areas of maritime law, maritime security, and development of a military diving capability,” Lieutenant Colonel Henry said.

The team also met with the Commander of the National Committee for Maritime Security Tactical Headquarters, Rear Admiral Ly Huot, to discuss future collaboration on naval interdiction and military diving training for members of the Royal Cambodian Navy.

“The Royal Cambodian Navy has a strong interest in enhancing its capabilities in these specialist fields. We will continue to engage in this area, including considering providing Cambodia with diving equipment,” Lieutenant Colonel Henry said.

“Australia is keen to collaborate with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific region on improving maritime security and our collective ability to respond to maritime security events, including on humanitarian and disaster relief operations.”

While in Cambodia, the IPE team also visited the Institute for Peacekeeping, Mine Clearance and ERW (IPMEC) in Phnom Penh.

The team discussed future collaboration with Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) personnel on training Cambodian peacekeepers for UN operations, including the Comprehensive Protection of Civilians, Gender Peace and Security, and English language training.

ADF personnel also met with a number of RCAF students currently undergoing training courses at IPMEC. The RCAF has a long history of involvement in peacekeeping operations, with more than 10,000 RCAF members deploying as peacekeepers since 2006.

Cambodia is one of 13 countries in the Indo-Pacific region that IPE will travel to this year to participate in workshops, engagements and knowledge exchanges. IPE aims to strengthen Australia’s regional relationships and build on trusted partnerships that have been developed and nurtured since the IPE program began in 2017.

Strengthening partnerships across the Indo-Pacific

Monday, 22 September 2025 - 15:30 PM

An update from Commander IPE Jen Harris:

Australia’s Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) program is in full swing, with September seeing engagements across the breadth of the region. Teams travelled to the north-east Indian Ocean, renewing valued friendships in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Closer to home, we have been catching up with colleagues in Brunei and Timor-Leste.

In Sri Lanka, we have focused on maritime surveillance, search and rescue, military medicine and military engineering. IPE activities were designed to complement the regional multinational activity Pacific Angel, co-hosted by the Sri Lanka Air Force and the US Air Force. Pacific Angel focuses on humanitarian and disaster relief, and our teams undertook valuable training in emergency medical and evacuation procedures.

People were central to the program in the Maldives this year, working together to develop workforce modelling capability, and sharing knowledge and experience in military justice and gender, peace and security. A highlight was the return of Royal Australian Navy Chaplain Imam Mogamat Essa, who led faith-based engagements focused on the spiritual wellbeing and mental resilience of our forces.

In Brunei, IPE coincided with the 80th anniversary commemorations for Australia’s Operation Oboe landings for the liberation of Borneo. Australia and Brunei Darussalam enjoy a longstanding defence partnership stretching back to World War 2. Unique to this year, IPE ran concurrent with Exercise Penguin, a biennial maritime security exercise between our two nations. A Royal Australian Air Force P-8A Poseidon and Royal Australian Navy Anzac-class frigate HMAS Ballarat supported the exercise. These two parallel programs represent the breadth and depth of the relationship

During the week of IPE activities, Australian and Bruneian participants exchanged knowledge in the areas of defensive cyber, military law and workforce planning. Flight Lieutenant Imam Abdul Kader made his fifth visit to Brunei. During a five-day religious engagement program, Imam Kader delivered a presentation on emotional intelligence to youth leaders, providing practical demonstrations of the support chaplains provide in the field.

At the core of all these engagements are people-to-people connections, reinforcing the latticework of trusted partnerships that characterise this region we call home. We have seen the power of dialogue and knowledge sharing firsthand, especially when founded on mutual respect and understanding. It has been a true privilege to play a small part in the incredible work our Defence and whole of Australian Government colleagues do every day to cultivate these partnerships. Thank you.

IPE25 trilateral English Language Teacher Training strengthens ties

Tuesday, 9 September 2025 - 12:30 PM

Commander IPE25 Brigadier Jennifer Harris reflects on her visit to Hanoi this week for the opening of the English Language Teacher Training program:

It’s an absolute privilege to be in Hanoi this week, representing the Australian Defence Force and the Indo-Pacific Endeavour Program, to open this year’s English Language Teacher Training program.

Teachers from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia will undertake a week of intensive teacher training.

Australian language specialists from the Defence International Training Centre, Captain Jen Hackney and Mr Chris Wilkinson, will deliver the training.

Indo-Pacific Endeavour, Australia’s flagship regional engagement activity, is pleased to be back at Vietnam’s Foreign Relations Department, continuing our enduring collaboration with our friends from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.

This annual training is a testament to the strength of our partnerships and our shared commitment to a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region – where state sovereignty is protected, international law is followed and nations can make decisions free from coercion.

We are proud to support this training package, investing in teachers, our greatest knowledge sharers. The investment you will make in the next five days will enhance our respective language capability, but also deepens the people-to-people links that are at the heart of our defence cooperation, building relationships founded on openness and mutual respect.

In a world of many languages, English continues to play a central role in facilitating multinational cooperation, peacekeeping operations and joint military exercises. English language teachers are essential to enabling stronger collaboration and enhancing mutual understanding across borders.

This year marks the fourth year of this training program, which has become a key feature of the Indo-Pacific Endeavour Program. Our sincere thanks to the Foreign Relations Department, which continues to host this important activity. Each iteration builds on the last, strengthening our shared capacity and reinforcing the bonds of friendship and trust between our nations.

The Australian Defence Force values the opportunity to work alongside our regional partners in building skills that support not only military effectiveness but also broader regional stability. Thank you to all the teachers and the trainers for the continued investment you make every day in building our future leaders.

Together, we are building a stronger, more connected Indo-Pacific.

Alon and Keris Woomera evolve into major military exercises

Wednesday, 3 September 2025 - 12:00 PM

Commander IPE 2025 Brigadier Jennifer Harris was in the Philippines last week for the final stages of Exercise Alon 25. The exercise saw approximately 1600 Australia Defence Force personnel deployed abroad in the Indo-Pacific Region, the largest commitment in nearly 20 years.

Since first being conducted as an amphibious landing activity with the Philippine Marines in 2023, Exercise Alon 25 has evolved to encompass comprehensive cooperation between the ADF and all services of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

Brigadier Harris said it was impressive to witness multi-domain cooperation between the ADF and the AFP, across air, land, maritime and special operations taskforces and elements, supported by Space and Cyber components.

“Exercise Alon grew out of Australia’s Indo-Pacific Endeavour (IPE) Program. This year’s iteration exemplifies the incredible growth in our partnership and it now stands alone as a key biennial joint activity between Australia and the Philippines,” she said.

Around 3600 personnel trained together between August 15 and 29 at locations around the islands of Palawan and Luzon.

This year’s Exercise Alon also included participation by the Royal Canadian Navy frigate HMCS Ville de Québec, and the United States Marine Corps’ Marine Rotation Force – Darwin, which included MV-22B Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.

Exercise Alon is a biennial activity. In the alternate year, the ADF and the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) train together in Exercise Keris Woomera, deepening bonds and military interoperability.

“It is impressive to see how the foundation laid by IPE has supported the growth and evolution of these two major standalone activities embedded into the training schedules of each country. Alon and Keris Woomera were Australia’s largest overseas military exercises in 2024 and 25,” Brigadier Harris said.

“These significant training activities successfully demonstrate Australia’s ability to force project into our region to support our key regional partners.”

The joint exercises not only improve military skills, demonstrate enhanced interoperability and strengthen defence diplomacy between participating countries – they build a spirit of mutual trust and are important steps in building strong cooperation to maintain regional stability.

Focus on resilience at regional security forum in Brisbane

Wednesday, 20 August 2025 - 15:30 PM

The IPE team was represented at the 2025 Indo-Pacific Environmental Security Forum (IPESF) in Brisbane last week.

Chief of Staff Group Captain Steve Henry led the team in welcoming counterparts from Bangladesh to the forum who were keen to discuss sustainable fuels as part of a broader collaboration with the Defence Energy Transition Office (DETO).

The overarching theme of the four-day conference was operational resilience. Day one focused on disaster resilience and how partnerships strengthen collective responses to disasters. Day two was focused on energy resilience during disasters. Day three was about systems thinking, community resilience and conflict prevention. Day four culminated in discussions and presentations around strategic partnerships and capability sharing.

Attending the conference, Squadron Leader Robert Bride said it brought together military and civilian agencies and regional experts from 21 countries to discuss non-traditional security threats, including lack of disaster preparedness; energy insecurity; climate-related environmental impacts; illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; water insecurity; and energy transition, solutions and best practices.

The forum provided an invaluable opportunity to better understand emerging solutions and best practice in responding to these challenges.

“The IPESF is unique in that it brings military and civilian discussions to the forefront and showcases the need to have a whole-of-stakeholder approach to addressing disasters, oil spills, water scarcity, climate migration challenges, energy insecurity and other environmental security threats,” Squadron Leader Bride said.

Environmental security can be broadly defined as countering vulnerabilities caused by the abundance or scarcity of environmental resources and/or degradation.

“The IPESF provides an opportunity for civilian entities to gain a better understanding of the important work that militaries do to reduce risks to national security, better identify and map the military and civilian nexus, and for Defence forces to learn about innovative solutions that industry and educational institutions are implementing to combat the same or similar environmental security challenges,” Squadron Leader Bride said.

The Center for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance (CFE-DM), United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) and Australian Defence Force, in partnership with the New Zealand Defence Force and the New Zealand Ministry of Defence, coordinated the 14th annual forum.

The organization noted that jet fuel purchases are “almost always paid in dollars,” making currency movements a direct operational concern for carriers across multiple regions.
IATA highlighted that the divergence between fuel price declines and operating costs has been evident for a decade.

The organization noted that jet fuel purchases are “almost always paid in dollars,” making currency movements a direct operational concern for carriers across multiple regions.

IATA highlighted that the divergence between fuel price declines and operating costs has been evident for a decade. The group reported that the volatility of jet fuel prices in dollars “has intensified since 2020,” driven by the pandemic-related collapse in demand, supply-chain disruptions during the recovery, and ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The most pronounced impacts are being felt in Russia and Brazil. IATA attributed Russia’s exposure to the weakening ruble following the invasion of Ukraine and to sanctions that “have limited the price of Russian oil since 2022.” Brazil, meanwhile, has faced currency pressure as markets anticipate monetary easing while the country continues to manage “persistent fiscal issues and the negative impact of tariffs on the balance of payments.”

IATA added that the European Union, China and India have also seen depreciation against the dollar since mid-2022, albeit to a lesser extent. It noted that the dollar has fallen “about 10% against many currencies this year,” helping reduce fuel bills for carriers whose domestic currencies strengthened during that period.

Fuel accounts for about 26% of airline operating costs. IATA stated that 55%–60% of global airline costs are denominated in dollars, compared with only 50%–55% of revenues. This imbalance means currency appreciation or depreciation has a direct impact on margins. According to the association, a 1% appreciation of the dollar against other currencies can reduce operating margins by “about 0.1 percentage points,” while a 1% depreciation can improve margins by a similar amount.

IATA’s August 2025 data shows the average jet fuel barrel at “about US$86 this year, compared with US$99 in 2024,” yielding “an estimated US$25 billion in global savings.” The association linked the drop to the dollar’s depreciation in several markets and a modest increase in SAF output, which currently represents “0.7% of total consumption” and is expected to “double its share in 2025.”

IATA noted that some airlines have “cut their losses by half in the first quarter,” helped by lower fuel costs and stable demand. Analysts cautioned, however, that the outlook remains sensitive to conflicts, supply-chain constraints, rising labor and maintenance costs, and delays in fleet renewal that could heighten exposure to future energy price swings.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-11/R%20%286%29.jpg?h=e3a8e1e1&itok=5j8KOdwt,N,,2025-11-26 19:56:37.985030

On this podcast, we bring you the latest reports from the GPB newsroom. On today's episode, the election interference case against President Donald Trump and others has been dismissed. A new study details the risk of sea level rise to Georgia's coast. And ahead of the final series of Stranger Things, an Airbnb in Fayetteville gives guests a unique and immersive experience tied to the popular series.

Alejandro Choza: I mean, ultimately, it's them that get excited about the property and they love to visit and we hope to do a lot of cool stuff over the next coming years.

Orlando Montoya: Today is Wednesday, Nov. 26, the day before Thanksgiving. I'm Orlando Montoya and this is Georgia Today.

Story 1:

Orlando Montoya: Georgia prosecutor Pete Skandalakis is dropping the state's election interference case against President Donald Trump and other defendants. In a court filing this morning, Skandalakis said he did not find clear evidence that there was a viable conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Georgia State University law professor Anthony Michael Kreis says momentum was against the case and he isn't surprised by the decision.

Anthony Michael Kreis: I think this is really, fundamentally, a gut check about whether you believe the president of the United States tried to overturn the 2020 election or not.

Orlando Montoya: Trump and 18 co-defendants were indicted in 2023, but the case was plagued by challenges, including the removal of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as prosecutor. With the charges dropped, a judge quickly dismissed the case today, ending a multi-year saga and the last effort to prosecute Trump for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

Story 2:

Orlando Montoya: Atlanta's Fulton County is preparing for the 2026 point in time or PIT count of unhoused people. GPB's Amanda Andrews reports leaders of the county's continuum of care, or COC, are looking for volunteers to help.

Amanda Andrews: The COC includes local officials and service providers. They use the PIT count to identify service gaps in Fulton County. This year, they identified 241 individuals who were unsheltered, which was a decrease from 2024. But they say challenges, including weather, likely caused an undercount. Maggie Goldman leads the effort. She says this time they're considering running an additional survey.

Maggie Goldman: It appears that the point-in-time count data does not stay with us directly to act on. And we'd like to make sure that the people that we touch are able to get some kind of follow-up through either a coordinate entry or another available group.

Amanda Andrews: The Fulton County PIT count takes place Jan. 22 and 23rd. Volunteers can sign up online. For GPB News, I'm Amanda Andrews.

Story 3:

Orlando Montoya: A Georgia foster care advocacy group held a Thanksgiving dinner last week for young adults who recently aged out of the foster care system. GPB's Sarah Kallis has that story.

Sarah Kallis: At the Fostering Success Act dinner, former foster children ages 18 to 26 enjoyed a sit-down dinner with waiters and heard from Jackson Health CEO, Rick Jackson, who is a former foster child himself. Fostering Success Act executive director Heidi Carr says the dinner helped attendees learn life skills that may have been otherwise hard for them to practice.

Heidi Carr: Just all the things that many of us really — maybe we weren't sat down and taught, but we got to witness through how our parents interact with others.

Sarah Kallis: Fostering Success Act is a nonprofit that provides resources to youth that have aged out of the foster care system and helps them access jobs, housing and college scholarships. For GPB News, I'm Sarah Kallis.

Story 4:

Orlando Montoya: Political and religious leaders are mourning the death of one of the most politically influential Black ministers in Georgia for many years. From 2016 to 2024, African Methodist Episcopal Bishop Reginald Jackson presided over more than 400 Georgia congregations before moving to a new post serving the church in the Washington, D.C., area. His family announced his unexpected death in a social media post today. Over the years, Jackson organized boycotts and rallies for progressive causes, supported Democratic candidates, and pushed church members to vote, as well as leading various religious and educational institutions. Words of condolence poured in today from Georgia Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and Atlanta congresswoman Nikema Williams. Bishop Reginald Jackson was 71 years old.

Story 5:

Orlando Montoya: A new study published in the journal Nature Communications details the risks of sea level rise to industrial facilities, including those on Georgia's coast. GPB's Chase McGee has more.

Chase McGee: Researchers found around one dozen industrial production and defense facilities in Coastal Georgia at risk of flooding by 2050 in its best-case scenario, including sites in Savannah and Brunswick. Dr. Sacoby Wilson is a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. He outlines the risks these industrial and production sites can pose should they be flooded.

Dr. Sacoby Wilson: You have both short-term effects to chemical and microbial contaminants in the flood waters and also long-term effects in flood. And let me not forget mold, of course. So for those who are going back after the event, could be exposed to mold that could also have a respiratory effect.

Chase McGee: The study recommends better disaster planning and mitigation strategies to reduce the risk of harm posed to people. For GPB News, I'm Chase McGee.

Story 6:

Orlando Montoya: State transportation officials have awarded $24 million in federal funding to expand Georgia's network of charging stations for electric vehicles. The State Department of Transportation last week announced six winning bidders for 26 new stations on interstates and highways across Georgia. This was the second round of funding from the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a priority during the Joe Biden administration.

Story 7:

Orlando Montoya: The Netflix original series Stranger Things is back today for its final season. It's a milestone for both fans and Georgia's entertainment industry. The show features now-iconic locations across the state. GPB's Sofi Gratas takes us to one of them.

Sofi Gratas: A flickering '80s-style TV welcomes you to the Airbnb in suburban Fayetteville, the actual home of characters Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers from Stranger Things. Guests can play Dungeons and Dragons.

I don't know how to play.

Painted on the wall: an alphabet, lined by rainbow Christmas lights. Twisted vines in a red-lit hallway mimic the ""Upside Down"" from the show. In a bedroom on the left, there's a record player, teed up with canon music from the TV show, like this song by Kate Bush.

Alejandro Choza: For me, it's like going in and listening to some records in Jonathan's room, that's my favorite part.

Sofi Gratas: Alejandro Choza is a real estate investor who bought the Byers home in 2022. He says it took over a year to style, but since then, thousands of fans have bought shares to own a piece of the property. Choza hopes they and other guests will keep the house busy long after the series finale.

Alejandro Choza: I mean, ultimately it's them that get excited about the property and they love to visit and we hope to do a lot of cool stuff over the next coming years.

Sofi Gratas: The Byers House is currently booked through April of next year. For GPB News, I'm Sofi Gratas.

Story 8:

Orlando Montoya: Jet fuel maker LanzaJet has begun commercial-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel from ethanol at its facility in Middle Georgia's Trutland County. The company this month said the milestone was the world's first non-oil-based renewable jet fuel compatible with today's aircraft and the culmination of 15 years of research and development. Federal aviation officials hope the production becomes a model for a new wave of sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. LanzaJet and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport shared more than $3 million in Federal Aviation Administration grants announced last year to help deploy SAF.

Story 9:

Orlando Montoya: Federal workplace safety officials have fined three companies nearly $27,000 for violations that contributed to the death of a worker at the Hyundai vehicle plant in Southeast Georgia. The worker died in a gruesome forklift incident days before the plant's grand opening in March.

Story 10:

Orlando Montoya: Tomorrow, families all over Georgia will gather to celebrate Thanksgiving. At most of those tables, someone will say grace over the meal. There are probably as many ways to bless the food on a Southern table as there are Southerners waiting to eat it. We asked Salvation South editor Chuck Reese for his thoughts on table blessings.

Chuck Reece: When Thanksgiving is coming, I often think about my friend Ann Byrne, who was a food writer based in Nashville. Many years ago, Ann and I had a conversation about table blessings, and we talked about the various ways we had heard people say grace around our tables. I asked Ann to write about that, and later that year, as Thanksgiving rolled around, I've published a beautiful story she wrote called our ways of saying grace. For that piece, Ann spent, and I quote from her story here, ""several months talking to religious leaders, folklorists, teachers, friends, and families all over the South. I learned that the blessing of food on the Southern table, saying grace, is alive and well. But like our world, it has changed."" I'm sure it is still changing, particularly when political issues have become so divisive in our country. This time of year, it is easy to find stories in newspapers and magazines about people who ban the discussion of politics around the Thanksgiving table, or people who refuse to celebrate the holiday with this family member or that one because of their political beliefs. So, what can unite us this year? There are bound to be things we can all be thankful for. First, I think there is the table itself, and the people who gather around it.

In her story, Anne quoted the late Nashville journalist John Edgerton. A couple of sentences from his landmark book, Southern Food: ""Family life often revolved around the kitchen and the dining table. Prayers were said at the table, important decisions were made, and the principle of family unity was repeatedly reinforced there."" And second, there is the food that will sit on our tables. Whether your Thanksgiving dinner will be a grand feast for an extended family of a couple dozen folks or a more meager meal, the chance to nourish one's body for one more day of life must always be a source of gratitude. Third, there is that phrase that's so common among Southern table blessings: ""And the hands that prepared it."" Somebody once told me a story about a gathering of friends around a takeout meal: To-go barbecue that was bought from a chain that has locations all over the South. And the person who volunteered to say grace, ended the prayer this way: ""Bless this food and the hands that prepared it: Sonny's."" Even when the cook isn't someone in your own family, blessing the hands that prepared it is never a bad idea. And those three pieces, I think, make a fine recipe for a table blessing in times like these. We're grateful for the chance to gather at this table, and for the food that sits upon it, and the people who worked to prepare it. I hope your Thanksgiving dinner is free of conflict. Better yet, I hope it's delicious. Come see us anytime at SalvationSouth.com.

Metal is more affordable and more compatible with fast design modifications, which makes it suitable for demonstrator aircraft.
The upcoming TD 2.0 flight campaign will mark a significant milestone on the path to certifying the final Zuri hybrid-electric VTOL.
With its extended range and spacious five-seat configuration, the Zuri VTOL looks like an attractive alternative to standard regional jets.
Additionally, as SAF-ready from day one, the Zuri VTOL will also be able to reduce emissions almost as much as a fully-electric eVTOL.","The TD 2.0 builds on the success of the first-generation Zuri demonstrator and incorporates several upgrades meant to smooth the path to full certification of the commercial version. The upgraded design features a new tail and an improved propulsion layout for reduced drag and better stability.

This new demonstrator will also validate all phases of VTOL flight at full scale, and all testing will be unmanned. Lastly, it will integrate the hybrid-propulsion system for extended range.

The TD 2.0 will boast a maximum takeoff weight of almost 700 kg (1,540 lbs), compared to the 2,800 kg (6,000 lbs) MTOW of the future commercial Zuri aircraft, along with a significantly shorter range and lower cruise speed.

An important difference focuses on airframe materials; while the demonstrator will be made of metal, the final aircraft is set to switch to advanced composites. Metal is more affordable and more compatible with fast design modifications, which makes it suitable for demonstrator aircraft. On the other hand, composite materials will enable the final VTOL to boast a lighter weight, in line with certification standards, and increased aerodynamic efficiency.

Zuri has already started working on the new demonstrator airframe, with flight tests set to begin in late 2026 or even early 2027. The upcoming TD 2.0 flight campaign will mark a significant milestone on the path to certifying the final Zuri hybrid-electric VTOL.

Zuri primarily targets regional air mobility with fewer CO2 emissions. The Czech VTOL will not only boast hybrid-electric propulsion, but will also be SAF-ready from day one. This means that it will be compatible with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel instead of conventional fuel, further reducing emissions for cleaner, more sustainable flight.

The Zuri VTOL promises a regional range of up to 700 km (435 miles) without the need to recharge, coupled with a cruise speed of 350 kph (218 mph). With its extended range and spacious five-seat configuration, the Zuri VTOL looks like an attractive alternative to standard regional jets.

Zuri operates an advanced research and development center in Prague and is currently developing an integrated systems ground test platform, named the Iron Bird, specifically dedicated to the validation of hybrid-electric systems.

Like all VTOL concepts, this Czech aircraft combines fixed-wing flight with vertical flight capabilities and is meant to operate independently from conventional airport infrastructure, which is another advantage for future regional operations and greater accessibility. Additionally, as SAF-ready from day one, the Zuri VTOL will also be able to reduce emissions almost as much as a fully-electric eVTOL.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/huge-milestone-for-one-of-the-most-advanced-five-seat-hybrid-vtols-261679_1.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 16:56:38.176951
