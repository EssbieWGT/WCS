""We are particularly concerned about the way some governments and regions are pushing this with mandates that are unrealistic.
He added that IATA was also concerned about the EU's focus on e-SAF because it is ""extremely expensive"".","IATA is concerned that airlines will be left footing the bill if the sector cannot meet unrealistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates.

Speaking at the IATA World Cargo Symposium, the airline association’s director general Willie Walsh said that sustainability was a “must” for aviation but added that targets being set were not always achievable.

He highlighted the European Union’s RefuelEU target that from 2025, fuel uplift from member state airports must contain at least 2% SAF. The percentage will increase gradually, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The RefuelEU initiative is part of the wider European Commission ‘Fit for 55’ package to meet the emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

He said the pace of SAF adoption is slower than expected, but this was not the fault of airlines.

""We are concerned about the pace at which we are progressing particularly in the area of SAF,"" Walsh said.

""We are particularly concerned about the way some governments and regions are pushing this with mandates that are unrealistic.

""I don’t mind ambitions targets but what I do mind is if they aren’t met. The idea that the targets were set to drive the production of SAF is a positive, but the idea that it incentivises airlines because we are going to penalised financially if we don’t achieve them is wrong.

""There is no environmental benefit to penalising airlines for the failure of other players in the supply chain.""

Walsh said that aircraft manufacturers and fuel companies were not doing enough to help meet the targets and were even ""walking backwards"" in terms of their commitments.

He added that IATA was also concerned about the EU's focus on e-SAF because it is ""extremely expensive"".

""There is a real risk at the moment that we are off track in terms of the pathway to zero2050 (aviation's target to have net zero emissions) and the concern is it will be seized upon by people that like to penalise our industry and we will face more and more penalties and taxes because of the failure of other players to commit to playing their part.

GEVO and Future Energy Global (“FEG”) recently entered into an offtake agreement focused on carbon abatement attributes, helping airlines and other businesses cut their CO2 emissions using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Under this multi-year deal, FEG will purchase Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions credits from Gevo tied to 10 million gallons per year of fuel to be produced at the latter’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) facility, known as Gevo ATJ-60. These credits will support FEG’s clients — including airlines and corporations — in their efforts to decarbonize. The agreement also gives FEG the option to increase its offtake in the future.

This agreement is expected to support Gevo in securing financing for the construction of its ATJ-60 facility. The company has received a conditional loan guarantee commitment of $1.63 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which includes capitalized interest during construction. In addition, Gevo is raising equity from project-level capital providers. The ATJ-60 facility, which is under development in Lake Preston, SD, aims to meet the demand for affordable jet fuel while reducing carbon emissions. The plant is projected to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually, at a production cost comparable to traditional jet fuel but with a much smaller carbon footprint.

The aviation industry has set a goal of reaching net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with SAF expected to deliver roughly two-thirds of the required emissions cuts. However, achieving this will require a more than 400-fold increase in SAF production. Since SAF isn’t accessible yet at all major airports globally, FEG offers SAF-based Scope 1 credits to airlines that want to purchase additional SAF but can’t physically obtain the fuel at their locations. Likewise, when companies buy and retire SAF-based Scope 3 credits to offset emissions from business travel, they help reduce the additional cost of SAF to airlines, accelerating the expansion of SAF production.

GEVO stock has gained 92.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 26.8% growth.

Reaffirmed by existing members through additional funding, the pioneering partnership continues to impact the country’s progress in its energy transition and, by extension, cleantech development. International partnerships like the JETP can be vital accelerators for local cleantech ecosystems in several ways:

Influencing institutional reform to prime existing infrastructure

Leveraging bilateral relationships to mobilize the private sector

Building capacity for widespread deployment

Laying systematic foundation for technological innovation

Let’s Take It from the Top: Prompting Infrastructural Reform Through Institutional Support

Multi-national public sector partnerships like the JETP announce high-level financial support from international partners ($8.5B originally, with an additional $5B including the global gateway package announced in 2025), enabling necessary policy shifts to prime the energy industry for widespread adoption and technology scaling:

The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET IP) maps clean energy investment needs over five years

Lifting licensing exemptions for embedded generation facilitates private investment in solar/wind

Dedicated JETP Project Management Unit and Presidential Climate Commission to engage ecosystem actors to create inclusive energy transition plans

Passed Climate Change Bill in 2023 to facilitate institutional arrangements for climate policies and actions, as well as to mandate the implementation of a carbon budgeting system and the establishment of sector emissions targets

Published the Green Finance Taxonomy and JSE’s Sustainable Disclosure Guidance, prompting local financial institutions to publish climate-related policies and commitments

Multilateral development banks finance and explore local grid and energy storage reform in a more inviting environment, priming existing infrastructure for renewables integration and creating space for innovative grid technologies:

Concessional loans from the World Bank, AfDB and the New Development Bank funded Eskom’s Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), to install 1,440 MWh of grid-connected battery storage to improve reliability and absorb solar/wind fluctuations

A 2023 grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency enabled exploration of AI-enhanced grid management, energy storage integration, and cross-border electricity trading. The study was implemented by U.S. firm POWER to reduce load shedding and increase the grid’s renewables capacity

Engagement with the Chinese government, leveraging PowerChina’s expertise to upgrade high-voltage transmission and ‘smart distribution’ infrastructure bolsters local capacity for future renewable additions through modernizing Eskom’s existing infrastructure

Total Energy & Power Investments In South Africa 2020-2025 By Sector

It Takes Two to Tango: Targeted Partnerships Invigorate Innovation

In signalling global investor confidence, the JETP has attracted international and bilateral private sector collaboration targeted at scaling renewables generation, invigorating innovative development in renewables applications in mobility and battery production.

Envusa Energy is a joint venture between Anglo American and EDF Renewables to decarbonize Anglo American’s mining operations and add renewables generation to the national grid. Envusa is developing 600 MW of renewable capacity in its first phase, planning to scale up to 3 GW by 2030

Global independent power producers (IPPs) Enel Green Power (Italy), Scatec ASA (Norway), and Mainstream Renewable Power (Ireland) have secured over 7.7 GW in utility-scale wind and solar capacity through competitive auctions

Anglo American and ENGIE’s have collaborated on the world’s largest hydrogen-powered mining truck in 2022 and BMW South Africa and Vulcan Energy have invested in solar-powered EV charging networks and critical mineral supply chains from local renewables scaling

Foreign partners have invested in initiatives to grow local early-stage development capabilities:

Local mining councils partnered with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in 2021 to foster research and development for advanced materials and sustainable mineral processing

The Hydrogen Valley Initiative, led by South Africa’s Department of Science and Innovation and partners like Anglo American, mapped potential hydrogen corridors and kicked off pilot projects ranging from forklifts to fuel cell bus routes

Universities such as the University of the Western Cape are partnering with global labs on battery storage developments that take local conditions into account

Invigorating investment in green hydrogen production/technology development, coordinated international efforts aim to capitalize on South Africa’s natural geographic suitability and influence future policy support:

$1B SA-H2 Fund launched alongside the Netherlands and Denmark (2023) to scale domestic green hydrogen production and position the country as a global export hub through mobilizing large-scale investments

German and South African bilateral Hydrogen Task Force, invested €23.1M in hydrogen “reference projects” including hydrogen-fuelled trucks, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel. Coordinated by KfW and South Africa’s IDC, financing aims to bridge funding gaps to attract private investors and value-chain development

Sasol’s various partnerships: Signed an MoU with ITOCHU to explore a green ammonia project in Northern Cape Town and partnered with ArcelorMittal South Africa to develop a hydrogen-powered “green steel” facility at Saldanha Bay

Picking Up Pace: Considerations As Plans Come to Fruition

Even with renewed financing, the JETP still contends with practical implementation hurdles. Accelerated planning has expanding the country’s pipeline of projects, inflating the partnership’s scale further than anticipated (no doubt contributing to the U.S.’s exit, among other factors). Financing continues to encounter distribution roadblocks with local companies (e.g., Eskom’s loan delays due to its debt). Green hydrogen’s absence from 2023’s IRP and local groups’ frustrations with the governments’ lack of transparency in developing related strategy complicates foreign interest in green hydrogen.

Local frustrations also extend into the private sector, as corporates struggle to connect with local innovators. Granted, we’ve seen recent initiatives that target local talent like certification and exchange programs facilitated by Germany’s GIZ and SARETEC for wind/solar engineers and a renewables training center/incubator for prospective innovators accompanying The World Bank’s initiative to convert former coal plant Komati Power Station into a solar PV/battery facility. Ultimately, time will tell if this groundwork laid by the JETP is enough to bridge the divide and inch innovators across the path to commercialization.

The goal is to increase accuracy, reduce waste and improve operational oversight.

Shell Aviation now gains better visibility over fuelling activities, with integrated tools that support into-plane refuelling and fuel stock management from a single platform.

“The successful deployment of i6’s technology across multiple Shell Aviation fuelling sites is a significant milestone in our digital transformation,” says Eva Wan, Global Head of Digital Strategy at Shell Aviation.

“This collaboration goes beyond the implementation of digital tools and marks a meaningful advancement in our journey to drive innovation.

“By unlocking new digital capabilities, we are delivering greater value to our customers and empowering our teams to work more efficiently and effectively.”

Cleaner energy through better data

By moving away from paper-based fuel tracking to a digital platform, Shell Aviation and i6 aim to reduce inefficiencies that often lead to fuel overuse or inaccurate reporting.

The technology combines fuel order management with live operational data, offering tighter control over resources and helping to meet carbon reduction targets.

It is a clear example of how better data usage can support sustainability in energy-intensive sectors.

As more airports adopt the i6 platform, the environmental impact of aviation fuelling is expected to lessen.

Future deployments include Dubai International, Birmingham and Singapore Changi, extending the reach of this digital-first approach.

Each airport added to the programme strengthens the case for digital fuel solutions in reducing emissions at scale.

“This is an exciting step forward in our partnership with Shell Aviation,” says Alex Mattos, Co-Founder and Managing Director at i6 Group.

“It demonstrates the tangible value of digital transformation and we’re thrilled to support Shell Aviation in delivering smarter fuel operations globally.”

Global expansion and local impact

Beyond Shell’s direct airport operations, the platform is also being extended through Shell Aviation Technical Services and Consultancy (TSA).

TSA provides support to fuelling companies within Shell’s network, helping them run safer and more efficient operations.

Now, these members can adopt i6’s cloud-based system, bringing the same digital upgrades to local and regional markets.

One of the first TSA member rollouts took place at Punta Cana International Airport in the Dominican Republic.

Gulfstream Petroleum Dominica (GPD) Aviation, a leading fuel distributor in the Caribbean, now uses i6’s platform to manage fuel operations digitally.

“As a member of Shell Aviation TSA, we’re not just committed to operational safety and efficiency – we live by it every day. Implementing i6 is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a key milestone for GPD Aviation,” explains Edmundo Jimenez, Aviation Director at GPD.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0ed2b222924059ea788fe21852cc1ad1:ecc43bb18cfef17d09d77b88737f7b1c/shell-aviation.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 10:56:58.959090

Key questions for Bailey and Edmond during the webinar were: Can aviation become sustainable and by when? Why does business aviation need to create its own narrative on sustainability? Will investment into new technologies continue? And, what regulatory hurdles will aviation face?

What is going to create real change in aviation and what time scales are realistic?

There is a lot of hype about hydrogen and new electric aircraft being developed Edmond noted. These new aircraft will come with time but will have initial drawbacks. For example, electric aircraft will initially be relatively small, regional aircraft while the notion of having hydrogen airliners that can transport a lot of people long distances is at least 20 years away .

A key feature of business aviation is that it provides access to flying when you want, where you want and with who you want. In the short term however, new alternatively fuelled aircraft will demand an entirely new airport fuelling infrastructure, therefore contrasting the advantages of business aviation in the short term.

Edmond predicts the biggest transformation over the next few years will come from sustainable fuel sources. SAF is going to be one of the hottest and most innovative developments in the industry to date. Whether influenced from mandates in the US and/or Europe, suppliers are actively exploring how to rapidly increase the production of SAF for market. The business aviation community is leading the way with SAF; one example is creating book and claim systems which has enabled the efficient uptake of SAF across the world .

Aviation needs to have its own narrative on sustainability. However, who should be leading this individual business or trade bodies like the BBGA?

As CEO of the BBGA, Bailey explained the industry is very interested in creating its own narrative. Our members are continually discussing the fact there is too much greenwashing in the media and not enough focus on the transformation aviation is currently going through .

The UK Government has announced its ambition to be a global leader in general aviation, however caution and realism are required. Bailey noted In order to be leaders we must make the UK highly attractive through the transformation process, which means we can t shut down aviation coming into the UK or do anything to undermine it. The narrative must explain that while we are working as a community to transition to electrification, hydrogen, and other new aircraft technologies, this takes time. It is important to demonstrate our progress and not destroy our industry while we are getting there .

Bailey went on to explain We asked students at Stansted College how they thought aviation was performing as an industry in terms of fuel burn and environmental impact; in a nutshell, they perceived aviation as the sinners of the universe.. Unfortunately, this view is shared widely outside of aviation. The wider public do not appreciate the comparatively small amounts aviation actually burns and what impact this has .

However, this is not a defence strategy Bailey explained. We can t simply react every time a question is asked in the media. We must get the narrative that says we want to move forward as quickly as we possibly can. We need to put ourselves in a position to be world leaders, and that means creating a different narrative .

In the commercial aviation sector, some airlines are taking a more proactive public narrative approach with clear statements about a movement away from carbon offsets (which have been widely discredited). EasyJet, for example, recently released a statement announcing they will no longer offset carbon emissions and instead invest funds into science-based targets initiative SPTI to focus on sustainable fuel. Edmond explained we see many airlines buying into the sustainable fuel narrative. This has also attracted the interest of airline leasing companies and other commercial aviation sectors, all wanting to be seen to invest in sustainable fuel production and to accelerate sustainable fuel availability .

Edmond noted There is a great opportunity for the business aviation community to come together and proactively own the narrative around sustainable aviation fuel and demonstrate it is more than greenwashing .

With multiple aircraft manufacturers competing for investment to develop new and sustainable aircraft, is there a risk this could this hinder global collaboration of new technologies to progress sustainable aviation quicker?

There are many different technology providers innovating in the sustainable fuel production business at the moment Edmond commented. While some early movers have established pathways and initial technologies, before investors provide large capital investment, they want to understand demand for the product and projected revenue. At present information on the demand for sustainable fuel and technologies that will result in sales is vague .

As SAF and new technologies develop it will become clearer to manufacturers where customer demand will come from and this will make investment easier. Further, it is likely that aviation will see a consolidation of small aviation development companies as larger businesses move quickly to acquire new technology ahead of rivals.

Do you feel there is a tension between the technological advances of aviation and the immediate politics of tax and regulation?

There is a current pressure on politicians to tax polluting industries. Bailey confirmed HMRC are under pressure and conflicted when it comes to aviation fuel taxes; if sustainability is to be driven forward in the UK, then the tax applied to aviation fuel has to be amended. Trying to get people to take up SAF is not an easy battle because there is a big price difference compared to normal aviation fuel; unfortunately, not everyone has the conscience we would like. We have an opportunity to drive the market forward into widespread use and distribution of SAF; we must ensure all sectors are taking sustainability seriously .

Willie Walsh, director general of the airline association IATA, has talked widely about public perception and acceptance of aviation. He has stressed that if airlines are to continue to fly and to develop, it will be contingent upon them taking environmental issues seriously.

More general aviation rules and policy are also being impacted by the pressure for aviation to become more sustainable. EU policy makers are preparing for a revision of the basic air services regulation; the rules much of commercial transport around Europe. It is clear these rules will be increasingly selective in what kind of aviation they want to support. Patrick noted it comes back to setting a narrative we must ensure aviation is working clearly and loudly toward a sustainable future rather than being perceived to be working against it .

The Energy Marketers of America (formerly, Petroleum Marketers Association of America) (“EMA”) submitted April 10th comments to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) addressing its:

…notice of intent to propose regulations (forthcoming regulations) implementing the clean fuels production income tax credits under § 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code (45Z), as added by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

EMA initially states that it:

…supports expanding the availability and accessibility of biofuels, the guidance for Section 45Z—which defines key concepts and outlines rules for measuring carbon intensity—is unlikely to achieve its intended goal of reducing transportation costs for consumers.

The Clean Fuel Production Credit is a tax credit for clean fuel production. It is an income tax credit for the domestic production of clean transportation fuel and divided into two categories:

Sustainable aviation fuel.

Non-sustainable aviation transportation fuel.

The credit is equal to the product of:

The applicable amount per gallon (or gallon equivalent) for any transportation fuel that is produced by the taxpayer at a qualified facility during the taxable year sold by the taxpayer in a qualifying sale; and,

The emissions factor for such fuel is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.

EMA describes itself as a federation of 49 state and regional trade associations representing family-owned and operated small business energy marketers throughout the United States. Its members are stated to be responsible for supplying 80% of all finished motor fuel and heating fuel products in the United States.

The Arkansas Oil Marketers Association is a state member of EMA.

EMA states that the proposed regulations fail to offer the economic incentives needed to drive greater adoption of biofuels. The organization identifies what it describes as “structural deficiencies” which include:

The shift in incentives from blenders to producers — and allocating added weight to aviation fuels —discourages energy marketers and retailers from including biofuel gallons into their sales portfolios.

The lack of harmonization between 45Z and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) undermines compliance with volume mandates.

The barriers to pass-through mechanisms effectively cancel out the carbon reduction benefits of renewable heating oil.

The emissions rate model lacks a clear, consistent methodology for credit calculation.

To realize the full benefits of biofuel incentives, there must be alignment with infrastructure policy to ensure the safe and reliable availability of biofuels below the terminal rack.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 10:57:03.740901

He called on governments and industry to remain focused on delivering the fundamental expectations of customers—safety and security, digitalization and sustainability.

“Whether supporting global trade, enabling e-commerce, or delivering vital humanitarian aid, the value of air cargo has never been clearer. To meet customer expectations and navigate an increasingly complex environment, the air cargo industry must continuously strengthen safety and security, fast-track digitalization, and deliver on its sustainability commitments,” Mr Sullivan said.

In terms of safety Mr Sullivan focused on the safe transport of lithium batteries and called on governments to step up efforts to stop rogue shippers and support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention—the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

“Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that comes increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement,” he said.

There was also a need for coordinated, risk-based measures for increased security and IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments.

IATA also renewed its call to states to fulfill their Annex 17 obligations by sharing timely and accurate threat intelligence to enable informed risk assessments and operational decisions.

“The industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. But governments have infinitely more resources, particularly in intelligence gathering. The best results come when governments and industry work together,” Mr Sullivan said.

He also called for greater emphasis to be given to ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance, and transparency.

The air cargo industry needed to continue to build sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics.

Momentum was also growing around reducing carbon emissions with more companies committing to sustainable aviation fuel.

Amid growing trade tensions, IATA reinforced its position that trade drives prosperity, and that any measures undermining the free flow of goods ultimately hurt businesses, consumers, and economies.

“Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are.

Nature play at any age Nature play is not limited to early childhood; these experiences benefit children at all stages.","Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., peals of laughter ring from the Bird House exhibit. Children splash in the water, dig in the dirt, experiment with sand and build with moss and rocks at Little Critters: Nature Play. This free drop-in program gives children the opportunity to explore nature and early science concepts at their own pace and comfort level and in the company of their caregiver.

Nature play is a specialized type of nature-based learning that prioritizes child-directed, hands-on activities and emphasizes authentic interaction with nature and/or natural materials. It can take place outside but can also take place indoors by using loose, natural parts like sticks, leaves, rocks or soil. The flexibility of nature play means that it can be easily adapted to any environment and incorporated in schools or at home. Little Critters: Nature Play intentionally engages caregivers to build their comfort using natural materials so they can continue nature play at home.

Nature play activities also often incorporate imaginative play opportunities for children to play like animals and practice caretaking behaviors. This strengthens children’s developing sense of empathy and models how they can participate authentically in shaping and caring for the world around them.

More than fun

Though it may look like simple fun, nature play is underpinned by decades of research on its benefits. Introducing this type of play-based learning in nature during childhood has a long-term effect of increasing participation in pro-environmental behaviors in adulthood, according to a study from 2015 by Louise Chawla of the Environmental Design Program at the University of Colorado Boulder. These long-term benefits are particularly significant for young children from birth to age 8, as frequent, positive outdoor experiences during this period contribute to developing conceptions of the natural world as a desirable, valuable place. Reduced exposure to nature during this period can result in children developing fear or misunderstandings of nature, specifically surrounding certain less desirable parts of nature: bugs, dirt and germs.

These negative feelings can then perpetuate and systematize this feeling of nature as undesirable or other). Children growing up in urban environments with less immediate access to natural spaces can be at particular risk of developing fearful responses to wild places and feelings of anxiety, discomfort and disgust toward natural elements such as dirt, plants and animals, according to a 1994 study from Robert Bixler, et al. It is perhaps no wonder that nature play has been widely embraced by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and implemented at zoos, nature centers and schools around the world. At the Smithsonian’s National Zoo, nature play is at the core of our strategy for engaging and inspiring the next generation of learners and scientists.

The benefits of nature play are not limited to the connections that form between children and the natural world. The multisensory, experiential qualities inherent in nature play offer many different developmental and academic benefits when integrated into any learning environment:

Without the prescribed narratives and uses presented by built environments and materials, children have greater freedom to direct and create their play, strengthening decision-making skills and reinforcing self-confidence.

The sensory-rich experience of being outdoors (or bringing natural items inside) can make it accessible to a wider range of developmental levels, as children can approach and engage at their own pace and comfort level.

Activating experiential learning opportunities in nature has been shown to improve student outcomes in science, math, and language arts, according to a 2013 study by Dilafruz Williams and P. Scott Dixon.

Nature-based play provides a powerful opportunity to build empathy for other living things and the natural world through activities encouraging connection, comparison and consideration.

Using natural materials in the classroom instead of commercially produced materials (e.g., sticks and rocks instead of plastic blocks) helps build creative and critical pathways, strengthens symbolic representation skills, and enhances the future play value of these materials when encountered outside.

Nature play in your classroom

The benefits of nature play do not end with the students. Nature-based learning also offers teachers and caregivers one of our most treasured gifts: flexibility! Nature play can be activated in any environment, from rural to urban, and it does not require a special field trip. All it takes is stepping outside your school doors!

Don’t have a forest in your backyard? A patch of grass or puddles on a sidewalk can inspire nature-based learning. Take advantage of a sunny day to observe, measure, or sketch shadows on the playground or sidewalk as a part of your math, art, or science lessons. Spend time observing the shrubs outside your school entrance each day and identify new vocabulary words to describe any changes. Or create and illustrate stories about any insects students observe living in the shrubs; what changes do they see?

You and your students can also bring nature into your classroom with the outdoor treasures you collect or by using some of these supply and activity ideas.

Nature play at any age

Nature play is not limited to early childhood; these experiences benefit children at all stages. The Little Critters: Nature Play program about trees offers ways to adapt nature-based activities and is designed to engage students of various ages.

Early childhood (preschool)

Sensory play: Young children learn about the world around them through their senses. Sensory play is an important way to encourage sensory exploration. Try incorporating materials from trees that you can easily find outside (pinecones, acorns, branches, leaves) into sensory play stations to develop your students’ vocabulary. Need something academic to push sensory play to the next level? Encourage students to sort by type: can they group the pinecones together? Provide color-coded bowls for color sorting or labeled baskets for size sorting.

Early elementary (K-2)

Math manipulatives: Incorporate materials from trees as math manipulatives for easy, low-cost, nature-based learning. Instead of using plastic bears to count on a tens frame, provide your students with acorns to practice counting or other mathematical operations. Try using pinecones for informal measurement: how long is the table using pinecones instead of plastic measuring blocks? This will build your students’ comfort level with natural materials and also stimulate their creativity.

Late elementary (3-5)

Food chains/food qeb: Instead of drawing a food web on the whiteboard, take your students outside to observe the natural world: on the playground, on the sidewalk, on a trail, anywhere. Have students observe and illustrate any animal and plant interactions on a field notebook page. Are there birds eating seeds? Bugs nibbling leaves? Have each student document their food chain interaction and share as a group. Draw observations into a collective food web showing all the food chain interactions they witnessed on their outdoor adventure.

Middle school (6-8)

Exploring biodiversity: This activity will help your students practice scientific thinking and science skills while exploring the hidden biodiversity in your schoolyard. Find a spot under or near a tree to set up a “Biocube” and discover all the different organisms that live there.

Find more activities and learn more about nature play at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.

“Whether supporting global trade, enabling e-commerce, or delivering vital humanitarian aid, the value of air cargo has never been clearer. To meet customer expectations and navigate an increasingly complex environment, the air cargo industry must continuously strengthen safety and security, fast-track digitalization, and deliver on its sustainability commitments,” said Brendan Sullivan, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo at the opening of the 18th World Cargo Symposium (WCS) in Dubai, UAE.

Safety: Zero Tolerance for Rogue Shippers

Safety is the top priority for air transport and in the case of air cargo the specific focus is on the safe transport of lithium batteries. IATA calls on government to step up efforts to stop rogue shippers and support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention—the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

“Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that come increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement,” said Sullivan.

Security: The Need for Coordinated, Risk-Based Measures

IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments. While some states implemented new measures, the lack of alignment led to inconsistent outcomes. This situation reinforces the importance of harmonized responses based on global standards.

“Recent security incidents highlight the need for better coordination among governments. Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures. Global standards and cooperation are essential,” said Sullivan.

IATA also renewed its call to states to fulfill their Annex 17 obligations by sharing timely and accurate threat intelligence to enable informed risk assessments and operational decisions.

“The industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. But governments have infinitely more resources, particularly in intelligence gathering. The best results come when governments and industry work together,” said Sullivan.

Digitalization: Accelerating Industry-Wide Adoption of ONE Record

IATA reinforced the central role of ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance, and transparency. The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data. To accelerate industry adoption IATA urged:

Airlines and forwarders to move forward with implementation

Governments to recognize ONE Record in regulatory data filing requirements

Developers to build secure, open, and compatible digital platforms

“ONE Record is a foundational shift in how we share, manage, and trust data across the supply chain. Airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned. To achieve full value, implementation must accelerate across all stakeholders, and governments must recognize ONE Record in their regulatory frameworks,” said Sullivan.

Sustainability: Commitment Strong, SAF Support Needed

The air cargo industry continues to embed sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics. For example, IATA guidance to eliminate single-use plastics across the cargo supply chain is now reflected in operational standards.

Progress is also being made on the sector’s largest environmental challenge—reducing carbon emissions. Momentum around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is growing, with new agreements across the value chain and more companies committing to SAF use. The SAF Registry, recently launched and operated by CADO, is designed to enable a global market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and accelerate the industry's transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition, IATA will soon launch CO2 Connect for Cargo to support accurate emissions calculation and reporting, including SAF usage.

However, SAF volumes remain far below what is needed, and production costs remain high. IATA urged governments to implement policy frameworks to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.

“We are committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the ramp-up of SAF—our strongest lever—has been disappointing. The major fuel producers have been slow-walking—or sidelining—planned investments in SAF. Aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2 saving products such as hydrogen-powered aircraft. And governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded. Instead, they send mixed signals by subsidizing fossil fuel extraction while aiming for net zero. Airlines are committed and determined but we cannot do it alone. We need action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers,” said Sullivan.

Trade Tensions

Amid growing trade tensions, IATA reinforced its position that trade drives prosperity, and that any measures undermining the free flow of goods ultimately hurt businesses, consumers, and economies.

“Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want,” said Sullivan.

Safety: Zero tolerance for rogue shippers

Safety is the top priority for air transport and in the case of air cargo the specific focus is on the safe transport of lithium batteries, says an official release. ""IATA calls on the government to step up efforts to stop rogue shippers and support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention—the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.""

Sullivan said: ""Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that come increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement.""

IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments. While some states implemented new measures, the lack of alignment led to inconsistent outcomes.

""Recent security incidents highlight the need for better coordination among governments. Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures. Global standards and cooperation are essential,” said Sullivan.

Digitalisation: Accelerating industry-wide adoption of ONE Record

IATA reinforced the central role of ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance and transparency, the release added.

""The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data. To accelerate industry adoption, IATA urged:

*Airlines and forwarders to move forward with implementation;

*Governments to recognize ONE Record in regulatory data filing requirements; and

*Developers to build secure, open, and compatible digital platforms.""

Sullivan said: ""ONE Record is a foundational shift in how we share, manage, and trust data across the supply chain. Airlines representing 72 percent of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned. To achieve full value, implementation must accelerate across all stakeholders, and governments must recognise ONE Record in their regulatory frameworks.""

Sustainability: Commitment strong, SAF support needed

The air cargo industry continues to embed sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics, the release added.

""Progress is also being made on the sector’s largest environmental challenge—reducing carbon emissions. Momentum around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is growing, with new agreements across the value chain and more companies committing to SAF use. The SAF Registry, recently launched and operated by CADO, is designed to enable a global market for SAF and accelerate the industry's transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition, IATA will soon launch CO2 Connect for Cargo to support accurate emissions calculation and reporting, including SAF usage.""

Sullivan said: ""We are committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the ramp-up of SAF - our strongest lever - has been disappointing. The major fuel producers have been slow-walking or sidelining planned investments in SAF. Aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2-saving products such as hydrogen-powered aircraft. And governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded. Instead, they send mixed signals by subsidising fossil fuel extraction while aiming for net zero. Airlines are committed and determined but we cannot do it alone. We need action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers.""

Trade tensions worrying

IATA reinforced its position that trade drives prosperity, and that any measures undermining the free flow of goods ultimately hurt businesses, consumers and economies.

""Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want,"" said Sullivan.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/15/81002-aircargo07.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 11:56:42.285504

The job was for the Glenn ’65 and Heather Hilliard Endowed Professor of Environmental Sustainability. As intriguing as it appeared to him, Dwivedi was hesitant to apply, knowing he was still a freshly minted professor.

“I talked to a lot of other folks, family, friends, seniors, my advisors,” Dwivedi said. “They said this is a good opportunity; you should definitely go about it. So, after careful consideration, I applied for the position. I was really excited about it.”

After becoming a full professor in July 2024 at the University of Georgia, Dwivedi began his new position as Clemson’s Glenn ’65 and Heather Hilliard Endowed Professor of Environmental Sustainability on Aug. 15.

“It is a humbling experience to get this prestigious position,” Dwivedi said. “My lab at the Clemson University Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation will be working on sustainable forestry issues in South Carolina and beyond to answer some critical questions for supporting a balance between prosperity, people and the planet. This is the exciting part about this position as it allows you to develop independent research projects in your area of expertise. This is also a great way to work with modern conservationalists like Glenn and Heather Hilliard to appreciate their vision for the state and the region overall.”

Glenn and Heather Hilliard started the endowed scholarship in 2010. Hilliard said growing up in the country and being involved in the Boy Scouts as a youngster showed him the importance of protecting the state’s forest lands, while also making them available to everyone for health, recreation and economic improvement.

“We believe that South Carolina is an absolutely spectacular and wonderful state that Heather and I love very much,” Glenn Hilliard said. “We want to do all we can do to keep it spectacular and wonderful. It’s filled with incredible natural and historic areas that certainly deserve to be identified and protected.

“I think the endowed professorship is environmentally going to help everything come together in a meaningful way and add value to a lot of work that’s already going on in this field. He is a world-class guy and really, really smart. I think he’s going to help us a lot. For Heather and I, one of our goals in life is to leave this world and our state a better and more beautiful place. We believe we can do it with this Clemson University professor because he’s going to be able to do that work long after we’re gone.”

Currently, Dwivedi’s research includes assessing the impact of federal conservation programs on ecosystem services and people, determining the role of urban forestry on the physical and mental well-being of city dwellers, as well as quantifying the role of wood-based sustainable aviation fuel in reducing wildfires. He is also starting new research programs on conservation and public health outcomes, forestry governance, climate-smart forestry and family forest landowners by working closely with faculty members at Clemson’s College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, and beyond to highlight the role of sustainable forestry.

“There’s a lot of action on sustainable forestry. Many people are entrusted to use wood to make various products,” Dwivedi said. “I want to make sure we are undertaking high-quality research and, at the same time, we are educating people to ensure they are investing in new wood-based products and technologies.”

Since arriving at Clemson, Dwivedi has been meeting with other faculty members in the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences to learn what projects they are working on. Those meetings will eventually expand to other colleges and universities in South Carolina.

“Then, I can see how to bring all of those ideas together in a single platform so that we can use all of those ideas in a cohesive manner to go for big proposals from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to do more fundamental research to improve the sustainability of forest resources and further expand the markets of wood-based products to encourage people to participate in markets for ecosystem services to make sure everybody is getting benefits from the forest industry,” Dwivedi said.

In the meantime, Dwivedi has begun to establish his research lab. He currently has three postdoctoral research associates and two doctoral students. The first student is working on urban forestry and deliberating on policy initiatives needed for improving urban forestry management across the state. The other doctoral student is working on the management of wildfires and ways to plan for them to reduce economic and environmental losses. He also recruited seven more graduate students who will enroll at Clemson this fall to start their respective degree programs.

Dwivedi, who is from India, completed his undergraduate studies in mechanical engineering at Devi Ahilya University Institute of Engineering and Technology in 2003, but it wasn’t something he fully enjoyed. In looking at what he wanted to do in the future, Dwivedi stumbled upon forestry.

He received his master’s in forestry management in 2005 at the Indian Institute of Forest Management. After working in New Delhi for a year, Dwivedi realized he was interested in higher education and wanted to make that his career. His supervisor encouraged him to apply for the University of Florida’s doctorate program. He graduated with a doctorate in forest policy and economics in 2010.

Unable to find a faculty position due to tough market conditions, Dwivedi started as a postdoctoral research associate at Yale University for two years. After that, he worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana for about a year. Dwivedi began working at the University of Georgia in 2013 where he was a faculty member for 11 years before coming to Clemson.

“He was a wonderful surprise,” Hilliard said. “I really enjoyed meeting him, first on the phone. I think he’s world-class. And I think South Carolina, Clemson and all are incredibly delighted that Puneet accepted the position. He’s a world-class environmentalist and professor. He’s going to play a major, important contributor to the important forestry business in South Carolina.”",https://news.clemson.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PuneetDwivedi1.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 08:56:07.300080

This year, the event takes place at a moment of transition for the industry and international relations, with tensions high due to tariffs and trade wars, demanding innovation, collaboration and world leadership.

The UAE Minister of Economy H.E. Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri began the event, welcoming attendees to the three-day event and touching on the industry’s key priorities.

“We’re very proud to host this global gathering of thought leaders, industry innovators and the pivotal movement of aviation and logistics sectors as a global hub for connectivity, trade and innovation,” Al Marri stated.

“We want to take this opportunity to recognise the exceptional contribution of Emirates SkyCargo and all our national carriers and logistics players for their role in strengthening the UAE’s position.”

Pointing to the synergy between the UAE’s strategy and the focus points for the aviation industry, Al Marri highlighted the importance of connectivity, sustainability and partnership in the success of the sector.

“Let us use this forum to forge new partnerships, scale impactful solutions and turn our vision into globalisation, connectivity and free trade over fragmentation, polarisation and protectionism,” Al Marri declared.

Connecting through challenges

Recognising the nation’s role empowering connectivity, enabling resilience in supply chains and facilitating international cooperations, Al Marri highlighted how Dubai recorded a milestone moment in 2024 with over one million air traffic movements and the nation’s airport’s serving more than 40 million passengers.

“We’re seeing the sector expand rapidly, driven by surging e-commerce, increasing demand for just in time logistics and new marketing perishable and pharmaceuticals,” Al Marri stated. “On the other hand, we face confidence of global challenges, geopolitical volatility, tightening, revelations and historic imperative to decarbonise last and most recently, the global tariff conflict.”

Net Zero mission

Al Marri was clear in his opening that sustainability is also a key focus point for the industry, as it continues to aim to meet net zero by 2050 cargo: “The UAE recognises their responsibility and is acting decisively. As a recent host of the COP 28 summit, the UAE is advancing one of the most ambitious climate agendas in the global aviation dialogue.”

Looking to put sustainable aviation fuel front and centre, as the industry moves forward, the UAE has launched a SAF roadmap, which has set a target of producing 700 million litres of SAF annually by 2030.

“This could eliminate up to 4.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, while establishing the UAE as a region hub of sustainable aviation fuels,” Al Marri declared.

Innovation leads the industry

Recognised as an equally key part of the industry’s development is the introduction of digitalisation on a wider scale, from electronic airway bills and integrated logistics platforms to predictive analytics and AI enabled customs compliance.

“Technology is reshaping air cargo and it must embrace efficiency,” Al Marri said. “Visibility and traceability are no longer nice to have future. They are market expectations. Digital tools are critical, not just for competitiveness, but for regulatory compliance, especially in customs security and safety.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UAE-Minister.jpeg,N,,2025-04-15 08:56:17.333561

The report’s base case, the Economic Transition Scenario, finds robust adoption of clean power and electrification in road transport, growth in natural gas demand, and long-term decline in coal and oil could cut overall emissions by 22% by 2050

BNEF’s modeling indicates that emissions have potentially seen structural decline for the first time globally

LONDON, April 15, 2025 – Navigating the energy transition has never been more complex for investors and businesses as they face elevated policy risks and geopolitical tension. BloombergNEF’s (BNEF’s) New Energy Outlook 2025, published today, examines the strong case for clean energy technologies and how the global energy transition is expected to progress at the intersection of increasingly cost-competitive solutions and growing energy demand.

BNEF’s updated Economic Transition Scenario (ETS) maps out a route to a lower-carbon energy system in a world where cost-competitive technologies drive investment decisions to meet rising energy demand. Under this scenario, BNEF sees faster growth in power demand due to increased use of artificial intelligence, which presents both a major challenge and opportunity for businesses. According to the report, demand for electric power rises 75% by 2050 as economic development, electric vehicles, cooling needs and data centers increase overall use.

“Growing economies in Asia, the Middle East and Africa account for a large portion of the increase, David Hostert, global head of economics and modelling at BNEF, and lead author of the report, said. “It is here that the greatest opportunities for power infrastructure investment will lie. We expect data-center power demand in these markets to grow by six to 16 times by 2035 and reach 260 terawatt-hours.”

Specifically, data centers are emerging as one of the most important new sources of electricity demand, representing 4.5% of total global power demand in 2035 and rising to 8.7% in 2050. BNEF estimates that an additional 362 gigawatts of power generation capacity will be needed globally by 2035 to meet data-center demand. The US stands out as the single most important market in this trend. According to BNEF’s analysis in The US Data Center Market Outlook, which is also published today, US data centers are projected to grow from 3.5% of total electricity demand in 2024 to 8.6% by 2035 – a faster rise than any other major load class. Over the next five years, demand from US data centers could outpace even electric vehicles’ incremental demand, driven by the surge in AI training workloads that require significant compute capacity and highly energy-dense infrastructure.

In BNEF’s global ETS, renewables and electric vehicles continue to expand their role as they become more cost-competitive and maturing technologies drive faster adoption. Renewable generation increases 84% in the five years to 2030, and doubles again by 2050. Solar, wind and other renewable sources serve 67% of the world’s demand for electric power by 2050, up from 33% in 2024. Similarly, sales of passenger electric vehicles increase to 42 million in 2030 – up from 17.2 million in 2024 – and almost double again to 80 million in 2050. With the robust adoption of clean power and electrification in road transport in the coming decades, BNEF sees emissions in ETS fall 22% by 2050 (back to 2005 levels), a trajectory in line with global warming of 2.6C by 2100, with a 67% likelihood.

“Major investment and rapid deployment of clean energy technologies across markets is essential to materializing real change, said Matthias Kimmel, head of energy economics at BNEF and co-author of the report. “The total investment potential for renewables in our ETS is almost $6 trillion from 2025 to 2035, and $10.55 trillion from 2025 to 2050. Policy makers and investors should continue to take advantage of readily available solutions like renewables, storage and electric vehicles, and capitalize on emerging opportunities surrounding energy supply and security.”

While electrification helps deliver a 40% reduction in oil consumption in the transport sector by mid-century, gas plays a larger role in the ETS due to lower long-term fuel price expectations and higher electricity demand from data centers. Specifically, global natural gas demand increases 25% from 2024 to 2050. Meanwhile, unlike renewables and EVs, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, clean fuels and low-carbon industrial processes all struggle to make an impact in the ETS.

The report also provides a comparison to BNEF’s previously published Net Zero Scenario (NZS), which charts a pathway to global net zero by 2050 and global warming of 1.75 degrees Celsius. The NZS calls for much faster deployment of clean technologies: by 2035, there are 16 terawatts of wind and solar installed globally, versus 12.6TW in the ETS. The passenger EV fleet is twice as large by 2035, at 952 million vehicles on the road. Nuclear power capacity rises above 750GW, hydrogen to 159 million metric tons, and demand for sustainable aviation fuel jumps to nearly 40 billion gallons, as multiple sectors race to decarbonize faster.

This year’s New Energy Outlook also contains a section focused on the 10 years to 2035, the year when countries will submit the third round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, which are due this year in advance of COP30 in Brazil. While many countries have yet to share their emissions pledges, the report indicates that markets like the EU, Australia and South Korea need to target roughly a 70% reduction in emissions by 2035 to align to the NZS.

Other findings in the report include:

The need to scale key technologies like renewable energy, electric vehicles, battery energy storage, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, sustainable fuels, heat pumps, grid infrastructure and more to reach net-zero emissions.

The investment volumes needed to achieve both the base case ETS ($185 trillion) and NZS ($213 trillion) and why there’s only a 15% difference between the two pathways.

How major countries stack up against each other with their carbon emissions trajectories, what emissions reductions are needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals, and assessments for countries that have submitted their third NDC.

,,2025-04-15 11:52:35+00:00,www.dentons.com,The challenge of project financing Europe's SAF projects - Dentons,Not Available,,,,,https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2025/april/15/the-challenge-of-project-financing-europes-saf-projects,"This article considers certain key challenges that have emerged with respect to the project financing of the early SAF projects in Europe or which are targeting export to Europe.
Airlines (the end-users of SAF) do not typically forward-hedge their fuel requirements beyond two to three years, making a long-term, fixed-price offtake agreement (that project finance lenders typically require) difficult to secure for a SAF project.
This competition for feedstock also adds a greater level of uncertainty to its cost and value in SAF production.
The most-proven technology for SAF production is the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which uses bio feedstocks.
Ideally, the costs of compliance with a change in SAF regulatory requirements (i.e.","In the era of ""Net Zero"", much legislation has evolved from the EU with respect to the imposition of mandatory decarbonisation targets and the composition of lower-carbon fuels.

One area of focus has been the aviation sector, which accounts for approximately 2.5% of global CO2 emissions.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation seeks to decarbonise the sector by imposing obligations on fuel suppliers, certain EU airports and aircraft operators to respectively supply, facilitate access to and lift sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Financial institutions also have greater internal mandates to support the development of sustainable projects.

However, notwithstanding the regulatory requirements for SAF production and usage, and the appetite in the market for projects to be developed, the number of project-financed SAF projects that have reached final investment decision remains low compared to the scale-up of the industry required to meet the EU's regulatory targets.

Many major airlines have also announced voluntary targets in terms of the proportion of SAF they are looking to incorporate into their aviation fuels mix.

This article considers certain key challenges that have emerged with respect to the project financing of the early SAF projects in Europe or which are targeting export to Europe.

How does the EU define SAF?

SAF is a ""drop-in"" fuel, meaning it can be blended with conventional jet fuel to reduce the carbon intensity of the aircraft's fuel batch.

It can be safely used by all aircraft and engines that are certified to operate with jet fuel, meaning SAF can already be used in the majority of operational aircraft, giving it a strategic advantage over other clean fuels which require aircraft to be fitted with different engines.

While SAF still contains carbon, and therefore emits CO2 when combusted, if the SAF is produced using certain sustainable pathways, it is not considered to be as carbon-intensive as conventional jet fuels.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation defines SAF as:

an aviation biofuel – liquid fuel produced from prescribed biomass sources such as cooking oil, animal manure or palm oil mill effluent which are not excluded sources (such as food and feed crops);

a synthetic aviation fuel, or e-fuel – fuels (such as e-SAF) made by synthesising green hydrogen with captured CO2 that fulfil the criteria for renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) under the Renewable Energy Directive III; or

a recycled carbon aviation fuel – produced from waste streams of non-renewable origin that meets the requirements of RED III (e.g. jet fuel made from synthetic crude oil derived from municipal solid waste).

Regulatory mandates for SAF usage

Given the cost differential between conventional jet fuel and SAF (in particular e-SAF), regulatory intervention is required to stimulate demand.

An example of this is the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation which imposes the following targets:

aviation fuel suppliers must supply fuel to aircraft operators at EU airports containing an average minimum SAF share (2% from 1 January 2025, rising to 6% by 2030 and thereafter in increments to 70% by 2050);

SAF should contain a minimum amount of RFNBO (1.2% by 2030, rising in increments to 28% by 2050);

applicable aircraft operators are required to uplift at least 90% of their annual fuel requirements from an EU airport (to avoid tankering at airports outside the EU to avoid lifting SAF); and

airport managing bodies must facilitate access to aviation fuel containing the minimum SAF blend (for example, by having the required infrastructure for SAF storage and transmission to aircraft).

The effectiveness of this regulation in promoting the evolution of the aviation fuel market is due to be reviewed by the European Commission by 1 January 2027.

Key challenges of project financing SAF projects

Offtake

While the airline travel industry has in many respects recovered from COVID-19 travel lockdowns, many are not in the financial position to commit to a long-term offtake agreement for SAF, while prices are significantly higher than conventional jet fuel.

Airlines (the end-users of SAF) do not typically forward-hedge their fuel requirements beyond two to three years, making a long-term, fixed-price offtake agreement (that project finance lenders typically require) difficult to secure for a SAF project.

Even if an environmentally-conscious airline can agree to stretch their SAF purchase commitment to, for example, 10 years, this would still leave a large, uncontracted tail for a long-term debt tenor of perhaps 20-25 years (which producers will try to achieve to lower their production costs for the larger SAF projects).

Lenders will struggle to lend to a project with significant uncontracted exposure at the back-end. A potential solution to bridge the gap would be to interpose an intermediary (aggregator) of sufficient creditworthiness between the SAF producer (selling long term) and end-customer(s) (buying short/mid-term).

Trading houses may find this risk profile attractive as it allows potentially lucrative upside if SAF demand surges as the reality of regulatory compliance becomes clear.

Larger projects may also find it difficult to secure one offtaker for the entirety of the plant's production and a sole offtaker's balance sheet might not be sufficiently strong to underpin a large-scale financing.

These projects may therefore enter several offtake arrangements with different buyers (potentially from different sectors) to spread the credit risk.

Bullish SAF producers may seek to have an uncontracted portion of their production sold on the spot market, to capitalise on forecasted demand as the SAF mandates ramp up.

As discussed above, lenders will be reluctant to take significant merchant exposure for a new sector and any limited merchant offtake strategy will need to be supported by detailed marketing analysis and considered implications for debt-sizing.

SAF valuation

The long-term valuation of SAF is currently impossible as the premium for SAF is too uncertain to establish a reliable value.

The SAF price will be a function of demand, largely driven by uncertain regulatory drivers, and supply which combines feedstock costs and production costs.

Levelised cost models may provide some price guidance for the various production pathways, but can only reflect the current understanding and costs base, not a guarantee of future project economics.

In the absence of any well-established pricing index for SAF, project finance lenders will likely require offtake to be on a fixed-cost basis (or by reference to another commodity index with which lenders are familiar and comfortable).

Feedstock supply and pricing

For SAF produced from biogenic sources, there are concerns around competition for feedstock supply in light of other EU-mandated targets that also require the use of biogenic feedstocks for other fuels.

This competition for feedstock also adds a greater level of uncertainty to its cost and value in SAF production. As is customary, lenders will expect a long-term feedstock supply arrangement from a credible and reliable source (meeting the EU's strict eligibility criteria) and a back-up plan in case of critical feedstock unavailability.

For e-SAF requiring CO2, sources of eligible CO2 are also limited by regulation. Biogenic CO2 is most readily available. However, there may be project-on-project risk in the event a SAF project is relying on the delivery of a biogenic CO2 from newly built processing facilities outside the project perimeter. There is an overall challenge around whether there will be sufficient biogenic CO2 available for e-SAF production.

For both e-SAF and bio-SAF, the CO2 supply and other biogenic feedstock supply, respectively, will need to comply with the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and sustainability criteria under RED III and the delegated acts (adding an additional layer of cost and complexity to these projects). Lenders will perform detailed due diligence and GHG modelling to ensure the SAF will meet the EU's regulatory requirements.

The route to market for SAF production into aviation supply to airports will also need to be considered, such as which market the SAF is best suited for, where it might be blended and what logistics are therefore required.

SAF technology

Uncertain and competitive production technologies make it more difficult to provide lenders with the certainty they crave to finance projects.

The most-proven technology for SAF production is the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which uses bio feedstocks. This places production economics in direct competition with hydrotreated vegetable oil and bio-diesel.

While certainty of production costs makes for easier financing, European regulations limit the proportion of HEFA-based SAF in the mandates over time, in order to encourage development of other technologies.

Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) has the advantage of access to large volumes of feedstock i.e. ethanol. A first-scale production plant started in the past year in the US, where ATJ is seen as a viable SAF pathway, subject to meeting carbon intensity targets.

RED III, however, caps the amount of biofuels produced from food/feed crops that can count towards the EU's decarbonisation targets for the transport sector (currently at 7%). As most bio-ethanol is produced from starch-rich crops, SAF using bio-ethanol may have less value in the EU market.

Given the fluidity of the market and the number of competing technologies, lenders are likely to favour SAF projects using technology that has a wide product slate and which can pivot to produce an alternative clean fuel (such as synthetic diesel or gasoline), should market conditions change.

While the technology used for e-SAF production (including electrolysers for green hydrogen, Fischer-Tropsch for hydrogen and CO2 synthesis) is proven at a smaller scale, additional risks are introduced when the technology is scaled up and integrated.

Lenders will undertake a rigorous technical due diligence and examine the robustness of the construction contractual arrangements (see below).

Construction

Given the integration of different technologies, SAF construction procurement may follow similar pathways to industrial downstream projects – whether to go down the single lump-sum turnkey engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract approach or procure the different components separately through an engineering, procurement and construction management contracting strategy (and lower construction costs and, ultimately, SAF costs).

Since the sector is nascent, lenders are likely to be more stringent in requiring an EPC contractor to provide a full technology ""wrap"" for the project.

Utilities access

SAF projects will need to consider any baseload power requirements not supplied by their dedicated renewable energy sources, such as any cooling and storage equipment requiring round-the-clock power.

Depending on location, using power from the grid may create issues in meeting the overall GHG emissions reduction requirements in EU legislation.

Lenders may be more comfortable supporting projects in locations where renewable sources are in abundance or where the average share of renewable energy in the grid exceeds 90% (in which case power can be taken directly from the grid and still be considered ""green"").

Non-HEFA SAF production is expected to be intense in terms of water requirements, meaning that this key utility needs consideration to determine plant and site feasibility.

Regulatory risk

The regulatory environment governing SAF is continuing to evolve and is extremely complex and uncertain. For instance, the pending review of the ReFuelEU Regulation in 2027 is creating apprehension on matters such as penalties.

More generally, given the extensive lobbying around the RED III sustainability requirements for clean fuels, projects can expect the change in law risk to feature prominently in lender due diligence.

Ideally, the costs of compliance with a change in SAF regulatory requirements (i.e. the further tightening of sustainability criteria for SAF) should be passed to the offtaker (SAF customer) under the offtake contract, as the end-user will ultimately only be interested in buying SAF to the extent it complies with the then-current SAF requirements in its market.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has called for urgent and coordinated global efforts to reinforce the resilience of the air cargo sector, stressing the need to meet evolving customer expectations through enhanced safety, digital transformation and sustainability measures.

Speaking at the opening of the 18th World Cargo Symposium in Dubai, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo, Brendan Sullivan, highlighted the crucial role of air cargo in global trade, humanitarian support and e-commerce, urging governments and industry stakeholders to act decisively across key areas.

Safety: Zero Tolerance for Non-Compliant Shippers

Top of the agenda was safety—particularly regarding the transport of lithium batteries, which Sullivan identified as a growing concern. “The risks from undeclared or mis-declared lithium battery shipments are increasing,” he warned, calling on governments to enhance oversight and enforcement to support ICAO’s Annex 18 regulations.

Security: Need for Harmonised Global Measures

Sullivan also addressed the fragmented approach to air cargo security in the wake of recent incidents involving incendiary devices. IATA urged for globally aligned, risk-based measures and emphasised the importance of timely intelligence-sharing between states to mitigate threats effectively.

“Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures,” Sullivan said. “Global standards and cooperation are essential.”

Digitalisation: Push for ONE Record Implementation

On the digital front, IATA reaffirmed the importance of the “ONE Record” initiative, a standard for digital data exchange across the air cargo supply chain. With airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volumes already onboard, Sullivan called on governments to formally recognise the standard in regulatory filings.

“ONE Record transforms how we manage and share data, improving efficiency and compliance. But its full benefits depend on universal adoption,” he said.

Sustainability: More Action Needed on SAF

Sullivan noted the industry’s increasing efforts to embed sustainable practices, such as phasing out single-use plastics and implementing carbon-reduction measures. However, he expressed frustration over the slow progress in scaling up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), citing high production costs and lack of policy support.

“We’re committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but we can’t do it alone,” Sullivan said. “Governments must act now with policy frameworks that encourage SAF production, just as they did with solar and wind energy.”

Trade Tensions and Global Prosperity

Finally, IATA warned against rising protectionism and trade restrictions, emphasising the role of air cargo in supporting economic growth.

“Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are,” Sullivan concluded. “Whatever the outcome of current trade tensions, air cargo will remain essential in keeping the world connected.”

The fire at one of the substations that provides power to Heathrow provided a reminder of the many hundreds of flights that the airport handles every day. Chancellor Reeves justified the recent government announcement supporting a series of airport expansions by stating that 'sustainable aviation fuel' (SAF) was a 'game changer' that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70 per cent.

It is planned that the SAF content will increase to 22 per cent by 2040 by which time it is forecast that passenger numbers will have doubled, equating globally to 200,000 flights day consuming over 18 million barrels of aviation fuel.

This will necessitate the use of multiple sources of feedstock such as municipal waste, sewage and a vast area of land dedicated to growing bioenergy crops.These are already grown on a massive scale to provide the E10 element in the petrol, thus further reducing the area of land available for growing food.

Alternatively SAF could be produced in the form of green hydrogen but this would require up to 3.4 times more wind and solar capacity than at present.

Clearly the Chancellor has not taken the trouble to read the report from the Royal Society which concludes that this course of action could be up to 69 per cent more carbon intensive than using standard kerosene jet fuel and could result in 'unacceptable collateral ecological damage'.

Airline operators may be keen to be seen as environmentally responsible but in reality they and the Chancellor are hiding behind another green smokescreen that fails to stand up to robust scrutiny.","https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjk3NTU3OTk0LTY0ZGMtNGMyYS04ZDlhLTMyZTNjNGJhYTIxNDoyYWQxYzhlNS05N2E3LTRlYTQtYjJmMi02NTZjNmQ1ZDM3YzI=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-04-15 07:56:08.001852

Safety: Zero Tolerance for Rogue Shippers

Safety is the top priority for air transport and in the case of air cargo, the specific focus is on the safe transport of lithium batteries. IATA calls on government to step up efforts to stop rogue shippers and support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention - the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

“Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that come increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement,” said Sullivan.

Security: The Need for Coordinated, Risk-Based Measures

IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments. While some states implemented new measures, the lack of alignment led to inconsistent outcomes. This situation reinforces the importance of harmonized responses based on global standards.

“Recent security incidents highlight the need for better coordination among governments. Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures. Global standards and cooperation are essential,” said Sullivan.

IATA also renewed its call to states to fulfill their Annex 17 obligations by sharing timely and accurate threat intelligence to enable informed risk assessments and operational decisions.

“The industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. But governments have infinitely more resources, particularly in intelligence gathering. The best results come when governments and industry work together,” said Sullivan.

Digitalization: Accelerating Industry-Wide Adoption of ONE Record

IATA reinforced the central role of ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance, and transparency. The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data. To accelerate industry adoption IATA urged:

Airlines and forwarders to move forward with implementation

Governments to recognize ONE Record in regulatory data filing requirements

Developers to build secure, open, and compatible digital platforms

“ONE Record is a foundational shift in how we share, manage, and trust data across the supply chain. Airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned. To achieve full value, implementation must accelerate across all stakeholders, and governments must recognize ONE Record in their regulatory frameworks,” said Sullivan.

Sustainability: Commitment Strong, SAF Support Needed

The air cargo industry continues to embed sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics. For example, IATA guidance to eliminate single-use plastics across the cargo supply chain is now reflected in operational standards.

Progress is also being made on the sector’s largest environmental challenge - reducing carbon emissions. Momentum around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is growing, with new agreements across the value chain and more companies committing to SAF use.

The SAF Registry, recently launched and operated by CADO, is designed to enable a global market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and accelerate the industry's transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition, IATA will soon launch CO2 Connect for Cargo to support accurate emissions calculation and reporting, including SAF usage.

However, SAF volumes remain far below what is needed, and production costs remain high. IATA urged governments to implement policy frameworks to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.

“We are committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the ramp-up of SAF - our strongest lever - has been disappointing. The major fuel producers have been slow-walking - or sidelining - planned investments in SAF,"" said Sullivan.

""Aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2 saving products such as hydrogen-powered aircraft. And governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded.

""Instead, they send mixed signals by subsidizing fossil fuel extraction while aiming for net zero. Airlines are committed and determined but we cannot do it alone. We need action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers,” said Sullivan.

Earlier this year, Brazil’s national energy council decided to pause a planned increase in the blend due to concerns that it could drive up food prices. With inflation already a key issue, the government feared the change could affect public perception and further dent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s declining approval ratings. Inflation stood at 5.48% for the 12 months through March, well above the central bank’s 3% target.

Now, the situation has shifted. “With vegetable oil prices falling again, the conditions are right for the government to move forward with the blend increase,” Amaral said during an event in São Paulo. He pointed to improved global supply and demand for vegetable oils as a key factor behind the price drop.

“The industry has the capacity, we’re increasing crushing operations, everything is ready,” he said. “It’s now up to the government, and we hope the decision comes soon.”

The Ministry of Mines and Energy did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), using 100% SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 90% over its lifecycle compared to conventional fuel.
The original goal was to hit a 50% reduction by 2030—but Volotea now believes it could reach that milestone as early as 2025.
However, leaders in the aviation sector, including Volotea, stress the need for supportive policies to scale up SAF use.","Sustainable aviation fuel is taking center stage in Europe’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions, and Volotea is stepping firmly into the spotlight. The European low-cost carrier has announced a new agreement with TotalEnergies to purchase up to 7.5 million liters of SAF between 2025 and 2029. This cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel will power the airline’s flights departing from French airports, marking a significant step forward in eco-friendly air travel.

Unlike traditional fossil-based jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel is produced from waste materials such as used cooking oils and animal fats. It’s already compatible with today’s aircraft engines and fueling systems, meaning no special modifications are needed. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), using 100% SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 90% over its lifecycle compared to conventional fuel. While SAF is currently blended with kerosene in practice, its potential to transform the aviation industry is massive.

Volotea’s decision to invest in SAF is part of a broader strategy to reduce its carbon footprint. The airline has been rolling out multiple initiatives over the past several years to improve sustainability and limit its environmental impact. In 2024, it achieved a 47% reduction in direct CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometer compared to 2012. The original goal was to hit a 50% reduction by 2030—but Volotea now believes it could reach that milestone as early as 2025.

This early progress reflects not just internal company goals, but the broader momentum in France and Europe toward low-carbon travel. France is actively working on developing infrastructure to produce SAF domestically. However, leaders in the aviation sector, including Volotea, stress the need for supportive policies to scale up SAF use. Incentive systems could help encourage innovation and investment in production, research, and distribution networks.

For TotalEnergies, the agreement demonstrates a growing ability to provide cleaner fuel solutions to partners committed to the energy transition. SAF is expected to play a critical role in the future of aviation, especially as pressure mounts to curb emissions without reducing flight frequency or access.

As more airlines follow Volotea’s lead, the skies over Europe could begin to look a little greener—not in color, but in carbon.",https://www.rustourismnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Volotea.webp,N,,2025-04-15 07:56:29.659783

Good morning, and welcome to the 18th World Cargo Symposium here in Dubai. A big thank you to Emirates SkyCargo and dnata for hosting us in this dynamic and vibrant city. It's always a pleasure to return to the Middle East, a region that plays a vital role in global air cargo connectivity, innovation, and resilience.

I want to start by sharing a story.

Since October 2023, attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea brought one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to a standstill. Supply chains were disrupted. Deliveries were delayed. Shockwaves were felt across global trade routes. Among the affected cargo was a shipment of vital medical supplies headed for clinics in Sudan and Yemen that were under strain from conflict and shortages.

With ocean freight stalled and the humanitarian clock ticking, relief organizations, had to act fast.

Direct Relief, one of the groups involved, made a crucial decision to shift part of the shipment from sea to air.

When the global supply chain stumbled, air cargo proved its agility—adapting, responding, and delivering.

That’s what we do. In moments of uncertainty, we bring reliability. When others stall, we keep moving. When time is critical, air cargo delivers. And we have seen that yet again as the world rushes to get relief supplied to Myanmar in the aftermath of March’s earthquake.

Of course, these are extreme circumstances. But they’re a powerful reminder of air cargo’s vital role—day in, day out—beyond the headlines of conflicts and relief efforts. On an average day, 180,000 tonnes of goods reach their destination by air. This is the lifeblood of global trade—driving growth, creating jobs, and spreading prosperity.

Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. It’s no secret—we believe trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want. And to do that it is critical that we remain focused on the fundamental expectations of our customers—that we are safe, operate with modernized processes and are driving towards sustainability.

Today, I want to speak not just about policy or performance metrics—but about the real stories behind these priorities. Stories that illustrate how safety, digitalization and sustainability are driving our business today and into the future.

Safety & Security — The Battery That Wasn’t Declared

To start, let me take you to a cargo terminal in East Asia. A routine inspection. The airwaybill listed “mobile phone accessories” which is nothing out of the ordinary. But one package caught an inspector’s attention. It contained damaged, undeclared lithium batteries. The successful intervention of the inspector stopped a serious safety risk, that was just hours away from being loaded onto an aircraft.

And that happened because of our industry’s safety culture and the supports we have put in place. The inspector had just completed IATA’s dangerous goods training. He was helped by DG AutoCheck which caught the mismatch between what was declared and what was in the box. And the airline’s station was CEIV Lithium Batteries-certified, meaning strong, consistent processes were in place.

Shipments of lithium batteries continue to surge. More and more people are using devices powered by lithium batteries, with ever increasing amounts of stored energy— in addition to phones, cameras and tablets, we are seeing bigger batteries in power tools, e-bikes, and drones. As those shipments increase in number, the number of incidents or potential incidents will rise unless we are even more vigilant. We must step-up our efforts even further…

First, by stopping rogue shippers: Too many lithium battery shipments enter the system undeclared or mis-declared. That’s unacceptable. It puts aircraft at risk. It puts lives at risk. Civil aviation authorities must take firm enforcement action against non-compliant shippers. And we need governments to actively support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18—the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

Second, we must ensure that training is rigorous, and compliance is universal. Last year over 85,000 professionals were trained through IATA’s Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) Center for Dangerous Goods. Our CEIV Lithium Batteries certification continues to expand—raising the bar across the supply chain, with 121 organizations already on board. From manufacturers and shippers to freight forwarders and airlines, every link in the chain must be competent, informed, and accountable.

Setting the Standard in Air Cargo

Let me take a moment to talk about CEIV, IATA’s Center of Excellence for Independent Validators. Now in its 10th year, CEIV is transforming how the industry handles specialized cargo by embedding compliance into everyday operations through rigorous, standardized training and assessment.

Since the launch of the first CEIV for Pharma in 2014, the program has expanded to include Live Animals, Fresh, and Lithium Batteries—each raising the bar in handling, transparency, and trust.

We’re seeing real impact:

Over 600 companies across 65 countries are CEIV Pharma-certified

More than 250,000+ trade lanes operate using CEIV standards

99% of certified companies say CEIV fosters a culture of continuous improvement

This is the future of air cargo standards—collaborative, transparent, and constantly advancing. We thank the industry for their trust, as together, we continue building the foundation of a modern safety culture.

Security: An Evolving Threat Landscape

Just as safety demands vigilance, so does security.

Civil aviation must never be used as a pawn in geopolitical disputes. Acts like forcing down aircraft or hiding incendiary devices in cargo must be condemned—clearly and without exception.

Following recent incidents where incendiary devices were concealed in packages and ignited, some States imposed new security measures. But without coordination, responses were inconsistent. Some were ineffective. Others were later reversed. It was far from the joined-up risk-based approach based on global standards that was needed.

IATA developed guidance to help airlines and supply chain partners manage the incendiary device threat—guidance that was endorsed across the industry. And we continue to collaborate closely with ICAO and its member states, the TSA, the European Commission and other civil aviation authorities in support of coordinated, proportionate, and effective policy responses. We urge states to live up to their Annex 17 obligations, to share baseline factual threat information so that airlines can assess risks and respond effectively.

Whether it is safety or security, the industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. And the best results come when governments and industry work together—collaboratively and transparently—to create and implement the global standards that have guided our industry for over a century.

Digitalization

Let’s shift gears to digitalization and another story that you will all be familiar with. A fire at an electrical substation closed a major airport hub in Northern Europe..... no prizes for guessing which one. A flight carrying a time-critical pharmaceutical shipment, destined for a cancer clinic in the country, was unable to land. Every hour counted.

Thanks to integrated digital systems, the shipment was instantly rerouted. Customs documentation was adjusted in real time. Tracking updates from a verified data logger verified through the IATA Air Cargo Device Assessment Program reassured both the shipper and the consignee that the shipment was still in good condition. And most importantly—the patient received their treatment on time.

That’s the power of digitalization in the future. If safety is our foundation, digitalization is our accelerator. It makes us faster, more transparent, and more resilient.

But digitalization is not just about speed. It is also about helping navigate an increasingly fragmented regulatory environment. Airlines are expected to comply with advance data requirements in the jurisdictions they operate to. These requirements are growing in number and complexity, increasing risks of inconsistent implementation or compliance. And when things go wrong, airlines can face penalties as high as USD 100,000 per violation. Not the governments that created system complexity. And not the supply chain partner who submitted erroneous data to the airline.

This fragmented data environment is especially challenging for e-commerce shipments, where multiple house waybill filings can conflict with the airline’s master air waybill.

This is where ONE Record comes in.

ONE Record enables seamless, end-to-end data exchange across the entire supply chain. It cuts out duplication, closes data blind spots, and strengthens compliance with regulatory requirements.

The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data.

And we’re well on the way. Airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned.

Open-source tools like NE:ONE, supported by a German government backed consortium, are making it easier for smaller players to adopt this standard. The goal is a single source of truth for every shipment—reducing ambiguity, error, and the risk of sanctions.

But implementation must accelerate. We urge:

Airlines and forwarders to act now and implement ONE Record

Governments to accept ONE Record in their regulatory data filing requirements

Developers to build compatible, secure, and open platforms

At the same time, digitalization isn’t one-size-fits-all. As air cargo advances on its digital journey, our standards must evolve with it. LAR Verify—our new web-based portal for live animal transport—is a prime example. It provides instant access to destination-specific regulations, helping improve compliance, enhance animal welfare, and reduce risk. It’s a clear model for how targeted digital tools can meet the specific needs of specialized cargo while supporting the broader vision of a fully digital, connected supply chain.

Beyond Documents: Toward Real-Time Visibility

Digitalization is not just about replacing paper with pixels. It’s also about culture. Our Digitalization Leadership Charter combined with the Digital Cargo Alliance brings together close to 40 signatories around shared principles: interoperability, data security, sustainability, and innovation.

And across IATA, we are exploring the potential of AI, insourcing digital talent, launching proof-of-concepts, and prioritizing cybersecurity.

Why does this matter? Because digitalization enables us to anticipate disruption—not just react to it. It empowers us to serve customers better, comply with regulators more easily, and reduce friction in global trade.

It is, in short, how we future-proof our industry.

Sustainability

The third pillar is sustainability.

Let me tell you one final story- a bit closer to home - illustrating our commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

A Hokkaido scallop that was harvested in Japan yesterday morning will be eaten in Nobu, a Japanese restaurant in Dubai. This journey is remarkable—not just for its speed, but for the steps taken to reduce its environmental footprint. More than that, it represents a global supply chain that connects producers—whether from mature or emerging markets—to international customers, supporting livelihoods and driving economic growth around the world.

This scallop, together with other fresh produce from Japan, was flown on an Emirates aircraft partly powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) produced in Singapore, recorded through the just-launched SAF Registry that enables SAF book & claim.

The shipment followed IATA’s CEIV Fresh standards—ensuring temperature-controlled handling that reduced waste and spoilage. It travelled in reusable and recyclable packaging and was handled by dnata ground crews using efficient, low-emissions enhanced GSEs.

For the shipper, this wasn’t just seafood—it was a promise to deliver quality produce with minimal cost to the environment.

And this goal is shared across the air cargo industry.

The air cargo industry is embracing sustainability principles, in-flight and on the ground. Waste reduction and the implementation of circularity strategies have become part of the standard way in which we conduct our operations.

Airlines and handlers are focusing on alternatives to plastic, focusing on reduction, reuse and recycling. As an example, Atlas Air, now reuses shredded cardboard as packaging material, significantly reducing plastic waste.

IATA has issued guidance to eliminate single-use plastics across aviation and the cargo supply chain and included these principles into handling standards.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

We're also taking action to address our biggest environmental cost: carbon emissions. Momentum around Sustainable Aviation Fuel is growing fast, with players across the value chain stepping up.

DHL and IAG Cargo renewed their SAF agreement—60 million liters, avoiding 165,000 tonnes of CO2.

Kintetsu World Express and IAG signed for 640,000 liters.

Korean Air and CEVA Logistics expanded their SAF partnership.

Lufthansa Cargo and Maersk committed to 400 tonnes by year-end.

At least seven shipper-forwarder SAF deals were signed in the past year—including Formula 1’s investment deals with Qatar Airways and DHL.

And soon, IATA’s CO2 Connect for Cargo will help calculate shipment emissions more accurately—factoring in SAF, aligned with our reporting methodology.

Without belittling these efforts, they are, frankly, nowhere near the volumes that we need to be speaking about.

We don’t have enough SAF. And the cost of what is available needs to come down.

We remain committed to our 2050 goal. But the ramp-up to that has been disappointing to say the least. Governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded.

In fact, they continue to send completely mixed signals by subsidizing fossil fuel extraction. And the major fuel producers have been slow-walking—or sidelining—planned investments in SAF. Additionally, aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2 saving products such as hydrogen powered aircraft.

Airlines are committed and determined. But this is not our show alone. We need much more action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers.

Conclusion — Our Story Is Still Being Written

So here we are. In a world that is anything but predictable, air cargo continues to deliver. Each and every day we deliver so reliably that much of what we do to power the global economy and drive prosperity is taken for granted. And through every shock, that value is illuminated for all to see.

From a faulty lithium battery intercepted, to a cancer medicine rerouted, to a scallop carefully delivered—these are not just anecdotes. They are proof that we make good on our aspirations even whether we are in the spotlight or not.

Let us continue to tell these stories. Let us continue to write this next chapter—together.

How does RSG balance high-end, world-class hospitality with environmental responsibility, and do you think this balance is shaping the future of global tourism?","Red Sea Global group CEO John Pagano talks to Economy Middle East about the company’s efforts at balancing luxury and sustainability while keeping in mind Saudi culture and heritage.

In partnership with daa International and Arabian Petroleum Supply, RSG recently introduced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the Red Sea International Airport, marking a first for Saudi Arabia. How do you see this initiative shaping the future of sustainable travel in the country?

This year we announced a deal to bring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to the Kingdom for the first time. Our SAF supply is blended at 35 percent SAF and 65 percent standard Jet A1, which reduces the produced carbon emissions resulting directly from each aircraft that uses this fuel by up to 35 percent.

Airlines operating at RSI now have the option of refueling using SAF. RSG’s subsidiary air operator, Fly Red Sea, which provides seaplane transfer, charter and scenic tour services across our destinations, will refuel its fleet exclusively with fuels that ensure aviation is more sustainable such as SAF.

By bringing SAF into the kingdom, we are dramatically reducing our guests’ personal carbon footprint from the moment they arrive to after they leave. Beyond this, we’re supporting the wider aviation sector to start making choices that are better for the environment.

With Saudi Arabia positioning itself as a global tourism leader under Vision 2030, how does Red Sea Global contribute to this vision, and what developments can tourists expect this 2025?

RSG has established itself as a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s economic diversification under Vision 2030. Our flagship destinations are already making significant contributions to the kingdom’s tourism sector by creating employment opportunities, attracting global travelers, and fostering partnerships with local businesses.

As RSG expands its portfolio, we continue to solidify our position as a catalyst for transformative economic development and a global benchmark for regenerative tourism. This year is set to be a defining chapter for RSG, with our 25 in 25 plan — that is 25 world-class resorts across our flagship destinations by the end of 2025. At the forefront of this expansion is the opening of Shura Island at The Red Sea, featuring 11 exceptional resorts, each offering unique luxury experiences, designed to harmonize with the region’s breathtaking natural landscapes. Meanwhile, AMAALA will debut its first collection of resorts at Triple Bay, with eight groundbreaking properties that redefine wellness, luxury, and innovation.

These additions join the five resorts already operational at The Red Sea and the ultra-exclusive Thuwal Private Retreat, completing the journey to 25 extraordinary destinations. This milestone not only represents the ambitious physical expansion of RSG’s destinations but also reinforces its commitment to creating diverse, sustainable, and interconnected developments that set a new global standard in luxury and regenerative tourism.

Added to this, we recently revealed the first properties in our residential proposition, including Four Seasons Private Residences, Ennismore’s SLS Residences, and soon, Shura Marina Residences. With more residential communities to be revealed throughout this year, we are offering a rare opportunity to own part of our luxury destinations along the Red Sea coast.

As Red Sea Global continues to grow, what strategies are in place to attract international visitors? Are there specific regions or traveler demographics you’re targeting, and how do you plan to position the Red Sea as a must-visit destination on the global tourism map?

In the early days, marketing The Red Sea and AMAALA was about introducing the world to a region that had never been explored for tourism at any scale. But now, as visitors begin to arrive, the focus shifts from vision to real-life experience.

We’re leaning into the Saudi tradition of Hafawah – genuine, caring hospitality from the heart – because what stays with people isn’t just the landscapes – it’s the individuals they meet, the stories they hear – and it’s this that they will share with their friends and family back home.

For The Red Sea, these stories are already unfolding. Award-winning underwater photographer Tobias Friedrich has captured never-before-seen images of the region’s marine biodiversity, showcasing its thriving coral reefs and wildlife. Travel journalists have started to explore uninhabited islands, ancient volcanic landscapes, and waters that had remained closed to the world for centuries. Red Sea Fashion Week was another milestone — an event where designers drew inspiration from the destination itself, with many more exciting moments still to come.

The key to promoting destinations like Shebara is ensuring each location’s unique identity is brought to life. The resort’s distinctive stainless-steel overwater villas, set against a backdrop of pristine natural beauty are already iconic, grabbing international attention and becoming emblematic of our commitment to harmonizing sustainability with luxury.

Desert Rock is equally alluring, carved into the mountainside so that guests can be truly at one with nature. Six Senses Southern Dunes, The Red Sea, which blends seamlessly with the desertscape. And of course, The St. Regis Red Sea Resort and Nujuma, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, which are both creating waves on social media due to their distinctive designs and especially the overwater villas, showing the world the turquoise waters of Saudi’s Red Sea coast.

Luxury and sustainability are sometimes seen as opposing forces. How does RSG balance high-end, world-class hospitality with environmental responsibility, and do you think this balance is shaping the future of global tourism?

For us, luxury and sustainability go hand in hand. Today’s luxury traveler wants to be as close to nature as they can be, a trend called barefoot luxury. At the same time, they want to know that when they travel, they are doing no harm. As highlighted in Booking.com’s 2024 Sustainable Travel Report, 83 percent of travelers say that sustainable travel is important.

We are celebrating this redefinition of luxury tourism and have placed sustainability at the core of our developments. From integrating LEED-certified infrastructure, targeting WELL certification for our offices and residences, and using renewable energy systems to employing design principles that minimize environmental impact, we ensure our destinations seamlessly harmonize with their natural surroundings. Conservation-led initiatives, such as the restoration of mangroves, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs, go beyond sustainability to have a regenerative impact.

Added to this, visitor numbers are carefully managed to align with the ecological carrying capacity of each destination, ensuring that exclusive guest experiences coexist with the preservation and enhancement of the environment. This deliberate approach not only reduces environmental impact but deepens guests’ connection to the region’s stunning natural landscapes and rich cultural heritage.

By striking this delicate balance, RSG demonstrates that luxury and sustainability are not only compatible but can thrive together. This pioneering model sets new benchmarks for global tourism, offering a harmonious blend of opulence and environmental stewardship that redefines what it means to travel responsibly.",https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/John-Pagano-Group-CEO-at-Red-Sea-Global.webp,N,,2025-04-15 06:57:00.813365

IMO GHG pricing not yet Paris deal-aligned: EU

Brussels, 14 April (Argus) — The International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism ""does not yet ensure the sector's full contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals"", the European Commission has said. ""Does it have everything for everybody? For sure, it doesn't,"" said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the commission's climate and energy spokesperson said. ""This is often the case as an outcome from international negotiations, that not everybody gets the most optimal outcome."" The IMO agreement reached last week will need to be confirmed by the organisation in October, the EU noted, even if it is a ""strong foundation"" and ""meaningful step"" towards net zero GHG emissions in global shipping by 2050. The commission will have 18 months following the IMO mechanism's formal approval to review the directive governing the bloc's emissions trading system (ETS), which currently includes maritime emissions for intra-EU voyages and those entering or leaving the bloc. By EU law, the commission will also have to report on possible ""articulation or alignment"" of the bloc's FuelEU Maritime regulation with the IMO, including the need to ""avoid duplicating regulation of GHG emissions from maritime transport"" at EU and international levels. That report should be presented, ""without delay"", following formal adoption of an IMO global GHG fuel standard or global GHG intensity limit. Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, told Argus that the EU's consideration of whether the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough won't be until ""well after October"". Commenting on the IMO agreement, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) pointed to the ""neutral"" approach to feedstocks, including first generation biofuels. ""The EBB welcomes this agreement, where all feedstocks and pathways have a role to play,"" EBB secretary general Xavier Noyon said. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at non-governmental organisation Transport and Environment, called for better incentives for green hydrogen. ""The IMO deal creates a momentum for alternative marine fuels. But unfortunately it is the forest-destroying first generation biofuels that will get the biggest push for the next decade,"" he said.

German Green party warns on climate policy for heating

Berlin, 14 April (Argus) — Germany's soon-to-be opposition Green party today warned against the prospective new government's plans for the heating sector, which the Greens say will lead to Germany incurring high fines under the EU's effort-sharing regulation (ESR), particularly as the coalition also seeks to ""deliberately delay"" the EU's buildings directive. The expected new government coalition parties CDU/CSU and SPD pledged in their coalition treaty more openness and the use of ""scope for implementation"" to achieve energy efficiency, while emphasising their commitment to reaching climate neutrality by 2045. The coalition also agreed to end the outgoing government's building energy act, with its focus on mandatory renewable energies shares, and instead focus on ""achievable CO2 avoidance"" as a key performance indicator in the heating sector. In ""deliberately"" delaying ""urgently needed"" action, Germany could incur high EU fines while still making heating more expensive for users, the Greens warned, as people are driven into ""fossil fuel dependencies"" and ""cost traps"". And the lax implementation of the EU's energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD) threatens to delay refurbishment and energy efficiency, the party said. German energy efficiency association Deneff similarly warned against a delayed implementation of the EPBD and the ""vague"" role accorded to the carbon price in the building sector. But Deneff commended the coalition's backing of existing energy efficiency support programmes, despite the envisaged end to the buildings energy act. The act was the brainchild of the Green-led outgoing economy ministry, fiercely criticised by the then-opposition CDU/CSU and only half-heartedly supported by outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD party. A recent study found that prices under the upcoming EU emissions trading system covering buildings and road transport (EU ETS 2) could turn out much higher than anticipated by the European Commission. Cologne University-based research institute EWI in a recent paper warned that carbon prices under the ETS 2 could climb from about €120/t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in 2027 to more than €200/t CO2e by 2035, significantly higher than the current price of €55/t CO2e under Germany's domestic carbon pricing scheme for the sectors. This is because of the sectors' high short-term marginal abatement costs, with necessary investments such as heat pumps and building renovations being cost-intensive and progressing slowly. The Greens on 11 April slammed the coalition treaty for advocating the use of ""dubious foreign emissions reductions "", its ""excessive"" focus on carbon capture and storage technology and touting an ""overcapacity"" of new gas-fired plants that could lead to a ""fossil lock-in"". The lower house of parliament the Bundestag on 6 May will elect CDU leader Friedrich Merz as Germany's chancellor, assuming the CDU and SPD parties give the coalition the green light as the CSU did last week.

Participants mostly support IMO GHG pricing mechanism

London, 11 April (Argus) — International shipping organisations and market participants mostly support the global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism approved today at the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 83rd Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting, but some raised concerns. The structure approved by the IMO establishes that ships must reduce their fuel intensity by a ""base target"" of 4pc in 2028 against 93.3 gCO2e/MJ, the latter representing the average GHG fuel intensity value of international shipping in 2008. Emissions above this target will be charged at $380/tCO2e. The levels defined by the approved regulation are achievable, according to a market participant, who said the gradually increasing targets may allow the market to properly adapt to the transition. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) secretary general Guy Platten said the sector is already investing billions of dollars in 'green' technology, so the agreement gives certainty that sustainable marine fuels producers need. ""The world's governments have now come forward with a comprehensive agreement which, although not perfect in every respect, we very much hope will be formally adopted later this year,"" he said. The European Shipowners (ECSA) secretary general Sotiris Raptis agreed the draft ""is not perfect"", but he celebrated progress towards a net zero emissions target, saying ""it is a good starting point for further work"" and pointing out that it may ensure the necessary investment in production of clean fuels. During a press briefing, IMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez said ships operating in international waters will be obliged to comply with the regulations after adoption, despite the US' refusal to engage with the discussions . Adoption of the pricing mechanism will be discussed and voted on in October. Offering a counterview, the Global Maritime Forum said the agreed measures may not be strong enough to reach IMO targets. ""The GHG intensity targets create uncertainty as to whether the strategy's emissions reduction checkpoints for 2030 and 2040 will be met,"" it said. ""As currently designed, measures are unlikely to be sufficient to incentivise the rapid development of e-fuels such as e-ammonia or e-methanol , which will be needed in the long run due to their scalability and emission reduction potential."" It said that failure to invest in these fuels would put at risk the target of at least 5pc zero- and near-zero emission fuel use by 2030 and the industry's entire 2050 net-zero goal. The World Shipping Council's vice president Bryan Wood-Thomas praised the agreement and said one benefit of it is the pricing system that is ""more aggressive"" if a vessel fails to meet the GHG intensity standard. ""But you also have a fee system that gives investors more confidence in actual revenue [from using cleaner fuels],"" he said. The Brazilian representative told Argus the fact that some countries thought the agreement was too ambitious while others indicated it was not ambitious enough show the group may have reached a balance that can be possible to comply. About the Brazilian position, the representative said the country ""was never against an agreement"". ""We were only against some aspects of the agreement, and we think that the membership has heard our concerns, and that's why we ended up pretty happy with the results"", he said. Brazil voted in favour of the agreement today. By Hussein Al-Khalisy, Madeleine Jenkins, Natália Coelho, and Gabriel Tassi Lara.

Q&A: IMO GHG scheme in EU ETS could be 'challenging'

London, 11 April (Argus) — Delegates have approved the global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism proposal at the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 83rd Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting. Argus Media spoke to ministerial adviser and Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, on the sidelines of the London MEPC meeting. What is your initial reaction to the text? We are happy and satisfied about the content of the agreed text, so far. But we need to be careful. This week, all member states were able to vote. But in October, when adaption will take place, only those states which are parties to Marpol Annex VI will be able to vote if indeed a vote is called for, and that changes the situation a little bit. Here when we were voting, a minority was enough — 40 votes. But if or when we vote in October, then we need two thirds of those party to Marpol Annex VI to be in favour of the text. Will enthusiasm for the decision today remain by October? I'm pretty sure it will. But you never know what will happen between now and and the next six months. What is the effect of the decision on FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS? Both FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS have a review clause. This review clause states that if we are ambitious enough at the IMO, then the EU can review or amend the regulation. So of course, it is very important that we first consider if the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough to meet EU standards. Only after that evaluation, which won't be until well after October, can we consider these possible changes. Do you think the EU will be able to adopt these the text as it stands today? My personal view is that we can perhaps incorporate this text under FuelEU Maritime, but it may be more challenging for the EU ETS, where shipping is now included. What was the impact of US President Donald Trump's letter on the proceedings? EU states were not impacted, but it's difficult to say what the impact was on other states.

“The stopover by the Chinook at East Sale is an important milestone for the use of SAF across Defence, and Army Aviation looks forward to greater availability of synthetic aviation turbine fuels.”","An Army CH-47F Chinook refuelled with about 3000lbs of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at RAAF Base East Sale in southern Victoria last month.

In a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group, Army is making regular use of the recently certified fuel.

SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable sources. Its use is primarily driven by the need for security of fuel supplies through lower reliance on conventional fuels.

The refuelling at RAAF Base East Sale demonstrated the ADF’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.

Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a SAF blend.

HQ Aviation Command’s Director of Aviation Capability Management, Colonel Brenton Mellor, said Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.

“Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence.

What are contrails and other non-CO2 emissions, and why do they matter?
In certain conditions, water vapour and some non-CO2 emissions such as soot or other particulate matters combine to form condensation trails.
There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO2 emissions.","Scientists and aviation leaders including Airbus are studying how to reduce aircraft non-CO2 emissions. Options include operational contrail avoidance, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and in the longer term, hydrogen propulsion. What are the most promising projects?

Non-CO2 warming effects could be as significant as CO2 in aviation’s total climate impact. However, non-CO2 emissions aren’t yet regulated in the same way. Scientists and industry leaders including Airbus are studying ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO2 emissions.

Discussions are heating up over whether and how to regulate non-CO2 emissions. It is a major aviation policy debate that affects airlines, governments and climate targets, as well as air traffic management due to scheduling and capacity constraints.

What are contrails and other non-CO2 emissions, and why do they matter?

Burning jet fuel always creates both carbon dioxide (CO2) and non-CO2 emissions. In certain conditions, water vapour and some non-CO2 emissions such as soot or other particulate matters combine to form condensation trails. Commonly known as contrails, these are the white streaks visible behind aircraft at altitude.

On average, contrails heat the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. However, some contrails can have a cooling effect, depending on when and where they form and how long they last. It’s thought that a relatively small number of flights create the majority of warming contrails.

The overall climate impact of non-CO2 emissions is complex and hard to measure. Scientists are still working to fully understand their long-term effects.

What is the aviation industry doing about contrails and other non-CO2 emissions?

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO2 emissions. They are using different fuel types (SAF, hydrogen), propulsion technologies and operational mitigation. The latter involves modifying flight paths in real time to avoid areas where warming contrails are most likely to form.

Airbus is working with scientists, policymakers and the wider aviation industry on some 20 projects linked to these mitigation concepts. Some are funded externally while others are funded internally or with specific partners willing to share the cost of the project with Airbus.

The projects fall into three broad categories:

Studying contrails and testing fuel alternatives, including sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen. Projects include PACIFIC and CRYSTAL, which were announced at the Airbus Summit 2025. Both continue Airbus’ research into fuel compositions using A350 and A220 aircraft.

Operational avoidance: Exploring optimisation of flight paths to minimise persistent contrails. Live projects include CICONIA, which focuses on forecasting contrail-prone weather, climate impact modelling, and on defining the best concept of operations. CICONIA's early results indicate that, assuming appropriate procedures are put in place, operational mitigation could be applied to many flights, thus effectively reducing their contrails impact, and without significant air traffic disturbance.

New technologies: Investing in hydrogen-powered flight and innovative propulsion systems. Live projects include Blue Condor, whose flight test results are due in late 2025. Blue Condor is a joint project between Airbus and the German Aerospace Centre DLR. Of the seven test flights, four resulted in the formation of contrails from the hydrogen engine. The aim of the investigations was to compare their microphysical properties with those of conventional contrails.

Promising technologies including humidity sensors could help aircraft to avoid weather conditions favourable to contrail formation. Humidity sensors feed weather forecasting models, so flights can benefit from improved forecasts of conditions favourable to contrail formation. Yet like climate impact models, they are in their infancy.

Nonetheless, the projects and collaborations led by Airbus and its partners are helping to accelerate the development of mitigation strategies for non-CO2 emissions and subsequent integration into flight operations.",https://www.asdnews.com/NewsImages/b/88979/95880_O.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 06:57:44.658281

Q&A: IMO GHG scheme in EU ETS could be 'challenging'

London, 11 April (Argus) — Delegates have approved the global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism proposal at the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 83rd Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting. Argus Media spoke to ministerial adviser and Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, on the sidelines of the London MEPC meeting. What is your initial reaction to the text? We are happy and satisfied about the content of the agreed text, so far. But we need to be careful. This week, all member states were able to vote. But in October, when adaption will take place, only those states which are parties to Marpol Annex VI will be able to vote if indeed a vote is called for, and that changes the situation a little bit. Here when we were voting, a minority was enough — 40 votes. But if or when we vote in October, then we need two thirds of those party to Marpol Annex VI to be in favour of the text. Will enthusiasm for the decision today remain by October? I'm pretty sure it will. But you never know what will happen between now and and the next six months. What is the effect of the decision on FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS? Both FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS have a review clause. This review clause states that if we are ambitious enough at the IMO, then the EU can review or amend the regulation. So of course, it is very important that we first consider if the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough to meet EU standards. Only after that evaluation, which won't be until well after October, can we consider these possible changes. Do you think the EU will be able to adopt these the text as it stands today? My personal view is that we can perhaps incorporate this text under FuelEU Maritime, but it may be more challenging for the EU ETS, where shipping is now included. What was the impact of US President Donald Trump's letter on the proceedings? EU states were not impacted, but it's difficult to say what the impact was on other states.

Q&A: Australia’s Corporate Carbon expands ACCU trading

Sydney, 11 April (Argus) — Australian carbon project developer Corporate Carbon has been expanding its trading capabilities around Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) on the back of growing supply and wider market maturity. Head of carbon trading Angus Robertson spoke with Argus about the latest developments in the market. Corporate Carbon is one of the biggest suppliers of ACCUs. Is it correct that the company has been issued around 15mn ACCUs, counting both fully-owned projects and partnerships, which would be around 10pc of all ACCU issuances since the scheme started in 2011? Yes, that's the approximate number. We've got around 100 projects. In terms of issuance from a mix of owned projects and offtake agreements with other developers and partners in the industry, the approximate forecast is around 3mn ACCUs/yr. We trade around that and then also have capacity to trade outside of our own projects and within the portfolio, plus operating as a trading entity in the secondary market. The company has been one of the main suppliers to private buyers, and to the federal government through carbon abatement contracts (CACs). But you are also buyers. How does that work? The increased capability of our business to both buy and sell is a reflection of the broader Australian carbon market maturing over the last few years. The beginning of the business was very much built off the back of those CACs. As that policy changed over time, allowing for the partial exiting of those CACs , obviously there's been a lot more focus on the secondary market now. We've seen a lot of trading houses, banks and other financial institutions coming into the market, and with that you get a more mature financial market. So in response to that, we've been building out our trading capacity as well as our broader commercial team over the past few years. We take a portfolio approach and we have a large inventory flow to assist with that growing demand, but there are times when we go out to the secondary market and source units on behalf of clients. You recently partnered with trading and risk management firm Ion Commodities to implement their Carbon Zero tool. How does that translate into your trading capabilities? We see Ion's solution as a really effective trading tool and portfolio management system. It reflects our readiness to operate at a larger scale. By providing those tools, it allows us to focus on the strategic goals of the business, especially from a commercial perspective. It is very much a tool for reporting purposes and the automation capabilities of the system assist with that, but it does have a bit of a flow-on effect in terms of efficiency across the business as well. Going to the market, in the short term, it seems to be all about the upcoming federal elections. Do you expect to see much price volatility within the next few weeks? Yes. As we approach the Australian federal election, we would expect there to be a degree of uncertainty, considering the difference in the two major party outcomes in terms of their take on the carbon market. We would see it as positive in either instance, but I think there is still a degree of uncertainty that should lead to perhaps a degree of illiquidity in the market. The market has been also weighed down by a strong issuance of safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs). Were you surprised with that high volume when it was first disclosed by the Climate Change Authority late last year? I think it was the general market consensus that the number was higher than initially forecast, and [ACCU] market prices definitely reflected that in the following weeks and months after those numbers were disclosed. Once the final numbers were released, I think the market had generally already priced that in by that point. Has that changed your internal outlook for when the ACCU market might see an expected shift from oversupply to undersupply? I wouldn't say our internal view has changed all that much. If the majority of that volume is now weighted towards the early years of the safeguard mechanism, policies might reflect that going forward. Now we would probably see ACCU supply as a potential restriction on the market in the short to medium term. Obviously, there's speculation around certain methods in the ACCU market, where higher forecasts were expected over the following next few years and that's now no longer the case. So probably more around supply than demand in terms of our shifted internal views, and this is more from a trading and market perspective as opposed to our actual projects being affected. So it's more on the supply side than demand, even with the high SMC issuances? Well, obviously the market has reacted to those media releases by the regulator around SMCs. So you know that's already happened — you can't really argue that now. Will there be further policy changes around the safeguard mechanism to account for that? That's a bit of an unknown, but it's definitely potential in the following years. And when you talk about supply constraints, is it mostly the delays with the development of the integrated farm and land management methodology , and potentially lower issuances from a reformed landfill gas method? Those are good examples of general delays in certain methods and the creation of new methods. So yes, our expectation is that this could be a big driver on ACCU prices in the next few years.

New tariffs could upend US tallow imports: Correction

Corrects description of options for avoiding feedstock tariffs in 12th paragraph. Story originally published 3 April. New York, 10 April (Argus) — New US tariffs on nearly all foreign products could deter further imports of beef tallow, a fast-rising biofuel feedstock and food ingredient that had until now largely evaded President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape global trade. Tallow was the most used feedstock for US biomass-based diesel production in January for the first month ever, with consumption by pound rising month to month despite sharp declines in actual biorefining and in use of competing feedstocks. The beef byproduct benefits from US policies, including a new federal tax credit known as ""45Z"", that offer greater subsidies to fuel derived from waste than fuel derived from first-generation crops. Much of that tallow is sourced domestically, but the US also imported more than 880,000t of tallow last year, up 29pc from just two years earlier. The majority of those imports last year came from Brazil, which until now has faced a small 0.43¢/kg (19.5¢/lb) tariff, and from Australia, which was exempt from any tallow-specific tariffs under a free trade agreement with US. But starting on 5 April, both countries will be subject to at least the new 10pc charge on foreign imports. There are some carveouts from tariffs for certain energy products, but animal fats are not included. Some other major suppliers — like Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand — will soon have new tariffs in place too, although tallow from Canada is for now unaffected because it is covered by the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. Brazil tallow shipments to the US totaled around 300,000t in 2024, marking an all-time high, but tallow shipments during the fourth quarter of 2024 fell under the 2023 levels as uncertainty about future tax policy slowed buying interest. Feedstock demand in general in the US has remained muted to start this year because of poor biofuel production margins, and that has extended to global tallow flows. Tallow suppliers in Brazil for instance were already experiencing decreased interest from US producers before tariffs. Brazil tallow prices for export last closed at $1,080/t on 28 March, rising about 4pc year-to-date amid support from the 45Z guidance and aid from Brazil's growing biodiesel industry, which is paying a hefty premium for tallow compared to exports. While the large majority of Brazilian tallow exports end up in the US, Australian suppliers have more flexibility and could send more volume to Singapore instead if tariffs deter US buyers. Export prices out of Australia peaked this year at $1,185/t on 4 March but have since trended lower to last close at $1,050/t on 1 April. In general, market participants say international tallow suppliers would have to drop offers to keep trade flows intact. Other policy shifts affect flows Even as US farm groups clamored for more muscular foreign feedstock limits over much of the last year, tallow had until now largely dodged any significant restrictions. Recent US guidance around 45Z treats all tallow, whether produced in the US or shipped long distances to reach the US, the same. Other foreign feedstocks were treated more harshly, with the same guidance providing no pathway at all for road fuels from foreign used cooking oil and also pinning the carbon intensity of canola oil — largely from Canada — as generally too high to claim any subsidy. But tariffs on major suppliers of tallow to the US, and the threat of additional charges if countries retaliate, could give refiners pause. Demand could rise for domestic animal fats or alternatively for domestic vegetable oils that can also be refined into fuel, especially if retaliatory tariffs cut off global markets for US farm products like soybean oil. There is also risk if Republicans in the Trump administration or Congress reshape rules around 45Z to penalize foreign feedstocks. At the same time, a minimum 10pc charge for tallow outside North America is a more manageable price to pay compared to other feedstocks — including a far-greater collection of charges on Chinese used cooking oil. And if the US sets biofuel blend mandates as high as some oil and farm groups are pushing , strong demand could leave producers with little choice but to continue importing at least some feedstock from abroad to continue making fuel. Not all US renewable diesel producers will be equally impacted by tariffs either. Some tariffs are eligible for drawbacks, meaning that producers could potentially recover tariffs they paid on feedstocks for fuel that is ultimately exported. And multiple biofuel producers are located in foreign-trade zones, a US program that works similarly to the duty drawbacks, and have applied for permission to avoid some tariffs on imported feedstocks for fuel eventually shipped abroad. Jurisdictions like the EU and UK, where sustainable aviation fuel mandates took effect this year, are attractive destinations. And there is still strong demand from the US food sector, with edible tallow prices in Chicago up 18pc so far this year. Trump allies, including his top health official, have pushed tallow as an alternative to seed oils.

The plan should incorporate an all-of-the-above energy strategy, including renewables, nuclear, and natural gas, to keep energy affordable.

Balancing environmental progress with economic realities is crucial, especially given the recent 20% rate hike on utility customers.

Natural gas should remain part of the energy mix, as renewables alone cannot meet current demands, and an all-of-the-above approach supports union jobs.

The state can lead in clean energy while ensuring affordability and reliability by responsibly using natural gas and investing in technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen.

Last month, there was an updated draft of the Energy Master Plan — a blueprint that aims to make New Jersey a national leader in clean energy, cutting emissions, and building a more sustainable economy. I believe wholeheartedly in the vision of a greener future. But, as policymakers, we must also be honest: the path to that future must be grounded in practicality, affordability, and fairness.

The current plan’s shortcoming is that it’s not a true all-of-the-above energy strategy. If we want to provide every New Jersey resident with affordable energy, the grid should be technology neutral, including renewables, nuclear and a continued, responsible role for natural gas. If we want to lower energy prices, we cannot afford to take energy options off the table.

The revised Energy Master Plan sets ambitious and admirable goals. But as we decarbonize and electrify, we cannot lose sight of the reality that working families, seniors, small businesses and manufacturers across New Jersey are already struggling with some of the highest energy costs in the country. If we are serious about achieving these goals without pushing costs onto those who can least afford it, we need an energy strategy that balances environmental progress with economic reality.

These concerns aren’t hypothetical. Just this year, the Board of Public Utilities approved a nearly 20% rate hike on utility customers — an increase that has sparked strong opposition from the public, business owners and many of my colleagues in the Legislature. Working families across New Jersey are already stretched thin, and they’re rightfully questioning why their energy bills keep climbing while their paychecks don’t. Part of the reason is that our energy supply has not kept pace with growing demand and limiting fuel options only makes that worse.

While renewables like wind and solar will play a growing role in our energy portfolio — and we will continue to support those investments — they are not yet able to meet New Jersey’s full energy demands on their own. Today, about 75% of our electricity and home heating come from natural gas. That’s why natural gas must remain part of the mix. An all-of-the-above approach that includes our conventional fuels will keep the lights on, keeps prices stable, and ensures the grid remains reliable when demand spikes — whether during a cold snap, heatwave or economic expansion.

Moreover, investing in every energy solution is an investment in middle-class, union careers. The transition to clean energy should not mean the loss of family-sustaining, skilled trades jobs. In fact, it should expand economic opportunities in middle-class, union careers. Building and modernizing New Jersey’s energy infrastructure has always been done safely, locally and by trained union labor. Implementing low-carbon technologies at these facilities will create even greater need in these fields. These projects mean real careers with benefits, pensions and apprenticeship opportunities — lifting communities, especially in urban and working-class areas, while ensuring the energy system we all depend on is maintained by the safest, most qualified workforce in the country.

Some critics will argue that we can simply “leap” to a carbon-free future. But what they’re ignoring is that there are all kinds of proven opportunities to reduce emissions from traditional energy sources, whether through carbon capture, hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, biofuels, and other technologies. We should not let ideology override common sense and leave solutions off the table.

We can remain an environmental leader without sacrificing affordability, reliability or working-class livelihoods. An all-of-the-above energy policy is not a retreat from clean energy — it is an acknowledgment that building a sustainable future requires careful planning, flexible thinking and respect for the people who will actually build it.

This is not an either/or choice. We can fight climate change and ensure that union workers are part of the solution. We can reduce emissions and make sure our seniors can afford to heat their homes. We can lead the nation in wind and solar energy and use natural gas responsibly to maintain a stable, affordable energy grid and power our home appliances.

That’s the future New Jersey deserves — and that’s the future I’ll keep fighting for.

I’ve been rebalancing my portfolio lately. It’s something I do every couple of years—trim what’s run ahead, add where conviction has deepened, and adjust based on what I now believe to be real, durable value. I’m not a trader. I buy and hold for years, sometimes decades, and while my portfolio leans heavily toward the digital and electrification of everything, hence my recent battery EFT assessment, I keep an eye on the corners of the energy transition where electrons alone won’t cut it. That brings me, inevitably, to biofuels. And to be clear, this is not investment advice. I’m sharing my reasoning, not offering you a target allocation or price point. Do your own diligence, or ignore the sector entirely. That said, here’s what I found worth considering and why.

As I noted in the battery assessment, I was finally shoved out of my procrastination by Pearl Jam. Well, at least by Stone Gossard, the guitarist for the grunge band. A mutual contact connected us as the band puts a carbon price of $200 per ton on its concerts and invests the resulting pool of cash in fixing the climate. Now they realize, like a lot of other people, that doing good and making money are synonymous. We talked climate investing a couple of weeks ago, and that triggered me to finally put my own pool of cash—smaller—into action again.

Biofuels have never been the center of the energy transition, and they never will be. That role belongs to renewably-generated electricity and the batteries and grids that move it. But liquid fuels will persist—particularly in the parts of transport and industry that resist electrification. Long-haul aviation is the most obvious example. You’re not going to fly a narrow-body across the Pacific on battery power, not this decade and not the next. Likewise, in maritime shipping, even with battery-electric coastal operations gaining ground, ocean-crossing vessels will still need dense, combustible energy carriers. Hydrogen and e-fuels continue to attract headlines, but their economics and thermodynamics remain unfavorable for most use cases. Biofuels—when derived from waste biomass and deployed in sectors that truly need them—offer a more grounded, scalable solution.

Still, as an investor, this is a hard space. A lot of early biofuel bets imploded: poor margins, poor feedstock strategies, poor timing. Some leaned too heavily on food crops, drawing justified criticism and volatility when commodity prices spiked. Others burned through cash chasing futuristic pathways that were years too early. The question, for someone building a portfolio for the long haul, is not which firm has the most exciting press release. It’s who is already operating at scale, with real customers, real revenue, and a defensible moat. And among the pure-play firms with little to no fossil fuel exposure, four companies emerged as worth my time: Neste, Darling Ingredients, UPM Kymmene, and Aemetis.

Let’s start where the conversation always should—with feedstock. Biofuels don’t begin in the lab or at the pump. They begin at the fryer, the field, the forest floor. And whoever controls or integrates feedstock supply is already playing a different game than those reliant on spot markets. Neste, the Finnish leader in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), operates a global supply chain that spans three continents. It sources used cooking oil, animal fats, and other residues, pre-treats them at scale, and converts them into high-quality drop-in fuels using proprietary hydroprocessing tech. It’s the biggest producer of SAF in the world today. What it lacks in fossil scale, it more than makes up for in logistics, policy fluency, and execution.

Darling Ingredients, a less famous name, is arguably even more secure on feedstock. It collects and renders about 10% of the world’s inedible animal by-products—literally the fat and bone left after livestock are processed—and turns a significant portion into low-carbon fuels via its 50-50 joint venture with Valero, Diamond Green Diesel. That JV is now the second-largest renewable diesel producer on the planet, with capacity nearing 1.2 billion gallons per year. The synergy is textbook: Darling supplies the feedstock, Valero supplies the refining and distribution infrastructure, and the fuel flows into markets like California, where LCFS credits stack on top of federal subsidies. The cash flow from the JV shows up consistently in Darling’s books, offsetting volatility elsewhere in its animal feed and fertilizer business.

UPM Kymmene, a Finnish forest products firm, has a very different profile—more industrial conglomerate than energy company. But it’s been quietly converting tall oil, a by-product of its pulp mills, into renewable diesel at its Lappeenranta biorefinery for nearly a decade. This isn’t speculative. It’s operational, integrated, and compliant with Europe’s most stringent advanced biofuel criteria. The volume is small—about 100,000 tonnes per year—but the margins are healthy, and the feedstock is fully captive. UPM is currently deciding whether to build a new 500,000-tonne biorefinery that would include SAF, and if it does, it’ll bring the same integration logic with it: using its own forestry residue streams, located adjacent to its existing industrial clusters, to create fuels where there’s already logistics and energy available. It’s moving slowly, but with capital discipline and a clear view of the regulatory landscape.

Aemetis rounds out the list as the highest-risk, highest-potential candidate. Based in California, it operates an ethanol plant today and is building out both a renewable diesel and SAF refinery as well as a dairy manure biogas network. The assets are real, the offtake agreements are impressive—Delta, Japan Airlines, and ten others have signed multi-year SAF supply contracts—and the LCFS and federal incentive stack in California makes the revenue projections look attractive. But this is not yet a consistently profitable business. It’s a capital-intensive transition play that depends on execution. If they build their projects on time and on budget, they could become a major SAF player. If not, it could be a cautionary tale. For now, I treat it as a speculative growth position—a small piece of the portfolio with a long time horizon.

From a pure investment ranking perspective, Neste is in a league of its own. It combines scale, diversification, and policy fluency with a high-integrity ESG story and continued margin strength, even in a turbulent year. Its downside for me is that it’s still running a legacy oil and gas refinery, but like Orsted, it’s exiting the fossil fuel industry rapidly and I believe its commitment. Darling is close behind, thanks to its unparalleled feedstock integration and the reliable cash flow from Diamond Green Diesel. UPM is the low-beta, high-discipline pick—less upside, but strong integration and balance sheet. As I’m bullish on engineered mass timber and hydroelectric, that it has plywood and hydro in its assets is something I’m comfortable with. Aemetis is the call option on SAF growth—too early to tell, but too well-positioned to ignore.

All of them are well off the 2021 clean investment bubble prices, so they are value priced now. And Trump’s tariffs have depressed all stocks. I exited the last of my Tesla—bought for an average of $19 at the current split level and long before the current craze for “I bought this car before Elon went crazy” bumper stickers—after the election and have been sitting on a pot of cash since, waiting until I figured out what I was going to do with it and what the right timing is. Well, biofuels and batteries for the what, and now for the when. Somebody online was stunned that I had divested TSLA and was considering biofuels, but I think it’s the right call. And my batteries ETFs include BYD among a lot of other Chinese battery and EV firms.

This portfolio shift doesn’t replace my investments in wind, solar, or grid infrastructure EFTs, my China digital economy investments or the Apple stock I bought at some much lower price lost to the mists of history. It complements them. Biofuels aren’t going to replace electrons, and they’re not the universal answer to decarbonization. But for the segments of global energy where combustion isn’t optional, and where electrification will be slow or partial, these firms offer a viable path to sustainable energy. They’re not making hydrogen hype. They’re not pretending every flight can run on batteries. They’re grinding biomass into something useful and low-carbon, with customers who need it and policies that support it.

With the International Maritime Organization’s recent passing of hard net zero requirements for 2050 with up to $380 per ton fines for missing reduction targets, biofuels are going to be getting hotter again.

I won’t buy all five. I might not even be able to buy the three I want due to arcane rules about Canadian RSPs, although I have other cash on hand outside of that part of my portfolio, so may invest regardless. But I came away from the analysis with a clearer view of who’s likely to be producing real molecules for hard-to-abate sectors five years from now. If the world still needs liquid fuels—and it will—I want to hold shares in the companies making the cleanest, cheapest, and most scalable ones. That’s what this sector offers: not fantasy, but functional climate solutions. And in a portfolio designed for the long transition, that’s worth owning.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-14-2025-06_59_32-PM-1-800x441.png,N,,2025-04-15 06:58:16.198553

The partnership is aiming to advance decarbonisation in air travel by accelerating the production and usage of SAF, an alternative fuel that can reduce CO₂ emissions by at least 65% over its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil kerosene.

According to Stefan Gumuseli, General Manager Air France KLM; India and Middle East, collaboration is a key part of Air France-KLM’s mission to make SAF more widely available, driving meaningful change.

“Decarbonising aviation comes with its challenges, and we are pleased to see Gerry’s Group’s commitment to sustainability and their responsibility toward reducing the carbon emissions generated by air travel,” he said.

A cleaner way to fly

Although European airlines are this year expected to meet a mandate of 2% SAF use in their jet fuel, there have been concerns that the industry may struggle to meet 2030 targets, of 6%, with the cost of the fuel three to five times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is currently permitted to be blended with conventional kerosene up to 50%, without the need for changes to aircraft, engines, or fuel infrastructure.

Setting the bar higher

SAF that is sourced by Air France-KLM must meet strict sustainability criteria, ensuring it does not compete with food production or use palm oil, and that it is certified by RSB or ISCC.

The group has set a target to reduce CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometre by 30% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. To help meet this goal, it said it aims to use 10% SAF by 2030. This is well above the EU’s mandated 6% minimum for European departures.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on April 14 announced the cancellation of USDA’s Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities program. Select projects that meet certain requirements may continue under a new Advancing Markets for Producers initiative.

The USDA announced the launch of PCSC in February 2022, indicating plans to invest $1 billion partnerships to support America’s climate-smart farmers, ranchers and forest owners. The program was designed to finance pilot projects that would create market opportunities for U.S. agricultural and forestry products that use climate-smart practices and include innovative, cost-effective ways to measure and verify greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits.

Funding for the program was provided through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corp. to support pilot projects that provide incentives to producers and landowners to implement climate-smart production practices, activities and systems on working lands; measure/quantify, monitor and verify the carbon and GHG benefits associated with those practices; and develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities.

The program received strong interest from the agricultural community, with more than 450 proposals for large-scale projects submitted within the three months of the program’s announcement.

The USDA in September 2022 announced it would invest up to $2.8 billion in 70 initially selected PCSC projects. In celebration of the one-year anniversary of the program’s launch, the agency in September 2023 indicated it was investing more than $3.1 billion in 141 PCSC projects.

Several biofuel, biogas and biochar-related projects were among those selected to receive funding. Among the awardees were Gevo’s Climate-Smart Farm-to-Flight Program, which was awarded up to $30 million and aimed to track and quantify the carbon-intensity (CI) impact of climate-smart practices while creating market incentives for low CI corn to help accelerate production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and low-CI ethanol.

Global Clean Energy Holdings Inc. was also awarded up to $30 million for a climate-smart camelina pilot project, which aimed to measure and validate the advantages of Camelina sativa (camelina) as an ultra-low carbon nonfood renewable fuel feedstock.

In addition, Roeslein Renewables was awarded up to $80 million to support a five-year PCSC project in Iowa and Missouri. Under the project, Roeslein was collaborating with 14 public and private entities to create markets for corn, soybeans, and livestock producers through renewable natural gas (RNG) production.

The USDA has deleted its PCSC webpage, which included a full list of awardees and program summaries. Archived versions of the PCSC webpage, however, can still be found online.

In its April 14 announcement, USDA cited “sky-high administration fees which in many instances provided less than half of the federal funding directly to famers,” as a reason for cancelling the PCSC program.

“Select projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers,” the USDA said in its announcement. “We continue to support farmers and encourage partners to ensure their projects are farmer focused or re-apply to continue work that is aligned with the priorities of this Administration.”

According to the USDA, the PCSC program is being reformed and overhauled into the Advancing Markets for Producers initiative. The agency said it has identified changes to align with current Trump Administration priorities and “will review existing grant agreements based on three Farmer First policy priorities.” This includes a requirement that at least 65% of federal funds go to producers; a requirement that grant recipients must have enrolled at least one producer as of Dec. 31, 2024; and a requirement that grant recipients must have made a payment to at least one producer as of Dec. 31, 2024.

“The Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities initiative was largely built to advance the green new scam at the benefit of NGOs, not American farmers,” Rollins said. “The concerns of farmers took a backseat during the Biden Administration. During my short time as Secretary, I have heard directly from our farmers that many of the USDA partnerships are overburdened by red tape, have ambiguous goals, and require complex reporting that push farmers onto the sidelines. We are correcting these mistakes and redirecting our efforts to set our farmers up for an unprecedented era of prosperity.”

In its statement, USDA said it will contact current partners individually to provide information about their future participation. The agency also said it will honor all eligible expenses incurred prior to April 13, 2025.

In partnership with Australian aerospace tech company MicroTau, the U.S.-based airline is installing microscopic “shark skin” riblet technology on its Boeing 767 aircraft, marking a bold leap forward in sustainable aviation.

At the heart of this transformation is the application of nature-inspired surface modification to aircraft exteriors—a method scientifically engineered to reduce drag, optimize airflow, and lower fuel consumption. The initiative, which falls under Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab, could lead to a new era of eco-conscious commercial flight, with potential fuel efficiency gains of up to 4%.

Let’s dive into how this innovation works, why it matters for global aviation, and what it means for sustainability goals across airline fleets worldwide.

What Are Shark Skin Riblets—and How Do They Work?

Despite appearing smooth to the human eye, a shark’s skin is covered in tiny, tooth-like structures called dermal denticles. These microscopic grooves reduce water resistance and turbulence, allowing sharks to swim with remarkable efficiency.

Inspired by this biological marvel, MicroTau’s riblet technology mimics the effect by imprinting microscopic grooves onto aircraft surfaces. The result is a smoother flow of air across the fuselage and wings, significantly reducing aerodynamic drag—the force that works against an aircraft in flight.

By reducing drag, aircraft engines don’t have to work as hard, leading to lower fuel consumption and fewer CO₂ emissions—key metrics for a sustainable aviation future.

Why Delta Is Leading the Charge

Delta’s decision to implement riblet tech on its Boeing 767 fleet is a calculated step toward decarbonizing its operations. As part of its Sustainable Skies Lab initiative, the airline is actively investing in technology-driven partnerships that deliver measurable environmental benefits without compromising performance or safety.

This positions Delta not just as a user of new aviation tech—but as a pioneer in shaping what sustainable air travel looks like in the decades to come.

Global Context: Shark Skin Takes Off Around the World

Delta’s announcement comes amid a global race to innovate in aviation sustainability. In 2022, Lufthansa was the first commercial airline to test shark skin riblet technology with its “AeroSHARK” coating, applied to cargo and passenger aircraft in collaboration with Lufthansa Technik and BASF.

In January 2025, Japan Airlines followed suit with a modified Boeing 787-9 in partnership with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and a domestic coatings firm. This aircraft became the first riblet-coated airliner to fly internationally, marking a significant milestone in East Asia’s sustainability efforts.

The increased adoption of riblet technology by major airlines reflects the industry-wide urgency to meet emissions reduction targets set by IATA and national regulators.

Geo-Targeted Impact: Why the U.S. Matters in the Aviation Sustainability Push

The U.S. is home to some of the largest airline fleets in the world. With Delta headquartered in Atlanta and operating a massive domestic and international network, the rollout of riblet coating across its Boeing 767 fleet could dramatically reduce fuel consumption systemwide.

The impact is not just environmental. Lower fuel costs also create financial efficiencies that benefit airlines and passengers alike. If proven successful, the technology could expand to Delta’s A330 and A350 aircraft, affecting transatlantic and transpacific routes.

For airports and government regulators across North America, Delta’s move sets a new precedent in what carriers can and should do to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint.

Shark Skin Technology in Aviation: The Airlines Leading the Charge Toward Sustainable Flight

As the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and meet global sustainability goals, airlines around the world are turning to innovative technologies to drive change. Among the most exciting advancements is shark skin technology, a bio-inspired solution that mimics the microscopic patterns found on shark skin to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency in aircraft. Also known as riblet technology, this cutting-edge innovation is quietly reshaping the future of commercial aviation. Several forward-thinking airlines have already begun testing or integrating shark skin coatings into their fleets, signaling a major shift in how the travel industry approaches environmental responsibility.

The airline formed the Delta Sustainable Skies Lab in January 2023 to work toward that. The first-of-its-kind lab concentrates on research, design, and testing to find innovative solutions for its climate goals.

Now, Delta is using two nature-inspired methods to minimize fuel consumption, one inspired by sharks and the other by geese. Here’s how they work.

How shark skin and migrating geese inspire fuel-saving techniques

Delta Sustainable Skies Lab’s newest partner is MicroTau, an Australian aerospace technology company working on a “Riblet Modification Package” that reduces an aircraft’s aerodynamic drag. How? The company’s riblets are reminiscent of shark skin, with tiny grooves to increase efficiency. Though a shark’s skin looks smooth, it’s covered in microscopic grooves called dermal denticles that help it glide through the ocean. MicroTau’s riblets can enhance fuel efficiency by up to 4% when applied to an aircraft’s exterior. Delta will begin testing the system on its Boeing 767 fleet.

Further, Delta is testing a technique pioneered by Airbus called fello’fly, a wake energy retrieval program (WER) inspired by migrating geese. The method pairs aircraft, with the trailing plane riding the free lift from the leading plane, which requires less engine thrust and reduces fuel use by up to 5%.

Sustainable Skies Director, Sangita Sharma, said: “Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab bridges the gap between ideas and proven innovation by accelerating research, design and testing for a more sustainable future of air travel. Collaborating with innovative partners lets us explore both changes that can be implemented in the near-term, and longer-term initiatives that will revolutionize how we think about flying for years to come.”",https://www.themanual.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Delta-fellofly.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1,N,,2025-04-14 19:56:46.125928

Wind power followed in second, jumping roughly 12 percent since March 2024. Energy generated from fossil fuels, meanwhile, fell by 2.5 percent.

Canary Media notes that the milestone occurred during spring, an optimal time for renewable energy. Solar panels are at their most efficient because of longer days, more sunshine, and cooler temperatures, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. Strong wind patterns are beneficial for wind turbines, and rain for hydropower.

The data will likely give the renewable energy industry some much-needed optimism even as the Trump administration looks to revive the sputtering coal industry and considers cutting back on Biden-era tax incentives for cleaner energy sources.

The fate of incentives and funding for the renewable energy industry are up to the Trump administration. In addition to withholding funding already approved by Congress, the president has called to repeal in part or entirely the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains tax incentives for everything from clean electricity production and investment and sustainable aviation fuel to more nascent technologies like carbon dioxide sequestration. The incentives have helped attract billions in investment in U.S. manufacturing facilities, much of that investment in Republican-run states and districts.

In March, 21 House Republicans penned a letter in defense of the tax incentives, arguing the credits in fact support Trump’s energy agenda, The New York Times reported. It isn’t clear whether the president agrees, however, given that his day one executive orders declaring an “energy emergency” and “unleash[ing] America’s affordable and reliable energy” exclude solar and wind from the definition of domestic energy sources.

Should these incentives and funding disappear, experts warn it could lead to U.S. brain drain even at a time when Trump claims he is in favor of onshoring manufacturing and innovation.","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/vip/2025/04/solar-wind-renewable-energy-fossil-fuels-inc-1231905344.jpg",N,,2025-04-14 14:56:07.334248

(Espoo, Finland) has started producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at its renewable products refinery in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The refinery has been modified to enable Neste to produce up to 500,000 metric tons per year (m.t./yr) of SAF. As a result, Neste’s global SAF production capability has increased to 1.5 million m.t./yr (around 1.875 billion liters). Last year, Neste bolstered its SAF supply capabilities in North America through a partnership with ONEOK to expand terminal capacity in Houston.

Ltd.’s 120,000-b/d Geelong refinery adjacent to Corio Bay, about 50 km west of Melbourne, in Victoria, Australia (OGJ Online, Nov. 18, 2024).

The ULSG upgrading project at Geelong is proceeding on schedule, with the refinery to begin ramping up ULSG production in August 2025 for targeted deliveries to retail sites by Dec. 15 to ensure compliance with the Australian federal government’s new fuel specifications coming into effect in late 2025, Viva Energy said on Apr. 14.

The update follows Viva Energy’s confirmation in its recently released annual report that, by yearend 2024, it had completed installation of key components for the new ULSG plant.

Once fully online, the ULSG plant will produce all grades of gasoline with a maximum sulfur content of 10ppm to enable importation of better vehicle technology into Australia that will result in major public health and environmental benefits from reduced tailpipe emissions and more fuel-efficient engines, according to the company’s 2024 annual report.

Scheduled to reach mechanical completion in second-half 2025, the ULSG plant will—upon full commissioning—allow the refinery to produce the cleanest gasoline ever manufactured in Australia, the operator said.

Regulatory compliance

First announced in 2021, Viva Energy’s ULSG upgrading project was approved in April 2022 at an overall investment of about $300 million (Aus.)—or about $222 million—following an award of $125 million under the Australian Federal Government’s refinery upgrades program (OGJ Online, Apr. 14, 2022; May 24, 2021).

In its 2024 annual report, Viva Energy confirmed it will complete the project at a final cost of $350 million (Aus.), $200 million of which is dedicated to Australian procurement and construction contracts mostly awarded to businesses in the Geelong region.

The budget increase follows the federal government’s December 2023 announcement that fuel quality and noxious vehicle emissions standards would come into effect from December 2025 to ensure Australia’s fuel quality aligns more closely with international standards.

In compliance with the regulatory timeline, Viva Energy confirmed expanding the ULSG project to certify that—in addition to all of Geelong’s ULSG conforms to 10 ppm sulfur content—aromatics limits of the refinery’s RON95 mid-grade gasoline production conforms to the pending legislation’s stricter requirement of less than 35%.

Both the ULSG and aromatics upgrades are part of Viva Energy’s ongoing transformation of the Geelong refinery into a modern energy hub that supports Australia’s energy security while also playing an important role its energy transition, the operator said.

Future refining plans

In its 2024 annual report, Viva Energy said it was continuing to explore options to replace crude oil with biogenic and waste feedstocks at the Geelong refinery, with potential biofeedstock and waste processing projects for the site slated for development throughout 2025.

After confirming in its 2024 half-year results presentation undertaking of engineering design for infrastructure to store and co-process biogenic feedstocks at Geelong, Viva Energy said in its latest annual report that, by yearend 2024, it had completed a first investment in infrastructure to support co-processing at Geelong involving the injection of used cooking oil and soft-plastics pyrolysis oil into processing activities to produce recycled polyproylene and biopolymers.

Additionally, the operator said work remained under way on the scope and phasing of co-processing biofeedstocks at the refinery to produce renewable diesel, with the trial project’s first phase anticipated to deliver 50 ml/year of a 3% renewable-diesel blend potentially beginning in 2026.

Upon completing the second and third phases of the co-processing trial in 2028 and 2032, respectively, Viva Energy said it would then be better positioned to weigh committing to any major investment in a dedicated renewables plant at Geelong based on a tested confidence in both the feedstock and end-user markets.

With rising pressure for an abatement solution to address emissions from air travel, Viva Energy said that—alongside developing supply chains to import and distribute sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—it also is evaluating possible at-scale production of SAF at Geelong leveraging existing processes at the refinery.

In addition to confidence in secure feedstock and end-user markets, the operator said key government policy and support also would be required to enable any investments in dedicated renewable diesel and SAF production capacities at Geelong.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/04/67fd482f751f004eaee80ef7-250414viva_energy_group_ltd.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-04-14 14:56:16.179353

Weihenmayer is the only blind climber to ascend the Seven Summits – the highest peaks on each continent. A Time magazine cover story on his 2001 Mount Everest climb brought him worldwide recognition.

Weihenmayer has also climbed frozen waterfalls in Nepal and Canada, volcanoes in Ecuador and Chile, and long, difficult rock routes in his home in Colorado's Rocky Mountains and the towering cliffs of the Italian Dolomites. And in 2014, he kayaked the entire 277 miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.

""As a blind climber, I have lived a life that no venture capitalist would have put money on, but I have been so lucky to have been a part of great teams, innovating through barriers and shattering people's perceptions of what is possible,"" Weihenmayer said. ""One of my greatest rewards is to be able to share a message of possibility, especially with young people as they shape the vision that will be the foundation for their lives.""

Born with a rare eye disease, Weihenmayer began losing his vision to retinoschisis when he was 14 years old. However, he resisted the idea that blindness would sweep him to the sidelines of life. He established himself as a formidable wrestler in high school, representing his home state of Connecticut in the National Junior Freestyle Wrestling Championship in Iowa. As a teenager, he also discovered rock climbing and a natural dexterity for the tactile aspects of scanning the rock with his hands and feet for holds.

Weihenmayer graduated from Boston College with a double major and in English and communications and earned a master's degree in education from Lesley University in Massachusetts. He later worked as a middle school math and English teacher at the Phoenix Country Day School in Arizona, using innovative tools like Braille seating charts and high-tech scanners to aid his teaching.

By challenging preconceptions about what it means to be blind, Weihenmayer has inspired people around the world. He is the co-founder of the nonprofit organization No Barriers, which offers transformative programs to help people with disabilities live a ""no barriers life."" The organization serves 10,000 people annually, living by its motto: ""What's within you is stronger than what's in your way.""

""I'm very glad we will be welcoming Erik to our campus as this year's Commencement speaker,"" said University of Arizona President Suresh Garimella. ""Erik is a world-renowned adventurer, educator and leader, who has dedicated his life to serving others. His achievements exemplify courage, resilience and the Bear Down spirit, and he is the perfect person to help inspire our graduates to continue to challenge themselves as they embark on the next chapters in their lives.""

Weihenmayer has appeared in several feature-length documentary films. He participated in a volcano research expedition to Vanuatu in the South Pacific alongside Will Smith, a trip that was chronicled in Disney's ""Welcome to Earth"" series, and most recently, he is featured in the short film ""Soundscape,"" which won a Creative Excellence Award at Banff Mountain Film Festival.

Weihenmayer is the author of the best-selling memoir ""Touch the Top of the World,"" which was made into a feature film, and he also wrote ""The Adversity Advantage"" and ""No Barriers: A Blind Man's Journey to Kayak the Grand Canyon.""

Government releases shortlist of projects for second round of green hydrogen funding

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) has announced that 27 electrolytic hydrogen projects have advanced to the next stage of the second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2). The scheme is the government's principal mechanism for providing funding support for low-carbon hydrogen production in the UK.

The successful projects are spread across the UK, including eight in Scotland and three in Wales. The range of intended uses for green hydrogen includes oil refineries, production of ammonia and an industrial-scale brewery. The government has reiterated its hope that the HAR2 support will boost decarbonisation of industries which are hard to electrify. It has also further identified projects that support the use of green hydrogen in ""glass manufacturing, brick making, and sustainable aviation fuel production."" However, the government has noted that it is unlikely that all the shortlisted projects will progress to a stage where they will receive funding.

Industry voices have welcomed the announcement, claiming it as a success for the funding mechanism. Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, praised the announcement as “building on valuable lessons” from the first Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1).

Project developers must now focus on maturing their projects and completing the government's due diligence process, before DESNZ publishes decisions on which projects will progress to the next stage.

Government kickstarts £100 million-plus fusion investment

The government has announced its £20 million investment to kickstart ""Starmaker One"", a private British fusion investment fund, the first early-stage clean energy fusion venture capital fund outside the US.

This ""first of its kind"" partnership aims to unlock up to a further £130 million of investment from the private sector, and put Britain at the forefront of the global fusion market, which the government expects to become worth trillions of pounds. The announcement follows the government's commitment in January 2025 for a record £410 million of funding for fusion research in the UK and in collaboration with other countries.

Fusion generation involves the combination of two forms of hydrogen and heating them at extreme temperatures, resulting in the release of large amounts of energy. The government intends fusion to be a key sector in the Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor and cites independent research from London Economics, which suggests that every £1 invested in fusion could benefit the UK economy by nearly £4.

By injecting cash into this technology, the government hopes to build private sector confidence in fusion energy. The initial £20 million investment will help small fusion companies to train their workforce, develop technologies and capitalise on fusion opportunities in a wide range of markets (including magnetics, industrial AI, robotics, healthcare, transportation and energy storage). The government also hopes that fusion can make a significant contribution to delivering clean, secure and abundant baseload energy.

Energy minister, Kerry McCarthy, said: ""breakthroughs in this technology are happening thick and fast, and we want to keep the UK at the forefront of the global race by helping projects to innovate and grow here, in turn driving economic growth"".

Long-duration electricity storage investment scheme unveiled

Ofgem has launched its new long-duration electricity storage (LDES) investment support scheme. The ""cap and floor"" scheme is the UK's first major funding for LDES projects in 40 years.

It aims to provide both financial stability for LDES operators by guaranteeing a minimum revenue and protection for consumers, by driving efficiency and ensuring that excess revenues result in reduced consumer bills.

Ofgem published its UK's technical decision document for LDES in March. LDES technologies provide essential back-up for renewable power by functioning like large batteries. The cap and floor scheme has been established to de-risk investment in these technologies (particularly liquid air energy storage, compressed air energy storage and flow batteries), which currently have significant upfront capital costs.

In a separate announcement, Ofgem has announced the first application window for the scheme. Ofgem is seeking applications from developers who can meet the government's Clean Power 2030 target. Projects will be divided into two tracks: a 2030 track and a 2033 track, with priority given to those who can deliver by 2030.

Ofgem has invited interested parties to send their intentions to submit projects by 22 April and to submit actual applications by 9 June (by email to LDES@ofgem.gov.uk).

Government publishes update to solar capacities for Clean Power 2030 Action Plan

On 7 April, the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) published a letter to the National Energy System Operator (NESO), copying in Ofgem. The letter confirmed the re-publication of the Connections Reform Annex, which accompanied the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan and detailed the permitted regional capacity breakdowns by technology.

The updated annex includes adjustments to the solar capacity allocations for 2031-2035. The update addresses a previous misalignment between solar capacity allocations and the solar pipeline for 2031-2035. This resulted from an increase in the solar project pipeline at transmission level not having been fully reflected in NESO's 2024 Future Energy Scenarios. NESO's advice to DESNZ on Clean Power 2030 and its action plan had been based on that document.

DESNZ states that it has decided the best way to address this is to amalgamate the solar distribution and transmission allocations for 2031-2035 across the 11 transmission network regions (see table 6 of the updated annex). This is intended to allow NESO to allocate network capacity to the most well-developed solar projects across transmission and distribution in each region.

DESNZ emphasises that this is a one-off technical update to the action plan. The overall (albeit ""interim"") solar capacity allocation remains the same. DESNZ has stated it does not expect to revisit allocations again until the publication of the Strategic Spatial Energy Plan in late 2026.

Next generation of offshore wind in Celtic Sea reaches ITT Stage 2 Sumaiya Hafiza

The Crown Estate has published an update that three sites have entered the final stages of Offshore Leasing Round 5 (OLR5) – the invitation to tender (ITT) Stage 2. This fifth round is expected to award rights for three new floating wind farms in the Celtic Sea, generating up to 4.5GW of capacity. This forms the first phase of commercial development for OLR5 and is part of a broader plan to introduce an additional 20-30GW of offshore wind leasing opportunities by 2030.

ITT Stage 2 will involve an auction later in spring 2025. The Crown Estate has suggested the resulting agreements for lease could be signed in summer 2025.

Research published by the Crown Estate last year indicated that these three floating wind farms could support the creation of over 5,000 jobs and deliver a £1.4 billion boost to the economy.

RenewableUK analysis shows that, by 2050, floating wind technologies could provide a third of the UK's overall offshore wind capacity, which could be 40GW. The organisation's estimate is that the floating wind sector alone could employ 97,000 people and contribute £47 billion to the economy.

Keir Starmer’s Government is facing growing calls to block investment from Chinese firms in the likes of Grangemouth oil refinery, new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C, plus other solar and wind projects.

It comes after Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said over the weekend that companies from China may have to be excluded from “sensitive” sectors after the Government stepped in to take control of the Scunthorpe steelworks from Jingye.

Downing Street appeared to try to defuse the simmering row with China on Monday by resisting pressure for a fresh crackdown on Beijing-linked companies in the UK.

Grangemouth oil refinery

But Starmer’s Government is now facing growing calls to go further and nationalise Grangemouth oil refinery – the under-threat plant near Falkirk partly owned by Chinese company PetroChina.

Several Labour MPs told The i Paper that they backed calls by the SNP to take control of the plant in central Scotland to secure its future.

Opposition MPs also called for the Government to block plans by Chinese company Mingyang to build a wind turbine factory in Scotland.

Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors

Experts also said it was time to examine how Chinese firms could be phased out from other major energy projects – including new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C.

However, they warned there was a limit on how much could be nationalised – warning that the Government may have to offer incentives to other private sector players to buy out Chinese firms.

Luke de Pulford, executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said Labour had been “naïve” and “desperate” in trying to encourage economic investment from Beijing.

“It’s wilful blindness because they know it’s compromising national security,” said the China hawk from IPAC, which brings together international politicians to examine the threats posed by China.

De Pulfold said ministers should do a full “audit” of existing Chinese ownership in key sectors. “We need to be rooting out Chinese investment from our critical infrastructure,” he said.

“It’s not going to be easy. But we need to protect our national security and increase our resilience. We have to accept there might be economic pain, but it’s a case of pain now over more pain later.”

In 2022 the Conservative Government forced China General Nuclear (CGN) out of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project in Suffolk, using £700m of taxpayer cash.

But CGN still owns a 33 per cent interest in the Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, with the French energy giant EDF owning the rest.

The Government should look at encouraging private companies – whether British or from allied companies – to buy out Chinese firms, De Pulford added.

“There has to be other ways of doing it than going around the country nationalising things all over the place. It’s not sustainable.”

The Chinese state ultimately holds £45 billion in UK assets, according to a 2023 ‘China List’ report in The Sunday Times.

China Investment Corporation (CIC), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, has a 10 per cent stake in London’s Heathrow airport, an 8.7 per cent holding in Thames Water, and is also part of a consortium that owns Cadent – the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Wind farms in and off the coast of Scotland

There has been increasing Chinese investment in Britain’s renewable sector, primarily in wind and solar.

Offshore wind company Mingyang was recently chosen by a joint Italian-Norwegian-Japanese venture to provide the turbines for the Green Volt North Sea wind farm off the north-east coast of Scotland.

Mingyang are also thought to be in talks to build a turbine plant in Scotland. UK Treasury ministers reportedly overruled concerns from the Ministry of Defence about Mingyang’s involvement in the wind farm.

Labour’s investment minister Poppy Gustafsson met with Mingyang at the end of last year, shortly before Chancellor Rachel Reeves went to Beijing to try to drum up wider investment.

The Conservatives’ Shadow Energy Secretary Andrew Bowie said Chinese involvement should sound “alarm bells” – potentially leaving subsea communications vulnerable to Chinese spying attempts.

Bowie told The i Paper that Labour’s “arbitrary” net zero targets meant they had “no choice but to become more and more reliant” on China, accusing the party of “undermining our energy and national security”.

However, some investment decisions were taken while a Conservative government was in power.

Several left-wing Labour MPs, including Jon Trickett and Andy McDonald, have joined the SNP in calling for the Government to consider taking control of Grangemouth from PetroChina and its partner Ineos.

Scotland’s sole oil refinery is set to close by the end of June. The owners have plans to convert it to an import-only terminal, with around 400 of the 2,000 jobs at the site facing the axe.

A joint Scottish and UK Government project have set out a number of options for the future of the Grangemouth site – including the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. However, it said that around £3.5 billion of private investment would be needed.

Brian Leishman, Labour MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, said no foreign power should have control over a “vital” asset like an oil refinery. “I don’t understand why the Government won’t do the same for Grangemouth as it did for Scunthorpe.”

He added: “Private, foreign capital is involved in the ownership in both. Losing refining capacity in Scotland will negatively impact our fuel security and therefore our national security.”

Ewan Gibbs, senior lecturer in economic and social history at Glasgow University, said it was “no bad thing” that the idea of nationalisation in heavy industry was back on the table – arguing that there was a good case for taking control of Grangemouth.

“Regardless of the country of origin, it’s clear we have private foreign ownership in key sectors who are not invested in the interests in the UK national or local economies,” said Gibbs.

“They are not committed to the welfare of workforces and capacity. It’s legitimate to be concerned about [security].”

George Magnus, economist and associate at the China Centre at Oxford University, said there should be a higher bar in allowing Chinese companies to invest in critical sectors.

“It’s reasonable to ask the Government that a rule is run over each company in question, and what the risk to Britain is. It’s naive to think if it’s not a state-run enterprise it will be fine,” he said.

However, Magnus warned that attempts to nationalise or force existing Chinese companies out would be difficult – and could lead to retaliatory action from Beijing when it comes to trade and British companies in China.

“I don’t think China will be very happy if the Government began extricating Chinese companies from nuclear and other sectors. There is still a fair bit of commerce that happens between us.”

Industry reactions to Tokayev’s directive

A current Airbus A320 captain, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the president’s directive as a «difficult task.» He noted that Tashkent Airport, located not far from Almaty, is also vying for regional hub status, a competition that Kazakhstan must be prepared to face.

«If Kazakhstan’s authorities manage to implement this project, it will provide a massive stimulus for the growth of local airlines and the broader aviation services sector,» the captain said.

Peter Foster, CEO of Air Astana, Kazakhstan’s flag carrier, said the airline supports the concept of transforming the country into a regional aviation hub. However, he admitted the details remain unclear.

Foster added that Air Astana would support placing the hub in the Almaty region, where most business travel is concentrated. He also speculated that a completely new site could be developed north of the city or even closer to Astana.

What is an air hub and how can it be built?

During an extended cabinet meeting on Jan. 28, 2025, President Tokayev described an air hub as an integrated ecosystem that includes passenger and cargo terminals, logistics centers and modern services.

However, aviation industry expert Abul Kekilbayev noted that the concept of an «air hub» is not clearly defined in current legislation, leading to varied interpretations. For some, it means a large airport handling over 10 million passengers annually. For others, it represents a fully developed transport and logistics center, including warehouses, rail connections, hotels, residential housing, schools, medical centers and facilities for cargo airlines.

Erlan Ospanov, co-owner of Sary-Arka International Airport in Karaganda, emphasized that an air hub is not just about physical infrastructure.

«An air hub requires close cooperation between an airline and an airport. The airline creates the passenger and cargo flows; the airport supports that flow with the necessary infrastructure,» he explained.

Kazakhstan’s law on airspace use and aviation activity defines an air hub as a key airport equipped with infrastructure for organizing connecting flights. It serves as an intermediate stop for airlines to transfer passengers, baggage, mail and cargo en route to final destinations.

How do air hubs operate in other countries?

Ospanov cited several classic examples of successful air hubs: Dubai International Airport with Emirates Airlines, Frankfurt Airport with Lufthansa and Istanbul Airport with Turkish Airlines.

The Airbus A320 captain also pointed to Istanbul as a standout model. He noted that Turkish Airlines now flies to 120 countries and operates a fleet of 347 aircraft.

«This creates enormous demand for their services and drives consistent growth,» he said. «Istanbul is one of the largest airports I’ve ever flown into; it operates thousands of flights each day to every corner of the world. Turkey has shown how to successfully manage transportation and logistics flows, create thousands of jobs and grow its national airline.»

Kekilbayev highlighted Frankfurt’s airport ecosystem as another strong example. Within its vicinity are three major airports: Mannheim, Frankfurt-Hahn and Frankfurt am Main, the latter of which is Europe’s top cargo hub. The entire region’s infrastructure is built around these air transport nodes.

He also pointed to Moscow, which operates four major airports: Sheremetyevo (a hub for Aeroflot), Domodedovo (S7 Airlines), Vnukovo (Utair) and Zhukovsky (Red Wings, technically located in the Moscow region). Each serves as a strategic base for a particular airline, optimizing efficiency and logistics in Russia’s capital.

The jet fuel problem

Foster of Air Astana identified limited access to jet fuel as the biggest challenge facing Kazakhstan’s aviation industry. Currently, the country produces only TS-1, a Soviet-era grade of aviation kerosene, and lacks the more widely used global standard Jet-A1. Transitioning, at least partially, to Jet-A1 has been necessary for years. But it still hasn’t happened.

President Tokayev has ordered that affordable jet fuel be made available by mid-2025. He acknowledged that kerosene prices at Kazakhstan’s airports are too expensive.

Although the production of Jet-A1 has been under discussion for years, a timeline remains unclear. Experts note that introducing the fuel will require new infrastructure, including dedicated storage tanks, because TS-1 and Jet-A1 cannot be mixed. Smooth logistics and fuel delivery will also depend on upgrades to airport infrastructure.

According to Kekilbayev, jet fuel in Kazakhstan costs about $1,000 per ton, compared to $700 to $800 in Europe. He says this pricing gap is a major deterrent to foreign investment.

«If it costs $1,000 a ton here, how are we supposed to attract anyone?» he said. «Investors won’t commit to the market until conditions are in place that allow them to recoup their investments.»

Complicating the issue, Kazakhstan heavily relies on imported jet fuel, primarily from Russia, increasing its exposure to price volatility and supply chain risks. Infrastructure is not yet in place to support imports from alternative suppliers, such as China or Turkmenistan.

However, Ospanov pushed back on the notion that Kazakhstan’s fuel is too expensive. He explained that only imported fuel comes with a high price tag, while domestic fuel — making up 60% to 70% of the total market — is significantly cheaper.

«Air Astana and SCAT purchase domestic fuel for 300,000 to 350,000 tenge (about $580 to $670),» he said. «You won’t find prices like that at any airport in the world. Plus, they pay almost nothing for storage.»

Ospanov argued that the high price of imported fuel is driven by value-added tax (VAT) and a monopolized supply chain dominated by Russian producers. He added that while imported fuel is technically sold to foreign companies at a zero VAT rate, the refund process can take up to two years.

«Accordingly, traders who import this fuel don’t expect to recover the VAT,» he said. «They write it off immediately and factor it into the fuel cost. On top of that, they add a risk margin, usually around 10% to 20%. As a result, imported fuel ends up being 40% to 50% more expensive than fuel refined in Russia.»

Ospanov explained that Russian suppliers can maintain this pricing power due to their monopoly in the Kazakhstani market. Fuel is not imported from other countries because a 5% import duty, while modest in theory, effectively acts as a trade barrier rather than a fiscal tool.

He emphasized that reducing airfares — a key factor in boosting passenger volumes — will require solving the fuel affordability problem. There are two potential solutions: ensure domestic availability of jet fuel or introduce a 6% preferential VAT rate.

«This isn’t about helping airlines; it’s about helping passengers,» he added. «Airlines will benefit anyway through increased traffic. But competition also needs to grow, and we’re hopeful the acquisition of Qazaq Air by Vietnam’s Sovico Group will help drive that.»

Infrastructure limitations and lack of investment

Experts also cite underdeveloped infrastructure, limited investment and a shortage of qualified personnel as major barriers to hub development.

Kekilbayev noted that Kazakhstan’s two largest airports, Almaty and Astana, are now hemmed in by private developments, leaving little room for expansion. The new terminal in Almaty is already overloaded and struggling to manage growing passenger demand.

Ospanov agreed, stating that airport infrastructure suffers from chronic underinvestment due to poor profitability. He pointed to a significant imbalance between the financial performance of airlines and that of airports.

«All the income and profit go to the airlines. Air Astana, for example, reported an EBITDA of $300 million in 2023. In contrast, the combined EBITDA of all 25 airports in Kazakhstan is less than $100 million,» he said.

Kekilbayev added that the low tariffs for aircraft maintenance further discourage private investment. There is also no clear mechanism to recoup infrastructure investments through tariffs or state-backed compensation programs. Additionally, the sector is experiencing a talent drain, particularly in aviation management, as professionals seek opportunities abroad.

«Unfortunately, we have very few experienced practitioners in aviation leadership,» Kekilbayev said. «The people in charge are smart managers, but many lack specialized training or practical industry experience.»

The cargo opportunity: untapped potential

President Tokayev noted that the global air cargo market is valued at around $140 billion, yet no Kazakhstani airline significantly participates in it.

Kekilbayev argued that Kazakhstan urgently needs a national cargo carrier. Unlike Azerbaijan, where Silk Way Airlines plays a leading regional role, Kazakhstan is still in the planning stages.

Ospanov highlighted the critical difference between passenger and cargo operations: cargo cannot wait.

«Companies like DHL, FedEx and UPS operate with flight schedules precise to within two minutes,» he said. «Kazakhstan’s current infrastructure simply can’t meet those standards.»

He also noted that Karaganda holds strong potential as a future cargo hub due to its central location and available space. However, he cautioned that it must operate without delays to be viable.

«Look at Liege in Belgium or Cologne in Germany. Those are examples of how to do it right,» he said.

Reform is essential for a functional hub

Kekilbayev stressed that Kazakhstan must urgently develop a comprehensive aviation strategy and modernize its airports if it hopes to create a functioning air hub.

«Despite the president’s initiative, there is still no state program specifically focused on air hub development,» he said. «The Ministry of Transport is more concerned with automobile roads and railways.»

He highlighted that Kazakhstan lacks a dedicated civil aviation policy.

«We’re still operating under a general transport strategy that doesn’t address the unique needs of the aviation sector,» Kekilbayev said.

Ospanov echoed the need for structural reform, calling it a prerequisite for real progress.

«Only through reform can we give this industry room to breathe,» he said. «Without that, there’s little chance of building an international hub. Our airports were never designed to be large transit centers. The master plans and development projects must be overhauled from the ground up.»

Ospanov said that a strategic misstep was made in the early stages of Kazakhstan’s aviation sector development. According to the classic model, airports should generate revenue through both aviation services — such as takeoff, landing and aircraft handling — and commercial, non-aviation services, including fuel sales, terminal leasing and catering.

«Due to regulated airport tariffs and unregulated airfare prices, we’ve seen a dramatic income imbalance,» he said. «All the revenue and profits go to the airlines. They’re thriving while airports are struggling to stay afloat. That imbalance has to be fixed. Someone deliberately drove a wedge between airlines and airports, and they began developing separately. That was a strategic mistake.»

Ospanov argued that Kazakhstan should focus on developing just one international air hub, warning that the market cannot sustain more than one. To support hub development, he recommended cutting VAT on aviation and fuel imports, encouraging a competitive fuel market, deregulating airport operations and overhauling the industry’s master plan and development strategy.

«We’re going to have one air hub. You can’t have two at an international level, not in this market,» Ospanov said. «We need to make a firm decision on where it will be based.»

Kekilbayev added that, realistically, Kazakhstan will not see a true international air hub for another five to ten years.

«First, there needs to be a shift in mindset,» he said. «Until that happens, it’s very difficult to even talk about building something of that scale.»

Ministry plans multiple hubs based on six key airports

Despite industry skepticism, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Transport is moving forward with plans to develop multiple air hubs. The strategy centers around six airports: Astana, Almaty, Aktau, Aktobe, Karaganda and Shymkent.

The cabinet has outlined five primary focus areas for air hub development:

Infrastructure modernization: Runways, logistics terminals and warehouses will be upgraded in partnership with investors. Foreign capital will fund improvements in Astana, Almaty and Aktau, while domestic investors will handle Karaganda and Shymkent. Aktobe is still seeking an investor.

Jet fuel availability: The government is amending fuel supply regulations to expand the list of acceptable fuel types, oils and lubricants. This includes allowing purchases outside the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and enabling alternative production standards. In mid-2024, KazMunayGas, the national oil and gas company, announced it was ready to begin producing Jet A-1 fuel. The ASTM D1655 standard, the international benchmark for jet fuels, has already been registered and is being incorporated into legislation. The company also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in partnership with Japan and the U.S.

Creating special economic zones (SEZs): Designed to attract investors, increase traffic and support manufacturing, SEZs are already in place. One has been active at Aktobe Airport since Jan. 8, 2025, while the others are still in development.

Streamlined customs and tax benefits: The government is considering tax incentives and simplifying customs procedures to support air hub growth.

Automation of cargo processing: All airports will be linked to the E-freight digital information system, which reduces bureaucracy and corruption risks, shortens cargo processing time and increases efficiency. The system will be integrated with Kazakhstan’s customs and agriculture management platforms for seamless logistics coordination.

The government is also exploring partnerships with global cargo giants such as Cargolux, Turkish Cargo and China Airlines Cargo. Currently, cargo transit through Kazakhstan accounts for just 2% of volume, but 22% of the total cargo value, a figure the authorities hope to grow.

«These measures will increase cargo volumes at domestic airports and lay the groundwork for developing regional air hubs that offer a full range of services,» the Ministry of Transport stated.

In his September 2024 state-of-the-nation address, President Tokayev reaffirmed the importance of aviation reform, calling the development of air hubs a critical national task.

How SAF Credits Help Airlines and Corporates Cut CO2 The aviation industry is aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.","Gevo and Dublin-based Future Energy Global (FEG) have signed a breakthrough offtake agreement that supports airlines and other companies in slashing their carbon footprints. Under this multi-year deal, FEG will buy Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon abatement credits tied to 10 million gallons per year of Gevo’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from its upcoming ATJ-60 facility.

This deal also gives FEG the option to expand its SAF purchase volume later. This will help airlines and corporations meet net-zero targets more quickly.

Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, CEO of Gevo said,

“Gevo has always planned to leverage SAF market economics to scale our business, and a Book and Claim market that enables the trading of SAF environmental attributes can accelerate SAF production even faster. Future Energy Global is building just such a market, spanning corporate customers, airlines, and aircraft lessors. Aircraft lessors own about half of all commercial aircraft worldwide, and Book and Claim is a critical enabler to allow them and their airline customers to adopt SAF faster.”

Gevo’s ATJ-60 Plant Set to Take Off with 60M Gallons of Low-Carbon SAF

EIA revealed that at the beginning of 2024, the U.S. SAF production capacity was only around 2,000 b/d.

Now, as per the press release, Gevo’s new ATJ-60 plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, will produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually, which will significantly suffice the demand.

The cost will be comparable to conventional jet fuel, but the fuel will have much lower emissions. The project received a $1.63 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy, which will help finance the construction of the ATJ-60 plant and speed up operations.

Key highlights of ATJ-60:

Gevo’s proprietary tech and “pay-for-performance” model reward emissions reductions. Through its Verity platform, the company ensures full transparency and accountability across the SAF supply chain. Additionally, the company rewards low-carbon practices while delivering real value to local communities.

Paving the Way for a Low-Carbon Future

Gevo is a pioneer of low-carbon fuels and chemicals from renewable sources. Its advanced technology creates Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), motor fuels, and eco-friendly materials that work with existing engines and infrastructure. It ensures an easy switch from fossil fuels.

Thus, cutting carbon emissions through renewable fuels and chemicals is their top priority. The company operates one of the largest dairy-based renewable natural gas facilities in the U.S. and an ethanol plant equipped with carbon capture technology.

Future Energy Global (FEG) Boosts Europe’s Aviation Decarbonization with SAF Credits

FEG’s business model connects investors, suppliers, and buyers to enhance sustainable aviation fuel production worldwide. By monetizing carbon credits tied to SAF, FEG creates extra revenue streams that boost the scale-up.

Natasha Mann, CEO and Co-Founder of FEG, noted,

“FEG’s collaboration with Gevo strongly enhances the portfolio of Book and Claim solutions we can offer our airlines, our lessors, and our corporate customers. It’s crucial to scale SAF production, and our business model lets us unlock the capital to do so. We’re impressed with Gevo’s pipeline, which combines technology ready for today’s market and additional technologies far along in development that could increase production efficiency and accelerate the trajectory of SAF scaling.”

To accelerate Europe’s aviation decarbonization, FEG supports Electro-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel or E-SAF. It’s a scalable, very low carbon, and drop-in fuel option with greater potential than many bio-based alternatives. On April 10, FEG became one of the first signatories of the Bodø Declaration, uniting airlines, tech firms, airports, and policymakers to push for climate-neutral aviation.

The Declaration urges:

Long-term SAF regulations through 2050 to unlock investments

Market incentives like the EU ETS to encourage fossil fuel shifts

Support for long-term offtake deals between producers and users

A Europe-wide book & claim system to maximize emission cuts

Last month, FEG signed a deal to supply Microsoft with Scope 3 SAF certificates from airline purchases. This is part of Microsoft’s ambition to be net-zero by 2030.

How SAF Credits Help Airlines and Corporates Cut CO2

The aviation industry is aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. SAF is expected to deliver two-thirds of the required emission cuts. This means that SAF production has to increase by 400 times. But SAF is not available everywhere. That’s where FEG comes in.

Through this deal, FEG will distribute SAF-derived Scope 1 credits to airlines unable to access physical SAF at their home airports. Corporates can also purchase Scope 3 credits to offset emissions from employee business travel. This “Book and Claim” approach separates fuel from its carbon savings, lowering logistics costs and unlocking access to global SAF markets.

Scope 1 means direct emissions from airline operations, and Scope 3 is indirect emissions from corporate air travel.

Annual SAF demand range over the main and accelerated cases compared with capacity potential, 2020-2026

This is how FEG amplifies SAF demand by turning carbon credits into revenue. This gives producers like Gevo a steady income and helps buyers attain their climate targets. Though FEG started with aviation, it now offers sustainable fuel credit solutions for land and marine transport as well.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2409429949.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 12:56:59.415108

Ainda assim, fundos imobiliários agrícolas — conhecidos como Fiagros — seguem confiantes na valorização de longo prazo das terras produtivas como forma de diversificação patrimonial.

Marconi Silva, gestor de operações agro da 051 Capital, responsável pelos fundos FDZA11, FZDB11 e FLEM11, reconhece o cenário adverso no curto prazo, com quedas nas cotações da soja e desafios financeiros enfrentados pelos produtores. Porém, ele sustenta que as bases fundamentais de valorização imobiliária das terras agrícolas permanecem sólidas.

""O mercado físico de commodities sempre foi sujeito a solavancos, mas os fundamentos do investimento imobiliário agrícola são estruturais e permanecem firmes"", diz Silva. ""A demanda mundial crescente por alimentos e biocombustíveis precisa ser suprida em um volume limitado de terra produtiva.""

Fiagro da 051 Capital aposta na valorização das terras

Segundo o gestor, a combinação entre aumento da renda global e mudanças nos padrões de alimentação — que exigem mais grãos na base da cadeia — tende a manter a pressão estrutural sobre a demanda. Ele também menciona fatores como a regulação ambiental da União Europeia, que prevê a adoção obrigatória do Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), como vetores adicionais de demanda por soja e milho.

A estratégia do fundo está centrada na aquisição de fazendas consolidadas com desconto e posterior arrendamento a grandes operadores, com contratos indexados à soja. Embora a receita anual dos fundos dependa das cotações da commodity, o principal retorno — segundo Marconi Silva — vem da valorização imobiliária dos ativos ao longo do tempo.

A valorização vista nos ativos geridos pela 051 é significativa. Entre os casos emblemáticos da carteira, a Fazenda Xingu, principal ativo do FDZA11, foi adquirida em junho de 2022 por R$ 150,7 milhões (incluindo custos transacionais) e, mesmo com a queda das cotações da soja em 2024, foi avaliada em abril deste ano em R$ 276,7 milhões — uma valorização de 84%.

No FZDB11, a Fazenda Tabuleiro I foi comprada por R$ 348,9 milhões em março de 2023 e avaliada em R$ 598 milhões pouco mais de um ano depois, segundo o último relatório gerencial — alta de 71% no período.

""Terra sempre foi um ativo de proteção patrimonial no Brasil e nos Estados Unidos. Quem investe entende que a valorização ocorre em platôs, não de forma linear. Por isso, mesmo com menos liquidez, há grupos querendo aumentar exposição.""

Sunos Asset reforça tese dos Fiagros com safra acima da média

A tese da valorização imobiliária também é defendida por outros players do setor. A Suno Asset, gestora do Fiagro SNFZ11, projeta um aumento relevante na receita de locação da Fazenda Coliseu — seu principal ativo — impulsionado pela produtividade acima da média da safra de soja 2024/25. Segundo João Vitor Franzin, analista da casa, a produção em Mato Grosso superou a média dos últimos cinco anos, o que deve gerar um bônus adicional sobre o valor mínimo previsto em contrato.

""Quanto maior a produtividade da fazenda, maior será o valor que o fundo receberá pela locação. E como a produtividade do Estado superou a marca de 65 sacas por hectare, há uma expectativa de bônus no pagamento"", afirmou Franzin, em live no canal da Suno Asset.

Na visão do analista, o avanço da produtividade e a adesão crescente de investidores à tese de valorização de terras reforçam a atratividade de longo prazo do segmento.

Une délégation de l’OAD, Observatoire de l’Aviation Durable, a fait le déplacement pour Elixir Aircraft, choisi pour la 8e étape des Rencontres Territoriales de la Décarbonation du Transport Aérien. À cette occasion, Elixir Aircraft annonce avoir démarré la turbine Turbotech TP-R90, montée sur avion pour la première fois. Prochaine étape : le vol alimenté intégralement en carburant SAF, courant 2025.

Première rencontre de l’OAD à l’international

À l’occasion du salon Aero Friedrichshafen, Damien Cazé, directeur général de l’Aviation civile, et Sandra Combet, secrétaire générale de l’Observatoire de l’aviation durable (OAD) ont tenu la 8e étape des rencontres de la décarbonation de l’aviation sur le stand d’Elixir Aircraft. Ils soutiennent ainsi le rayonnement des solutions industrielles françaises à l’international.

L’OAD a souhaité découvrir la technologie Carbon OneShot de l’Elixir, une conception de l’avion tout carbone en neuf pièces seulement, sans rivets ni colle. Cette innovation simplifie considérablement l’aérostructure, garantit une sécurité accrue et une maintenance réduite, tout en allégeant les appareils, diminuant ainsi leur consommation par rapport aux modèles à structure métallique ou partiellement composite.

Afin d’enrichir sa plateforme numérique documentant les innovations industrielles françaises et de mieux soutenir le développement d’Elixir Aircraft, la délégation de l’OAD a échangé avec des représentants des métiers clés de la production et du support client.

« En France, nous ne voyons pas la décarbonation comme une contrainte mais comme une opportunité. Une opportunité pour innover et pour conquérir de nouveaux marchés. Elixir Aircraft est un exemple parfait de réussite dans ces deux domaines.» a déclaré Damien Cazé.

« La visite officielle de la DGAC et de son Observatoire de l’Aviation Durable est une forme de concrétisation de dix ans de travail. Nous sommes désormais un avionneur identifié sur le marché mondial. Ce premier déplacement international de l’OAD nous rend très fiers de partager avec la DGAC la visibilité des ailes françaises dans le monde.» a déclaré Cyril Champenois, cofondateur et directeur des ventes d’Elixir Aircraft.

Premier montage sur avion de la turbine TP-R90 de Turbotech

Elixir Aircraft a réservé à cette visite officielle l’annonce du 1er montage de la turbine Turbotech TP-R90 sur avion. C’est une étape essentielle du projet BeautHyFuel, soutenu par le CORAC et la DGAC (Conseil pour la Recherche Aéronautique Civile), piloté par Elixir Aircraft et Turbotech, en partenariat avec Safran Aircraft Engines, Daher et Air Liquide.

Le démarrage du moteur intégré au prototype n°1 de l’Elixir a eu lieu à La Rochelle, en février 2025. Cet essai au sol fait suite aux premiers burns d’hydrogène liquide, démonstration au sol ayant eu lieu en septembre 2024, sur le Campus Technologies Grenoble d’Air Liquide et à la première campagne d’essais de qualification du moteur réalisée en janvier 2024 sur le site d’ArianeGroup à Vernon.

Un avion adaptable à tous les carburants

Certifiés depuis 2020, les avions Elixir représentent une flotte de 30 appareils de formation en Europe. Elixir Aircraft a choisi la fiabilité du moteur Rotax afin de répondre immédiatement aux besoins des écoles de pilotage. L’Elixir est un avion de 4e génération, le plus vertueux de sa catégorie, grâce à sa structure composite et sa faible consommation de 12 litres par heure.

Ainsi, Elixir Aircraft poursuit le développement technologique vers la décarbonation selon trois étapes :

La production actuelle d’avions à moteur thermique ultra frugaux, alimentés en carburant sans plomb, réduisant déjà de 70% les émissions de CO2.

Le développement de la turbine TP-R90 et son alimentation en carburant d’aviation durable (CAD ou SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel), dont le premier vol est prévu pour 2025. Cette version réduirait les émissions de CO2 de plus de 70%.

À plus long terme, la propulsion hydrogène de cette même turbine. Cette version réduirait les émissions de CO2 de 90%.

Le premier démarrage sur avion va valider la possibilité de certification de la turbine et sa sécurité de fonctionnement conformément aux exigences CS-23. Avec ce programme de recherche et sa recherche d’innovation permanente dans la conception de son avion de 4e génération, Elixir Aircraft se prépare pour l’avenir.

À propos d’Elixir Aircraft

The collaborative industry consortium has applied to the UK Advanced Fuels Fund, for support to accelerate its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project.

The GRAMM SAF project will catalyse decarbonisation of the UK aviation industry, while delivering significant economic benefits locally and nationally.

GRAMM’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel cuts carbon emissions fourfold beyond the UK SAF Mandate requirements. That enables the project to deliver 53.5% of the UK’s 2035 SAF target. Apart from its positive environmental impact, GRAMM says it will create 850 jobs in the North West, bringing economic revitalisation to communities that need it most.

Alexander Peschkoff, GRAMM consortium lead, said: “Advanced Fuels Fund support will propel UK sustainable aviation forward.

“Meeting a significant part of the UK aviation sector’s net zero obligations will establish GRAMM as a leading sustainable aviation fuel producer. This project also proves that decarbonisation can tackle climate challenges while driving regional economic growth.”

GRAMM’s vision has attracted strong industry backing, particularly from BioTfueL, a proven end-to-end technology platform developed by global energy leader TotalEnergies, technology licensor Axens, and industrial solutions provider, Thyssenkrupp.

The proposed location for the project is the Royal Port of Barrow, for which Associated British Ports (ABP) announced an ambitious development masterplan to create an advanced engineering cluster.

The port is also home to another GRAMM project partner, Centrica-owned Spirit Energy, which is planning to repurpose the depleted Morecambe Bay Gas Fields in Barrow into the MNZ carbon store.

Regional support for the GRAMM SAF project has been equally robust, with assistance from the North West Net Zero Hub, a regional programme dedicated to promoting investment in energy projects,Net Zero North West (NZNW), an industry-led collaboration driving industrial decarbonisation across the North West, and Enterprising Cumbria, the newly-established body working to boost economic development throughout Cumbria county.

James Johnsonb, head of regional programme, North West Net Zero Hub, said: “GRAMM has assembled a very strong consortium to progress their proposals for a first-of-a-kind large-scale SAF production facility.

“Support from the Aviation Fuel Fund, if approved, would help the project progress. The North West Net Zero Hub has been pleased to support GRAMM.

“We recognise the importance of the national policy framework for sustainable aviation fuel, and if successful, the GRAMM project could be a transformative opportunity for the North West, creating substantial job and supply chain opportunities throughout its delivery phases.”

Jane Gaston, CEO NZNW, said: “As the home to two of the UK’s airports, Net Zero North West recognised in our manifesto the importance of providing a resilient supply of significant volumes of sustainable fuel to support the aviation industry.

“Our own work in developing the North West Industrial Cluster Plan shows that the North West is uniquely placed to deliver transformational projects such as this. It’s, therefore, no surprise that GRAMM have chosen to target delivery of this project in our region.”

She added: “With a combination of expertise driven by our industry and the people who work there, our natural geological assets both on and off shore, and our transportation links, including our ports, this project could further enhance the £30bn pipeline of projects already identified across carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, renewables, nuclear and battery which will not only deliver significant carbon reductions, but, critically, support industry in the North West to continue to make a positive contribution to the UK’s economic growth whilst operating in a more sustainable way.”

The funding from the UK Advanced Fuels Fund, if the application is successful, will enable the GRAMM consortium to move from planning to implementation, making this project a reality.

On the other, our biofuels solutions enable ethanol plants to produce byproducts which could be monetised to ensure robust profitability.
Que: What has been Novonesis’ approach to working with ethanol producers, OMCs, and technology providers in India?
For the ethanol-to-jet-fuel route to SAF, Novonesis has solutions for increasing ethanol and by-product yields, and for the reduction of carbon intensity of bioethanol.","Que: Can you elaborate on the company’s journey, its global presence and its key contributions to the biofuels industry?

Ans: Novonesis is the result of the successful merger in 2024 between two leading Danish biosolutions leader - Novozymes, and Chr. Hansen. As a company, we prioritise having a global presence with local reach, enabling localised innovation that is suitable for the regions we operate in. We have close to 40 R&D and application centers around the world and over 20 manufacturing sites.

Novonesis’ pioneering research in biofuels is turning the promise of agricultural feedstocks including grains and biomass into tangible clean energy solutions. Our integrated solutions enable bioenergy producers to access the latest innovations and thereby be competitive, efficient, and above all, sustainable. Our biosolutions (enzymes and yeast) have helped the ethanol industry increase yield by over 3 percent all over the world in the recent past. These gains are accompanied by superior plant efficiency and lower energy consumption. Globally, our biosolutions have supported the reduction of >60 million tons of CO2 emissions annually. Through collaboration, we are nurturing an ecosystem that thrives on innovation and dedication to a greener future.

Our commitment extends beyond research, we continue to work hand-in-hand with technology providers, ethanol producers, and oil marketing companies to strengthen the biofuel ecosystem. Our goal is clear: to contribute significantly to India's energy security and the global pursuit of sustainability by extending our efforts across the farm-to-fuel value chain.

Que: Can you shed light on how Novonesis bioenergy solutions are being implemented in markets like the USA, and Brazil?

Ans: In the US and Brazil, growth has been driven by positive policy support, enhanced industrial capabilities and the use of cutting-edge technologies (including robust digitalization) to boost industrial yield and process efficiency. These markets are evolving towards advanced biorefining models that integrate the conversion process to produce fuel, energy, and chemicals. The success story of the Brazil bioenergy markets is particularly similar to that of India, wherein blending mandates by government have provided a fillip to the growth of the sector.

Within Brazil, Novonesis collaborates with a leading biofuels producer, Raizen, to produce 2G ethanol more efficiently. The partnership works to reduce the production cost, increase capacity and reduce the carbon intensity of biofuels to enable companies and countries to meet their global decarbonisation targets.

A significant way in which both Brazil and the US have been able to leverage bioenergy, is also the way in which they have diversified co-products of biofuels such as Distiller’s Corn Oil (DCO) which has its use cases in home and personal care products, as well as in the production of renewable diesel/biodiesel, and Distillers’ Dried Grain Solubles (DDGS), which is a useful source for animal nutrition. Both DCO and DDGS have been monetised significantly in the US and Brazil. Within India, DCO and high protein DDGS continue to be nascent and niche segments that hold tremendous potential.

Que: India has set ethanol blending targets under the National Policy on Biofuels. How is the company contributing to achieving these goals?

Ans: Novonesis innovations, particularly in relation to enzymes and yeast, aid in higher ethanol yield for ethanol producers, which, in turn, support the Government of India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP). In the context of grain based or 1G biofuels, we provide advanced enzymes and yeast solutions to optimise fermentation processes and enhance the conversion of starch-based grains into ethanol. These solutions are tailored to work across grain feedstocks such as rice, corn, sorghum and biomass feedstocks like rice straws, bagasse and bamboo – equipping ethanol plants with all avenues to produce biofuels basis availability/ accessibility and costs of these feedstocks.

There are two critical factors to solidify the biofuels program – ensuring feedstock availability and optimising producers’ profitability. We are proud to cater to both ends of the spectrum. On one side, Novonesis’ plant health solutions improve crop yield and thereby strengthens availability of feedstocks suited for biofuels production - enabling opportunity to support higher blending rates. On the other, our biofuels solutions enable ethanol plants to produce byproducts which could be monetised to ensure robust profitability. In addition, Novonesis is continuously strengthening its supply operations to cater to the exponential ongoing demand and the elevated projected elevated of Biosolutions – ensuring robust capacity utilisation and reliability of ethanol plants.

Our focus continues to be on further strengthening our first generation (1G) portfolio, while expanding our contributions in 2nd generation (2G) bioethanol production, utilising technological advancements and collaborations that enhance production efficiency.

Biodiesel is another critical biofuel that could be efficiently produced using advanced enzymes, even with alternating feedstocks. This allows for agile, cleaner and sustainable production processes. Our solutions are already being leveraged in producing biodiesel across India. By using innovative enzymes, we can also catalyse the conversion of oils and fats into biodiesel. Our enzymatic process offers a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to traditional chemical methods, thereby also furthering India’s sustainability and net-zero targets.

By driving the adoption of innovative bio-based technologies and fostering collaboration across various sectors, Novonesis is not only aiding in the global battle against climate change but also establishing benchmarks in the bioenergy sector that demonstrate how economic growth, and environmental stewardship can be seamlessly integrated. This approach positions Novonesis as a key player in reshaping energy strategies for a sustainable future, both in India and globally.

Que: What has been Novonesis’ approach to working with ethanol producers, OMCs, and technology providers in India?

Ans: We offer easy and seamless access to Novonesis technologies, supported by robust technical services to ethanol producers, to ensure that producers can maximise their plant’s potential. In our recent collaboration with a leading corn-based ethanol producer in South India (250 KLPD capacity), we were able to enable plant throughput improvements by 20 percent thereby supporting upto 2 percent increased yield in ethanol. The improved throughput and increased yield resulted in savings for the producer of approximately INR 4.5 crore per annum.

We also continuously evolve and fine-tune our portfolio to changing market and customer needs. For instance, with the introduction of corn as a feedstock for ethanol production, Novonesis has introduced an advanced portfolio so that producers get the best output from their investment. In conjunction with technology players, Novonesis has also been able to tailor enzyme blends for second generation (2G) ethanol production using feedstocks such as rice straws, bamboo, amongst others- a classic example of how we innovate and customise for local needs.

Finally, we partner across the value delivery ecosystem to complement each other’s strengths. We understand that our strength is also derived from our ability to partner effectively, and we therefore collaborate with like-minded, highly agile and solution-oriented companies to enable better reach for our most advanced biosolutions.

Que: How does your innovation Innova® Eclipse, enhance fermentation processes and bioethanol yield?

Ans: Our Innova range of yeast solutions are designed to deliver 2 percent+ ethanol yield, relative to standard market products, and offers reduction in glycerol and organic acids. Depending on the process needs, our Innova range could either fast-track fermentation, thereby allowing more ethanol production without adding commensurate fermentation capacities or improve throughput with more complete fermentations.

In essence, our Innova range of products helps ethanol producers improve substrate and carbon conversion efficiency to consistently increase ethanol yields (+1-2 percent with up to 40 percent less glycerol), improve plant throughput and achieve more complete fermentations with industry leading tolerance to fermentation stressors.

Que: Is Novonesis exploring any advancements in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other next-gen biofuels beyond 1G and 2G ethanol?

Ans: Beyond 1G and 2G ethanol, our solutions are well established in biodiesel and renewable diesel production and are being leveraged globally. Biosolutions drive values in today’s biofuels industry but can also be a platform for opening new value streams in SAF, bio-derived chemicals and maritime fuel.

In relation to SAF, there are currently multiple pathways towards the transition to SAF, each of which has increasing relevance for Novonesis technologies. In the context of SAF from vegetable and waste oils (HEFA: currently the most mature technology for SAF at scale), Novonesis provides the biosolution to pretreat Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOGs) with enzymes, preparing them for conversion by chemical catalysis to jet fuel. For the ethanol-to-jet-fuel route to SAF, Novonesis has solutions for increasing ethanol and by-product yields, and for the reduction of carbon intensity of bioethanol. Novonesis is also exploring alternative biological routes to chemical intermediates that may be suitable to produce SAF, and other chemicals needed in refineries and downstream processes.

Global datacenter power demand to double by 2030 on AI surge: IEA

According to an April 10 report by the International Energy Agency, global electricity demand from datacenters is projected to more than double to 945 TWh by 2030. This increase, driven largely by the rise of AI, is comparable to Japan's current total power consumption. In the US, datacenters are anticipated to consume more electricity for data processing than all energy-intensive manufacturing sectors combined by 2030, including industries such as aluminum and cement.

Renewable energy sources and natural gas are expected to meet much of this demand, and the rapid growth of AI presents challenges and opportunities for the energy sector. Despite the anticipated surge in electricity consumption, the report suggested that the emissions impact of AI could be mitigated if the technology facilitates emissions reductions across various sectors.

Pakistan SAF technology developments are positioning the agricultural-rich nation as a potential dark horse in Asia’s race toward aviation decarbonisation. As Asian airlines face mounting pressure to reduce emissions amid global climate imperatives, Pakistan’s unique approach of converting agricultural waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could offer a regional model worth examining.

Converting an environmental problem into economic opportunity

The smog that blankets major Pakistani and neighbouring Indian cities each harvest season has become an annual crisis, driven largely by the burning of agricultural residue. The practice, particularly prevalent in Punjab province, releases particulate matter that compromises air quality across borders.

However, this challenge presents a technological opportunity that Pakistan’s emerging SAF sector aims to capitalise on. “Crop residues burned during both winter and summer in Pakistan represent an underutilised resource with immense potential for SAF production,” noted experts in an April 2025 report by The Express Tribune, highlighting a practical technological solution to an entrenched environmental issue.

The technology equation

Pakistan SAF technology implementation focuses on two principal conversion methods, each suited to different agricultural inputs:

Hydroprocessing Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): For lipid-based feedstocks including used cooking oil and non-edible oils

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ): Optimised for converting sugar-based inputs like wheat straw and rice husks

The technologies produce aviation fuels chemically identical to conventional jet fuel, requiring no aircraft modifications, and deliver substantially improved carbon profiles. A third technology using carbon dioxide capture remains in development but holds promise for further emissions reductions. Dr Adeel Ghayur, described by The Express Tribune as an “eminent energy scientist and expert in circular economy,” indicated that commercial SAF technologies can scale from 100,000 to one million tonnes of annual production capacity, with corresponding economic impacts.

Asia’s first private SAF project

The December 2024 announcement of a $121 million SAF facility in Sheikhupura represented a milestone not just for Pakistan but for all of Asia. According to Pakistan Today, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has committed $86.2 million to the project, with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) providing $35 million. What makes this development particularly noteworthy in the Asian context is its designation by the ADB as “the first private sector-led SAF project in Asia and the Pacific,” excluding China.

For a region where state involvement typically dominates energy infrastructure, this private-sector approach merits attention from investors and policymakers across Asia. The facility is operated by SAFCO Venture Holdings Limited and owned by Taimur Shaikh and Ali Shaikh, and presents compelling environmental and economic metrics: projected annual production of 200,000 tonnes of SAF, reduction of 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide yearly, creation of 300 direct jobs, and facilitation of approximately 20,000 indirect employment opportunities in the supply chain and tertiary industries.

The regional competitiveness question

While Pakistan’s SAF ambitions are technologically sound, important questions remain about its competitiveness in an Asian market where Singapore, Japan, and South Korea have already established advanced biofuel capabilities.

The price difference remains substantial, with SAF currently commanding approximately $2,500 per metric tonne versus $700 for conventional jet fuel. For price-sensitive Asian carriers navigating post-pandemic recovery, this cost gap presents significant challenges to adoption.

Dr. Ghayur said in The Express Tribune that “strengthening R&D is essential for Pakistan to remain competitive in the global SAF market, secure its position as a hub for innovation, and maintain leadership as SAF adoption rises across Asia.” The acknowledgement reflects awareness of the technological race underway in the region.

For Asian nations with similar agricultural profiles – Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia – Pakistan’s SAF initiative offers a potential template for converting agricultural waste into aviation biofuels and addresses seasonal air pollution events. The multiplicative benefits – enhanced energy security, emissions reductions, rural economic opportunities, and foreign direct investment – align with development priorities across South and Southeast Asia.

Four-dimensional solution

Pakistan SAF technology implementation addresses four interconnected challenges that resonate in developing Asian economies:

Energy security: Reducing petroleum import dependence via domestic production

Economic development: Creating value-added manufacturing with substantial job creation potential

Foreign direct investment: Attracting capital for industrial-scale bioprocessing operations

Environmental mitigation: Addressing agricultural burning emissions and aviation carbon footprints

Critical path forward

For Pakistan’s SAF sector to achieve its potential, several hurdles will need to be surmounted. First, continued investment beyond the initial Sheikhupura facility will be necessary to achieve meaningful scale. Second, as SAF technologies evolve, Pakistan will need to maintain technological competitiveness through sustained R&D investment. Finally, efficiency improvements in agricultural waste collection and transportation will be essential to maintain favourable economics.

The byproduct potential enhances the business case further, with SAFCO’s facility projected to produce 18,000 tonnes of bionaphtha annually for sustainable plastics production, according to Pakistan Today.

As Dr Ghayur concluded in The Express Tribune, “The comprehensive policy roadmap will serve as both a blueprint and a catalyst to propel Pakistan to the forefront of the global SAF revolution.”

While significant challenges remain in scaling production, optimising costs, and matching competitive alternatives, Pakistan’s SAF technology trajectory represents a distinctive approach to circular economy implementation with potential regional application across all of Asia’s agricultural economies.",https://techwireasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dreamy-robin-6QpvHGaXFhg-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 13:56:46.926243

Pakistan has rare opportunity to transform an environmental problem – crop waste burning – into a solution that addresses multiple national challenges.","With abundant agricultural residue and new investment, Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel sector offers a promising pathway to reduce emissions and create thousands of jobs.

As the morning sun rises over Punjab’s golden fields, farmers continue a generations-old practice: burning vast swathes of crop stubble to prepare for the next planting season. The flames, while clearing fields efficiently, send plumes of smoke into the sky, adding to Pakistan’s challenges around its air quality. But what if these agricultural leftovers – “waste” products – could instead power the jets crossing the country’s skies?

Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel production from crop waste isn’t just an environmental daydream. According to economic and energy experts, alongside ecological activists, it represents a tangible pathway for Pakistan to transform its vast agricultural abundance into a position of leadership in the rapidly expanding sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market.

The untapped potential of agricultural waste

Every year, millions of tonnes of crop residue are burned in Pakistan’s agricultural regions, particularly in Punjab. The practice, primarily employed to clear fields for the next planting season, creates significant air pollution and wastes valuable biomass resources.

According to experts quoted byThe Express Tribune, these residues – including rice husks, wheat straw, and bagasse – represent an underutilised resource with “immense potential for SAF production.”

A four-pronged solution

The development of Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure offers a unique approach to address four important national challenges simultaneously:

Enhanced energy security: By producing aviation fuel domestically from agricultural waste, Pakistan could reduce its dependence on imported petroleum products.

Large-scale economic activity: Commercial SAF facilities can generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs. Dr Adeel Ghayur, an “eminent energy scientist and expert in circular economy,” explained that larger refineries “require multi billion-dollar investments but have the potential to generate thousands of […] jobs, boosting economic activity in their regions.”

Foreign direct investment: The growing global demand for SAF presents significant investment opportunities. According to Pakistan Today’s December 2024 report, the recent $121 million financing deal for Pakistan’s first SAF facility in Sheikhupura – supported by the Asian Development Bank ($86.2 million) and the International Finance Corporation ($35 million) – demonstrates viability.

Environmental benefits: Converting crop waste to SAF addresses two environmental problems simultaneously: reducing air pollution from crop burning and decreasing aviation carbon emissions. The aviation industry and the scientific community consider that SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The technology behind SAF

Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel production relies primarily on two key technologies:

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA): Used for lipid-based feedstocks like used cooking oil, animal fats, and non-edible vegetable oils.

Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ): Best suited for sugar-based feedstocks like wheat straw, rice husks, and bagasse waste.

The technologies produce “drop-in” fuels that are fully-compatible with existing jet engines and aviation infrastructure. A third emerging technology that utilises carbon dioxide as feedstock shows promise but is not yet commercially available.

Economic viability and market potential for Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel sector

While SAF currently commands a premium price – approximately $2,500 per metric tonne compared to $700 for conventional aviation fuel – regulatory frameworks globally are increasingly mandating its use.

Dr Ghayur told the Express Tribune that commercial SAF technologies offer production capacities ranging from 100,000 tonnes to one million tonnes annually.

The SAFCO Venture Holdings Limited facility in Sheikhupura is expected to produce 200,000 tons of SAF annually, according to Pakistan Today, and demonstrates the scalability of such projects.

The facility is projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 500,000 tonnes each year and create approximately 300 direct jobs and an estimated 20,000 indirect jobs in the waste-to-fuel value chain, as detailed in the same report.

The path forward: A strategic approach

For Pakistan to capitalise fully on its sustainable aviation fuel potential, experts recommend a comprehensive strategy focused on:

Attract foreign investment: Building on the success of projects like the Sheikhupura facility to bring in additional capital and expertise.

Knowledge and infrastructure development: Equipping local industries with the necessary capabilities to participate in SAF production and distribution.

Indigenous R&D capabilities: In his interview with The Express Tribune, Dr. Ghayur emphasised that “strengthening R&D is essential for Pakistan to remain competitive in the global SAF market, secure its position as a hub for innovation, and maintain leadership as SAF adoption rises across Asia.”

As global aviation fuel demand exceeds 250 million metric tonnes annually and mandates for SAF usage increase in the European Union, United Kingdom, and United States, Pakistan faces a limited window to establish itself in this growing market.

The successful development of Pakistan’s first SAF facility, described as “the first private sector-led SAF project in Asia and the Pacific” by the ADB, marks a significant first step.The facility will not only produce SAF but also 18,000 tons of bio naphtha annually, a raw material for sustainable plastic production.

Pakistan has rare opportunity to transform an environmental problem – crop waste burning – into a solution that addresses multiple national challenges.

With appropriate investment, policy support, and strategic planning, Pakistan can use its agricultural abundance to become a significant player in the global green aviation transition and create domestic economic growth and better environmental conditions.

As Dr. Ghayur concludes, “The comprehensive policy roadmap will serve as both a blueprint and a catalyst to propel Pakistan to the forefront of the global SAF revolution.”",https://sustainability-news.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/linkan-yadav-B45__9a17ss-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 11:57:21.506898

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions.","Scientists and aviation leaders including Airbus are studying how to reduce aircraft non-CO₂ emissions. Options include operational contrail avoidance, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and in the longer term, hydrogen propulsion. What are the most promising projects?

Non-CO₂ warming effects could be as significant as CO₂ in aviation’s total climate impact. However, non-CO₂ emissions aren’t yet regulated in the same way. Scientists and industry leaders including Airbus are studying ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions.

Discussions are heating up over whether and how to regulate non-CO₂ emissions. It is a major aviation policy debate that affects airlines, governments and climate targets, as well as air traffic management due to scheduling and capacity constraints.

What are contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions, and why do they matter?

Burning jet fuel always creates both carbon dioxide (CO₂) and non-CO₂ emissions. In certain conditions, water vapour and some non-CO₂ emissions such as soot or other particulate matters combine to form condensation trails. Commonly known as contrails, these are the white streaks visible behind aircraft at altitude.

On average, contrails heat the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. However, some contrails can have a cooling effect, depending on when and where they form and how long they last. It’s thought that a relatively small number of flights create the majority of warming contrails.

The overall climate impact of non-CO₂ emissions is complex and hard to measure. Scientists are still working to fully understand their long-term effects.

What is the aviation industry doing about contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions?

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions. They are using different fuel types (SAF, hydrogen), propulsion technologies and operational mitigation. The latter involves modifying flight paths in real time to avoid areas where warming contrails are most likely to form.

Airbus is working with scientists, policymakers and the wider aviation industry on some 20 projects linked to these mitigation concepts. Some are funded externally while others are funded internally or with specific partners willing to share the cost of the project with Airbus.

The projects fall into three broad categories:

Studying contrails and testing fuel alternatives, including sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen. Projects include PACIFIC and CRYSTAL, which were announced at the Airbus Summit 2025. Both continue Airbus’ research into fuel compositions using A350 and A220 aircraft.

Operational avoidance: Exploring optimisation of flight paths to minimise persistent contrails. Live projects include CICONIA, which focuses on forecasting contrail-prone weather, climate impact modelling, and on defining the best concept of operations. CICONIA's early results indicate that, assuming appropriate procedures are put in place, operational mitigation could be applied to many flights, thus effectively reducing their contrails impact, and without significant air traffic disturbance.

New technologies: Investing in hydrogen-powered flight and innovative propulsion systems. Live projects include Blue Condor, whose flight test results are due in late 2025. Blue Condor is a joint project between Airbus and the German Aerospace Centre DLR. Of the seven test flights, four resulted in the formation of contrails from the hydrogen engine. The aim of the investigations was to compare their microphysical properties with those of conventional contrails.

Promising technologies including humidity sensors could help aircraft to avoid weather conditions favourable to contrail formation. Humidity sensors feed weather forecasting models, so flights can benefit from improved forecasts of conditions favourable to contrail formation. Yet like climate impact models, they are in their infancy.

Nonetheless, the projects and collaborations led by Airbus and its partners are helping to accelerate the development of mitigation strategies for non-CO2 emissions and subsequent integration into flight operations.",https://www.airbus.com/sites/g/files/jlcbta136/files/styles/airbus_608x608/public/2025-04/contrails_a350.png?itok=GT4OaLsS,N,,2025-04-14 11:57:42.000614

Potential applications for this nanomaterial span aerospace, automotive, and robotics, promising new pathways for lightweight, high-performance components. The project is supported by Chinese investment, with a Chinese company set to commercialize the product.

“They see that maybe they can do something greener and more sustainable using Malaysia’s biomass resources,” Dr. Tan added.

Meanwhile, a second team is focusing on upcycling palm oil biodiesel byproducts. In partnership with colleagues from Xiamen University’s main campus in China, researchers are converting crude glycerol—a common waste product—into 1,3-propanediol through microbial fermentation. This high-value compound is a precursor for polyester resin, which is used in fabrics, carpets, and other consumer goods.

“This bio-based process is a much greener alternative to traditional chemical methods,” said Dr. Tan Jian Ping, Assistant Professor at Xiamen University Malaysia.

These innovations are aligned with Malaysia’s broader push toward a sustainable green economy, utilizing local resources and advanced research to reduce environmental impact and create economic opportunities. By combining local biomass with Chinese technological and financial backing, Malaysia is positioning itself as a hub for next-generation green materials in Asia.

These initiatives not only advance Malaysia’s scientific capabilities but also serve as tangible examples of international cooperation driving sustainable development.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biomass-1.jpeg,N,,2025-04-14 09:56:28.549823

However, according to Achampong, the conversation around fuel procurement has shifted dramatically to prioritise availability and sustainability.
“Fuel is at the top, and you have to ensure your fuel procurement is much more resilient against several factors,” he says.
“You need to consider sustainable aviation fuel, even though it’s in shorter supply,” Achampong says, emphasising the advantage held by supply chain leaders who reliably source these scarce resources.
From price obsession to supply security Before COVID-19, aviation procurement was largely driven by cost savings.","Resilience takes centre stage

Achampong emphasises that the era of viewing procurement merely as a transactional function—focused primarily on cost—is definitively over. “The push for procurement leaders right now is to make sure they’re able to instil a bit of resilience in the organisation,” says Achampong. “Procurement supply chain leaders need to make organisations more resilient to withstand disruptions.”

According to Achampong, the pandemic sharply exposed the aviation industry’s vulnerabilities because it wasn’t limited to geographic disruptions. Instead, the crisis reshaped the procurement landscape entirely. “COVID was a universal disruption, which meant it didn’t matter whether you focused your supply chain in China or not; the whole world was disrupted, so you couldn’t have really mitigated it,” he explains.

Yet, the subsequent crises highlighted the need to protect aviation organisations against repeated disruptions even more clearly. Achampong adds, “After COVID, you had the Suez crisis and the Ukraine war. Everyone realised that you won’t avoid disruptions if they happen. You must ensure your organisation is as cushioned as possible.”

Today, procurement departments are evaluated not merely by their cost efficiencies but by how quickly and effectively they can respond to unexpected disruptions. Achampong points out that the real test of resilience is recovery time, stating, “The key is that well-prepared organisations don’t necessarily get affected by unforeseen events as materially as others, and are able to recover the quickest.”

This strategic shift toward resilience in aviation is particularly critical because the consequences of procurement failures are immediate and severe. Achampong illustrates this vividly, “Every category of spending can ground an aircraft. If you have a catering shock on a long-haul flight, you won’t take off because you can’t.”

Fuel procurement becomes a balancing act

Among all procurement challenges faced by aviation leaders, none is more critical—or complex—than fuel. Traditionally fuel has been viewed primarily through the lens of cost control. However, according to Achampong, the conversation around fuel procurement has shifted dramatically to prioritise availability and sustainability.

As Achampong explains, fuel remains aviation’s largest expenditure and places enormous pressure on procurement departments to safeguard supply. “Fuel is at the top, and you have to ensure your fuel procurement is much more resilient against several factors,” he says. “One of them is price, but the other one is availability, and then sustainability.”

Today, the aviation industry is increasingly driven by commitments to sustainability, bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into sharper focus. However, securing supplies of SAF remains a significant procurement hurdle. “You need to consider sustainable aviation fuel, even though it’s in shorter supply,” Achampong says, emphasising the advantage held by supply chain leaders who reliably source these scarce resources. “The smarter supply chain directors are the ones who are able to secure a regular supply of some sort of sustainable aviation fuel so they can demonstrate sustainable intentions.”

Yet, Achampong highlights that the challenge of fuel procurement goes beyond sustainability alone. Price shocks remain an ever-present threat, and managing this volatility is crucial for airlines’ survival. “You’ll always have an element of supply. But how will you control the costs?” Achampong asks, underscoring that “a huge part of resilience is how resilient you are to price shocks because they have a material effect on your organisation.”

The pandemic and subsequent disruptions intensified the scrutiny placed on fuel procurement, forcing airlines to rethink their strategies entirely. The most successful procurement leaders are those who can secure consistent and sustainable fuel supplies and anticipate and adapt rapidly to market fluctuations. Achampong argues this agility is a defining factor for competitive advantage in today’s aviation landscape.

From price obsession to supply security

Before COVID-19, aviation procurement was largely driven by cost savings. Yet the pandemic dramatically reshaped priorities, triggering an urgent shift from cost reduction to securing stable supply chains. Achampong emphasises how drastically these conversations have changed.

“Speaking to chief procurement officers and airline supply chain directors there’s a marked change in the conversation,” Achampong says. “People are not talking about pricing anymore. All they care about is supply.”

As suppliers faced new pressures and disruptions, procurement leaders quickly discovered that low prices were irrelevant if critical components weren’t available. Achampong describes this new reality, “In some cases, the supply isn’t there, so it’s about who’s able to get guarantees for that supply. Regular supply became key. Price hasn’t gone out the window, but the consideration is, ‘Well, it doesn’t matter how much it costs—can we actually get it?’”

The lesson from recent disruptions, Achampong argues, reinforced the necessity of strong, strategic supplier relationships. Organisations that had prioritised these connections emerged stronger and recovered faster. He highlights a striking statistic from recent surveys by CIPS, “During COVID, around 60% of organisations did not know their goods would be supplied late until they arrived late. There’s only one reason for that—they didn’t have strategic relationships with their strategic suppliers.”

Achampong draws an instructive historical parallel to illustrate the importance of these relationships. Recalling the competitive edge held by Japanese automakers decades ago, he explains, “The interesting thing was just one simple insight: the Japanese companies treated their suppliers as partners. That’s where the whole concept of Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) came from.”

He firmly believes that adopting a partnership-oriented approach, as opposed to adversarial interactions dominated by price negotiations, provides lasting benefits. “Rather than having a standoffish relationship with your supplier—having a contract and beating them up about price—you put in place measures to ensure you have a strategic relationship,” Achampong says.

But how can aviation companies practically implement SRM? Achampong outlines clear steps, “First, ensure you have lines of communication at different levels—managerial level, senior management level, and board level—between the two organisations. Then, have regular meetings and align on strategy, branding, and innovation. Organisations must work in tandem rather than apart.”

This alignment not only prepares companies to withstand disruptions but also fosters collaborative innovation and mutual growth. Achampong notes that when crises strike, “You’re helping each other. It’s not a standoff. During something like a pandemic, everyone’s losing money, so instead of sending your suppliers letters demanding discounts, you sit down together and ask, ‘How can we to get through this together?’”

When asked if aviation in the Middle East excels in this area, Achampong offers measured optimism, especially in critical sectors, “In certain sectors, such as fuel, the strategic relationships are practically there. Whether individual airlines have perfected this approach across the board is less clear, but the principles are the same.”

Core procurement principles reaffirmed

Amid the unprecedented disruptions of recent years, aviation procurement strategies might appear dramatically transformed. Yet, according to Achampong the fundamentals of effective procurement haven’t changed—instead, their value has been powerfully reaffirmed.

“Procurement has always been surrounded by supplier relationship management, contract management, and category management. These aren’t just technical terms—they’re critical,” he emphasises. Achampong notes that companies hit hardest by COVID-19 often neglected these basics, particularly the critical principle of maintaining strategic supplier relationships.

Achampong also addresses misconceptions around procurement philosophies such as ‘just-in-time’ (JIT). Despite common belief, he clarifies that JIT was never meant as a universal approach. “No one ever advocated ‘just-in-time’ as a broad-brush statement—certainly not us,” he explains. “It’s a concept that’s relevant when it’s relevant. If you’re securing medical supplies, you wouldn’t apply a just-in-time philosophy. It simply doesn’t make sense.”

The pandemic revealed that organisations adhering closely to foundational procurement principles—like diversifying their supply chains and proactively managing risk— were best prepared to absorb and swiftly recover from disruptions. As Achampong emphasises, “Risk management or risk mitigation is a key part of your procurement strategy. Having that in place would have allowed you to emerge from COVID much quicker than others.”

Tech and AI’s role in procurement

While AI-driven solutions hold promise, Achampong notes that the industry has yet to witness a fully end-to-end automated procurement system that delivers.

Nonetheless, Achampong acknowledges substantial progress in specialised AI applications, particularly in areas such as category management and supplier analysis. “There are some excellent AI tools capable of selecting suppliers from myriad places or analysing large chunks of data to achieve the right commercial outcome,” he says.

He also highlights blockchain technology’s increasing importance, especially within aviation’s highly sensitive supply chains. “Blockchain technology helps traceability of all sorts of goods,” Achampong points out, citing aviation’s intricate catering supply chain as a key example. “For example, airlines like catering firms who own farms in Australia where cattle are raised specifically for first-class catering. Digital tools enhance traceability and efficiency, which is critical in maintaining quality and compliance.”

Yet Achampong is clear that real innovation typically occurs within the supplier base itself, emphasising the importance of robust partnerships. “Largely, technology sits with the partners rather than the airlines or OEMs,” he observes. “If your relationships are strong, you encourage your partners to develop solutions—including technological ones—that overcome problems or make your processes more efficient.”

Bridging the talent gap

As aviation procurement races toward resilience, strategic relationships, and digital innovation, one challenge remains: talent.

“The talent gap in procurement and supply chain is huge,” says Achampong. “There’s a huge demand for procurement and supply chain personnel, but not just anyone—organisations are looking specifically for professionals who have experience, qualifications, or ideally both.”

Achampong highlights a striking reality revealed through CIPS’ annual salary surveys: qualified procurement professionals consistently command a premium in the job market. “There’s about a 30% salary differential between people doing the same roles who are qualified procurement professionals and those who aren’t,” he notes. “Companies recognise the significant impact a procurement professional can have.”

To address this talent gap, CIPS has actively collaborated with regional airlines to nurture and expand procurement expertise. Achampong shares successful examples, such as the partnership with Emirates Flight Catering, “Kieran Dowd, who runs procurement at Emirates Flight Catering, is very invested in developing his people’s capability to ensure they add value strategically, not just transactionally.”

Similarly, Achampong references Etihad Airways’ pioneering approach by describing how the airline group created the region’s first dedicated procurement academy, “Etihad had the first academy covering all Etihad Airways-affiliated companies. Procurement personnel from all their airlines came to Abu Dhabi to go through this academy.”

These dedicated academies and training initiatives play a crucial role in closing the skills gap. “We’ve probably got about 25 study centres across the region,” Achampong says. “Our mission is simple: we aim to build the procurement and supply chain talent pool. We do this by licensing centres to teach our globally recognised curriculum and by working closely with corporate organisations.”

Procurement priorities in aviation

Looking ahead, procurement leaders in aviation face a landscape shaped by volatility, uncertainty, and the relentless pursuit of efficiency. Ultimately, procurement’s future success lies not in reactive crisis management but in proactive foresight. “The procurement leaders you don’t hear about are the most effective,” Achampong concludes. “They are quietly mitigating risks, managing costs, and positioning their organisations to thrive no matter what comes next.”",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/04/14/Untitled-1200-x-900-px-2025-04-14T150854.784.png,N,,2025-04-14 08:56:13.194979

S&P Global Ratings' Christa Clapp and Alexandra Dimitrijevic explain how investors can get a consistent picture

Environmental Finance: What impact do you see geopolitical headwinds having on companies' progress towards climate transition and resilience?

Alexandra Dimitrijevic: The CERAWeek conference in Houston in March is always a good place to take the temperature of the energy markets, and one of the key phrases we heard there was 'climate pragmatism'. Since the Glasgow COP in 2021 and the invasion of Ukraine a few months later, global priorities around energy have shifted from decarbonisation towards security and affordability.

There is also a link here to artificial intelligence. AI is not only critical in terms of technological competition, it is also critical for security. It also brings additional demand for energy to power data centres. Meanwhile, there is enormous need in emerging markets for more energy, and for that energy to be affordable.

This focus on the need for secure, additional and affordable energy means the energy transition is going to take longer. But it is also important to note that climate change isn't going away. Companies recognise this, and are placing an increased focus on adaptation and resilience in the face of growing physical risks.

EF: Transition financing has, thus far, lagged behind other parts of the sustainable debt market. Why do you think that has been the case?

Christa Clapp: The challenge is that there are very different starting points and paces of transition in different parts of the world, depending on natural resources, politics and how they prioritise the trilemma of security, affordability and decarbonisation. That means that investors do not have an agreed definition of a credible transition. That has made it difficult for companies and governments to raise transition finance.

In response, we have developed a Climate Transition Assessment (CTA) that applies our Shades of Green approach to offer a globally consistent picture. Our scale runs from dark green, for activities aligned with net zero by the middle of the century, down to red, for activities that are inconsistent with or likely to impede the net-zero transition, such as direct fossil fuel investment.

The Shades of Green scale also addresses regional differentiation. For example, we assessed Rwanda's Sustainable Finance Framework last year. We shaded its financing for the use of liquified petroleum gas for cooking as light green. In other regions, we wouldn't have judged the use of fossil fuel for cooking as light green but, in Rwanda, it delivers carbon reductions compared with the current practice of using wood, as well as significant improvements in indoor air quality. The Shades of Green scale thus allows global comparisons of regionally specific progress towards transition.

EF: How does your Climate Transition Assessment address issues with credibility and transparency?

CC: A lot of companies have long-term net-zero targets, but investors find it difficult to understand how credible those targets are. In addition to companies' long-term targets, the CTA focuses on the specific near-term actions, over the next five to 10 years, that companies are taking to put themselves on a pathway to meet their ambitions. What policies are they implementing? How are they engaging with their supply chains? Are they relying on developments, such as in sustainable aviation fuel, that might not deliver at the scale necessary?

We then apply our shading to look at companies' existing revenues and business models – it might be a carbon-intensive firm shaded yellow or orange, for example.

We examine their near-term actions and investment plans to project that shading forward to the future, to consider whether they are credibly moving to greener business models. Again, that provides a globally consistent assessment of a company's planned transition.

EF: How are market participants applying the CTA?

CC: Every investor has its own mandate, risk tolerance and approach to managing sustainability in its portfolio. When an investor is looking at the early stages of the transition of heavy emitting industries, for example, it might be comfortable holding yellow or orange companies, whereas another might be focused on the greener part of the spectrum: the CTA provides them with the transparency and lets them decide how to apply it.

We're also seeing some companies use the CTA in their annual reports, to publicly share our assessment of the progress of their transition, while we are seeing lenders use the CTA as an element in their lending assessments.

The CTA is also being used in green equity designation programmes at three exchanges – NASDAQ, B3 in Brazil and SIX Swiss Exchange. These programmes identify listed companies that meet green criteria, largely based on the World Federation of Exchanges' Green Equity Principles, but with local specificities. If one of their listed companies is interested in having a green label, we apply our shading to their revenues and investment plans, and provide a CTA report – and, if it meets the requirements, the exchange can give it greater visibility.

It's an interesting space to watch. It's a pretty nascent market, but I can see parallels with how the green bond market started, in that it provided a very visible way of identifying a green company. It began slowly but soon snowballed. We're very interested in contributing to transparency in this emerging area.

Muss sie auch sein, denn genau das ist ihr Job: Dafür zu sorgen, dass auf die Minute genau der Flieger abhebt, mit einem Service, der nichts zu wünschen übrig lässt. Und zwar dorthin, wohin es der Kunde wünscht - und sei es bis ans Ende der Welt. Seit zehn Jahren organisiert die Geschäftsfrau aus Bergisch-Gladbach mit ihrem Luftfahrtexperten-Team von ""PAS- flights"" maßgeschneiderte Flüge. Und das 24/7.

Flugzeuge im Bauch

Flugzeuge im Bauch hatte Birte Kipke schon seit ihrer Kindheit. Dass sie sich einmal beruflich in die Welt des Fliegens begeben würde, das stand für sie schon lange fest. Die Leidenschaft dafür lag eindeutig in der Familie, genauer gesagt beim Vater. Denn wenn er nach Hause kam, hatte der Hobbypilot und Geschäftsführer großer Fluggesellschaften immer die große, weite Welt im Gepäck. Heute ist Birte Kipke (53) Geschäftsführerin der ""PAS-Professional Aviation Solutions GmbH"". Das Unternehmen ist 9001-ISO-zertifiziert und neben Deutschland weltweit mit Standorten u.a. in Italien, der Schweiz, Portugal, der Türkei, Malta sowie Singapur vertreten.

Emanzipation

Mehr als zehn Jahre ist es her, dass Birte sich vom mächtigen Broker-Übervater in London gelöst hatte, um schließlich nach einer kurzen Auszeit als Mitgesellschafterin und Geschäftsführerin von ""PASflights"" einzusteigen. Doch wofür steht das Unternehmen? ""Dafür, dasss wir den perfekten Flug organisieren"", antwortet die Geschäftsfrau prompt. Und perfekt ist für sie all das, was maßgeschneidert und mit der notwendigen Sicherheit und Transparenz auf die persönlichen Kundenwünsche abgestimmt ist.

Das gewisse Etwas

Sie möchten ihre Mitarbeiter mit einem extravaganten Flug belohnen? Oder Sie sind selbst der Star mit einem eng getakteten Eventkalender? Vielleicht brauchen Sie als Erstligist die nötige Ruhe und Konzentration zur Vorbereitung aufs nächste Spiel? Manchmal auch müssen Menschen aus Erdbebengebieten geborgen, Geflüchtete in Sicherheit gebracht werden…? Ist das der Fall, kommen Charterflüge ins Spiel. Und die organisiert ""PASflights"" ganz nach Bedarf.

Gut gemacht ...

Schulterklopfen, lobende Worte und als Prämie einen Charterflug. Viele Firmen, darunter große Banken und Versicherungen, greifen zur Belohnung gerne auch mal tief in die Tasche, um besonders erfolgreiche Mitarbeiter zu belohnen. Ein Charterflug ist dann genau das richtige. ""Incentives zeigen die Wertschätzung für den Mitarbeiter"", weiß Kipke aus Erfahrung. ""Das kommt immer sehr gut an."" Das Erlebnis beginnt bereits am Flughafen. ""Der erste und der letzte Eindruck, das sind wir"", verweist die Chefin auf die 24/7-Selbstverpflichtung.

Eine gute und ausreichende Betreuung ist ebenso wichtig wie die persönliche Boardansprache, Catering, Boardgetränke in den Farben der Firma oder auch gebrandete Kopfstützen. ""Nur wenn gewünscht"", schränkt Birte Kipke ein. ""Manche mögen's lieber inkognito.""

Ben Stiller & Co.

Natürlich - auch dieses Image stimmt: Promis chartern gerne, denn für sie ist Zeit Geld. Lange Wartezeiten, Verspätung oder Flugausfälle können sie sich nicht leisten. Bei eng getakteten Auftritten soll wenigstens die Reise stressfrei sein. Der US-amerikanische Schauspieler und Filmproduzent Ben Stiller, Olympia-Sieger Florian Hambüchen und Eishockey-Legende Felix Schütz wissen es zu schätzen, wenn sie erholt aus dem Flieger ins nächste Abenteuer steigen können. Und nicht nur sie. Für Manager, die morgens zum Meeting nach Mailand müssen und abends zum Event nach Berlin, gibt es nur eine Alternative zu Linienflügen: Sie müssen chartern.

Die andere Seite

Was Chartergesellschaften alles leisten, haben sie in der Coronazeit gezeigt und zeigen sie immer wieder bei Flügen in Katastrophengebiete. Um die Menschen aus dem Erdbebengebiet von Nepal zu holen, hatten die Deutsche Regi rung und SOS International über ""PASflights"" technisch besonders ausgestattete Maschinen mit extra geschulten Piloten gebucht, die unter erschwerten Bedingungen in den engen, von Bergen umgebenen Flughafen von Kathmandu fliegen konnten.

Auch für Flüge in den Sudan, um Flüchtlingsfamilien an Bord zu holen, wird ""PAS- flights"" seit Jahren angefragt. ""Diese Aufträge können nur Fluggesellschaften mit einer Kriegs-Risiko-Versicherung annehmen"", klärt Kipke auf. ""Manche Airlines sind so feinfühlig, dass sie sogar Extras für Babys und Kleinkinder organisieren"", sagt sie anerkennend. Dass ihr Expertenteam auch Linienflüge als Zubringer für Charterflüge organisiert hatte, um Arbeitern in der Coronazeit die Rückkehr von den Ölplattformen nach Hause zu ermöglichen, darauf ist die 53-Jährige besonders stolz. ""In Saudi-Arabien beispielsweise hatten alle Flughäfen geschlossen"", erzählt sie. ""Die Menschen hätten ansonsten ein ganzes Jahr auf den Plattformen verbringen müssen.""

Die Coronazeit war aber auch eine Zeit, in der die Nachfrage nach Privatjets boomte. Denn wer mit seinem Tier zum Ferienhaus oder zum Zweitwohnsitz ins Ausland wollte, hatte keine andere Chance. ""Man braucht schon ein sehr gutes Netzwerk"", sagt sie. Das hat sie - und muss es haben im Hinblick auf die vielfältigen Aufgaben, die ihr Expertenteam zu bewältigen hat.

Nachhaltigkeit ist gefragt

Ein Thema, das ihr besonders am Herzen liegt, ist die Verantwortung, die ein Unternehmen im Hinblick auf Nachhaltigkeit für die nachfolgenden Generationen hat. ""Nachhaltigkeit ist in unserer Unternehmensphilosophie verankert"", erläutert Kipke. ""Neben der Umwelt-Management- Zertifizierung ISO 14001 bieten wir mit ClimatePartner die Möglichkeit, einen CO2- Ausgleich zu leisten. Zusätzlich können Kunden Flüge mit SAF-Betankung buchen. Das ist allerdings nur in ausgewählten Flughäfen möglich.""

This type of synthetic fuel is created using renewable electricity sources such as wind, solar, or hydropower. What sets e-SAF apart is its carbon neutrality—it releases only the amount of carbon that was initially captured during its production, making it a key tool in aviation’s shift away from fossil fuels.

Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs at SAS, emphasized the importance of collaborative progress, stating, “Moving away from fossil-based fuels isn’t just important—it’s essential. At SAS, we believe real change is possible through cooperation and a shared roadmap for transformation.”

This shared vision was solidified at the international SAF seminar held in Bodø on April 9–10, which culminated in the launch of the Bodø Declaration. The event convened key stakeholders from across the aviation ecosystem—including industry experts, researchers, NGOs, and representatives from the European Commission. It underscored the urgent need for stable regulatory frameworks, secure investment environments, and cross-sector collaboration to achieve a meaningful transition to cleaner aviation fuels.

The Bodø Declaration builds on efforts like Project SkyPower—a joint letter submitted to the European Commission in February 2025. Spearheaded by SAS, the initiative was supported by a broad network of aviation and energy players who recognize the critical role e-SAF will play in decarbonizing air travel. Signatories to the declaration include fuel producers, technology developers, aircraft and engine manufacturers, airport operators, policymakers, and academics, all united in their goal of maintaining aviation’s essential societal role while minimizing its environmental impact.

Strategic collaboration lies at the core of SAS’s sustainability strategy. The Bodø Declaration is a clear example of the kind of joint action required to meet rising demand and accelerate the transition to cleaner aviation. This vision was further reinforced in November of the previous year when SAS signed a partnership agreement with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Copenhagen Airport, and Aalborg Airport to promote e-SAF production in Denmark. This collaboration is part of the Fjord PtX project, a national initiative aimed at producing synthetic fuels using renewable energy. The project not only advances Denmark’s leadership in sustainable aviation but also contributes to job creation and the broader decarbonization of the aviation industry.

The airline also co-founded the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC), a multi-stakeholder group aimed at supporting SAF policy development and adoption. Globally, Cathay’s Corporate SAF Programme recorded a 22-fold increase in SAF usage compared to its launch in 2022.

In support of a circular economy, Cathay Pacific reduced the average number of single-use plastic (SUP) items per passenger to 2.6 and introduced two new 2025 targets – to increase in-flight recycling of water bottles to 33 per cent and to ensure that at least 50 per cent of remaining passenger-facing SUP items are made from recycled plastics. A new workflow for recycling plastic bottles and cans was also implemented at HKIA.

In the community, 2024 marked the 20th anniversary of Cathay’s youth development programme, I Can Fly, which resumed after a five-year pause and was expanded to include an exchange tour in the Greater Bay Area.

Cathay’s CEO Ronald Lam said: “Having successfully completed our two-year rebuilding journey, we have now set our sights on growth and development, where sustainability remains an area where we aspire to lead and is at the forefront of our path forward.

“Our environmental focus continues to be on climate change and a circular economy. Beyond our environmental efforts, we remain committed to our deep roots in Hong Kong, enriching our communities through youth, sports, and arts initiatives while setting our sights on future growth by attracting, developing and retaining a strong pipeline of global talent.”",https://ttgasia.2017.ttgasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Cathay-continues-its-sustainability-efforts-as-it-builds-momentum-for-future-development_ENG_640_3.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 08:56:40.669017

Fuel costs represent a substantial portion of total operating expenses for cargo carriers, and with rising fuel price volatility, driven by increasing global uncertainty, controlling these costs is becoming more challenging. Jet fuel can rise to as much as 35 percent to 50 percent of an air cargo company’s operating costs. For cargo carriers in a low-margin industry, tackling this issue is key to long-term financial sustainability.

Unique challenges

Unlike passenger airlines, cargo carriers operate under a different set of financial constraints. Because passenger airlines face costs such as cabin crew and frequent flight schedules, fuel represents a smaller proportion of overall expenses – typically, 20 percent – 35 percent of operating costs. In addition, passenger planes usually fly lighter and more frequently, making them more fuel-efficient and allowing them to benefit from economies of scale – advantages that cargo carriers don’t have.

For cargo carriers fuel is therefore, a much greater proportional expense, and managing fuel costs critical for the survival of cargo airlines.

Price volatility

One of the most pressing concerns for cargo airlines is the unpredictable volatility of fuel prices, which is largely driven by: fluctuations in crude oil prices, geopolitical instability, and constraints within the refining market. In recent years, the ongoing Ukraine war, global supply chain disruption, and refining capacity limitations have all contributed to price spikes.

Covid-19, as well as market shifts such as the OPEC price war, have exposed the air cargo sector to even more erratic fuel price movements. Fuel price volatility has become more frequent, complicating financial planning and pricing strategies.

Another challenge the industry faces is compliance with evolving sustainability regulations. Carbon pricing schemes such as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), add a layer of complexity, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, further drive fuel expenses. While SAF holds promise for reducing the carbon footprint of aviation, it comes at a significantly higher cost compared to conventional jet fuel.

Currency fluctuations are another issue for carriers operating in regions with weaker currencies, as jet fuel is quoted in USD. This means that for these carriers, fuel becomes an even larger proportion of total expenses. Without a strategy to manage these rising and volatile fuel expenses, many carriers will struggle to remain competitive, and it may threaten their long-term viability.

Cost strategies

In response to these challenges, cargo carriers turn to a variety of strategies to mitigate the impact of fuel price volatility. One such approach is hedging with derivatives. Hedging can stabilise fuel costs but carries risks if prices move unfavourably. What’s more, derivatives hedging is a complicated task which demands substantial financial expertise.

Improving operational efficiency is another avenue. Cargo carriers are increasingly investing in weight-reduction measures, such as lighter materials and more streamlined aircraft, to lower fuel consumption.

Optimising flight routes to minimise unnecessary fuel burn is a key strategy for managing costs. However, this becomes increasingly challenging in the face of geopolitical disruptions, such as Russia’s ban on Western carriers from its airspace, which force airlines to take longer, less efficient routes.

Additionally, the renewal of fleets with next-generation aircraft designed for better fuel efficiency plays a crucial role in long-term cost savings – but demands significant upfront investment.

Risk management is key

The growing difficultly of managing fuel costs underscores why addressing fuel price risk should be a top priority for cargo airlines.

While fuel efficiency requires investment, risk management offers a more immediate solution. One means of doing this which avoids the downsides of derivatives hedging, is energy price risk insurance, which needs far less upfront investment and protects balance sheets by insuring against swings in the fuel price.

By hedging fuel costs and strategically navigating market risks, cargo carriers can better control the financial impact of fuel price volatility. Ultimately, integrating robust risk management strategies with a focus on fuel efficiency will help cargo airlines weather the storm of rising costs, ensuring their long-term success in a highly competitive industry.

Conclusion

The challenges of rising fuel costs and price volatility are nothing new for the airline cargo industry, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to navigate. As fuel comprises a significant portion of operating expenses, cargo carriers must take proactive steps to mitigate these costs. By combining operational improvements, and fleet renewal, the industry can better cope with financial pressures. However, the critical role of fuel price risk management cannot be overstated – it is the key to safeguarding the financial stability and future viability of cargo carriers.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_2351268771-1-1-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 08:56:53.103744

New Delhi: Global oil demand is flattening, diesel growth in India is stagnating, and the world is sitting on a 9 million barrels/day surplus—these were some of the key signals from India’s top oil and gas executives at a high-powered panel marking the 24th Foundation Day of Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC).

Speaking at the panel titled ‘Future-Ready Oil & Gas Industry: Challenges & Opportunities on the Road to 2047’, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Arun Kumar Singh said: “Diesel is virtually stagnant this year. Gasoline saw 4–5 per cent growth, but diesel is less than 1 per cent . Had China not done EV conversion, global demand would have been up by 3 million barrels already.”

Advt

He said global oil growth was under 1 million barrels/day last year, with downward corrections each month. “World has 9 million barrels/day of surplus capacity. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Canada, the US, Brazil—together are sitting on this. It’s a man-made problem of plenty.” Singh added, “The world is walking on multiple legs—demand is shifting. For India, this trajectory will continue, but the rest of the world will behave differently.”

The panel brought together key energy leaders including A.S. Sahney, Chairman of Indian Oil Corporation; Dr. Ranjit Rath, CMD of Oil India Ltd; Harish Mehta, CEO & MD of Jio-bp; and Prasad K Panicker, Chairman of Nayara Energy, moderated by ET Energy World Editor Sudheer Pal Singh.

Indian Oil Chairman A.S. Sahney said energy transition and energy security were not separate agendas. “If the industry moves away from fossil fuels, we are also strengthening energy security,” he said. “Refining capacity of OMCS will increase by over 20 per cent in the next 18 months—from 250 to 300+ MTPA.”

Sahney said Indian Oil has already deployed 10,000 EV charging stations, with the industry total crossing 15,000. “We are putting up India’s largest green hydrogen plant—10,000 tonnes per annum—at Panipat. The bidder will be announced this month,” he said.

On retail, Sahney said, “Today’s customer wants more than fuel—differentiated products, grocery, grooming, servicing, EV charging, multiple payment options—retail outlets are becoming energy and service hubs.”

Oil India CMD Dr. Ranjit Rath said India was opening up 1 million sq. km of previously restricted areas, mainly in deep and ultra-deep waters. “Drilling today targets 7,500 metres in waters up to 3,000 metres deep. These are high-risk, capital-intensive zones,” he said. He added that global collaboration was critical. “We’ve signed an MoU with Petrobras for joint bidding in OALP-10. We are also exploring partnerships in Andaman-Nicobar waters.”

Jio-bp’s Harish Mehta said India, with its $30 trillion economy target by 2047, will drive 75 per cent of incremental global energy demand over the next decade. “Gasoline demand will peak by 2035, diesel by 2041. India has 1 lakh fuel stations—many are unproductive. There is clear space for differentiated networks,” he said.

On EVs, Mehta said, “Renewable energy prices are dropping. Battery tech is evolving. Solid-state batteries and five-minute charging are no longer science fiction.” He added that hydrogen fuel adoption in heavy vehicles is also gaining ground. “ICE-to-hydrogen conversion is already on trial. 25 vehicles in Jamnagar have clocked 3 lakh km.”

Nayara Energy Chairman Panicker emphasised profitability and energy affordability. “Our core business must fund transition. Affordability is critical for India’s economic rise. Without low-cost energy, growth targets will be hit,” he said. On sustainability investments, he said, “The green shift involves heavy costs. These either need government support or other funding structures. Industry cannot pass this on to the consumer.”

He also flagged concerns over the incoming carbon market. “Carbon trading starts soon, but pricing will decide the real impact. Too high a price will hit downstream players.”

ONGC CMD Singh also touched on the role of technology in exploration and production: “In exploration, AI improved one well’s prediction accuracy to 98.9 per cent . Oil recovery is still only 30–35 per cent —technology can double it. We live in a ‘30 per cent world’. Value extraction is inefficient across the chain.”

On the regulatory environment, Singh said: “No country gives the kind of gas price India gives today. For new fields, producers are getting $12 per MMBTU. Globally, producers are capped at $3 in many markets.” He said India now offers one of the most liberal regimes for oil and gas exploration. “The government expects only production. Royalty and tax burdens are minimal in new fields.”

Closing the session, the panel turned to biofuels. Indian Oil’s Sahney said, “India can be among the top three global biofuel producers, along with the US and Brazil. This is one area where we can lead.” He added, “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a huge opportunity. India’s aviation fuel demand will grow at 10–12 per cent CAGR. SAF can make India a hub for international airlines.”

The panel concluded with consensus that India’s oil and gas sector must adapt to rapid shifts in fuel mix, technology, and global trends—while ensuring affordability, domestic production, and energy security remain top priorities.

The role of a charter broker has remained largely the same, however, the industry has been faced with different challenges and developments during this time and the role of the broker has grown. The range of clients using charter services is becoming increasingly diverse, with a broader range of people realising its value and efficiency. Increasing levels of regulation being implemented by governments and civil aviation authorities around areas such as border security, trade, safety, the environment and more, have made the air charter broker a hugely valuable asset as they provide the professional expertise and knowledge to guide travel bookers and advise on the most suitable, legal and competitive solutions. The process checks and arrangements that need to be made to coordinate a charter flight have significantly increased in recent years, making the broker a vital part of the process. Working with operators to make all the necessary arrangements, when things go wrong—which they frequently do, including inclement weather, technical failure, government permit issues and busy airport slots, the broker is able to support with solutions to ensure travellers are still able to reach their destination. As a leading industry association, The ACA works to advise member companies when regulatory changes arise, or are planned, and what will be required, which allows our members to effectively support their clients.

What have been the most significant changes in charter customer demographics and demands over the past 15 years?

Although formal figures are difficult to identify simply due to the confidentiality our industry prides itself on, feedback from our members show there have been changes to the demographics. Overall, a trend has been an increasing number of younger travelers utilizing air charter. This is not unexpected as the vast majority of air charter flights are for business travel and the demographics mirror business changes, with technical industries developing younger c-suite executives who are using air charter to support their business travel.

Access is a big driver of this business travel and business aviation serves twice as many city pairs compared with scheduled services – which have not recovered their networks post-pandemic, often meaning air charter is the only solution to fly directly to a specific destination.

How has The ACA’s role in the industry evolved during the last 15 years?

The ACA has transformed in recent years from being a networking organization to becoming the leading global trade body for air charter. We have taken a more proactive role with a focus on growing the Association’s international presence and expanding its contribution to the wider air charter industry. Over the past ten years, membership has grown significantly and as of February 2025, it now has 435 member companies, with 53% of members outside the UK. This was a key part of our strategy, providing a network of accredited professional member companies across the world.

The ACA rebranded in 2019 to reflect the Association’s increasing drive towards being seen as a global entity, capable of delivering value to members in countries around the world. At the point of the rebrand in 2019, The ACA had just 250 members. Following this, we have created member resources on sustainability and international regulations as well as developed professional training qualifications. Last year, we made the first part of this available as an online course available to all members worldwide.

We have seen our role develop in the industry, with an increased focus on supporting and developing the next generation of young professionals and helping them to understand the variety of opportunities and careers available within the air charter sector. The ACA has delivered increasing outreach via engagement with colleges and universities, alongside our internship program which offers both theoretical training and practical work experience, and which we are confident will continue to grow.

With the rise of various booking platforms and apps, how do you see the role of traditional charter brokers evolving?

Technology and booking platforms play an important part in growing the industry and provide a familiar access point for younger generations of travel bookers.

While the development of platforms and apps make the charter process more efficient, technology will never be able to replace the essential human touch that charter brokers bring to arranging aircraft charters. Booking charter flights is a complex travel management function with a large number of moving parts, and technology cannot substitute an individual’s wealth of knowledge and expertise. These are irreplaceable when it comes to assessing the technical requirements with permits, NOTAMS, weather conditions, taxation and complex itineraries, alongside multiple time zones and fine details such as bespoke catering. As legislation has made air charter more complex in recent years, the role of the traditional broker as a professional advisor has never been more valuable.

How is the charter sector addressing sustainability concerns?

Sustainability is a hugely important topic for the industry. The air charter sector has been leading the change and process to sustainable aviation for many years now. The UK DfT Jet Zero Consultation in 2021 confirmed that between 2010 and 2019, the industry achieved a 20% reduction in emissions due to efficiency improvements and is continuing at a 2% reduction per annum. The air charter industry has led technology development to improve sustainability, with the first use of composite materials and winglets to improve fuel efficiency. In November 2023, the first transatlantic flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was operated by Gulfstream.

The Net Zero 2050 targets and SAF mandates which have come into force across many countries, including the UK, continue to be an industry focus. For example, from 2025 the UK government has mandated that 2% of all jet fuel must be sustainably sourced. The emergence of SAF could be an effective means of helping the aviation sector to decarbonise, however, one of the main barriers to achieving this is a lack of reliable supply. To make SAF a viable alternative to traditional jet fuel, significant investment into SAF production and infrastructure is required, in order to create a reliable supply chain that ensures SAF is widely available at all airports. The Powering up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan published in 2023 highlights the potential for creating 65,000 jobs by the UK SAF industry by 2050, bringing a £1.9 billion direct GVA per annum to the country.

One of the immediate tools the industry has in place to address sustainability concerns is carbon offsetting. The majority of our members have an emissions offsetting scheme, starting with an opt-in policy where clients have the option to pay to offset the CO2e footprint of their journey. Over the past several years, The ACA has been encouraging the concept of opt-out, where offsetting is included as a standard within the charter contract, and it is specifically up to the client to choose to opt out. Some of our members have also gone a step further and offset all charter flights as standard, some even by 200%. Additionally, many charter companies employ full time sustainability officers and are looking to reduce their energy consumption, environmental footprint at their facilities and most importantly, aircraft emissions.

The ACA has taken steps in recent years, through its sustainability and innovation working group to ensure it presents a positive example to the charter industry and is a carbon neutral company. Working with sustainability partner 4AIR, The ACA has been offsetting all events and company operations. We also joined the UK DfT led Jet Zero Council and supported the work done to plan the continued transition of aviation to a zero-emission future.

What changes do you anticipate in charter broker qualifications and standards over the next 15 years?

The ACA is keen to ensure that the already high standards maintained by member companies continue long into the future, which is why the Association felt it was important to launch its accredited Air Charter Broker Qualification, back in 2021. Since then, The ACA has hired a full-time training manager to oversee and deliver this course, all whilst ensuring the Association has greater capacity to expand its training offering. The course is designed to provide individuals with the knowledge they will need to succeed as an air charter broker and ensures that brokers are aware of the industry best practices as set out by The ACA. The training resources delivered within the Air Charter Broker Qualification provide excellent value in supporting members to upskill new staff, as well as allowing more experienced brokers to refresh their knowledge. In 2024, the Association launched the first stage as an online training course to allow global member access to this training, and is working on additional courses this year that will support other types of members.

Over the next 15 years, I think training and best practice will remain a key priority for member companies and the industry. As more and more brokers achieve The ACA qualification, it will grow in recognition, and I expect it to become a requirement for professional development in the industry.

What role do you see The ACA playing in shaping the future of air charter?

The ACA provides an important role in advising and educating the industry. We lead industry self-regulation, promote the best supply chain relationships and our members are accredited as experienced and trustworthy professionals. The ACA is the “go-to” source of industry information, proactively representing our members to government and regulators, providing expert guidance, support and training, and organising unrivalled networking events.

As The ACA’s membership continues to grow internationally, we will be able to employ more resource to expand our reach and influence and deliver even greater value to our members. Currently, we have 435 member companies in over 60 different countries and are growing at between 5 and 8 new member companies every month. This growth will enable us to connect professionals in the industry, support them with training and information, while growing the industry through our continued efforts to encourage young professionals, both in the industry and the next generation, to understand the opportunities and look at a career in air charter, through college and university engagement as well as our internship program.

How have charter industry standards evolved, and what further developments do you anticipate?

The charter industry has very high standards as a whole, due to the highly regulated operational side of aviation. There are many restrictions and rules that must be followed in planning and operating flights. Operators must be commercially licensed, have aircraft insured and with certified maintenance. These requirements are the core structure that underpins the safety of the industry.

There are occasions where individuals and companies break the rules and operate illegal charter flights, a dangerous practice which although rare, continues. We created ‘Fly Legal Day’ every January to focus attention on this and educate travellers of the dangers as well as provide a reporting tool for anyone to report suspicions which we then take to the relevant authorities. This has been very successful in raising awareness across the world and focusing a spotlight on any who look to break the rules.

In the future, we will continue with this work and through our education and training, we will continue to ensure that standards and best practice evolve with the industry to maintain the highest levels of service that travellers experience.",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-ACA_Glenn-Hogben-CEO-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 05:56:52.862918

Europe finds itself at a remarkable crossroads. With climate policies for aviation poised to transform the sector, there is a genuine opportunity to accelerate towards a future that is cleaner, more resilient, and globally influential. Rather than seeing resistance as a setback, it should be recognised as a sign that real change is happening. By standing firm, Europe can turn ambition into action and strengthen its leadership in sustainable aviation.

Building Momentum: Industry Dialogue Reflects Progress

Calls from parts of the aviation industry to slow down climate measures reflect the magnitude of the transformation underway. The European Union Emissions Trading System and the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandates represent meaningful strides towards decarbonisation. These policies, co-developed with industry, reflect a shared recognition of the need for urgent action.

As voices rise in debate, they highlight that these initiatives are not symbolic gestures but real catalysts for change. Rather than viewing these discussions as obstacles, they can be seen as valuable dialogue that sharpens focus and strengthens resolve.

Strengthening Investor Confidence: A Path to Clean Tech Leadership

Staying the course sends a powerful message to investors and innovators. Confidence in policy frameworks encourages greater investment in the technologies that will define aviation’s future. From advanced e-fuels to cutting-edge electrolyser solutions, Europe has an enviable head start. By maintaining momentum, the region positions itself as a leader in the global race towards clean technology.

Clarity and consistency will attract the capital needed to scale up production, driving job creation and stimulating regional economies while delivering tangible climate benefits.

Unlocking Sustainable Growth: Enhancing Fuel Policies

Extending the EU ETS funding for sustainable aviation fuels beyond its current horizon provides an exciting opportunity to boost certainty and accelerate deployment. By focusing future funding towards advanced e-kerosene and other scalable solutions, Europe can move beyond first-generation biofuels and ensure that sustainable aviation becomes mainstream.

Expanding emissions coverage to include all departing flights from European airports is another positive step. This approach would generate fresh resources for innovation while addressing emissions on key international routes, reinforcing Europe’s role as a climate pioneer.

Learning from Experience: Progress Through Persistence

Europe’s history with climate policy reveals an encouraging trend: persistence pays off. The EU ETS has already achieved a 47 percent reduction in emissions in the sectors it covers since its inception. This progress is a testament to the power of well-designed, forward-thinking policy.

Rather than revisiting past compromises, this is the moment to build on those successes. Europe can confidently lead the way, turning its experience into inspiration for global efforts to decarbonise aviation.

Positive Signals: Empowering Clean Aviation Innovation

By maintaining a strong policy stance, Europe provides clear direction to the market. This certainty inspires companies to invest, innovate, and scale up green technologies. With enhanced penalties for non-compliance and stronger incentives for fuel suppliers, the supply chain can be guided decisively towards sustainable solutions.

The transition is already underway. By embracing it fully, the aviation sector can become a showcase of European innovation and environmental leadership.

Embracing the Future: A Shared Vision for Success

Sustainable aviation is no longer an abstract goal. It is a fast-approaching reality. Strengthening current policies aligns Europe with the vision of cleaner skies, competitive industries, and thriving communities.

Governments across the region have an opportunity to act decisively, helping industry partners not only to comply but to flourish. With proactive support and clear direction, Europe can deliver a future where environmental integrity and economic prosperity go hand in hand.

Conclusion: Lifting Off Towards Sustainable Leadership

The choices Europe makes today will shape the legacy of its climate ambition. By remaining resolute and positive, the European Union has the power to chart a path that benefits future generations while bolstering its position as a global leader in sustainable innovation.

This is more than a policy decision. It is an invitation to build a cleaner, stronger, and more prosperous future together. By embracing the opportunities before us, Europe can rise to meet the moment and inspire the world to follow.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-10-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-14 09:56:34.982308

Dr. Michael Engel, Geschäftsführer des BDF, erklärt: „Der Koalitionsvertrag von CDU/CSU und SPD markiert eine wichtige Weichenstellung für den Luftverkehrsstandort Deutschland. Die Rücknahme der Luftverkehrsteuererhöhung ist ein erster Schritt in die richtige Richtung und sendet ein wichtiges Signal an die Branche. Doch um wirklich effektive Wachstumsimpulse für die Luftfahrt zu setzen und die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit Deutschlands auf europäischer Ebene zu sichern, bedarf es weitergehender Maßnahmen. Nur mit einer spürbaren Reduzierung der staatlichen Standortkosten und einer echten Entlastung der Luftfahrtunternehmen können wir langfristig den Luftverkehr stärken und die Position Deutschlands als attraktives Luftverkehrsdrehkreuz sichern.“

Positiv bewertet der BDF die Ankündigung der neuen Bundesregierung, die wettbewerbsverzerrenden Sonderbelastungen abzubauen. Insbesondere die geplante Abschaffung der über die europarechtlichen Vorgaben hinausgehenden PtL-Quote (Power-to-Liquid) noch im Jahr 2025 sowie das angekündigte Gleichbehandlungsprinzip bei Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) schaffen Planungssicherheit und entlasten deutsche Fluggesellschaften im internationalen Vergleich.

Zudem begrüßt der BDF die angestrebte Modernisierung in der Luftfahrtindustrie und des Luftverkehrs im Sinne der Dekarbonisierung und des fairen Wettbewerbs.

„Diese Maßnahmen weisen in die richtige Richtung“, so Dr. Engel. „Jetzt kommt es darauf an, die angekündigten Vorhaben zügig und ambitioniert umzusetzen. Der Luftverkehr ist Rückgrat der deutschen Exportwirtschaft, fördert den Tourismus und verbindet Menschen weltweit. Nur durch verlässliche und wirtschaftsfreundliche Rahmenbedingungen kann der Luftverkehr in Deutschland wieder durchstarten.“

The findings of the Project Willow study highlight several options that can drive the development of a new hub for sustainable industries. Split into three areas – waste and recycling projects, bio-feedstock initiatives and renewable energy – this collection of projects are anticipated to create up to 800 skilled jobs, offering potential new avenues for the current workforce, as well as creating additional economic opportunities. A recent appearance at the Scottish Affairs Committee by the report’s authors suggests the preferred priority project is the production of sustainable aviation fuel, with others to follow.

One of the perennial challenges, however, in terms of translating small-scale innovation to manufacturing on a commercial scale must be tackled head-on. At its core, Grangemouth has always been a manufacturing site, rather than a research and development facility, so there will need to be some adaptation to help these ideas come to fruition.

Infrastructure, funding and skills must all be part of the plan, but it could be a valuable opportunity to provide an additional injection of drive into the ecosystem, with innovative biotechnology companies and the Grangemouth manufacturing operations working together to carve out the next chapter and deliver change.

Importantly, the new opportunities for the site should not rely on one single technology, as has been the case with petrochemical refining, but the challenging incorporation of a range of sustainable processes at significant scale. The plans for using bio-feedstocks are particularly exciting. We have existing biotechnology skills and expertise that can play a significant role in the transition, while also being integrated with the renewable energy and recycling projects. Scotland has a vibrant cluster, which the Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre has supported over the last decade alongside other partners, laying the foundations for an economy that can eventually move away from fossil fuels.

The Scottish Bioresource Mapping Tool developed by IBioIC, Scottish Enterprise and Zero Waste Scotland, for instance, helps to identify the availability of different feedstocks for new products and processes, from agriculture and forestry waste to food and drink co-products, industrial carbon dioxide and seaweed.

We also have a network of more than 300 organisations that can feed into the new projects, depending on what is required for each of the three focus areas, as well as the capabilities to support skills development – including involvement with the Skills Transition Centre at Forth Valley College already kicked-off. With some reskilling, the people who have prior experience at Grangemouth could become the powerhouse we need for implementing new sustainable technologies.

Defossilising Grangemouth as an enormous undertaking and collaboration is perhaps the most critical element in making that happen. Scaling-up to establish new industries and supply chains is full of complexity and hurdles, and in this case, we cannot afford for that to be the barrier that halts progress before it has gained any momentum.

It will take years to transition away from petrochemicals to bio-based processing but the scale of the task requires immediate action. The legacy of Grangemouth may have impacted Scotland’s carbon footprint so far, but its reinvention could make a significant contribution to reaching net zero before it is too late.","https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmQ3Yzc3Yzk3LTMzZWQtNGE2Yy05ZmQxLTc0NGI1YzhiN2I2ZDo5MWY1OGU0NC05M2YwLTQ2OWItODcyMS05OGFjNDJkNWRmNmY=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-04-14 01:56:41.436289

Iwatani, a leading Japanese conglomerate specialising in energy and industrial gases, has signed a contract to identify sources of waste cooking oil across Japan. The aim is to help secure feedstock for the new SAF production facility being constructed within Cosmo Oil’s Sakai Refinery. The SAF plant, the only commercial-scale SAF plant in Japan, will commence production this month. It will be operated by SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY.

As part of the initiative, Iwatani will leverage its extensive LPG customer base and industrial network—serving more than 3.3 million households—to identify and collect waste oil. Revo International, a Japanese company specialising in waste oil recycling and environmental solutions, will be responsible for the collection and transportation of the oil to the SAF plant.

The project also includes the involvement of Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., one of Japan’s largest petroleum companies with strong expertise in refining and fuel distribution, and JGC Holdings Corporation, a global engineering firm with significant experience in energy infrastructure and plant construction.

Together, the six companies aim to establish a fully domestic SAF supply chain—from feedstock procurement to fuel production and airline delivery—supporting Japan’s national target of achieving 10% SAF usage by 2030.

This initiative is supported by the Japanese government’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

“We aim to expand the SAF supply chain and strengthen domestic production,” the companies said in a joint statement. They also confirmed their participation in the “Fry to Fly” Project, a national campaign promoting SAF derived from used cooking oil.

The SAF produced at the Sakai plant will comply with international sustainability standards under the ISCC CORSIA certification. Once fully operational, the facility will produce approximately 30,000 kilolitres of SAF annually, cutting lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Postavili so tudi vmesni cilj, da bi do leta 2030 emisije zmanjšali za pet odstotkov.
Navedli so tudi poročilo analitične družbe Boston Consulting, ki napoveduje, da bo do leta 2030 primanjkljaj teh sintetičnih goriv 45-odstoten.","Letalski promet se je lani po vseh kazalnikih robustno povečal, podobno statistika kaže letos. Ob tem pa predsednik svetovnega panožnega združenja opozarja, da tej transportni panogi v prizadevanjih za ničelne emisije ne gre dobro, da so zelo negotovi tudi vmesni cilji na tej poti, s prstom pa kaže predvsem na dobavitelje goriv.

Letalski promet je po podatkih mednarodnega združenja letalskih prevoznikov IATA lani dosegel nove rekordne ravni. »V letu 2024 je postalo popolnoma jasno, da želijo ljudje potovati. Povpraševanje po poletih se je povečalo za deset odstotkov, njihovo število je doseglo rekord tako na področju poletov med državami kot znotraj njih. Kar 83 odstotkov vseh ponujenih sedežev je bilo zapolnjenih, kar je rekord, je v poročilu o lanskem letu dejal prvi mož IATA Willie Walsh in dodal, da se rast (sicer nekoliko manjša) nakazuje tudi za letošnje leto, kar so potrdili podatki za januar in le nekoliko manj za februar.

Manj zadovoljen je Walsh z izpolnjevanjem okoljskih zavez letalskega prevoza. Dejal je, da so letalske družbe vložile rekordne zneske v nakup trajnostnega goriva, ki pa so ga dobavitelji dobavili komaj kaj, lani manj kot 0,5 odstotka vsega potrebnega. V pogovoru za agencijo Reuters je dejal, da dobavitelji s tovrstno dobavo zavlačujejo.

V letalski industriji se že dolgo uporablja kerozin, pridobljen iz nafte, trajnostno letalsko gorivo (angleška kratica SAF – sustainable aviation fuel) pa je mešanica običajnih fosilnih goriv in sintetičnih komponent, izdelanih iz vrste obnovljivih »surovin«, kot so rabljena jedilna olja, maščobe, rastlinska olja, komunalni, kmetijski in gozdarski odpadki.

Letalski prevozniki so se leta 2021 zavezali, da bi leta 2050 dosegli ogljično nevtralnost. Z uporabo celostnega pristopa, ki upošteva vse emisije v življenjski dobi goriva, naj bi se emisije toplogrednih plinov v celotnem življenjskem ciklu z uporabo trajnostnih letalskih goriv zmanjšale za kar 70 odstotkov ali več kot 90 odstotkov v primerjavi s fosilnim letalskim gorivom.

Postavili so tudi vmesni cilj, da bi do leta 2030 emisije zmanjšali za pet odstotkov. Walsh, ki je tudi nekdanji direktor British Airways, je za Reuters dejal, da je ta vmesni cilj nedosegljiv, predvsem pa da preostali udeleženi v izpolnjevanju tega cilja ne prevzemajo svoje vloge. Vse skupaj malo spominja na avtomobilizem, kjer so bile dane prav tako velike tovrstne zaveze, ki se zdaj majejo.

»Vsi so za stvar, dokler mi plačamo račun, kar je preprosto nesprejemljivo,« so bile Walsheve besede. Dvom, da je vmesni cilj dosegljiv, pomeni precejšen preobrat glede na mnenje s srečanja IATA pred komaj desetimi meseci, ko je Walsh dejal, da je ta cilj »eksistenčno nujen«. Zdaj je drugače, prst je uperil predvsem v dobavitelje goriva, češ da ignorirajo dane obljube, pa čeprav bodo za goriva, ki bodo imela manj emisij, letos letalske družbe namenile 3,8 milijarde dolarjev. Reuters je za komentar prosil panožno združenje proizvajalcev goriv Fuels Europe, a od njih ni dobil dogovora.

Razogljičenje letalstva

Evropsko združenje letalskih prevoznikov A4E (Airlines for Europe) je v zapisu konec marca navajalo, da sicer ostajajo popolnoma zavezani razogljičenju letalstva, zmanjševanju emisij in doseganju ogljične nevtralnosti do leta 2050, a so tudi oni dodali, da so za doseg tega cilja ključna cenovno dostopna trajnostna goriva. Kot so zapisali, so globoko zaskrbljeni, da zakonodaja s tega področja ne ustvarja cenovno dostopnega trga tovrstnih goriv. Navedli so tudi poročilo analitične družbe Boston Consulting, ki napoveduje, da bo do leta 2030 primanjkljaj teh sintetičnih goriv 45-odstoten. A4E dodaja, da morajo zdaj odgovornosti prevzeti evropska komisija in države članice, ker dobavitelji ne dostavljajo goriva. Brez nujnega ukrepanja v prihodnjih mesecih bo tudi po njihovem mnenju verodostojnost zaveze močno omajana – in potrebna ponovna presoja.

IATA pač še navaja, da jih v smeri manjšega okoljskega odtisa ovira dejstvo, da dobave novih letal zamujajo. Predstavniki proizvajalcev so menda Reutersu odgovorili, da so povsem zavezani k proizvodnji bolj učinkovitih letal, a da jih bremenijo stalne težave v dobavnih verigah sestavnih delov. Pri tem le omenimo, da ima evropski konzorcij Airbus v načrtu, da bi do sredine prihodnjega desetletja na trgu uvedel naslednika svojega najbolj prodajanega modela 320 neo, ki naj bi imel od 20 do 30 odstotkov manjšo porabo goriva, kar naj bi med drugim dosegli z izdelavo drugačnih kril, motorji z odprtim rotorjem in lažjimi materiali trupa.

Business travel, a sector historically associated with significant environmental impact, is now at the forefront of this change. With growing awareness of the ecological footprint caused by excessive travel, companies like BCD Travel are exploring ways to make business travel more sustainable. BCD Travel’s 2024 Survey on Reimagining Corporate Travel Policies, which surveyed 211 travel buyers, highlighted that sustainable travel is now a significant theme, with 64% of travel buyers incorporating it into their policies. Flexibility is also gaining traction, as companies adapt to hybrid work environments and evolving traveller needs. However, issues like managing local regulatory differences and balancing global consistency remain hurdles. This article explores the impact of traditional travel practices, highlights the importance of mindful travel, and outlines some sustainable options for business travellers.

The Environmental Impact of Business Travel

Business travel contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions. Air travel is a significant source of global emissions and is predicted to account for 12 to 27 per cent of 2050 global emissions. Air travel emissions are increasing 70 per cent faster than initially expected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is estimated that business travel represents about 15 to 20 per cent of that global travel. Not only does excessive travel affect the environment but also increases carbon emissions. Furthermore, hotel stays, rental vehicles, and meals on the go all add to resource consumption, while single-use plastics and disposable items at airports, hotels, and meeting spaces exacerbate waste issues.

The 2024 BCD survey also highlights several specific strategies that organisations are implementing to promote sustainable travel. Around 59% of companies reporting reduced travel budgets, cost control is critical. Popular measures include encouraging virtual meetings, optimizing trip lengths, and limiting luxury travel perks. Despite these constraints, there is recognition that well-structured travel policies can enhance talent retention and satisfaction.

Among the many measures is public transportation, wherein rather than relying on taxis or ride-hailing services, companies are encouraging the use of public transportation, which not only reduces carbon emissions but also cuts down on travel costs. Business travellers can consider travelling light and reducing luggage weight. Travelling without checked-in luggage or reducing its weight minimizes the fuel burden on flights, making air travel slightly more eco-friendly. Or even, opting for hybrid or electric vehicles is gaining traction. Many companies now prioritise electric or hybrid vehicles for ground transportation, marking a shift towards renewable energy use in business travel. Other practices include carpooling to reduce individual vehicle use, encouraging economy class over business class, and choosing direct flights over connecting routes to cut down on unnecessary emissions.

Being Mindful

With sustainability now a critical consideration, business travellers and companies need to adopt mindful travel practices. Implementing more strategic travel planning and opting for greener options can reduce the negative impact of travel on the environment.

Companies committed to sustainability enhance their brand image, appealing to eco-conscious clients and partners with specific eco-conscious campaigns. Increasingly, organizations are choosing to participate in carbon offset programs that fund projects like reforestation, renewable energy, or conservation to offset the carbon footprint of their travel.

Beyond individual travel choices, travel managers are also rethinking how they organise meetings. Sustainable group activities, focusing on low-impact or eco-friendly experiences, are increasingly part of the meeting agenda.

The Shift toward Sustainable Travel Programs: Insights and Innovations

In an industry first, BCD has developed a comprehensive sustainability solution for corporate travel programs. This innovation, developed with climate-tech partner SQUAKE and experts at global corporate travel consultancy Advito, helps businesses set sustainability goals, manage carbon emissions, and encourage greener travel choices. Key features include automated carbon tax applications, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) procurement, and compliance tools for regulations like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Piloted with Siemens, the solution will be available in early 2025, offering consistent sustainability guidance and reporting across booking platforms. It aims to simplify integrating sustainability into corporate travel processes and reduce travel-related emissions.

The future of corporate travel is increasingly dependent on innovative initiatives that prioritise sustainability while ensuring operational efficiency. A notable example is Microsoft’s collaboration with Advito, which centred around limiting the growth of their Scope 3 emissions and aligning their travel team with this objective. Advito’s Sustainable Collaboration team analysed Microsoft’s travel footprint to identify opportunities to transition from air to rail travel, along with quantifying the potential savings in carbon emissions. The analysis uncovered numerous opportunities for Microsoft to make significant changes; specifically, by shifting 50% of travel from air to rail on viable routes, the company could achieve a reduction of approximately 4,438 tons of CO2 emissions annually.

Another pioneer in building a sustainable travel program was global fintech firm Finastra, who sought reduce internal travel, enhance employee productivity, and optimise their program savings. In early 2019, Finastra announced an ambitious sustainability initiative to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. With the guidance of experts from Advito, the Finastra Travel Team worked to reduce internal travel from 43% at the beginning of the campaign to just 9.8% in just four months, reducing travel spend by 50% in the process.

What Lies Ahead for Sustainable Business Travel?

BCD Travel and other industry leaders are expected to innovate further, encouraging the use of low-emission flights, promoting sustainable suppliers, integrating dynamic meeting location choices and encouraging the use of train travel over air where applicable. The rise of eco-certifications, regulations on sustainability, such as the EU’s CSRD, and ongoing research into sustainable travel technologies will likely make sustainable travel the norm in the corporate world.

While business travel is essential, it doesn’t have to come at the cost of our planet. Companies and travellers have a role to play in making more sustainable choices. By being mindful of travel impacts and embracing green practices, we can pave the way for a more sustainable, responsible future in business travel. Furthermore, sustainable travel is no longer a niche concern, but a growing priority for organisations worldwide. As more companies adopt these practices, the travel industry will likely witness a shift towards more sustainable and responsible travel solutions. For organisations still on the fence, adopting even a few of these initiatives could lead to substantial benefits for both the environment and the bottom line.

As businesses worldwide adapt to a new travel paradigm, the message is clear: sustainable travel is not just a responsibility—it’s an opportunity to lead.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/03/e17118a5-annie-spratt-iqwnr00mfqm-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 22:56:07.831956

“With SAF blending mandates expanding, demand is rising rapidly,” said Jeong Ho-seung, head of SK Innovation’s Sustainable Fuel Technology Team.
Jeong emphasized the challenges of meeting stringent safety standards: “Aviation fuel is heavily regulated, and SAF must meet one of eight ASTM standards.
We’re also developing technologies that allow us to use lower-grade, cost-effective waste oils.” SK has now established a full SAF value chain—from feedstock procurement to production and global distribution.
The United States has set a goal to fully replace conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050.","DAEJEON, South Korea, April 14 (Korea Bizwire) — At SK Innovation’s Environmental Science & Technology Institute in Daejeon, a powerful scent of used cooking oil hangs in the air, signaling an ambitious transformation: converting waste oil into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Within the facility’s pilot plant, dark brown waste oil is refined through high-temperature, high-pressure reactors into a clear liquid—an eco-friendly fuel that can cut carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The shift comes as SAF gains momentum globally, driven by regulatory mandates and growing pressure on the aviation sector to decarbonize.

“With SAF blending mandates expanding, demand is rising rapidly,” said Jeong Ho-seung, head of SK Innovation’s Sustainable Fuel Technology Team. “The global SAF market is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 46%, reaching 108 trillion won ($80 billion) by 2034.”

SK Energy, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, began commercial SAF production last September at its Ulsan Complex, marking a domestic first.

The facility, with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons, uses a co-processing method that integrates bio-based feedstocks into existing petroleum production lines. This dual-input system allows for continuous SAF output alongside other low-carbon products like bio-naphtha.

Much of SK’s progress is underpinned by its in-house R&D. Engineers at the Daejeon institute developed the co-processing technology and validated it through pilot testing before scaling it to commercial operations.

Jeong emphasized the challenges of meeting stringent safety standards: “Aviation fuel is heavily regulated, and SAF must meet one of eight ASTM standards. We’re also developing technologies that allow us to use lower-grade, cost-effective waste oils.”

SK has now established a full SAF value chain—from feedstock procurement to production and global distribution. The company became the first Korean refiner to export SAF to Europe in January.

In March, it signed a bulk supply deal with Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, and has since begun supplying domestic carriers including Air Busan and Korean Air.

Governments worldwide are tightening SAF mandates. The European Union now requires a minimum 2% SAF blend in jet fuel, with targets rising to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The United States has set a goal to fully replace conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050. Korea, meanwhile, announced last August that all international flights departing the country must blend SAF starting in 2027.

Still, industry insiders warn that Korea’s policy support lags behind other nations. The EU offers carbon credits to airlines using SAF, while the U.S. provides tax credits of up to $1.75 per gallon for SAF producers. Japan also offers tax deductions of up to 40% for SAF-related investments and sales.

“To meet growing market demand, multi-trillion-won investments are required,” said one industry source. “Without government support, such investments are unfeasible. Proactive policy measures are essential to advance this strategic industry.”

Myanmar 7.7 Earthquake Recovery

Myanmar is grappling with the aftermath of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck on March 28, devastating its central region. The disaster claimed over 3,600 lives and caused widespread destruction, toppling everything from modern condominiums to historic pagodas.

More than nine million people across 58 townships have been impacted, with thousands of buildings, including schools and hospitals, reduced to rubble. The situation remains unstable as aftershocks continue to shake the worst-affected areas, worsening an already critical humanitarian crisis.

In response, UN agencies are requesting an additional $241.6 million to support those in the hardest-hit areas. They are also reallocating $134 million from Myanmar’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan, published in December 2024.

The updated plan highlights two million newly affected people in urgent need of aid. This adds to the 4.3 million who had already been relying on assistance before the earthquake struck.

Even before this tragedy, Myanmar faced severe challenges. Nearly 20 million people—about a third of the population—were already in need of humanitarian support.

Listen to a recent interview with corn grower Randy Hughes about SAF tax credits:","Legislation seeking to create a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production tax credit is looking for cosponsors.

SAF is jet fuel, of which at least 90 percent is derived from synthetic, renewable, and nonpetroleum sources. Beginning in tax year 2028, the credit is equal to $1.50 for each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel produced by a claimant in this state during a taxable year.

For purposes of this legislation, SAF only includes feedstocks grown or sourced domestically from within the U.S. While there’s currently no production of SAF occurring in Wisconsin, the state is in a prime position to become a hub for SAF production, according to bill authors Rep. David Steffen and Sens. Romaine Quinn and Patrick Testin. Lawmakers believe Wisconsin has an edge both geographically and because of its strong agricultural output.

The anticipation from bill authors is that SAF will produce a new market for the farming and timber industries.

At a time when the agricultural sector is facing a myriad of challenges, Wisconsin can support its farmers and timber producers by seizing opportunities for our growing biofuels industry, the authors wrote in a memorandum.

Wisconsin’s biofuels industry adds $4.2 billion to the state’s economy and directly employs over 19,000 people. The SAF tax credit is on the priority lists for both the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation and the Wisconsin Biofuels Association for this legislative session.

In a shocking and dramatic turn of events, American Airlines Flight AA154, en route from Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW) to London Heathrow (LHR), was forced into an emergency diversion to Memphis International Airport (MEM) on April 10, 2025, after smoke mysteriously began to fill the forward cabin just an hour into the flight. The Boeing 777, a massive and normally reliable aircraft, became the center of an unexpected emergency, sending waves of panic throughout the cabin as flight attendants and crew scrambled to handle the crisis. The fact that the plane was less than an hour from its scheduled destination raised significant concerns over the safety of the aircraft and the airline’s preparedness for such incidents.

A Nightmarish 40 Minutes in the Sky

This incident unfolded with all the drama of a high-stakes thriller. After taking off from Dallas at 2:31 UTC, everything appeared to be running smoothly for the 200 passengers aboard the Boeing 777. But the calm was short-lived. Just over an hour into the flight, smoke began seeping into the forward cabin, sending the crew into action mode. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the pilots made the quick decision to divert the flight to Memphis International Airport, a move that may have been a matter of life or death.

As the aircraft made its descent into Memphis, passengers were left on edge, unsure of what was happening in the chaos above them. According to reports from FlightRadar24, the aircraft made a safe but urgent landing at runway 36C in Memphis, touching down at 4:22 UTC—nearly 40 minutes after the initial diversion was initiated. The plane was met with emergency vehicles on the ground, and the passengers’ long ordeal finally came to an end, but not before sparking alarm bells across the aviation world.

The Boeing 777’s Age and Reliability Under Scrutiny

The plane involved in this heart-stopping emergency was a Boeing 777-200ER, registered N761AJ, a 23.1-year-old aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. While these aircraft are usually considered reliable, their age and potential for mechanical wear-and-tear could be a factor in this terrifying scenario. Despite American Airlines’ claims of ensuring “top-notch” maintenance, this incident raises alarm about the true safety of older aircraft in the fleet, especially when faced with unexpected mechanical failures mid-flight.

A History of Alarming Similar Incidents

This emergency landing isn’t the only high-profile incident involving American Airlines aircraft recently. On April 1, 2025, a different American Eagle flight, AA5406, operated by PSA Airlines, was forced into a dramatic evacuation at Augusta Regional Airport (AGS) after smoke filled the cabin following its landing. Passengers were forced to evacuate via the aircraft’s wings, while footage captured by one of the passengers quickly went viral.

The similarities between these incidents are disturbing—both flights involved a smoky cabin and swift actions by the crew to mitigate a major crisis. What’s even more unsettling is the fact that both incidents involved aircrafts operated by American Airlines, raising the question: How many other flights are at risk of similar problems? Could this be a sign of systemic issues within American Airlines’ maintenance protocols?

The FAA’s Investigation: A Deep Dive into Safety Standards

In the aftermath of the dramatic Memphis diversion, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) swiftly launched an investigation into what went wrong with American Airlines Flight 154. Was this simply an isolated mechanical malfunction, or does it point to a deeper problem with the airline’s maintenance practices? As the FAA probes further, the airline’s reputation is at stake, especially with passengers now questioning the airline’s commitment to ensuring flight safety.

This FAA investigation will not only examine the cause of the smoke in the cabin but also scrutinize American Airlines’ overall safety and maintenance procedures. The findings of this investigation will surely have significant implications for the airline industry as a whole—particularly for major carriers like American Airlines, which faces mounting pressure to maintain their safety record after such incidents.

Passenger Panic and Airline Accountability

While the airline’s crew responded swiftly and efficiently to the smoke-filled cabin emergency, it’s hard to ignore the panic and fear passengers experienced during this harrowing ordeal. Many passengers on board have recounted their terrifying experiences, with some saying they could smell something burning as the cabin quickly filled with smoke. “It felt like a scene from a disaster movie,” one passenger said in an interview after landing. Others noted that the cabin’s air was becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, exacerbating their anxiety.

American Airlines issued a statement apologizing for the inconvenience caused, as it always does after an incident. But the real question on everyone’s mind is whether the airline has done enough to address these safety concerns moving forward. Can American Airlines truly be trusted with the safety of its passengers when its planes are experiencing repeated mechanical failures?

American Airlines, one of the largest and most prominent airlines in the world, has earned a significant place in the global aviation industry. Established in 1930, American Airlines operates as the primary carrier of the United States, providing extensive domestic and international services. With its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, the airline is a major player in both passenger travel and cargo transport, connecting people and businesses across continents.

History and Expansion

American Airlines’ journey began with the merger of several small regional airlines. Over the decades, the airline expanded rapidly through acquisitions and partnerships, solidifying its position as a key player in the American and global airline industry. One of the most notable milestones in its history was the merger with US Airways in 2013, which significantly increased American Airlines’ market presence, creating the world’s largest airline in terms of fleet size and passenger traffic at that time.

American Airlines is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, one of the largest global airline partnerships, which allows passengers to enjoy seamless travel across multiple international carriers. The airline’s vast network includes over 350 destinations across more than 50 countries, making it an essential global carrier.

Fleet and Operations

American Airlines boasts a diverse fleet that includes various models of Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The airline’s fleet is known for its size, operating hundreds of narrow-body and wide-body jets, making it well-equipped to handle both short-haul and long-haul flights. The fleet includes the Boeing 737 and 787 Dreamliner, as well as the Airbus A321 and A330, which serve various domestic and international routes.

In terms of operational reach, American Airlines’ services are spread across every corner of the globe, with its hub airports in major cities such as Dallas/Fort Worth, Charlotte, Chicago, and Miami.

It will supply the fuel to Japanese airline companies for a cleaner alternative to traditional air travel.

As Reuters reported, Cosmo planned production at its Osaka-based Sakai refinery earlier this year. It aimed to produce 30,000 kiloliters of sustainable aviation fuel per year by April.

The company supplies eco-friendly fuel to Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. This commitment is significant because it is Japan's first domestically produced green fuel for airlines.

Cosmo's sustainable fuel is made from cooking oil and is the first large-scale production of its kind in the country. The refiner worked with two other companies to produce it but declined to provide details about the fuel's price and volume.

The news from Japan is encouraging worldwide because of how sustainable aviation fuel can reduce the harmful air pollution associated with traditional plane travel.

The aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global energy pollution. This contribution impacts our planet's overheating and leads to public health risks and extreme weather events.

In other parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel companies like LanzaJet have been creating millions of gallons of alternative fuel to offset air travel pollution. That company's fuel is made from low-carbon intensity ethanol, or grain alcohol, using corn.

Another company, OXCCU, has been creating jet fuel from air pollution using renewable energy and a combination of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

As a traveler, you can look into flying on planes powered by sustainable fuel and support airlines' efforts to embrace fuels with lower carbon impacts. For example, Delta has been actively working to use sustainable fuels to reduce the environmental impact of its flights.

Until sustainable fuel flights become more readily available, you can change the way you travel by embracing train travel and vacationing close to home in places that don't require a flight. When you do fly, consider eco-friendly travel destinations to help minimize your adventures' overall environmental impact.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sustainable-aviation-fuelimage-reci36GfcI80PaIDy.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 13:56:07.584302

Three of the Port Authority of NY & NJ’s major airports may have gotten there before us!

Most travelers are aware that air travel is a major contributor to carbon emissions, and airports themselves can also be massive hubs of energy use with in- and out-going vehicle traffic, bright lighting 24/7, air conditioning and heating, as well the production of vast amounts of waste. The aviation industry, including airports themselves and the planes actually flying, contribute around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, some airports are taking steps to reduce these emissions and become a part of the solution.

All over the planet, airports are embracing sustainability and recognizing the need to make more eco-friendly choices. This includes three of the major airports in the United States’ largest and most famous city, New York – John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), all operated by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.

These three airports are going through major redevelopment projects to embrace renewable energy, move away from fossil fuels where they can, and strategically reducing the volume of waste they produce.

NY Metropolitan Airports Cleared for a Green Landing

JFK and LaGuardia airports collectively serve over 90 million travelers annually — JFK alone handles 63.3 million passengers, and LaGuardia sees 33.5 million. And at Newark Airport, 49 million travelers were served in 2023.

In 2024, a total of 145.9 million air passengers flew through JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, and New York Stewart airports, according to initial estimates. That total surpassed the previous record of 143.8 million set in 2023. To support this level of traffic, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey is responsible for managing a significant portion of the region’s transportation infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, seaports, and airports, all within its designated geographical area. Spanning 1,500 square miles and centered around New York Harbor, it covers parts of 17 New York and New Jersey counties, making it the largest employer in New York State. The Port Authority’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

One of the most exciting projects helping them get there is the recently upgraded electric charging station at JFK. This station has added 24 brand-new EV chargers, bringing the total number of chargers at JFK to 46, open 24/7 to the public to quickly charge their passenger vehicles.

Even better, the chargers are being used for the airport’s own ground fleet of EV vehicles at the airport as well. This aligns with the Port Authority’s net-zero emission goals, which have seen it commit to electrifying its entire light-duty fleet by 2028 and its ground service equipment fleet by 2035.

Gas-powered ground operations and light-duty fleets require enormous amounts of fossil fuel, but by transitioning all their vehicles to electric, that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Imagine, if you will – security vehicles, concessions, baggage carousels, kiosks – all run on electricity generated by renewable energy like solar. That is what New York is working towards. Here’s how: solar-powered terminals.

Running on Sunshine

A brand new, solar-powered sustainable terminal at JFK is already underway and is due to open in 2026.

“The development of the New Terminal One is rooted in resiliency and sustainability, extending from our design and construction to operations and maintenance after we open our doors in 2026. We are building the terminal to withstand challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events, so we remain fully operational no matter the environmental conditions,” says Uzoamaka N. Okoye, Chief of Staff, The New Terminal One (NTO) at JFK.

Okoye explains that NTO is committed to reducing its environmental impact through innovative energy systems. Their state-of-the-art microgrid, built in partnership with AlphaStructure, is key to these efforts. Featuring the largest solar array in New York City and on any U.S. airport, the microgrid will enable them to function independently of the power grid with locally generated and lower carbon energy.

Reducing Waste, Elevating Sustainability

Vehicle carbon emissions are where our minds go when we think of waste at airports. Unfortunately, that is just one part of the problem. Airports also generate huge amounts of waste every single day, from plastic food packaging to lavatory water, uneaten food to deplaned waste to oil, grease spills to single-use plastic bottles. This list is long and daunting. When was the last time you made it through an airport without throwing something away?

But for most travelers, sustainability is not top of mind when we are rushing to a gate or trying to fill up on food between flights. For most of us, convenience is always going to win out over reducing waste.

Fortunately, the Port Authority is taking steps to mitigate this and make it easier to dispose of our trash properly. Revamping their recycling policy is the first step, by having clear and separated receptacles for different recyclable items helps to make sure waste is at least handled properly at the airport and “to get the most use out of waste-bound materials as possible in order to avoid landfilling,” says Alexandria Cassidy, lead on zero-waste at the Port Authority.

She is absolutely right!

One of the more significant issues with our recycling system in the United States is improper waste sorting and insufficient facilities to handle the waste, especially plastics. These clearly labeled bins are a start in helping to keep the waste in the right place while maintaining convenience for passengers. Ultimately, EARTHDAY.ORG would like to see a drastic reduction in the use of single-use plastics at airports, across the U.S., and globally, and a move towards more eco-friendly alternatives like water refilling stations, bamboo cutlery, paper, and reusable glass bottles.

With the redevelopment of the new Terminal 6 at JFK, “Sustainability is a top priority for us and has been built into the design of T6, with floor-to-ceiling windows, over 6,000 rooftop solar panels, energy-efficient baggage systems, and graywater collection and reuse throughout the terminal,” said Rishali Chaplot, Manager, Environment and Sustainability at JFK Millennium Partners. “Both during the construction of T6 and its operation in 2026, we aim to divert as much waste as possible by implementing various waste recycling and composting guidelines across all our products and vendors. Through January of this year, our waste diversion rate at the construction site was 98.87% — a figure we are very proud of.”

Doing the Right Thing = Saving Money

LaGuardia Airport’s newly developed $5.1 billion Terminal B stands as a prime example of sustainable design that ultimately is good for the bottom line as well. The Terminal earned a LEED v4 Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). This recognition makes it the world’s first airline terminal to meet these advanced environmental standards, highlighting the airport’s commitment to sustainability.

Its design has allowed LaGuardia to save more — reducing its water bills by 43% and its energy costs by 18%. This has been achieved through reduced window glazing, installation of a specialist roof that reflects solar heat, using solar water heaters, and light-sensitive artificial lighting control. Every aspect of Terminal B is designed to maximize efficiency and minimize waste. This ambitious project reflects LaGuardia Airport’s ongoing efforts to lead in both eco-conscious infrastructure and innovation.

In November 2023, the Port Authority announced that Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal A achieved LEED Gold certification by the USGBC for leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the most widely used green-building rating system in the world and an international symbol of environmental responsibility.

The one-million-square-foot Terminal A at Newark Airport features a variety of sustainable design elements, including the largest solar rooftop installation at any U.S. airport atop the terminal’s parking deck, new electric buses to support shuttle operations, water-efficient fixtures reducing potable water demand by more than 45 percent, a cool roof designed to reflect sunlight, absorbing less solar energy and reducing the heat gain on the building, and energy-efficient indoor lighting and controls. In achieving LEED Gold, the project meets the Port Authority’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing annual energy costs by an estimated 30 percent.

“The LEED Gold designation exemplifies the agency’s commitment to environmental sustainability and being a good neighbor,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “By establishing rigorous building standards and adopting aggressive measures to reduce our carbon footprint, we are creating a healthier environment and striving to improve the quality of life for those in the region we serve.”

Newark Liberty also provides charging and electrical infrastructure to enable airlines to transition to electric ground-support equipment (GSE) across the terminal. The agency’s 2022 Zero Emission Airside Vehicle Rule mandates the conversion of all GSE to electric models by 2030, where commercially available. It’s satisfying to see major airports taking responsibility and recognizing their role in cutting carbon emissions and reducing waste.

Like the Port Authority, we see the shining benefits of renewable energy—whether through solar, wind, or other sustainable sources. Beyond their environmental impact, renewable energy helps to lower operational costs, proving that sustainability and financial savings go hand in hand. As more airports and industries embrace these green technologies, they not only contribute to a healthier planet but showcase that renewable energy is both a smart financial decision and a critical step toward a sustainable future for all.",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Creating-a-Green-Sky.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 15:56:33.314719

In addition, the company’s equity saw notable growth, reaching EGP 45.380 billion, a 4.9% rise from 2023 and an astounding 800% increase since 2015.

The results were announced during the company’s general assembly meeting, held in the presence of the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Karim Badawi, along with officials from the petroleum sector.

In the meeting, Badawi underscored the importance of the petrochemical industry for the petroleum sector, given its added value to natural resources. He pointed out that investors’ interest in petroleum projects is a true reflection of the attractiveness of its investment climate.

For his part, Ahmed Mahmoud, the Chairman and Managing Director of MOPCO, reviewed the company’s primary results in line with the pillars of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources (MoPMR). He highlighted the company’s commitment to occupational safety and health standards, boosting production efficiency, and adopting sustainable practices to achieve Egypt’s vision in sustainable development goals.

The company recorded four million hours of work with no injuries during 2024, increasing total number of safe working hours to 19 million since 2018.

Mahmoud said that MOPCO was able to increase 10% of the production capacity of its MOPCO 3 plant, located in the Damietta Industrial Complex. Coming earlier than expected, the increase was the result of replacing the HPCC unit, leading to a $2 million boost in the company’s revenues.

In the area of urea and ammonia production, MOPCO has surpassed its targets, with sales amounting to 1,741,000 tons and 116,000 tons respectively. The company exported 947,000 tons of urea and allocated 795,000 tons to the local market. Notably, the European market is the largest destination for MOPCO’s urea exports, accounting for 89%. For ammonia, the company exported 48,000 tons and allocated 68,000 tons to the local market.

Mahmoud explained that MOPCO is currently implementing several projects, including a project focused on upgrading and developing its plants’ efficiency to increase production and rationalize natural gas consumption. The company has also started its production of ADBlue–a urea-based solution to reduce diesel engine emissions.

Moreover, MOPCO is developing a green ammonia production project in cooperation with the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (EGPC) and the Norwegian company Scatec, collaborating with Damietta Green Ammonia Company, and holding 25% of the shares. It has also signed a 15-year purchase agreement with the Norwegian company Yara Clean Ammonia.

MOPCO also holds 20% of the shares in the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel (ESAF) Company. Additionally, it is implementing a carbon dioxide recovery unit from the smokestack of plant 1–the first project of its kind in Africa and the Middle East to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

The company will be taking part in two projects in El Alamein: one of them to produce soda ash and its derivatives, and another to produce silicon products. It is also expected to produce technical-grade urea to help reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. In addition to that, it is installing solar panels that generate 4 megawatts by 2026, Mahmoud said.

In respect of social responsibility, MOPCO allocated EGP 39 million throughout the year to supporting numerous initiatives and projects across Egypt, particularly in Damietta, where it implemented a range of infrastructure development projects, and participated in initiatives supporting education, health, and civil society. MOPCO has also been awarded the ISO 26000 certification for social responsibility.

MOPCO places a strong emphasis on developing human capital, offering a total of 1,710 training opportunities annually across a wide range of fields, as highlighted by Mahmoud.

10일 찾은 대전 SK이노베이션 환경과학기술원. 식용유보다 맑고 노란 빛의 기름병을 여니 주유소 기름 냄새가 코를 찔렀다. SK에너지가 만든 지속가능항공유(Sustainable Aviation Fuel·SAF). 폐식용유 같은 바이오원료를 석유 원료와 섞어 뽑아낸 비행기용 연료다. 환경 보호를 위해 전 세계적으로 SAF 도입 의무화 바람이 불면서 정유사 간 시장 선점 경쟁이 치열한데 SK에너지가 출사표를 던졌다.

치킨 튀긴 식용유가 비행기 연료가 된다... SAF가 뭐길래?

SAF로 항공유 전체를 대체하기에는 무리가 있어 현재는 SAF를 항공유와 섞어 쓴다. 두 가지 방법이 있는데 하나는 100% SAF를 만든 다음 항공유에 원하는 만큼 물리적으로 섞는 것이고 또 하나는 생산 설비에 바이오원료와 석유 원료를 함께 넣고 공정을 거쳐 원하는 비율의 SAF를 생산하는 식으로 '코 프로세싱(Co-processing)'이라 불린다.

이를 커피에 비유하면 전자는 원두(바이오원료)로 에스프레소(100% SAF)를 만든 다음 물(항공유)을 섞어 아메리카노를 만드는 식이라면, 후자는 원두(바이오원료)와 물(석유원료)을 시작부터 한 번에 넣고 우려내 콜드브루를 제조하는 식에 가깝다.

SK에너지는 자체 코 프로세싱 방식으로 시장에 뛰어들었다. 대전 기술원에서 연구개발(R&D)을 통해 공정을 설계하고 2024년 9월 국내 최초로 울산에 150억 원을 들여 전용 생산 라인을 갖췄다. 폐식용유를 중국·인도 등에서 들여와 연간 10만 톤 수준의 5% SAF를 만들고 있다. 이 SAF는 유럽·캐세이퍼시픽항공·에어부산·대한항공 등에 보내진다.

탄소중립 움직임에 발맞춰 SAF 시장은 연 평균 46.2%씩 크게 성장해 2034년 746억 달러(108조 9,600억 원) 규모가 될 것이란 예측이 나온다. 특히 유엔 산하 국제민간항공기구(ICAO)의 국제항공 탄소상쇄·감축제도(CORSIA) 의무화에 따라 2027년부터 한국 등 193개 회원국은 국제 항공 온실가스 배출량을 2019년의 85%로 줄여야만 해 SAF가 필수적이다.

유럽연합(EU)은 올해 의무 비율을 2%로 시작해 2050년에는 70%까지 올린단 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 전체를 SAF로 대체한다는 목표다. 아시아에서는 일본이 2030년부터 10% 의무화를 로드맵을 발표했다.

업계에서는 전통 항공유 수출 1위 국가인 한국이 100% SAF 생산 설비를 갖추는 등 시장 경쟁력을 키워야 한다는 목소리가 나온다. 하지만 정유사들은 조 단위 투자가 필요해 적극 뛰어들기를 망설인다. 정부 지원이 필요하다는 얘기가 나오는 이유다. 일본은 석유화학기업인 이데미쓰고산의 생산 설비에 2,570억 원을 투입하고 생산 세액 공제 제도도 마련했다.",https://newsimg-hams.hankookilbo.com/2025/04/10/f701202c-6bab-438a-a4bf-2ef6b5ff09c3.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 12:56:25.706343

Qantas and Airbus have jointly committed $15 million to the fund to be managed by Sydney and Melbourne firm Climate Tech Partners.

The fund will focus on innovations in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) but will also invest in other technologies which will help decarbonise the aviation sector. The fund will mainly invest in Australia but will have capacity to invest globally.

According to a joint announcement by Qantas and Airbus on April 7, the new fund will offer early-stage technology companies mentorship and strategic support as well as investment capital.

Qantas chief sustainability officer Fiona Messent said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool we have to decarbonise aviation and, with Airbus, we’re investing significantly in ways to make it more available and accessible.

“As well as funding, this partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated into the SAF supply chain while also providing companies with access to Qantas and Airbus as they develop and test their solutions.”

The investment capital will be drawn from the 2022-established $US200 million ($318 million) Qantas-Airbus SAF partnership fund.

“For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit, so it’s fantastic to be collaborating across industries to accelerate local production,” Messent added.

Airbus chief sustainability officer Julie Kitcher said: “Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors; from airlines, manufactures and airports to regulators, governments and investors.”

She said she believed Australia was well positioned to be a leader in low carbon fuels and investment in the sector could generate new jobs.

Co-founder of Climate Tech Partners Patrick Sieb said: “Working with global leading aviation and aerospace companies allows us to not only make more deeply informed investment decisions in this complex area but attract and support the best companies by helping them accelerate through industry engagement.”

Sydney and Melbourne firm Climate Tech Partners was set up Sieb and Tom Kline last year. The pair previously raised a Climate Tech Fund for Investible. They launched fundraising for Climate Tech Partners’ main fund early this year and have attracted initial commitments, including from Daniel Besen’s family office.

According to Sieb and Kline, Climate Tech Partners Fund I is close to achieving a first close above $45 million.

Qatar Airways is committed to meeting its environmental obligations and partnerships such as ours with Virgin Australia will be crucial to that.”","Qatar Airways and Virgin Australia have agreed to collaborate with Renewable Developments Australia to become key partners in a project that aims to establish a domestic facility for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the Charters Towers Region of North Queensland. The project aims to establish a fully integrated Ethanol to Jet (EtJ) facility that converts bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite into 100% SAF, using proprietary PureSAF technology supplied from KBR, while also generating all of the project’s energy requirements from renewable sources. This unique vertically integrated and energy self-sufficient approach sets it apart from other SAF and EtJ projects globally.

It is anticipated that the facility will annually produce up to 96 million liters of SAF, which will be delivered to nearby airports. Early modelling indicates a potential lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 70 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.

This project is in line with the larger Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that Qatar Airways and Virgin Australia signed in October 2024. The MoU cemented their intent to collaborate on sustainability initiatives that aim to reduce carbon emissions in air travel and advance the use of SAF and Low Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) in Australia.

In a positive letter of support to RDA, The Boeing Company (TBC) outlines its commitment to collaborate in several areas, including policy advocacy and the contribution of technical expertise, where relevant, to further encourage support from the broader aviation ecosystem.

The project, currently in the pre-final investment decision stage, aims to deliver SAF from early 2029.

Abang Johari believed that microalgae is an industrial crop that could help to expand and grow the state’s economy and serve as a model to achieve our aspirations while preserving the environment.
“Microalgae offer great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is crucial to the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
“I believe microalgae is a renewable source that can offer us a sustainable solution that does not compete with food sources.","THE Sarawak government will continue to pursue research on microalgae on its nutritional and medical benefits, and is looking into other algae species for their potential medical applications.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg said the microalgae offers potential for innovative and sustainable product development in the food industry.

“There are many algae species that have been found to have tremendous health benefits, and spirulina is a good example of a superfood. Spirulina is packed with essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which make it a popular supplement for health-conscious individuals.

“But beyond spirulina, we are also looking into other algae species for their potential medical applications. For instance, some algae have been found to have antibacterial and antiviral properties, which can help in the fight against infectious diseases,” he said.

Abang Johari who is also Minister for Finance and New Economy was delivering his ministerial winding-up speech at DUN yesterday (May 24).

He said, additionally algae may be used to reduce inflammation, detoxify the body, boost the immune system, and even aid in weight loss.

He told the august House that there are two facilities cultivating algae with different technologies, with the first facility, on solar platform, which is a collaboration between Sarawak Energy, Sarawak Biodiversity Centre, Eneos Corporation and Chitose Group from Japan at Sejingkat.

“The other facility is employing the use of tanks and sea water. This is a collaboration between Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) Energy and Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) in Demak Laut,” he said.

Sarawak, he said, has also taken a progressive step to explore microalgae as a potential source of renewable energy, where Sarawak Biodiversity Centre, in collaboration with Sarawak Energy Berhad as well as Chitose Laboratory and Eneos Corporation from Japan has established the world’s largest mass microalgae biomass production facility, Chitose Carbon Capture Central (C4), spanning about five hectares in Sejingkat, Kuching.

“The C4 will tap into the exhausted gas containing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Sejingkat Coal Power Plant to grow algae in a carbon circular economy.

“This is the first of its kind in Malaysia to demonstrate the industrial-scale utilisation of flue gas to enhance algae production. This 5-hectare facility will act as ‘liquid trees’ to capture CO2 while functioning as a natural purifier by releasing oxygen through photosynthesis,” he said.

Abang Johari believed that microalgae is an industrial crop that could help to expand and grow the state’s economy and serve as a model to achieve our aspirations while preserving the environment.

“This facility will also serve as part of net zero emissions efforts with an expected 700 tonnes of CO2 that can be absorbed by the algae biomass, and will produce around 350 tonnes of algae biomass annually. This will be transformed into high- quality products such as food and feedstock, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical ingredients,” he said.

He added the commercialisation of algae has only just begun.

“We anticipate significant growth in this industry with the planning of the Chitose group to expand the farm to 100 hectares in the next three years and to achieve 2,000 hectares by 2030 in Sarawak.

“We expect to create up to 5,000 new job opportunities and decarbonisation of about 200,000 tonnes of carbon annually,” he said.

On a related note, he said Sarawak has the capacity to provide a green fuel solution from a sustainable source.

“Microalgae offer great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is crucial to the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

“I just came back from Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) exhibition using aircraft powered by SAF, from a joint venture between PETRONAS and SEDC Energy. It is the world’s first SAF produced using algae. This clearly proves Sarawak is able to produce safe and reliable SAF for commercial use.

“I believe microalgae is a renewable source that can offer us a sustainable solution that does not compete with food sources.

“Here in Sarawak, there is enough sunlight, warm tropical climate and abundance of seawater that provides the right conditions to continuously farm the oil source sustainably,” said Abang Johari.",https://www.sarawaktribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8adeb426-f85a-4e2e-8570-85e3755c3237.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 11:57:59.530303

전 세계적 의무화 추세... 시장 성장 ↑

항공유 1위 한국도 100% SAF 생산 시급

막대한 투자 규모에 정유사 선뜻 못 나서

정부 ""SAF 의무화 비율 및 R&D 준비 중""

10일 찾은 대전 SK이노베이션 환경과학기술원. 식용유보다 맑고 노란 빛의 기름병을 여니 주유소 기름 냄새가 코를 찔렀다. SK에너지가 만든 지속가능항공유(Sustainable Aviation Fuel·SAF). 폐식용유 같은 바이오원료를 석유 원료와 섞어 뽑아낸 비행기용 연료다. 환경 보호를 위해 전 세계적으로 SAF 도입 의무화 바람이 불면서 정유사 간 시장 선점 경쟁이 치열한데 SK에너지가 출사표를 던졌다.

치킨 튀긴 식용유가 비행기 연료가 된다... SAF가 뭐길래?

SAF로 항공유 전체를 대체하기에는 무리가 있어 현재는 SAF를 항공유와 섞어 쓴다. 두 가지 방법이 있는데 하나는 100% SAF를 만든 다음 항공유에 원하는 만큼 물리적으로 섞는 것이고 또 하나는 생산 설비에 바이오원료와 석유 원료를 함께 넣고 공정을 거쳐 원하는 비율의 SAF를 생산하는 식으로 '코 프로세싱(Co-processing)'이라 불린다.

이를 커피에 비유하면 전자는 원두(바이오원료)로 에스프레소(100% SAF)를 만든 다음 물(항공유)을 섞어 아메리카노를 만드는 식이라면, 후자는 원두(바이오원료)와 물(석유원료)을 시작부터 한 번에 넣고 우려내 콜드브루를 제조하는 식에 가깝다.

SK에너지는 자체 코 프로세싱 방식으로 시장에 뛰어들었다. 대전 기술원에서 연구개발(R&D)을 통해 공정을 설계하고 2024년 9월 국내 최초로 울산에 150억 원을 들여 전용 생산 라인을 갖췄다. 폐식용유를 중국·인도 등에서 들여와 연간 10만 톤 수준의 5% SAF를 만들고 있다. 이 SAF는 유럽·캐세이퍼시픽항공·에어부산·대한항공 등에 보내진다.

정호승 SK이노베이션 지속가능Fuel 기술팀 팀장은 ""바이오원료를 섞으면 불순물 종류나 함량, 촉매 반응 결과, 저장 안정성 등이 달라져 R&D가 필요했다""며 ""바이오원료의 저장, 반응, 제품 생산까지 밸류 체인을 단계별로 연구했고 생길 수 있는 문제의 해법을 만들어 대량생산을 해냈다""고 설명했다.

에쓰오일·HD현대오일뱅크·GS칼텍스 등 다른 정유사들도 기존 생산 설비에서 코 프로세싱 공정으로 SAF를 만들어 국내외로 판매 중이다.

시장 커지는데 국산 100% SAF 생산은 언제쯤

탄소중립 움직임에 발맞춰 SAF 시장은 연 평균 46.2%씩 크게 성장해 2034년 746억 달러(108조 9,600억 원) 규모가 될 것이란 예측이 나온다. 특히 유엔 산하 국제민간항공기구(ICAO)의 국제항공 탄소상쇄·감축제도(CORSIA) 의무화에 따라 2027년부터 한국 등 193개 회원국은 국제 항공 온실가스 배출량을 2019년의 85%로 줄여야만 해 SAF가 필수적이다.

유럽연합(EU)은 올해 의무 비율을 2%로 시작해 2050년에는 70%까지 올린단 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 전체를 SAF로 대체한다는 목표다. 아시아에서는 일본이 2030년부터 10% 의무화를 로드맵을 발표했다.

업계에서는 전통 항공유 수출 1위 국가인 한국이 100% SAF 생산 설비를 갖추는 등 시장 경쟁력을 키워야 한다는 목소리가 나온다. 하지만 정유사들은 조 단위 투자가 필요해 적극 뛰어들기를 망설인다. 정부 지원이 필요하다는 얘기가 나오는 이유다. 일본은 석유화학기업인 이데미쓰고산의 생산 설비에 2,570억 원을 투입하고 생산 세액 공제 제도도 마련했다.",https://newsimg-hams.hankookilbo.com/2025/04/10/f701202c-6bab-438a-a4bf-2ef6b5ff09c3.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 11:58:06.192737
