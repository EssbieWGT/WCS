PARAMOUNT, California (Reuters) -In 2019, Scott Kirby, the chief executive of United Airlines, hailed its new contract with green jet fuel producer World Energy as an example for the aviation industry to follow in its drive to cut emissions.

Six years later, that collaboration is dead.

Boston-based World Energy was one of the first companies in the world to produce commercial quantities of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a type of renewable fuel made from sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues and other waste.

Its Paramount refinery near downtown Los Angeles had been a rare success story, supplying millions of gallons of SAF a year to airlines such as United Airlines and fellow U.S. carrier JetBlue Airways. The plant, which began operations in 2016, was central to the carriers' pledges to help the airline industry switch to a blend of 10% SAF by the end of this decade.

But the refinery quietly ceased operations in April. And World Energy's plans for a second plant in Houston have stalled amid a lack of commitment from the industry, according to Chief Executive Gene Gebolys.

""Some airlines were engaged in a pretty disingenuous effort to put out press releases"" overstating their commitment to SAF projects, Gebolys said, without naming any companies. ""People sometimes said too much in the past and did too little.""

Still, Gebolys acknowledged that some airlines have made a genuine effort to support SAF producers, while governments also needed to step up with stronger incentives to drive progress.

The termination of United's fuel purchase contract with World Energy - and the closure of the Paramount refinery - have not previously been reported.

United Airlines said it ended its relationship with World Energy ""a few years ago"", without providing a reason. A JetBlue spokesperson said World Energy has been a ""valued partner"" since 2020 and it will continue working with the company.

World Energy's struggles mirror the plight of dozens of clean fuel startups, according to a Reuters review of the sector. Nearly 20 years after the first commercial flight powered partly by biofuels made the short hop from London to Amsterdam, Reuters found that the airline industry's plans to go green before regulators start penalising them are little more than a pipe dream.

NO CLEAR PATHWAY

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecasts SAF will account for 0.7% of total jet fuel this year, up from 0.3% in 2024. Air passenger traffic, meanwhile, is expected to rise 6% this year, IATA says.

IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry's claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector's faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialised, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

Of the remaining projects, 23 have been abandoned, 27 are delayed or on indefinite hold, 31 have yet to produce any fuel, and 4 are SAF credit deals, where no physical fuel is delivered.

For the other 44 projects, Reuters was unable to find any public updates since their initial announcements.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That's about 10% of what's needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn't producing enough fuel.

""These guys are the cause of the problem, and they've got to start playing their part,"" said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

""I'd like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,"" Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

PARAMOUNT 'RESET'

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy's partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What's more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry's long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

'EXERCISE IN FUTILITY'

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

""This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,"" said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

NEW TECHNOLOGY

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.

This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery.
Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF.
The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.
“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production.","On the occasion of World Biodiesel Day, MOL Group highlights a recent milestone in its energy transition journey. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been successfully produced for the first time at INA’s Rijeka Refinery during a pilot project to process biocomponent, as well as a significant volume of renewable diesel HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil). This marks the second successful SAF and HVO production test within MOL Group, following an earlier pilot at Slovnaft’s Bratislava refinery. These underscore the company’s technological readiness and strategic commitment to alternative fuel development in meeting EU climate targets and enhancing regional energy security.

The successful pilot project at the Rijeka Refinery was implemented in cooperation with Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), the licensor of the refinery’s Hydrocracking Unit, with the aim of testing the co-processing of 5% POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent – a by-product of palm oil production) with fossil feedstocks. During the pilot, 1,000 tonnes of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) standard for sustainable biofuels.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties. During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s Central Testing Laboratory (CIL), while the biogenic content (C14 analysis) was carried out by accredited external laboratories – the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen.

Earlier this year, MOL Group’s Bratislava Refinery also conducted successful production tests of a diesel fuel containing HVO and SAF. HVO was produced using oil from cashew nut shells and the biocomponent produced this way was processed together with crude oil. In case of SAF, partially refined cooking oil was processed with the traditional raw material. The test proved that the Bratislava Refinery’s production unit used for the production of standard aviation kerosene is also suitable for producing sustainable aviation fuel.

MOL Group had been using the co-processing method at the Danube Refinery in Százhalombatta for years: the process reduces the emissions of traditional fuels by mixing plant residues, as the bio and fossil components are processed simultaneously directly during production.

Renewable fuels play a key role in MOL Group’s SHAPE TOMORROW strategy. The company is already a key player in both the Hungarian and regional biofuel markets, with hydrotreated vegetable oil produced from waste, i.e., renewable feedstock, being among the most climate-friendly fuel options, and ranks among the pioneers in Europe when it comes to the production of aviation biofuels.

“MOL Group already produces diesel and sustainable aviation fuel from renewable feedstocks and is ready to expand the production. This readiness underscores our strategic commitment to sustainable mobility—whether in road or air transport. For us, becoming a complex mobility service provider means offering an increasingly diverse range of fuels, thus creating all the necessary conditions for a smart energy transition for our customers. We are already playing a leading role in this process in the region, and we are determined to maintain this position through continued investments and innovation.” – said Csaba Zsótér, Senior Vice President, Fuels at MOL Group.

MOL Group is continuously researching and developing new possibilities for the production and use of biofuels. In partnership with Budapest Airport, Wizz Air, and Airport Fuel Supply Llc., MOL Group launched commercial testing of SAF in 2022 in Hungary. Building on this, the company now sells SAF as part of its regular operations in Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, in quantities equivalent to approximately 14 kilotons of biocomponents.

SAF can only be produced from classic renewable feedstocks (such as materials of vegetable origin) or waste, but it should meet the same technical and environmental specifications as conventional kerosene. Currently, very few refineries worldwide are equipped to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The current and projected global supply of SAF falls significantly short of demand, as reflected in prices. This is why MOL Group’s developments are of strategic importance, both from a climate protection and supply security perspective.",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mol-group.png,N,,2025-08-11 06:56:15.458072

The challenges for Velocys began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys’s English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

In response to criticism, the journal decided to address the comments but not engage directly with Kennedy's assertions.

In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history.
Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.","IATA has set a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a target that would require airlines to ramp up SAF use to 118 billion gallons annually, a more than 300-fold increase from current production.

Airline industry leaders point to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy.

However, the aviation sector has yet to publish a comprehensive roadmap or a transparent database of upcoming SAF projects that would allow regulators and the public to assess the credibility of these projections.

To scrutinise the industry's claims, Reuters built its own database of airline SAF initiatives - offering the most comprehensive view yet of the sector's faltering green progress and revealing that the industry has no clear pathway to hitting net zero targets.

While airlines have announced 165 SAF projects over the past 12 years, only 36 have materialised, Reuters found. Among those, Reuters uncovered problems at three of the largest - including World Energy - that exemplify the systemic challenges plaguing the SAF sector.

Of the remaining projects, 23 have been abandoned, 27 are delayed or on indefinite hold, 31 have yet to produce any fuel, and 4 are SAF credit deals, where no physical fuel is delivered.

For the other 44 projects, Reuters was unable to find any public updates since their initial announcements.

If all the pending projects announced by airlines reached their maximum potential, it would only add 12 billion gallons of SAF production, the Reuters analysis found. That's about 10% of what's needed to hit the net zero target.

Airlines pin the problems on the oil industry, saying it isn't producing enough fuel.

""These guys are the cause of the problem, and they've got to start playing their part,"" said Willie Walsh, director of IATA, the global airline lobby, and a former chief executive of British Airways and its parent International Airlines Group.

At the moment, SAF costs three to five times more than jet fuel and some oil company executives argue that there is limited demand from airlines at current prices.

""I'd like there to be a shortage. I actually see an overcapacity,"" Bernard Pinatel, the head of downstream and marketing and services at TotalEnergies, told a press briefing in June.

PARAMOUNT 'RESET'

The Paramount refinery, which used cooking oil and animal fat from a local abattoir to make fuel, repeatedly stumbled in its efforts to expand and all 35 employees were laid off in April, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The future of the plant is uncertain, the two people said, after World Energy's partner, Air Products, withdrew from the project in February, citing challenging commercial conditions tied to the expansion and operations. Air Products, a U.S. industrial gases and chemicals company, had been slated to lead a $2 billion expansion of the site.

World Energy CEO Gebolys said Paramount's closure was a ""reset"" because the refurbishment was over budget and behind schedule. He said it would come back online, without giving a time frame. He declined to comment about the layoffs.

According to more than a dozen people directly involved in the sector, airlines play minimal roles in the execution of projects and, in most cases, their only commitment is to buy SAF when their partners produce it.

What's more, airlines are making bold projections about SAF use and emissions reductions based on unproven technologies or early-stage projects run by startups with no experience of commercial production, Reuters found.

Of the 36 projects that have produced any SAF, all but one rely on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process to convert waste oils, fats and grease into jet fuel. HEFA was the technology used at Paramount.

However, HEFA plants are severely constrained by the limited availability of suitable raw materials and cannot meet the industry's long-term fuel demands, three industry specialists said.

IATA chief economist and sustainability executive Marie Owens Thomsen disputed the idea airlines only play a minimal role, saying they were striking SAF purchase agreements and investing in new technologies, supporting early-stage innovation and collaborating with research institutions.

She also said alternative ways of making SAF needed to be developed alongside HEFA, as this process alone would not be sufficient to produce enough fuel to hit net zero by 2050.

'EXERCISE IN FUTILITY'

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide. This figure is expected to rise as air traffic more than doubles from 2019 levels by 2050 and fuel use rises 59%, according to environmental advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

By painting a picture of imminent breakthroughs and success in producing SAF at scale, airlines can bolster their green credentials while deflecting pressure for more disruptive interventions, such as stricter emissions caps or higher carbon taxes, the group said.

""This is first and foremost about justifying never-ending growth and pretending that you can do that without heating the planet more and more - which you cannot do,"" said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner with advocacy group Biofuelwatch.

Failing to find a solution could prove costly. Under new EU rules, airlines face escalating mandates to use SAF on flights departing from EU airports. The mandate starts with at least 2% of their fuel in 2025, climbing to 6% by 2030, and eventually hitting 70% by 2050.

European SAF mandates are expected to cost airlines $2.9 billion in additional fuel purchases and compliance expenses this year, according to IATA estimates.

The return to power of U.S. President Donald Trump could further hamper the industry's green transition. Trump has pledged to roll back many incentives his predecessor, Joe Biden, offered to SAF and other green energy projects.

As projects flounder in the United States, the U.S. airline industry has pinned hopes on a new SAF bonanza in Panama. It's already hitting the skids, Reuters found.

SGP BioEnergy, headquartered in New York, pledged in 2022 to build the world's largest SAF facility, in collaboration with the government of Panama. The plant is to make green fuel from industrial hemp oil and used cooking oil.

Due to start this year, production has been pushed back to 2027. SGP BioEnergy Chief Executive Randy Letang said the delay was largely due to airlines showing less interest in backing SAF projects than in the past.

Panama's energy secretary did not respond to a request for comment.

After the plant opens, the company may switch to making renewable diesel for trucks and ships, because those industries showed more enthusiasm than aviation, Letang said.

""We're only going to take it so far with SAF until we determine whether or not the airlines are actually serious about making the commitments for this fuel,"" he said.

Letang said airlines were competing to announce their own marquee projects, when producers actually needed consortiums made up of many carriers to invest in large-scale projects.

""That's how you build this industry. Without that, it's an exercise in futility, quite frankly,"" he said. ""The airlines could do a lot more.""

A few years ago, Letang was striking big SAF deals with major airlines through his previous biofuels venture, SG Preston. In 2016, JetBlue announced a 10-year commitment to buy commercial volumes of green fuel from SG Preston, calling it one of the largest such deals in history. JetBlue said in 2021 it would double down on the deal as it pursued a target to use SAF for 8% of its fuel needs by 2023.

Australia's Qantas Airways signed a similar 10-year deal with SG Preston in 2017 for 8 million gallons of SAF annually starting in 2020 to help power flights between Los Angeles and Australia.

The deals were based on SG Preston's plan to build five plants across North America - two in Ohio and one each in Indiana, Michigan, and Ontario. None has been built.

SG Preston filed for bankruptcy in 2022, according to company filings. A spokesperson for Letang's current firm, SGP BioEnergy, said the two companies had no affiliation.

NEW TECHNOLOGY

While most SAF projects rely on HEFA, British startup Velocys uses Fischer-Tropsch technology, which converts waste such as garbage, wood chips, or flared gas into clean fuel.

IAG - the parent of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus - has been an enthusiastic backer, announcing four major SAF initiatives with Velocys over the past 15 years. But despite producing SAF in pilot projects, none of the Velocys projects has reached commercial production.

Its challenges began in 2010 with a project to turn methane from a London landfill into jet fuel. That venture collapsed when its main backer went bankrupt.

Since then Velocys has attempted to build its own plants - including in Oklahoma - but it has proven too costly and technically challenging.

After shutting the Oklahoma plant, Velocys shifted focus to two new projects: one at Immingham in northeast England and another in Mississippi.

British oil major Shell and IAG initially backed Velocys's English venture, and the British government awarded a 27 million pound ($37 million) grant in 2022, then another 3 million pounds in July. However, Shell backed out in 2021 to pursue its own SAF ventures. Shell declined further comment.

While IAG has no purchase deal with Velocys, it maintains a partnership and expects production to begin in 2029.

Velocys Chief Executive Matthew Viergutz remains optimistic, saying the company has learned from past setbacks. However, the Mississippi project is on hold pending clarity on U.S. SAF regulations.

The Immingham project was meant to start supplying British Airways last year. The plant site is a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side.

Velocys has yet to sell a drop of green jet fuel to IAG or any other airline.

Now in its ninth year, the increasingly influential list has become an industry bellwether for where airline innovation is heading and what’s worth backing.

This year, the airline group – which includes British Airways and Iberia – is placing its biggest bets on AI and climate tech. The startups are drawn from 11 countries and, for the first time, split into two streams.

New for 2025 is a “Discover” track for early-stage startups, particularly those in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and energy transition tech. These 15 companies will participate in a six-month mentoring program to prepare them for possible future deployment.

It runs alongside the more commercially focused ""Deploy"" track, which offers 12-week proofs of concept directly with IAG operating companies.

The IAGi Accelerator is the group’s flagship innovation program, fast-tracking collaboration with startups across six focus areas including AI, robotics, sustainability, and next-gen computing.

Speaking exclusively to Skift, Nisha Basson-Mugnier, IAG’s innovation principal, explained the new dual strategy: “We saw the opportunity to engage with early-stage deep-tech startups in a better way. We’ve worked with these types of companies before in our traditional format, but launched the Discover track to reflect how much activity and innovation we’re now seeing – especially in the energy transition space.”

SAF is seen as the most scalable near-term solution to decarbonize long-haul flying – and regulators in both the EU and UK are beginning to mandate its use.

The study will examine opportunities for shared CO2 capture, transport and storage infrastructure, aiming to reduce costs compared to individual projects. Each partner will be involved in at least one hub, comprising centralised capture, transport, and storage facilities.

“With more than 1 billion tonnes of production a year in Asia coming from blast furnace capacity that is relatively early in its production life, it’s important for industry to decarbonise existing steelmaking assets,” said Dr Ben Ellis, Vice President Marketing Sustainability at BHP.

Running until the end of 2026, the study will set out preliminary plans for each hub, including cost estimates, construction timelines, and potential commercialisation pathways.

Steel production accounts for around 7% of global CO2 emissions annually, with demand projected to rise 30% by 2050, according to the World Economic Forum. JSW Group’s targets align with this challenge.

“We aim to reduce our CO2 emissions intensity in steelmaking by 42% by 2030 from a base year of 2005 and achieve net neutral carbon emissions by 2050,” said Prabodha Acharya, Chief Sustainability Officer at JSW Group.

However, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) notes that capture rates remain low at the world’s only commercial-scale CCUS facility for gas-based steel production.

The Al Reyadah plant in the UAE captured less than 20% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2020 and 2021, and 26% in 2022 after its owner EMSTEEL switched to nuclear and solar power for electricity.

EMSTEEL and Masdar are now pursuing alternative decarbonisation pathways, including green hydrogen, following the launch of its DRI-EAF pilot project last year.

“Green hydrogen is an essential element in advancing national and global decarbonisation efforts and we are proud to be at the forefront of that endeavour,” said Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Masdar CEO.

IEEFA warns that a broader industry shift towards DRI technologies could sideline CCUS in steelmaking, as happened in power generation, where projects such as the UK’s £1bn CCS programme and the US Kemper plant were cancelled after policy shifts and cost overruns, leaving few operational facilities.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2022/12/shutterstock_1624978153.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 06:56:50.777670

In the not-so-distant past, Suneet Singal was known as a standout figure in the world of real estate, an industry where ambition towers as high as the buildings he helped finance. Nowadays, he can be found discussing clean energy strategies with entrepreneurs or collaborating with engineers on biomass infrastructure. His pivot from concrete to carbon strategy represents a striking evolution, but for Singal, it’s simply the logical next step in a career driven by value creation. Only now, the value he seeks isn’t just financial, it’s environmental, commercial, and generational.

As nations around the world scramble to meet emissions targets, balance energy security, and maintain economic competitiveness, he has positioned himself as a key advisor and voice of reason in a sector too often caught between idealism and inertia. Singal is not interested in greenwashing or ungrounded optimism. He’s interested in solutions, especially the ones that generate both profit and progress.

Given his real estate background, where asset management, risk, and return are deeply intertwined, Singal brings a fiscally conservative lens to climate innovation. “It’s not a zero-sum game between economic strength and environmental stewardship. With the right strategies and incentives, the two can reinforce each other. We can meet domestic needs and create products that serve global markets. It’s not about abandoning values, it’s about elevating them. Competition, innovation, and independence should be the cornerstones of leadership in this space,” he explains.

That philosophy is taking shape across several verticals. In the Southern U.S., for instance, Singal is involved in projects leveraging the region’s abundant biomass and cutting-edge carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) infrastructure. According to industry reports, the U.S. Gulf Coast is on track to become a CCS leader, with more than 80 million metric tons of annual capacity in development. These hubs don’t just store emissions — they enable large-scale industrial decarbonization and could unlock export-ready carbon solutions in a rapidly evolving energy marketplace.

But Singal’s model of leadership doesn’t stop at state lines. He champions commercial partnerships that allow U.S.-based technologies to meet sustainability needs across international markets. These aren’t philanthropic ventures; they’re built around shared commercial interests. The idea is simple: if advanced biofuels or clean hydrogen can be produced at scale using American expertise, they can serve global demand while driving value at home.

He’s particularly focused on market pathways that allow companies to deploy U.S. feedstocks and processing technology through strategically located facilities, whether domestically or abroad. These kinds of efforts reduce supply chain volatility and allow private firms to meet growing international sustainability standards on competitive terms.

Clean hydrogen, for instance, is rapidly gaining momentum in the energy sector. In the U.S., initiatives like the Hydrogen Shot aim to dramatically reduce production costs and expand availability. Singal sees a direct role for private innovators in scaling these technologies — not just in producing them, but in aligning infrastructure, investment, and supply chain capacity for long-term impact.

Singal’s role in these ecosystems is not that of a public official or lobbyist, but of a translator, someone who can bridge policy, capital, and industrial know-how. He speaks the language of markets as fluently as that of environmental science. His background allows him to see beyond short-term incentives and understand how lasting infrastructure must be structured to drive results and attract capital.

That’s why he’s cautious about overly relying on subsidies or temporary tax relief. “If your business model only works because of handouts, it’s not a business, it’s a liability,” he says. “We need to build systems that are cost-competitive and resilient to external factors. That’s what buyers want, and it’s what responsible entrepreneurship demands.”

True to his private-sector roots, Singal is a staunch advocate for U.S.-based production. But he also believes American products must be globally relevant. “Serving international markets from a domestic base isn’t just smart, it’s strategic. When we export real solutions, we shape global trends, create jobs, and keep capital circulating inside our economy.”

This pragmatic approach is resonating with business leaders across multiple sectors, especially those looking to align growth with sustainability without losing sight of cost discipline. Singal often consults with executives exploring how to make sustainability work for their bottom lines. His message is consistent: decarbonization doesn’t have to mean deindustrialization. With smart policy frameworks and entrepreneurial leadership, the U.S. can lead the next generation of energy and infrastructure technologies.

This thinking is particularly relevant in the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector, a space Singal is deeply involved in. As airlines face increasing pressure to reduce emissions, the challenge lies in building a cost-effective, scalable supply of sustainable fuel. Singal’s work is focused on unlocking that potential by leveraging U.S. feedstocks such as agricultural residues and woody biomass, and refining them either domestically or through select global processing hubs. The result is a more reliable, politically stable supply chain that meets international standards without compromising competitiveness.

At the core of Singal’s philosophy is a belief in alignment between market opportunity and sustainability, between growth and responsibility. He rejects the notion that environmentally conscious business must come at the expense of fiscal discipline or national strength. He is also attentive to how critical energy assets are structured, with a preference for domestic control and transparent investment models.

“We should be exporting our capabilities and leadership, not our control. Climate progress isn’t about compliance, it’s about direction. If we want to shape the future, we need to lead it on our terms,” he says.

Singal’s influence continues to grow as businesses seek practical roadmaps for navigating the green transition. His ability to bring clarity to complex systems and connect industrial ambition with environmental responsibility makes him a valuable advisor to executives and stakeholders looking for more than slogans. His model is based on mutual value: the private sector drives innovation, markets reward impact, and industries transition without losing their edge.

There’s something deeply American about Singal’s story. His career trajectory perfectly encompasses both the American Dream and a thirst for making the world a better place. His work doesn’t make headlines every day, but it’s shaping how governments and businesses alike think about the green transition, not as a burden, but as an opportunity for U.S. strength and global cooperation.

“The next decade will determine who leads the global economy, and it won’t just be about output, but about purpose. America has the tools: capital, technology, and talent. If we lead with intention, the results will follow. This is a moment not just for innovation, but for leadership that lasts.” He concluded.",https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1592-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 06:57:07.797860

The Structural Decline of Aviation

The aviation sector's struggles are rooted in its inability to adapt to a post-pandemic world. While passenger numbers are surging (5.2 billion in 2025), the cost of serving these customers is rising faster. Labor costs alone are projected to grow by 7.6% in 2025, driven by a 4% increase in the global workforce to 3.3 million employees. Airlines are paying premiums to attract and retain pilots, mechanics, and cabin crew, with wages rising 10–15% annually in key markets. Meanwhile, fuel costs—though down 4.8% due to lower oil prices—still account for 26.4% of operating expenses, and compliance with carbon offset programs (CORSIA) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates will add $4.8 billion to industry costs in 2025.

Infrastructure bottlenecks compound these issues. Airports are struggling to modernize aging systems, while supply chain disruptions for aircraft parts have pushed lead times to over a year. Airbus's A350 production is capped at six units per month, and the industry's reliance on rare earth elements for electrification efforts creates new vulnerabilities. Geopolitical risks—ranging from U.S. trade policy shifts to conflicts in Europe and the Middle East—add further uncertainty.

The Workforce Crisis: A Talent Drain and Retention Quagmire

The aviation workforce is in turmoil. The IATA Global Skills Survey highlights a critical shortage of pilots and technicians, with training bottlenecks delaying hiring by 18–24 months. Airlines are caught in a vicious cycle: higher wages to attract talent erode margins, while automation and AI adoption risk displing workers. For example, AI-driven cockpit assistance and single-pilot operations are already under scrutiny by pilot unions, who fear safety compromises. Meanwhile, the rise of space tourism and defense aerospace is siphoning talent away from traditional aviation, exacerbating the ""brain drain.""

Labor costs are no longer a line item but a strategic liability. Low-cost carriers, which once thrived on razor-thin margins, are now grappling with a 20% projected shortfall in maintenance technicians by 2028. Full-service airlines are not immune; their focus on premium services and crew welfare has led to a 6.7% rise in labor costs, outpacing revenue growth. The result? A sector where even modest profitability gains are offset by rising operational fragility.

Infrastructure Fragility: A System on the Brink

The aviation industry's infrastructure is a patchwork of outdated systems and unmet modernization needs. Air traffic control (ATC) systems in the U.S., India, and parts of Africa remain decades behind global standards, contributing to delays and safety risks. The 2024 FAA Reauthorization allocated $105.5 billion to modernize ATC, but progress is glacial. Meanwhile, the integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and AI-driven logistics is stymied by regulatory inertia and incompatible legacy systems.

Environmental regulations add another layer of complexity. The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation mandate—requiring a 70% SAF blend by 2050—has pushed airlines into uncharted financial territory. SAF costs are 2–3 times higher than conventional jet fuel, and production capacity remains insufficient. Airlines are caught between regulatory compliance and shareholder expectations, with many forced to pass costs to consumers through higher ticket prices.

The Case for Sector Rotation: Resilient Alternatives

As aviation's structural weaknesses crystallize, investors must pivot to sectors poised to benefit from the post-aviation travel shift. Three areas stand out: rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms.

1. Rail: The Digital Renaissance of Connectivity

The global digital railway market is projected to grow from $83.74 billion in 2024 to $230.60 billion by 2034, driven by AI, IoT, and 5G integration. Governments in Asia Pacific—led by India, China, and South Korea—are investing heavily in smart infrastructure, with digital rail systems enhancing freight logistics and passenger mobility. For example, Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) reported a 100-basis-point improvement in its operating ratio to 59.0% in Q2 2025, driven by higher freight volumes and core pricing gains. Its free cash flow of $1.105 billion year-to-date underscores the sector's resilience.

2. Regional Logistics: The Urbanization-Driven Boom

Urbanization and e-commerce are fueling demand for regional logistics networks. In Asia Pacific, where 60% of the global population growth is concentrated, companies are leveraging AI and IoT to optimize last-mile delivery. The region's logistics sector is expected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2030, outpacing global averages. Investors should target firms with exposure to smart warehousing, drone delivery, and cross-border e-commerce platforms.

3. Digital Travel Platforms: The Integrated Future of Mobility

Digital travel platforms are emerging as undervalued beneficiaries of the aviation sector's decline. As airlines face fare volatility and operational inefficiencies, travelers are increasingly relying on integrated platforms that combine rail, regional air, and digital services. These platforms, which leverage AI for route optimization and real-time booking, are projected to capture 30% of the global travel market by 2030.

Conclusion: A Strategic Reallocation Imperative

The aviation industry's perfect storm—structural decline, labor instability, and infrastructure fragility—demands immediate portfolio reallocation. Investors who cling to airlines risk being caught in a sector where even modest gains are offset by systemic risks. By contrast, rail, regional logistics, and digital travel platforms offer a path to resilience, growth, and long-term value creation.

How IMARC Can Help Stakeholders Navigate the Global Air Freight Market To capitalize on growth and navigate the complexities of the global air freight industry, stakeholders require more than just data—they need a strategic partner.","Speed, reliability, and supply chain precision have become cornerstones of global commerce. As businesses operate across borders and customers expect shorter delivery times, the need to move products efficiently across continents has become essential. Air freight isn’t just connecting time zones—it’s enabling fast, predictable service that modern logistics depend on.

Driven by the need for speed and reliability, the global air freight market is on an upward trajectory, estimated at USD 319.4 Billion in 2024. With a steady compound growth of 4.9% expected through 2025 to 2033, the sector is forecast to reach USD 492.7 Billion by 2033. As disruptions challenge global supply chains, air freight emerges as a critical enabler of continuity and efficiency.

This article outlines six major forces behind the expansion of international air freight, each contributing to its rising demand and shaping the future of global logistics.

1. E-commerce Expansion Is Boosting Air Freight Demand

Online shopping continues to grow at double-digit rates worldwide, changing how consumers order and how businesses deliver. With mobile commerce rising and platforms becoming more global, buyers now expect orders within days—even when shipped internationally. This shift has pushed businesses to make air freight central to their fulfillment approach.

For instance, Amazon Air has reshaped India's e-commerce delivery by operating the only dedicated air cargo fleet in the country, currently using two aircraft to transport tens of thousands of packages daily. Since its 2023 launch connecting four major cities, it has expanded to serve 12 cities via air and multimodal air-rail networks, covering over 100 origin-destination pairs. Amazon Air significantly boosts next-day delivery with over 99% on-time performance, overcoming India’s logistical challenges through precise overnight operations, enhancing delivery speed, reliability, and scale ahead of events like Prime Day.

Similarly, in March 2025, CEVA Logistics launched a direct air charter between Wuxi and Chicago to meet growing e-commerce demand, increasing trans-Pacific capacity and shortening delivery times for online retailers. Retailers, DTC brands, and global marketplaces are using air cargo to meet fast delivery expectations and provide consistent service. Fulfillment centers are being located near major airports to support this.

Key Drivers:

Demand for fast, cross-border delivery

Growth of mobile-first and international online retail

Dependence on air cargo for time-sensitive, high-value goods

Fulfillment networks redesigned around airport access

Retailers are also offering premium delivery options that rely heavily on air transport, as more customers are willing to pay for guaranteed speed. As e-commerce reaches deeper into emerging markets, air freight will continue to play a vital role in expanding reach and meeting service standards.

2. Global Trade Growth Is Lifting International Air Cargo

Cross-border trade continues to fuel economic activity, and its recovery is driving up air freight volumes. As companies expand their sourcing and sales internationally, they’re leaning more on fast, dependable shipping solutions.

In June 2025, global air cargo demand grew modestly by 0.8% year-on-year, driven by a 9.0% surge in Asia-Pacific amid trade tensions and military conflicts impacting other regions. Capacity rose 1.7%, but load factor declined to 45.5%. North America and the Middle East saw notable demand drops (-8.3% and -3.2%, respectively), while Europe had minimal growth (0.8%). Key trade lanes like Europe-Asia (+10.6%) expanded, contrasting with declines on Asia-North America (-4.8%). Lower jet fuel prices and global manufacturing recovery underpin mixed regional performance.

Air freight remains especially important in sectors where delays aren’t an option. Pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and precision equipment all require fast, secure, and compliant delivery.

Key Drivers:

Increased global trade activity

Multi-region supply chain expansion

Fast delivery needs in regulated or high-value industries

Use of air cargo for urgent or just-in-time shipments

Multinational manufacturers are using air freight to avoid production delays caused by late components. In complex supply chains, quick shipping ensures smooth operations—especially during peak seasons or amid policy changes.

3. Fleet Expansion and Route Optimization Support Growth

Modernization of cargo fleets is helping the air freight sector keep pace with demand. Airlines are adding wide-body freighters and upgrading aircraft for better efficiency and cargo space. These investments give operators more flexibility along busy routes.

For instance, between March 2024 and March 2025, Amazon Air expanded its U.S. fleet’s cargo capabilities, with a 14% increase in weight capacity and a 12.9% rise in volume. The fleet now includes ten Airbus A330-300 freighters, seven of which joined within the last year. These widebody jets surpass the Boeing 767-300s—Amazon’s second-largest aircraft—in carrying capacity, offering 17% more in tonnage and 6% more in volume. Widebody aircraft now account for more than 75% of Amazon’s domestic available ton-miles, a sharp rise from figures reported three years earlier.

Passenger airlines are also using cargo space on long-haul flights, allowing for extra volume without deploying dedicated freighters. This approach has been key during peak demand or lower passenger traffic.

Key Drivers:

Larger freighter fleets on major trade lanes

Increased use of cargo holds in passenger aircraft

Upgraded airport cargo terminals and logistics hubs

Smarter routing and AI-based network planning

Airport investments are improving infrastructure, from cold storage and automation to customs pre-clearance. In May 2025, AISATS opened a new logistics park at Bengaluru Airport featuring cold chain capabilities, automated handling, and integrated customs systems. These updates reduce delays and boost capacity, making air freight more dependable.

4. Technology Is Reshaping Air Freight Operations

Digital tools are improving every stage of the air freight process. Carriers and logistics firms are adopting automation, predictive models, and real-time tracking to give customers better visibility and control.

Today’s shippers expect to monitor shipments end-to-end, receive live updates on delays, and track environmental conditions like temperature or vibration. This is especially crucial in sectors like biotech, electronics, and aerospace.

In June 2025, Etihad Cargo rolled out SmartTrack, a sensor-based tracking platform offering real-time shipment data, condition monitoring, and improved oversight. Similarly, cargo.one introduced AI-powered automation and unified workflows to streamline air freight quoting for forwarders in July 2025. It automates shipment data extraction, rate collection, and consolidates all rates—including ad hoc and manual airline rates—into a single platform. A central queue enhances team collaboration, syncing quotes with TMS for faster processing and higher conversion. These innovations boost efficiency by eliminating manual tasks, allowing focus on customer relationships and strategic activities.

Key Drivers:

Use of IoT, GPS, and smart containers

AI-powered forecasting and dispatch systems

Online booking and rate comparison tools

Blockchain-enabled customs and documentation

By reducing manual steps and improving tracking, digital platforms help teams plan more efficiently and avoid surprises. These improvements also support better communication and service quality, which strengthens customer relationships.

5. Adapting to Shifting Trade Policies and Geopolitics

Changing trade agreements, tariffs, and customs rules are forcing businesses to rethink logistics strategies. In these cases, air freight offers the speed and adaptability needed to respond quickly.

Shifts in trade policies—most notably the United States’ elimination of the de minimis threshold for low-value imports from China in May 2025—have significantly disrupted established air freight patterns. This policy change led to a sharp 27% year-over-year drop in air cargo volumes from China to the U.S., prompting a global reconfiguration of trade routes and supply chain strategies. Furthermore, deals like the RCEP and updates to the USMCA have led companies to revise trade lanes. Many now use air shipping to avoid congested or unstable routes and take advantage of new corridors.

Key Drivers:

Introduction of new trade agreements

Shift to air cargo to bypass maritime or rail bottlenecks

Growth of intra-regional air networks due to nearshoring

Streamlined customs and faster compliance processes

When trade rules shift, delays can disrupt sourcing, production, and fulfillment. Air freight gives companies flexibility to reroute goods, stay compliant, and keep inventory moving—even with short notice.

6. Sustainability Is Becoming a Core Focus

Environmental concerns are no longer optional—they’re a priority across logistics. As pressure builds from regulators, investors, and customers, air freight providers are adopting cleaner technologies and better emissions tracking.

Carriers are increasing use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), upgrading to fuel-efficient aircraft, and switching to electric vehicles for ground handling. In April 2025, IATA launched a global SAF Registry through CADO, enabling airlines to track SAF usage and cut lifecycle emissions. According to the IATA, global production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to double in 2025, reaching approximately 2 million tons. This would account for about 0.7% of the total fuel consumed by airlines worldwide—a notable rise from the 0.3% share in 2024. Despite the growth, SAF still comprises a relatively small fraction of overall aviation fuel use, highlighting the considerable gap that remains to meet net-zero emission targets.

Key Drivers:

Wider adoption of SAF and cleaner propulsion

New aircraft with better fuel efficiency

Solar-powered, energy-efficient terminals

Built-in emissions tracking in freight platforms

Shippers are also driving change. Many now ask for carbon data in bids and prefer carriers with certified green programs. As carbon regulations expand, sustainable air freight is becoming the new standard—not a premium offering. To meet the growing demand, Neste commenced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production at its Rotterdam refinery in April 2025, boosting its global SAF capacity to 1.5 million tons annually. The refinery, capable of producing up to 500,000 tons of SAF yearly, is undergoing expansion to increase renewable fuel output to 2.7 million tons by 2027, making it the largest renewable diesel and SAF facility worldwide. Neste’s total renewable fuels capacity will reach 6.8 million tons, with SAF capacity growing to 2.2 million tons, strengthening its role in reducing aviation emissions.

Why Air Freight Matters Now More Than Ever

Air freight is growing rapidly, powered by rising e-commerce, global trade, smarter logistics, and sustainability goals. These drivers are not just trends—they’re reshaping how goods move internationally.

Air cargo’s speed, precision, and adaptability make it essential in today’s complex supply networks. Companies that invest in the right tools, infrastructure, and partnerships will be better equipped to meet demand, reduce risk, and expand their reach.

Looking ahead, those leading in both delivery speed and emissions performance will define the next chapter of international freight. Now is the time to rethink strategies and act.

Challenges and Constraints Despite the strong growth outlook, the Alcohol To Jet ATJ Fuel Market faces notable challenges. High production costs compared to conventional jet fuel remain a key constraint, although these are expected to decline as economies of scale improve. Feedstock competition with food production can also limit raw material availability, necessitating a focus on waste-based and non-food biomass sources. Regulatory approval processes for new fuel pathways can be lengthy, slowing market entry for innovative technologies. Infrastructure limitations, such as blending facilities and distribution networks, can hinder widespread adoption. Additionally, volatility in crude oil prices can impact the competitiveness of ATJ fuels, influencing airline procurement decisions. Addressing these barriers will require coordinated action from governments, industry stakeholders, and research institutions to ensure sustained growth and market penetration.

Opportunities The Alcohol To Jet ATJ Fuel Market holds vast opportunities for innovation and expansion. Continued advancements in conversion technologies can significantly enhance yield and reduce costs, making ATJ fuels more competitive with conventional options. Expansion into emerging markets with growing air travel demand offers considerable revenue potential, especially in regions with abundant biomass resources. Partnerships with airports for dedicated SAF infrastructure can streamline distribution and blending, improving adoption rates. The integration of ATJ fuel production with carbon capture and utilization technologies can further enhance environmental benefits and attract additional regulatory incentives. Moreover, rising corporate commitments to net-zero emissions present opportunities for long-term offtake agreements, providing revenue stability and encouraging investment in large-scale facilities. Investment in research to explore novel feedstock types, such as algae-derived alcohols, could also unlock new pathways for sustainable fuel production.

The visit showcases ongoing successful collaboration between the two organisations and underlines commitment to scaling up the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK.

During the visit, Ms Moynihan met with Firefly’s leadership team, toured the site, and reviewed progress on the development of SAF production capabilities. The discussions focused on the importance of SAF in driving aviation decarbonisation and on the innovative technologies being developed at Firefly to produce SAF from sewage sludge – a low-cost, waste-based feedstock with strong decarbonisation potential.

The site, which is owned by Haltermann Carless, is located with existing infrastructure to upgrade the fuel and strong transport links to London airports.

Firefly is on track to meet their proposed completion date on the first facility in 2029, with additional facilities planned across several other geographies. The Harwich facility will bring new green energy jobs to the area and enjoys strong support from local MPs and residents. The project is expected to contribute to UK energy security while creating a much-needed new disposal pathway for sewage waste.

Despite challenging global M&A market conditions, Chinese investments in Brazil jumped 64 percent year-over-year, though deal count dropped, signalling a mature shift toward fewer but larger, high-impact acquisitions.

This momentum accelerated following Brazilian President Lula's May 2025 Beijing visit, which secured over $4.5 billion in new Chinese investments [2], including: Envision Group ($1 billion sustainable aviation fuel), CGN Power (~$529 million wind/solar), Great Wall Motors (~$1.05 billion automotive), and Longsys (~$423 million semiconductors).

Energy and Critical Minerals Drive Investment Wave

A&M analysis of 94 Chinese investments over the past five years shows Energy and Natural Resources accounting for 85 percent of total announced deal value—over $19 billion.

Chinese companies are spearheading Brazil's renewable transformation: State Power Investment Corp leads major solar projects including the Luiz Gonzaga Complex, China Three Gorges has invested $68 million in hydro projects, and State Grid secured nearly $5 billion for transmission infrastructure. This supports Brazil's standout energy profile—90 percent of electricity from low-carbon sources, far outpacing the 41 percent global average [3].

China's focus on critical minerals, especially lithium, underpins this trend with major deals worth over $2.2 billion since August 2020. Brazil's emerging ""Lithium Valley"" offers compelling advantages: high-grade spodumene deposits, competitive production costs, and strategic proximity to US and European markets.

Strategic Spotlights

EVs: Chinese cars have become ubiquitous in Brazilian streets, with rapidly increasing market share. Chinese automakers captured 80 percent of Brazil's EV market share in the first half of 2025 [4], with BYD dominating pure electric vehicles at over 75 percent market share [5]. Local manufacturing by BYD and Great Wall Motors, combined with Geely's Renault partnership, further demonstrate strategic localization approaches, while positioning Brazil as Latin America's EV export hub.

Tech Expansion: Chinese technology companies are making strategic advances into Brazil's food delivery service industry. Meituan plans to invest $1 billion over five years to launch Keeta, representing a direct challenge to dominant player iFood [6], while DiDi relaunched operations through 99 Food in 2025 after a previous suspension [7]. These moves signal Chinese tech firms' search for growth overseas amid intense home-market competition.

AI Opportunity: Brazil's AI market is projected to reach $4.42 billion by 2025, and $17.91 billion by 2031 [8]. Brazilian Government support through the R$23 billion National AI Plan and renewable energy mandates for data centers creates opportunities for tech giants like Huawei (cloud service since 2019) and Tencent (São Paulo data center since 2021). Brazil is emerging as a key AI battleground where Chinese expertise offers an advantage, but success requires local partnerships to navigate evolving regulations and seize growth opportunities.

A&M Cross-Border Expertise

Successful China-Brazil investment execution requires deep expertise across regulatory environments, cultural contexts, and operational complexities. A&M brings deep expertise in helping Chinese companies access the Brazilian market and vice-versa, with experienced professionals in both countries.

A&M Strategic Recommendations

For Chinese Companies:

Deploy real-time BRICS market intelligence—track minerals, renewable incentives, and regulatory shifts.

Carefully vet local partners—select customs, tax, and compliance experts with China-Brazil credentials to avoid surprises.

Identify funding partners early—prioritize those with local market coverage and currency capabilities.

Accelerate your market-entry timeline—fast-track manufacturing to get ahead of rising EV tariffs.

For Brazilian Businesses:

Integrate beyond raw exports—move up the value chain with processing and battery-pack capabilities.

Build EV supply-chain readiness—align processes with leading OEM standards.

Actively leverage digital partnerships—collaborate with Chinese tech leaders for e-commerce, AI, and logistics.

For Investment Professionals:

Shift focus to deal quality—prioritize fewer, higher-impact transactions.

Target ""Lithium Valley"" advantages—rigorously assess asset quality and cost structures.

Evaluate AI and green energy platforms—capitalize on incentives and Brazil's strong renewables profile.

Position Brazil as a BRICS hedge—diversify strategies to leverage Brazil's rising influence in EV and critical minerals amid global trade volatility.

Forshaw said the introduction of a 1-2 per cent mandate would provide the signal needed for investors to commit to new local sustainable aviation fuel projects and help safeguard Australia’s long-term fuel supply.
These “IEA days” include fuel on ships bound for Australia as well as that stored domestically.
A government spokesman said Labor had invested $250 million in the low-carbon liquid fuel industry through its Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.","The local boss of aviation juggernaut Airbus warns that Australia is at risk of sleepwalking into a fuel security crisis and missing its long-term climate targets unless the government forces airlines to use sustainable fuel.

Airbus Australia’s chief representative, Stephen Forshaw, said a mandate of between 1 per cent and 2 per cent on the use of sustainable fuels by aircraft would kickstart a local biofuels industry, cut emissions and reduce the country’s heavy reliance on imported fuel.

Over the past decade, Australia has doubled its dependence on imported jet fuel to more than 7 billion litres, more than one quarter of which comes from Chinese refineries. China, Malaysia and Singapore account for 70 per cent of imports of the fuel, Department of Climate Change and Energy data show.

Low-carbon fuels are derived from renewable or sustainable sources such as feedstocks and waste products and can be “dropped in” as a direct replacement for fossil fuels without major capital outlays or equipment upgrades.

Australia exports a huge proportion of the products required to make clean fuels – such as sugarcane, canola and tallow – but is a global laggard in their development and has no existing operational projects. Singapore, by contrast, has the capacity to produce more than 1 billion litres of biofuel.

Forshaw said the introduction of a 1-2 per cent mandate would provide the signal needed for investors to commit to new local sustainable aviation fuel projects and help safeguard Australia’s long-term fuel supply. The 2 per cent figure is higher than that previously suggested by industry.

“If we don’t move quickly to seize this opportunity, we run a real risk that the future will be made in Singapore, not Australia,” he said. “We want to use our feedstock here to produce fuels here, power our industry here and capture the economic and security benefits here.

“We can’t afford to default to what we’ve been historically pretty good at in Australia – exporting our raw commodities for others to process. Doing this, we simply export the opportunity to others.”

Defence experts sounded the alarm about Australia’s fuel supply levels as recently as June, when US bombing of Iran prompted fears the Middle Eastern nation would close access to a key trading route – and access to critical supplies of oil.

Under protocols laid down by the International Energy Agency, nations should hold at least 90 days of oil stocks in reserve. These “IEA days” include fuel on ships bound for Australia as well as that stored domestically.

According to the most recent government data, in May Australia had 48 days of imported oil coverage and only 17 days worth of jet fuel supplies.

Forshaw will tell a major industry conference on Tuesday that Australia can no longer depend on a “benign” trade environment for its future fuel imports.

“Cross-border supply chains grew during times when the benefits of globalisation were understood. Their resilience is being increasingly challenged by growing nationalism, protectionist trade policies and security challenges,” he said.

“Fuel underpins energy and transport, and powers our wider economies – literally.”

In July, government green bank the Clean Energy Finance Corporation said fuel security risks could become “particularly pertinent” for Australia’s defence forces, which will be reliant on liquid fuels for many decades.

The corporation also said Australia’s failure to develop a biofuel industry would put its net-zero targets out of reach in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and long-haul trucking.

The Albanese government is set to reveal a new 2035 target for reducing carbon emissions in coming weeks. The Climate Change Authority, which is advising on the target, has previously sought feedback on a goal in the range of 65 to 75 per cent on 2005 levels.

A target in such a range would require a significant uplift from the existing 2030 target of a 43 per cent – including from the aviation and heavy transport sectors.

A government spokesman said Labor had invested $250 million in the low-carbon liquid fuel industry through its Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

Airbus is an investor in a SAF project near Townsville called Jet Zero. Forshaw said well-designed production tax credits would help narrow the gap between the price of SAF and that of traditional jet fuel – which is a key barrier to the industry’s development.

“We can’t ask governments to support endlessly, and we have to be realistic that funds are scarce, so measures need to be well-targeted and designed to encourage the private sector to invest,” he said.",https://acapmag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GettyImages-1372488167-4.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 22:56:44.140053

Hingga Juli ini, sudah ada 143 SPBU yang menyalurkan Pertamax Green 95, dengan total penjualan mencapai 4.700 kiloliter. Heppy menjelaskan, untuk sementara distribusi masih fokus di Jawa. Alasannya sederhana: pasokan bioetanol lebih mudah didapat dari pabrik pengolahan di Mojokerto.

“Kami fokus di wilayah Jawa. Kalau di luar Jawa akan bisa kita kembangkan,” ujarnya.

Bukan cuma darat yang jadi sasaran. Pertamina Patra Niaga juga menggeber pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) untuk sektor penerbangan, berbahan baku minyak goreng bekas/Used Cooking Oil (UCO).

“Ke depan, Pertamina mendorong terbentuknya ekosistem nasional untuk pengumpulan UCO sebagai bahan baku SAF. Dengan langkah tersebut, Indonesia diharapkan mampu menjadi pusat produksi SAF untuk kawasan ASEAN,” kata Heppy.

Tak berhenti di BBM ramah lingkungan, Pertamina Patra Niaga juga memperkenalkan konsep Green Energy Station (GES). Bukan SPBU biasa, GES ini jadi one stop integrated energy solution yang ramah lingkungan, sekaligus membuka peluang bisnis non fuel retail.

Di dalamnya ada atap PLTS untuk pemanfaatan energi mandiri, layanan ekosistem kendaraan listrik lewat SPKLU dan SPBKLU, digitalisasi layanan lewat MyPertamina, hingga penyediaan bahan bakar high tier seperti Pertamax low sulfur.

Tak ketinggalan, GES dilengkapi fasilitas non fuel retail seperti Bright Store, kafe, dan auto care. “Saat ini sudah ada 442 GES, 14 SPKLU dan ada 43 SPBKLU,” tutur Heppy.

Dengan inovasi ini, Pertamina Patra Niaga ingin membuktikan bahwa masa depan energi Indonesia tak melulu soal fosil, tapi juga soal kreativitas menghadirkan bahan bakar yang bersih, terjangkau, dan siap menyambut era transisi energi.

„Szükség van az állami szerepvállalásra és a gyártó cégeket ösztönző, támogató jogszabályi környezetre az alternatív, fenntartható üzemanyagok elterjedése érdekében.” - ezzel az állítással a lakosság 64%-a ért egyet.
A MOL-csoport frissített SHAPE TOMORROW stratégiájában kiemelt hangsúlyt kapnak a megújuló üzemanyagok.
„A MOL a már ma is állít elő megújuló alapanyagokból dízel-, valamint fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyagot, és készen áll ennek bővítésére.
SAF csak klasszikus megújuló (például növényi) alapanyagból vagy hulladékból készülhet, de ugyanúgy teljesítenie kell a műszaki és a környezetvédelmi előírásokat, mint a hagyományos kerozinnak.","A magyar felnőttek közel kétharmada hezitálás nélkül utazna bioüzemanyaggal működő repülővel is – ami különösen azzal összevetve tanulságos, hogy egy önvezető autóban történő utazást (ami technikailag ma már többé-kevésbé reális lehetőség) csak 40%-nyian vállalnának be jelenleg. A friss adatok a MOL megbízásából készített országos reprezentatív kutatásból származnak. A felmérésből kiderült: kiemelkedő, 80 százalékot is meghaladó a bioüzemanyag-hajtású repülőgépen való utazási hajlandóság a 30–39 évesek körében. Hasonlóan magas ez az arány a felsőfokú végzettségűek között is – a 65 év felettieknek viszont csupán a 39%-a utazna olyan légijárművön, amit bioüzemanyag hajt.

A válaszok alapján a magyar autóvezetők 83%-a számára fontos, hogy az autójához használt üzemanyag fenntartható forrásból származzon. Különösen igaz ez a férfiakra, illetve az 50 éven felüli autóvezetőkre. Az adatok egy látszólagos ellentmondásra is rámutatnak: miközben a legtöbben valamilyen anyagi előny vagy ösztönzés hatására váltanának zöldebb üzemanyagra (tízből kilenc válaszadó jelölt meg ilyen tartalmú válaszlehetőséget azok közül, akik eleve nyitottak a fenntartható üzemanyagok használatára), minden második autóvezető már ma is hajlandó lenne valamennyivel többet fizetni a bizonyíthatóan megújuló forrásból származó energiáért. A kérdezettek 68%-a hidrogénhajtású autóba is szívesen beülne.

Az alternatív üzemanyagokra váltás jelenlegi megítélése elsősorban a költségektől függ: a leghatékonyabb ösztönző az alacsony ár és a költséghatékonyság lenne, kiemelten az idősebb korosztály (50 éven felüliek), és az alacsonyabb iskolai végzettségűek körében. „Szükség van az állami szerepvállalásra és a gyártó cégeket ösztönző, támogató jogszabályi környezetre az alternatív, fenntartható üzemanyagok elterjedése érdekében.” - ezzel az állítással a lakosság 64%-a ért egyet. Az életkor, az iskolai végzettség és a településméret növekedésével párhuzamosan nő az állami szerepvállalás iránti igény.

Az ellentmondást a demográfiai eltérések oldják fel: ártöbbletet jellemzően a fiatalok és a diplomások hajlandóak fizetni a zöld üzemanyagokkal együtt járó tisztább környezetért, míg az árelőnyt igénylők relatív többsége az 50 feletti korosztályból kerül ki. Az is fontos tapasztalata ugyanakkor a kutatásnak, hogy a zöldátállás esetében a második leggyakrabban említett motiváció maga a fenntarthatóság, a környezet megvédésének szándéka, vagyis a CO₂-kibocsátás csökkentése, a levegő tisztasága, illetve az ökológiai egyensúly megőrzése. Ezeket a környezeti-természeti szempontokat elsősorban a fiatalabb (18–39 éves) válaszadók és a diplomások emelték ki a válaszaikban.

A MOL-csoport frissített SHAPE TOMORROW stratégiájában kiemelt hangsúlyt kapnak a megújuló üzemanyagok. A MOL már jelenleg is a hazai és a regionális bioüzemanyag-piac kulcsszereplője (a hulladékból, vagyis megújuló alapanyagból előállított hidrogénezett növényi olaj a leginkább klímabarát üzemanyagok közé tartozik), és európai összevetésben is az úttörők közé tartozik a repülőgép-bioüzemanyagok előállításában.

„A MOL a már ma is állít elő megújuló alapanyagokból dízel-, valamint fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyagot, és készen áll ennek bővítésére. A felkészültség azt jelzi, hogy a vállalatcsoport valóban stratégiai célként tekint a fenntartható mobilitásra, legyen szó akár a közúti, akár a légi közlekedésről. A komplex mobilitási szolgáltatóvá válás számunkra azt jelenti, hogy egyre többféle üzemanyagot kínálunk, megteremtve az okos energiaátmenet minden szükséges feltételét ügyfeleink számára. Ebben a folyamatban már ma is vezető szerepet játszunk a régióban, amit beruházásaink és fejlesztéseink révén tartósan meg kívánunk őrizni” – nyilatkozta Zsótér Csaba, a MOL-csoport üzemanyag üzletágának ügyvezető igazgatója.

A vállalat – egyebek között a Szegedi Tudományegyetemmel és a Pannon Egyetemmel együttműködve – folyamatosan kutatja és fejleszti a bioüzemanyagok előállításának, illetve felhasználásának új lehetőségeit. A Budapest Airporttal, a Wizz Airrel és a Repülőtéri Üzemanyag Kiszolgáló Kft.-vel együttműködve a MOL 2022-ben kezdte meg a fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyag (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, azaz SAF) kereskedelmi tesztelését. Erre alapozva ma már üzemvitel-szerűen értékesít SAF-ot Magyarországon Szlovákiában és Horvátországban, hozzávetőlegesen 14 kilotonna biokomponensnek megfelelő mennyiségben A vállalatcsoporthoz tartozó Slovnaft pozsonyi üzemében az idei év eleje óta immár a SAF-gyártás tesztelése zajlik – a hidrogénezett növényi olajat (HVO) tartalmazó dízel előállítása mellett -, a szintén csoporttag INA rijekai finomítójában pedig az elmúlt hetekben indult meg a SAF termelése annak érdekében, hogy az érintett országok teljesíteni tudják az EU megújuló üzemanyagok arányára vonatkozó 2030-as 6%-os célszámát.

SAF csak klasszikus megújuló (például növényi) alapanyagból vagy hulladékból készülhet, de ugyanúgy teljesítenie kell a műszaki és a környezetvédelmi előírásokat, mint a hagyományos kerozinnak. Jelenleg globálisan is alig néhány olajfinomító mondható felkészültnek a fenntartható repülőgépüzemanyag-előállításra. A mai és a prognosztizált SAF-kínálat is lényegesen elmarad a kereslettől – amit az árak is tükröznek -, ezért van stratégiai jelentősége a MOL fejlesztéseinek mind klímavédelmi, mind ellátási szempontból.",https://alapjarat.hu/sites/default/files/styles/metatag/public/tankolas-no-d.jpg?itok=BnYKgzEb,N,,2025-08-10 12:56:55.096738

Hosted at Cairns Convention Centre, this summit brought together major figures in the aviation sector to share insights, strategies, and future plans for the industry.

Virgin Australia’s New Growth Path and Fleet Expansion

In his keynote speech, Dave Emerson, Virgin Australia’s CEO, accentuated the value segment enhancement. Virgin was aiming its marketing at small business, corporate value, and premium leisure travellers. Emerson explained how Virgin Australia is attempting to capture about one-third of the domestic market share, a figure the airlines is focused on increasing in the airline’s customer base in these segments to flex further.

Recently, the airline achieved significant milestones, including its successful IPO, which attracted a 25% investment from Qatar Airways. This strategic partnership also resulted in launching new international flights from Australia to Doha. Emerson added that Virgin Australia’s future plans include fleet expansion with 16 new aircraft, including the Boeing 737 MAX and Embraer E-Jets E2, slated for delivery in the coming fiscal year.

The airline’s fleet renewal program aims to modernize its aircraft while remaining financially efficient, relying on cash flow rather than raising additional capital. The company has grown from a post-administration fleet of 58 aircraft to over 100 in operation today. Additionally, Virgin Australia is introducing pet-friendly flights as part of its customer experience enhancement efforts.

Managing Risks in a Volatile Global Environment

Austrian Capital Territory’s Chief Minister Andrew Barr, ACCC’s Matthew Schroder, and Cairns Airport’s CEO Richard Barker participated in a panel discussion focusing on an important topic of concern in the world today; the need to manage risks considering the current global climate.

As the aviation industry faces numerous challenges, including geopolitical instability, fuel price volatility, and the fast-paced advancements in AI technology, the panelists discussed strategies to ensure sustainable airline operations and competitive pricing.

Matthew Schroder mentioned that the ACCC had approved the Qatar Airways-Virgin Australia strategic partnership, highlighting its potential to boost competition and offer significant benefits to Australian consumers, including better access to international routes, including a daily flight from Canberra to Doha starting December 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Net-Zero Emissions Goals

The summit placed a strong emphasis on aviation sustainability. With the Australian aviation sector facing increased pressure to meet net-zero emissions goals, panelists from Air New Zealand, Qantas, and Boeing discussed the challenges and opportunities in adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Kimberly Camrass, Boeing’s Sustainability Lead for the South Pacific, outlined the critical role SAF will play in decarbonizing the aviation industry. However, she pointed out that SAF adoption has been slow due to the limited local production and high costs, as it currently remains three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

The Group Sustainability Officer of Qantas Messent Fiona underscored that shifting to SAF will require collaboration throughout the entire aviation ecosystem. Corporate collaborations along with government action were noted by Fiona to be crucial for achieving the carbon reduction targets in 2030.

The Australian Aviation Market: Recovery and Growth

According to Simon Elsegood, CAPA’s Head of Research, the Australian aviation industry is on a strong recovery path post-COVID. However, several challenges remain, including workforce shortages, supply chain disruptions in aircraft production, and increasing maintenance costs.

In terms of market trends, international passenger traffic is rebounding faster than domestic travel, with Southeast Asia and emerging European markets seeing the most significant growth. However, the industry faces constraints in aircraft availability, which affects route development and overall capacity growth.

One of the biggest changes in recent years has been the decline in business travel, which has been significantly impacted by the rise of video conferencing and changing corporate policies post-pandemic.

Qantas’ Ambitious Fleet and Sustainability Plans

During a discussion with Qantas Domestic CEO Markus Svensson, I learned about the airline’s exciting plans for fleet renewal, which includes the new A321XLR aircraft. The first delivery is expected by Christmas 2025, with a total of 10 aircraft slated for delivery by mid-2026.

This fleet renewal program is part of Project Sunrise, an ambitious initiative to introduce non-stop long-haul flights to any destination globally, starting with Sydney-London routes by 2027. Additionally, Qantas is focusing heavily on SAF and reducing its carbon footprint through sustainable aviation technology.

Conclusion: The Future of Aviation

Memperingati Hari Kebangkitan Teknologi Nasional (Harteknas) 2025 pada 10 Agustus, PT Pertamina (Persero) melanjutkan upaya pengembangan energi baru dan terbarukan (EBT), serta transformasi teknologi berbasis keberlanjutan.

Wakil Direktur Utama Pertamina Oki Muraza mengatakan, perusahaan kini tidak hanya berfokus pada bisnis hidrokarbon sebagai warisan, tetapi juga telah mengembangkan beragam solusi energi hijau. Salah satunya, program pengembangan bioetanol di lingkungan Pertamina Group.

""Pertamina tengah memanfaatkan berbagai jenis feedstock lokal seperti molase (produk samping industri gula), batang sorgum, dan nira aren untuk memproduksi bioetanol. Produk ini nantinya akan digunakan sebagai bahan bakar campuran (blending) untuk gasolin,"" kata Oki pada forum Konvensi Sains, Teknologi, dan Industri (KSTI) di Bandung, Jumat (8/8).

Selain bioetanol, di forum yang sama Pertamina juga menampilkan progres pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sebagai solusi bahan bakar ramah lingkungan untuk sektor penerbangan, serta bahan baku minyak goreng bekas atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO).

Saat ini, Pertamina giat mendorong pembentukan ekosistem nasional untuk mengumpulkan UCO sebagai bahan baku SAF. Dengan langkah tersebut, Indonesia diharapkan mampu menjadi pusat produksi SAF untuk kawasan ASEAN.

""Ke depannya kita berharap akan ada ekosistem untuk pengumpulan minyak goreng bekas atau used cooking oil menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Cita-cita besarnya Indonesia nanti akan menjadi hub bagi produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel di ASEAN,"" kata Oki.

Pada kesempatan yang sama, Pertamina juga menyampaikan apresiasinya terhadap dukungan pemerintah dalam inisiatif menyelenggarakan forum KSTI 2025 yang digelar di Gedung Sasana Budaya Ganesha (Sabuga), Bandung, Jawa Barat yang berlangsung pada tanggal 7 - 9 Agustus 2025.

Oki menilai KSTI 2025 sangat strategis untuk membuka peluang kolaborasi antara industri, perguruan tinggi, dan lembaga riset. Sinergi itu antara lain dilakukan bersama berbagai universitas seperti Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), serta Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) sebagai balai penelitian.

""Baik itu di hulu, meningkatkan produksi di hilir, meningkatkan efisiensi, menghasilkan BBM yang ramah lingkungan, dan juga di bidang energi terbarukan, sebagai kontribusi untuk meningkatkan porsi dari renewables atau energi terbarukan di dalam bauran energi nasional,"" ujar Oki.

Quando corretamente processados em Unidades de Recuperação Energética (URE), esses resíduos podem ser convertidos em produtos de alto valor agregado, como biodiesel, etanol de segunda geração (E2G), SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), hidrogênio verde, eletricidade e fertilizantes organominerais. Essa transformação energética proporciona não apenas expressivos ganhos ambientais — ao reduzir emissões de gases de efeito estufa e proteger lençóis freáticos da contaminação — como também estimula a economia circular, gera empregos qualificados e fomenta cadeias produtivas de base tecnológica em nível local e nacional. Entretanto, a realidade ainda caminha em sentido oposto: a destinação dominante dos RSU continua sendo os aterros sanitários, cuja eficiência energética do biogás captado é, em média, 10% daquela obtida com a gaseificação em UREs modernas. Além de ineficientes, os aterros continuam a ser grandes emissores de metano e contaminantes.

Fracassos que poderiam ter sido evitados

Projetos inovadores — como os da Fulcrum BioEnergy (SAF) e da Raízen (etanol 2G) — fracassaram economicamente, não por ausência de tecnologia, mas por desprezar a análise adequada das incertezas envolvidas em seus investimentos. Ao ignorarem fatores críticos como volatilidade do CAPEX, flutuações de preços dos produtos, custos operacionais, produtividade e — especialmente — a possibilidade de ocorrência de eventos de natureza tributária e de mercado, ambos os projetos tornaram insustentáveis econômica e financeiramente, causando impactos negativos para investidores, governos e a sociedade.

Importante destacar que esses riscos foram previamente identificados e mensurados nos estudos de viabilidade econômica financeira realizados pela DBEST PLAN. A empresa previu que, sem a devida consideração de cenários tributários desfavoráveis e variações de mercado — como os que efetivamente ocorreram — os projetos da Fulcrum e da Raízen estariam destinados ao fracasso.

DBEST PLAN e Safran: Referência Nacional e Internacional

No Brasil, a DBEST PLAN – Engenharia e Tecnologia da Informação e a Safran, empresa internacional, destacam-se como pioneiras na incorporação dessa metodologia em seus estudos de viabilidade para projetos de energia limpa. Aplicando com rigor a Simulação de Monte Carlo, essas empresas avaliam com precisão a viabilidade de projetos de SAF, biodiesel, etanol 2G, hidrogênio verde, eletricidade e fertilizantes organominerais, processando biomassa e RSU em UREs de última geração. Ao acompanhar práticas de análise adotadas por grandes players internacionais, a DBEST PLAN contribui para a transição energética do Brasil com soluções sustentáveis, financeiramente sólidas e socialmente justas. Sua abordagem orienta decisões governamentais, evita desperdícios de recursos públicos e privados e impede o surgimento de novos projetos fadados ao fracasso. Recomendações Finais Projetos inovadores de alto risco devem obrigatoriamente utilizar ferramentas como a Simulação de Monte Carlo para: • Proteger investidores de perdas desnecessárias, • Garantir o correto dimensionamento do CAPEX e OPEX, • Ajustar as expectativas de retorno à realidade econômica, • Demonstrar maturidade técnica perante financiadores e órgãos de fomento.

É hora de o setor público e privado reconhecerem que a transição energética requer, além de boas intenções e tecnologias promissoras, rigor analítico e gestão estratégica das incertezas. Só assim evitaremos novos casos como o da Raízen e garantiremos que os recursos investidos resultem em impactos positivos reais para o Brasil e o mundo.

Di tengah krisis iklim, langkah-langkah ini bukan sekadar strategi bisnis, melainkan wujud tanggung jawab generasi kini untuk menjaga kelayakan bumi bagi masa depan.

1. Bioetanol: Energi Hijau dari Potensi Lokal

Pemanfaatan sumber daya lokal seperti molase, batang sorgum, dan nira aren menjadi salah satu terobosan strategis Pertamina. Bioetanol yang dihasilkan akan digunakan sebagai campuran gasolin, mengurangi emisi dan ketergantungan pada bahan bakar fosil. Inovasi ini menunjukkan bahwa energi terbarukan dapat dibangun dari kekayaan hayati yang selama ini kurang dimanfaatkan.

Selain memberikan solusi lingkungan, program ini juga membuka peluang ekonomi bagi petani lokal. Pengolahan feedstock menjadi bioetanol menciptakan rantai nilai baru yang memberi manfaat langsung bagi masyarakat di sekitar sentra produksi.

Meanwhile, the global SAF market is expected to balloon from $2.25 billion in 2025 to $134.57 billion by 2034, driven by airlines like Delta, United, and British Airways committing to 100% SAF blends.
SAF production faces challenges like feedstock supply chain bottlenecks and high capital costs.
Data-Driven Takeaways YPF's SAF venture is a high-conviction play for investors seeking exposure to the energy transition.","The aviation industry is racing toward net-zero emissions by 2050, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the only scalable solution to decarbonize air travel. While the global SAF market is projected to grow at a blistering 57.53% CAGR from 2025 to 2034, Latin America remains a largely untapped frontier. Argentina's state-owned oil giant, YPF, is positioning itself as a regional leader with a $400 million joint venture—Santa Fe Bio—to produce SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) at its San Lorenzo refinery. This move is not just a bet on green energy; it's a strategic play to capitalize on a market growing at 50.1% CAGR in Latin America (far outpacing the user's 20% figure) and a regional SAF supply gap that could become a goldmine for early movers.

Why YPF's Play Stands Out

YPF's Santa Fe Bio project is a masterclass in strategic positioning. The San Lorenzo refinery, located in a port city, offers ideal logistics for exporting SAF to Europe and North America, where demand is surging due to CORSIA mandates and corporate ESG goals. The venture leverages Argentina's abundant feedstock—used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and animal fats—at lower costs than competitors. This is critical: SAF production costs remain high globally, but YPF's access to low-cost raw materials and Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI)—which offers tax breaks and streamlined permitting—creates a compelling cost advantage.

The project's two-phase rollout also demonstrates operational prudence. Phase 1 will focus on building a pretreatment plant and a state-of-the-art biorefinery, with scalability baked into the design. By 2030, the Latin American SAF market is expected to hit $792.5 million in revenue, up from $69.2 million in 2024. YPF's early entry positions it to capture a significant share of this growth, especially as regional airlines and global carriers seek local suppliers to avoid the high costs of importing SAF from North America or Europe.

Policy Tailwinds and Market Dynamics

YPF's timing is impeccable. Argentina's national energy transition goals align with global decarbonization targets, and the government's RIGI regime reduces financial risk for investors. Meanwhile, the global SAF market is expected to balloon from $2.25 billion in 2025 to $134.57 billion by 2034, driven by airlines like Delta, United, and British Airways committing to 100% SAF blends. Latin America's current SAF supply is negligible, creating a vacuum YPF is poised to fill.

The joint venture with U.S.-based Essential Energy adds another layer of credibility. Essential's expertise in biofuel technology complements YPF's infrastructure and market access. Together, they're building a production model that could serve as a blueprint for other emerging markets.

Risks and Rewards

No investment is without risk. SAF production faces challenges like feedstock supply chain bottlenecks and high capital costs. However, YPF's self-funding approach (reducing debt risk) and Argentina's policy support mitigate these concerns. The company is also hedging its bets by producing HVO, a diesel-like product with growing demand in the transportation sector.

For investors, the key question is whether YPF can scale production quickly enough to meet demand. The answer lies in its phased rollout and strategic location. If the project hits its production targets, YPF could become a regional SAF powerhouse, with export potential to Europe and North America.

Data-Driven Takeaways

YPF's SAF venture is a high-conviction play for investors seeking exposure to the energy transition. The company's ability to leverage Argentina's resources, policy incentives, and global demand trends positions it as a winner in a market growing at 50%+ CAGR. While the user's 20% CAGR figure underestimates the sector's potential, the core thesis holds: YPF is betting big on a future where carbon-neutral aviation is non-negotiable.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 23:56:14.796925

CAPA State of the Industry

CAPA - Centre for Aviation head of research Simon Elsegood

Domestic Market Structure:

The Australian domestic market is highly concentrated, with two major airline groups dominating 95% of the market.

The two big dominant airline groups handled 95% of passengers in 2024. 90% of Australian domestic passengers have a choice of two airline groups.

Workforce Shortages:

The aviation industry is facing significant workforce shortages, particularly in airport and maintenance roles, with an aging workforce and competition from overseas markets exacerbating the issue.

A gap has emerged of about 800 to 10,000 workers, primarily in airports and maintenance

The industry is recruiting fewer young people, so the workforce is going to continue to age.

Sustainability Challenges:

Aviation emissions are growing as a proportion of Australia's total emissions, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption lagging due to limited local production.

Australian airlines consumed eight billion litres of jet fuel in 2024 and burned 10 million litres of SAF, which was all sourced overseas.

Golden Triangle Airports Recovery:

Major Australian airports are still recovering, with Sydney most impacted, while Perth shows significant growth due to increased international traffic and regional travel.

International Market Trends:

While some traditional markets like New Zealand and the US are still down, there's strong growth in Southeast Asian destinations and emerging European markets.

Business Travel Decline:

There is a structural decline in business travel post-pandemic, with video conferencing and corporate policies impacting demand.

Fleet Supply Constraints:

Airlines are facing challenges in acquiring new aircraft due to global supply chain issues, impacting capacity growth and network expansion.

Airlines have not been able to get the aircraft that they want to increase capacity and grow their networks. OEMs are still struggling to lift production.

Passenger Recovery Post-COVID:

The Australian aviation industry is showing strong recovery from COVID-19 impacts, with international travel rebounding faster than domestic.

Airfare Trends:

There were substantially higher fares in 2023 and into 2024, but fares have started to normalise.

Long-Term Growth Projections:

The Australian aviation market is projected to add 40 million passengers over the next decade.

The domestic market will account for two thirds to three quarters of passengers, with growth of 2% to 2.5%. The international market has more growth upside at 2.5% to 3%, based on conservative estimates.

Airline Leader Interview: Air New Zealand, CCO, Jeremy O'Brien

Air New Zealand recently announced Nikhil Ravishankar as its next CEO. Described as ""constantly curious"" and ""a real innovator,"" Ravishankar brings significant digital expertise to the role. Having served at the airline for over five years, he has focused on enhancing customer experiences and operations through digital technology and introduced an agile operating model that has improved the organisation's responsiveness to change.

The airline has faced significant operational challenges, with up to 11 aircraft grounded simultaneously due to engine issues. To maintain network integrity, Air New Zealand implemented several solutions, including:

Leasing three Boeing 777s from Cathay Pacific.

Securing 15 additional Pratt & Whitney engines.

Receiving new A321neo deliveries.

These measures have enabled the airline to resume growth, particularly across the Tasman Sea where it will operate 1.7 million seats during the winter season - a 10% year-on-year increase. The airline is also expanding services to Pacific Islands and domestic routes.

Fleet expansion continues with ultra-long-haul Boeing 787s arriving in February and March 2026, featuring increased premium cabin density to target the premium leisure market, particularly from the US.

The airline is innovating with its SkyNest product - six bunk beds between premium economy and economy cabins that passengers can book for four-hour sleep periods on ultra-long-haul flights. This reflects Air New Zealand's commitment to addressing customer pain points through innovation.

Regarding network strategy, Air New Zealand is evaluating potential returns to London and Chicago markets and exploring opportunities in India through partnerships. The carrier is taking a more rational approach to route selection post-COVID, focusing on markets where it has ""the right to win"" and can achieve sustainable returns.

Boeing sustainability lead - Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific Kimberly Camrass

Qantas Group chief sustainability officer Fiona Messent

Tourism & Transport Forum CEO Margy Osmond

Virgin Australia chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer Christian Bennett

Current Challenges and Approaches:

Airlines are shifting from carbon intensity metrics to net emissions measurements.

The next five years are deemed critical for meeting 2030 reduction targets.

Industry consensus that airlines cannot achieve decarbonisation alone - partnerships across the entire ecosystem are essential.

Policy and Economic Considerations:

Harmonised policy frameworks across regions are preferred to avoid fragmentation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) development presents significant economic opportunities, potentially adding to GDP and creating jobs.

Learning from international policy implementations is crucial for Australia and New Zealand to design effective frameworks.

Cost Distribution and Financing:

The ""green premium"" of SAF (currently 3-4 times more expensive than conventional fuel) requires sophisticated cost-sharing mechanisms.

Book and claim systems (separating physical fuel from environmental attributes) could help aggregate demand.

Defence procurement and corporate partnerships are emerging as important demand signals.

Broader Benefits Beyond Emissions:

SAF development offers fuel security benefits, reducing dependence on imports.

Rural communities could benefit from agricultural feedstock production, creating regional jobs.

Tourism industry faces significant economic risks if aviation sustainability isn't addressed.

Carbon Offsets and Physical Climate Impacts:

High-integrity carbon credits remain essential for net-zero strategies.

Physical climate impacts already affecting aviation operations through extreme weather events.

Tourism destinations face infrastructure challenges from rising temperatures and severe weather.

The panel emphasised that sustainability messaging should focus on economic opportunities rather than solely on climate risks, and that the entire tourism ecosystem must collaborate on solutions rather than leaving the burden solely with airlines.

At the heart of this shift is YPF S.A.'s Santa Fe Bio project, a $400 million investment to convert the San Lorenzo refinery into a biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). This initiative, part of YPF's broader 4×4 Plan, positions the state-owned oil giant to capitalize on a regional SAF supply gap and Argentina's unique competitive advantages in renewable feedstock and infrastructure. For investors, the project represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector poised for explosive growth.

Argentina's Energy Transition: A Catalyst for SAF Demand

Latin America's aviation sector is grappling with a stark supply-demand imbalance for SAF. While global airlines commit to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, SAF production in the region remains nascent. A 2025 MIT study estimates that Latin America could supply 10–15% of global SAF demand by 2050, but current production costs—ranging from $1.11 to $2.86 per liter—far exceed conventional jet fuel prices of $0.70 per liter. Argentina's Santa Fe Bio project directly addresses this gap by leveraging its agricultural surplus and existing refining infrastructure.

YPF's strategic location in Santa Fe province, a hub for soybean and biodiesel production, provides access to low-cost feedstocks like used cooking oils and agricultural residues. The San Lorenzo refinery's port connectivity further enhances its export potential, targeting markets in Europe and the U.S., where SAF demand is surging due to stringent sustainability mandates. Argentina's Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), which offers tax breaks and streamlined permitting, reduces financial risk for YPF and underscores the government's commitment to decarbonization.

Regional Scarcity and YPF's Competitive Edge

The scarcity of SAF in Latin America is a critical tailwind for YPF's venture. Brazil, the region's biofuel leader, is prioritizing ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) pathways, while Argentina's focus on HVO and SAF from waste oils differentiates its approach. YPF's partnership with Essential Energy, a U.S.-based biofuel innovator, adds technical expertise and global market access. The joint venture's phased rollout—starting with a raw material pretreatment plant and a state-of-the-art biorefinery—ensures scalability and adaptability to evolving feedstock and certification standards.

Moreover, Argentina's regulatory environment is aligning with global sustainability trends. The 2025 introduction of pure biofuel regulations for marine transport signals a broader openness to low-carbon fuels. YPF's Santa Fe Bio project, which aims to reduce aviation emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, aligns with these policies and positions Argentina as a regional SAF exporter.

Financial and Environmental Metrics: A Dual Win

While specific production capacity figures for 2025 remain undisclosed, the project's $400 million investment and RIGI incentives suggest a robust financial model. YPF's self-funding approach, combined with Essential Energy's operational experience, minimizes debt risk. The project's carbon reduction potential is equally compelling: SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by 50–80%, directly supporting Argentina's net-zero goals and attracting ESG-focused investors.

Investment Thesis: Timing the Aviation Decarbonization Wave

The Santa Fe Bio project is a strategic bet on a sector where timing and positioning are critical. With global SAF demand projected to grow at a 20% CAGR through 2030, YPF's early mover advantage in Latin America's underdeveloped SAF market is a key differentiator. The project's alignment with Argentina's energy transition policies, coupled with its access to low-cost feedstocks and export-ready infrastructure, creates a compelling value proposition.

For investors, the venture offers exposure to both YPF's operational transformation and Argentina's broader decarbonization agenda. While risks such as feedstock price volatility and regulatory shifts exist, the project's RIGI incentives and Essential Energy's partnership mitigate these concerns. As the aviation sector races to meet emissions targets, YPF's Santa Fe Bio project is not just a local initiative—it's a global opportunity.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 23:56:36.065860

La decisión, anticipada meses atrás por el presidente y CEO de YPF, Horacio Marín, forma parte del plan denominado “YPF del Futuro”, con el que la compañía prevé expandirse hacia distintas fuentes energéticas fuera de los hidrocarburos.

En el caso de Santa Fe Bio, desde la empresa anticiparon que el proyecto demandará una inversión estimada de USD 400 millones. El financiamiento será estructurado en su mayor parte bajo un modelo de project finance, en acuerdo con un socio estadounidense especializado en la elaboración y comercialización de biocombustibles.

En el caso del SAF, se elabora a partir de cultivos como colza, camelina y carinata, mientras que los HVO se hacen en base a e elaborarán a partir del procesamiento de aceites vegetales, residuos, grasas animales y otros insumos.

El proyecto se desarrollará en dos fases y está previsto que sume los beneficios del Régimen de Incentivo a las Grandes Inversiones (RIGI).

Cómo será la sociedad

Este joint venture estará integrado en partes iguales por YPF y el grupo Essential Energy, con presencia nacional e internacional en el mercado de biocombustibles de primera y segunda generación.

Ambas compañías comenzaron a trabajar en la factibilidad del proyecto en diciembre de 2024, tras la firma de un Memorando de Entendimiento (MOU), y en la actualidad continúan definiendo los términos contractuales finales.

El plan contempla el uso de la infraestructura de la refinería de San Lorenzo, en la provincia de Santa Fe, donde se instalará una planta de pretratamiento de materias primas y una biorrefinería de última generación. También se adecuarán instalaciones del complejo industrial, para llevar adelante la producción.

El SAF es considerado por organismos internacionales como la alternativa sostenible más escalable para el transporte aéreo a mediano plazo. En este contexto, se proyecta un crecimiento de la demanda en los próximos años, con oportunidades de exportación hacia Europa y Estados Unidos, mercados que exigen certificaciones internacionales.

La ubicación de la refinería de San Lorenzo fue elegida por su proximidad a la zona núcleo productiva, la disponibilidad de materia prima y su conexión directa con el puerto, lo que facilita la logística de comercialización y exportación.

Historia de la refinería

La refinería de San Lorenzo, fundada en 1938 por YPF, fue privatizada en 1993 y pasó por distintas manos, entre ellas Pérez Companc, Repsol y Petrobras. En 2002 fue adquirida por Oil Combustibles y, en 2018, volvió a YPF en sociedad con Dapsa, en el marco de un proceso de liquidación judicial.

El complejo industrial incluye destilería, planta de despacho de combustibles, parque de tanques, planta de asfalto y un puerto de gran capacidad sobre la Hidrovía Paraná-Paraguay. Actualmente, la refinería se encuentra inactiva y será reconvertida para el nuevo proyecto.

Según el plan, en la primera etapa de operación, prevista para 2030, la planta producirá unas 100.000 toneladas anuales de SAF. Con la ampliación de capacidad, se espera superar las 500.000 toneladas por año.",https://www.newsdigitales.com/uploads/noticias/2/2025/08/afa5c676215b36e834d978a3f6c2258b48821072.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 21:56:16.257054

The 2006 L322 model, used by the late monarch between 2006-2008, comes with all the royal bells and whistles, plus a few bespoke touches designed specifically for Palace life. Finished in the classic Royal Household Tonga Green and paired with an Oxford Sand leather interior and extended walnut trim, the vehicle screams luxury.

As per Marie Claire, it’s the only supercharged L322 Her Majesty ever owned, powered by a 4.2-litre V8 engine. Special modifications were added by Land Rover’s Special Vehicle Operations division, including side steps, mud flaps, a dog guard for the Queen’s beloved corgis, a boot liner, rear grab handles to aid entry and exit, and upgraded internal wiring for royal security equipment. It even features a quirky bonnet ornament of a Labrador with a pheasant in its mouth, something that oddly fits the car’s royal countryside charm. The Queen, despite having hundreds of chauffeurs at her service, loved driving cars herself and would be regularly pictured in them, as per the BBC.

The vehicle, which clocked around 120,000 miles and was based at Windsor Castle, is expected to fetch between £50,000 and £70,000 when it goes under the hammer at Iconic Auctioneers’ Silverstone Festival on August 23. “Vehicles with such distinguished provenance rarely enter the market, making this an exceptional opportunity for collectors and enthusiasts alike,” said Rob Hubbard, Managing Director and Principal Auctioneer of Iconic Auctioneers. “Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s personal Range Rover combines automotive excellence with an unmatched historical significance.”

Wakil Direktur Utama Pertamina, Oki Muraza, memaparkan bahwa arah bisnis perseroan kini tak lagi hanya mengandalkan sektor minyak dan gas, tetapi telah meluas ke inovasi energi bersih. Salah satu proyek prioritasnya adalah produksi bioetanol yang dikerjakan lintas anak perusahaan dalam Pertamina Group.

Bahan baku lokal seperti molase hasil industri gula, batang sorgum, hingga nira aren dimanfaatkan untuk memproduksi bioetanol. Produk ini akan digunakan sebagai bahan campuran bensin (blending) guna menekan emisi karbon. Oki menyampaikan hal tersebut saat Konvensi Sains, Teknologi, dan Industri (KSTI) di Bandung, Jawa Barat, Jumat (8/8/2025).

Selain bioetanol, Pertamina juga fokus mengembangkan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), bahan bakar pesawat ramah lingkungan yang salah satu sumbernya berasal dari minyak jelantah. Perseroan bahkan tengah membangun ekosistem nasional untuk mengumpulkan minyak bekas tersebut, dengan visi menjadikan Indonesia sebagai pusat produksi SAF di kawasan ASEAN.

“Kalau ekosistem pengumpulan minyak jelantah bisa terbentuk, Indonesia punya peluang besar menjadi hub SAF untuk ASEAN,” ujar Oki.

Pertamina turut mengapresiasi dukungan pemerintah pada Forum KSTI 2025 yang berlangsung di Gedung Sasana Budaya Ganesha (Sabuga), Bandung, 7–9 Agustus 2025. Menurut Oki, ajang ini menjadi titik temu penting antara industri, kampus, dan lembaga riset dalam memperkuat kolaborasi.

Az életkor, az iskolai végzettség és a településméret növekedésével párhuzamosan nő az állami szerepvállalás iránti igény.

A vizsgálat alapján a 30–39 évesek körében 80 százalékot is meghaladó a bioüzemanyag-hajtású repülőgépen való utazási hajlandóság. Hasonlóan magas ez az arány a felsőfokú végzettségűek között – a 65 év felettieknek viszont csupán a 39 százaléka utazna olyan légi járművön, amit bioüzemanyag hajt.

A közlemény idézte Zsótér Csabát, a Mol-csoport üzemanyag-üzletágának ügyvezető igazgatóját, akinek tájékoztatása szerint a Mol már most is állít elő megújuló alapanyagokból dízel-, valamint fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyagot, és készen áll ennek bővítésére.

A vállalat – egyebek között a Szegedi Tudományegyetemmel és a Pannon Egyetemmel együttműködve – folyamatosan kutatja és fejleszti a bioüzemanyagok előállításának, illetve felhasználásának új lehetőségeit.

A Budapest Airporttal, a Wizz Airrel és a Repülőtéri Üzemanyag Kiszolgáló Kft.-vel együttműködve a Mol 2022-ben kezdte meg a fenntartható repülőgép-üzemanyag (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) kereskedelmi tesztelését. Erre alapozva a társaság már értékesíti a SAF-ot Magyarországon, Szlovákiában és Horvátországban.

Hozzátették, hogy a SAF csak klasszikus megújuló (például növényi) alapanyagból vagy hulladékból készülhet, de ugyanúgy teljesítenie kell a műszaki és a környezetvédelmi előírásokat, mint a hagyományos kerozinnak.

A kutatást a Mol megbízásából az Iránytű Intézet készítette idén májusban, 500 ember bevonásával.

By launching direct flights from Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Charlotte (CLT) to Québec City's Jean Lesage International Airport (YQB), the carrier is not only enhancing connectivity but also catalyzing a $50 million tourism revenue boost for the region. This move aligns with a broader trend of airlines targeting secondary markets to diversify revenue streams while addressing the growing demand for sustainable travel. For investors, the expansion offers a compelling case study in how strategic infrastructure investments, ESG alignment, and regional partnerships can drive long-term value.

Infrastructure: A $200 Million Bet on Future Growth

Québec City's Jean Lesage International Airport (YQB) is undergoing a transformative $200 million infrastructure overhaul as part of its 2025–2030 strategic plan. This investment is critical to accommodating a projected 2.4 million annual passengers by 2030 and includes the redesign of the domestic arrivals area, runway and taxiway renovations, and enhanced public transit options. The airport's 2024 passenger traffic surged by 43.8% to 1.68 million, underscoring the urgency of these upgrades.

The infrastructure push is not merely about capacity—it's about creating a seamless passenger experience. Modernized facilities, optimized food concessions, and revamped parking solutions are designed to meet evolving traveler expectations. For investors, this signals a long-term commitment to YQB's role as a regional hub. The airport's EBITDA of $34.6 million in 2024 and its net income of $3.6 million highlight its financial resilience, making it an attractive partner for airlines seeking to expand into high-growth markets.

ESG Alignment: Greening the Skies with Low-Carbon Corridors

American Airlines' expansion to YQB is deeply embedded in its net-zero emissions by 2050 roadmap. The airline is deploying fuel-efficient Embraer 175 aircraft for the DFW-YQB route, which reduces per-passenger carbon footprints. YQB itself has achieved a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2016, a feat driven by runway efficiency upgrades and contrail-avoidance strategies. These initiatives align with the growing investor appetite for ESG-compliant assets, particularly in sectors facing regulatory scrutiny over carbon emissions.

The airport's 2040 carbon neutrality goal for airport-authority-managed operations further cements its appeal. For instance, YQB's one-way corridor at international arrivals has cut operational delays by 15%, reducing fuel burn and emissions. Such innovations not only enhance environmental performance but also lower operational costs—a win-win for airlines and investors.

Regional Airline Synergies: Expanding Reach Without the Cost

American Airlines' partnership with regional carriers like Flair Airlines and Air France exemplifies a cost-effective strategy to expand its network. By using Embraer 175s for the DFW-YQB route, the airline minimizes capital expenditures while maintaining high-frequency service. This model is particularly effective for secondary markets like Québec City, where demand is seasonal but growing.

The collaboration also diversifies YQB's route offerings, with connections to destinations like Halifax, Edmonton, and Paris. For investors, this highlights the potential of regional airlines as undervalued assets in the post-pandemic recovery. Flair Airlines, for example, has seen a 30% increase in regional route profitability since 2023, driven by its focus on underserved Canadian markets.

Investment Implications: Where to Allocate Capital

Infrastructure Providers: Companies involved in airport construction and technology upgrades (e.g., Arconic, which supplies aircraft components, or AECOM, a construction and design firm) stand to benefit from YQB's $200 million investment.

Regional Airlines: Flair Airlines and other regional carriers with contracts to serve YQB could see revenue growth as American Airlines expands its network.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Producers: As American Airlines ramps up SAF usage to meet its net-zero goals, firms like Neste and Gevo may see increased demand.

Tourism-Linked Sectors: Hospitality chains and tour operators in Québec City are poised to capitalize on the 2.9% passenger traffic increase, with hotel occupancy rates projected to rise by 10% in 2025.

Conclusion: A Model for Future Aviation Growth

American Airlines' Québec City expansion is a blueprint for sustainable, tourism-driven growth. By combining infrastructure investments, ESG alignment, and regional partnerships, the airline is not only enhancing its competitive edge but also creating a ripple effect of economic activity. For investors, this represents a rare opportunity to align with a strategy that balances profitability with planetary and social responsibility. As the aviation industry navigates a post-pandemic landscape, the YQB model offers a roadmap for resilient, future-proof growth.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 17:56:07.523858

The NFU said the potential complete closure of one of the UK’s two bioethanol plants raised serious concerns for arable growers in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and the wider biofuels sector.

Vivergo’s owners AB Foods said the UK's largest bioethanol plant, at Saltend, is in doubt following a government agreement with the US to abandon a 19 per cent tariff on US imports of the fuel as part of the recent UK-US trade deal.

Managers at the plant are also are calling on ministers for assistance, in the form of financial help, warning production at the plant could stop in just over a month.

The plant has come to be regarded as a foundation of the UK’s renewable fuel sector and has taken more than one million tonnes of wheat annually from more than 4,000 UK farms. In addition, the facility also produces important co-products, such as high-protein animal feed.

It has been forecast some 4,500 jobs in the supply chain could be impacted by Vivergo closing, and in particular the farmers who grow the wheat.

Managing director Ben Hackett has written to wheat growers warning the plant could only honour existing contracts for wheat purchases while the uncertainty continued.

Mr Hackett said: ""We have the site, the skills, the supply chain and the ambition to lead the way on sustainable aviation fuel.

""But without urgent government support for British bioethanol, the UK risks losing that opportunity, along with the jobs and billions of pounds in investment that depend on it.""

The government has stated it is holding talks with Vivergo “to find a way forward”.

As farmers are being faced with unpredictable markets and small margins, the NFU is pressing Keir Starmer’s administration to help ensure UK-grown grain has a viable future beyond feed markets, and assurances that the bioethanol sector will form a key plank of Britain’s green energy revolution.

NFU Combinable Crops Board Chair Jamie Burrows said the abrupt suspension of operations at Vivergo threatened to destabilise what was an already volatile market.

“Not only are there huge implications for those growers that currently supply Vivergo, but this also has the potential to put further downward pressures on farmgate prices at a time when our arable farmers are already facing huge challenges including extreme weather and ongoing market volatility.”

Mr Burrows said the closure emphasised the urgent need for government to support the domestic biofuels industry by enabling increased use of crop-based biofuels in transport and aviation.

“In order to open up further market opportunities to incentivise UK wheat being used by UK biofuel plants, the NFU is calling for government to allow more biofuels from crops to be used in road transport and aviation.”

Meanwhile, it has emerged this week that a green jet fuel investment worth £1.25bn could be put in jeopardy if the plant is forced to close.

Chris Smith. the chief executive of Meld Energy, which signed an agreement with Vivergo Fuels earlier this year for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at Saltend, said that without Vivergo at the site they may have to look overseas.

As the world grapples with the aftermath of the Ukraine war and the rise of multipolarity, Brazil's balancing act offers a blueprint for navigating uncertainty.","In the shadow of the Ukraine war and the fracturing of the U.S.-led global order, Brazil has emerged as a pivotal actor in reshaping the economic and geopolitical landscape of the Global South. As the host of the 2025 BRICS summit, Brazil is leveraging its diplomatic finesse and economic heft to steer the bloc toward a pragmatic, non-confrontational path. This strategy—balancing Western ties with South-South cooperation—has created a unique window for investors to capitalize on BRICS-driven markets while navigating the turbulence of a multipolar world.

The Geopolitical Chessboard: Brazil's Pragmatic Mediation

Brazil's foreign policy under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has been defined by a “multi-aligned” approach. Unlike Russia's hardline stance or China's assertive expansionism, Brazil has avoided direct confrontation with the West while championing BRICS as a platform for inclusive growth. This balancing act is critical in a post-Ukraine world, where the U.S. and its allies have imposed sanctions on Russia, and BRICS nations face pressure to choose sides.

By hosting the 2025 BRICS summit, Brazil has positioned itself as a stabilizing force. The bloc's expansion—from five to eleven members—has introduced new dynamics, but Brazil's emphasis on institutional coherence and practical cooperation has mitigated fragmentation. For example, the inclusion of Indonesia, a strategic bridge between East and West, has strengthened BRICS' economic and geopolitical footprint. This expansion, coupled with Brazil's focus on trade facilitation and financial integration, has created a more resilient bloc less susceptible to ideological divides.

Investment Opportunities: BRICS as a Growth Engine

The BRICS bloc's focus on infrastructure, de-dollarization, and sustainable development has unlocked a range of high-conviction investment opportunities. Here are three key areas to watch:

1. New Development Bank (NDB) and Green Infrastructure

The NDB, established in 2015, has become a cornerstone of BRICS economic cooperation. With a $50 billion capital base and a mandate to fund clean energy, transportation, and climate resilience projects, the NDB is a critical player in the Global South's green transition. In 2024, the bank issued a $1.25 billion green bond to finance clean transportation and energy efficiency, signaling its commitment to sustainability.

Investors should consider NDB-backed projects in Brazil, India, and South Africa, where solar, wind, and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure are accelerating. For instance, Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) has partnered with the NDB to fund $1.7 billion in climate-related projects, including EV charging networks and biofuel production.

2. Clean Energy and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The BRICS Business Council (BBC) has identified energy transition as a strategic priority. Brazil, in particular, is emerging as a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In 2025, Chinese company Envision Energy announced a $1 billion investment in Brazil to produce SAF from sugarcane, leveraging the country's agricultural expertise. This project, part of a broader $38.8 billion energy transition investment in Brazil in 2023, highlights the potential for cross-border green partnerships.

India, meanwhile, is targeting 8–10 million tonnes of SAF production annually by 2040, driven by partnerships with Airbus and domestic research institutions. Investors in renewable energy firms with exposure to BRICS markets—such as NextEra Energy (NEE) or Ørsted (DONG)—could benefit from this trend.

3. Digital and Financial Innovation

Brazil's push for a BRICS-wide digital payment system and a potential common currency is reshaping the bloc's financial architecture. While a unified BRICS currency remains aspirational, the group's experiments with local currency trade and blockchain-based transactions are reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar. The Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), a $100 billion liquidity pool, further insulates BRICS members from Western financial shocks.

Investors should monitor the performance of BRICS-focused ETFs like the iShares MSCI BRIC ETF (BKF) and the WisdomTree Brazil Equity Fund (EBR). Additionally, fintech firms operating in BRICS markets—such as Nubank (NU) in Brazil or Paytm (PAYTM) in India—are well-positioned to capitalize on the shift toward digital finance.

Geopolitical Risks and Mitigation Strategies

While BRICS offers compelling opportunities, investors must remain mindful of geopolitical risks. Internal divisions, particularly between China and India, and the lingering impact of U.S. tariffs on Brazilian exports, could disrupt momentum. However, Brazil's diplomatic agility—evidenced by its role in brokering the G20's 2024 climate agreement—suggests a capacity to navigate these challenges.

To mitigate risk, investors should adopt a diversified approach:

- Sectoral Diversification: Allocate across clean energy, infrastructure, and technology to hedge against sector-specific volatility.

- Currency Hedging: Use BRICS-focused ETFs or local-currency bonds to reduce exposure to dollar fluctuations.

- Political Risk Insurance: Consider instruments like the MSCI Emerging Markets Political Risk Index to assess country-specific vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: A New Era of South-South Cooperation

Brazil's 2025 leadership of BRICS marks a turning point in the Global South's quest for economic autonomy. By prioritizing stability, sustainability, and multilateralism, Brazil has transformed BRICS from a geopolitical talking shop into a dynamic engine of growth. For investors, this means opportunities in green infrastructure, digital finance, and cross-border partnerships that transcend traditional East-West divides.

As the world grapples with the aftermath of the Ukraine war and the rise of multipolarity, Brazil's balancing act offers a blueprint for navigating uncertainty. The BRICS bloc, under Brazil's stewardship, is not just a counterweight to the West—it's a bridge to a more inclusive and resilient global economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 14:56:51.282126

Taking to X, he wrote that the production is set to ""begin soon as per ICAO's CORSIA standards with an annual capacity of 3 crore litres.""

""With more such facilities coming up in the country, we are well on the path to meet the target of 1 per cent SAF blending in all international flights by 2027 and cut our aviation carbon footprint,"" he said in the X post.

He praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for this ""milestone"".

""I believe it is a milestone under the leadership of PM Shri @narendramodi ji towards India's commitment to sustainable aviation,"" he added.

In 2014, the ethanol blending was just 1.53 per cent. By 2022, India achieved 10 per cent blending, five months ahead of schedule. The original target of 20 per cent blending (E20) by 2030 was advanced to 2025 and has already been achieved in the current Ethanol Supply Year.

Ethanol production has surged dramatically, growing from 38 crore litres in 2014 to 661.1 crore litres by June 2025.

This remarkable growth has helped reduce the country's dependence on imported crude oil, leading to a significant saving of Rs 1.36 lakh crore in foreign exchange.

E20 blending in petrol was introduced by the Centre to reduce the country's oil import cost, energy security, lower carbon emissions and better air quality.

India however has no plans to mandate the blending of ethanol with diesel. The issue of blending ethanol with diesel is still at an experimental stage.

Notably, at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi committed to an ambitious five-part ""Panchamrit"" pledge, including reaching 500 GW of non-fossil electricity capacity, generating half of all energy requirements from renewables, and reducing emissions by 1 billion metric tonnes by 2030.

India also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 45 per cent. Finally, India commits to net-zero emissions by 2070. (ANI)

But, the blossoming new technology has been hit with skepticism when it comes to farmers incorporating it into their operations.

Zach Johnson, also known as the Millennial Farmer, was the moderator for the panel focusing on artificial intelligence. He said he believes that his children growing up with artificial intelligence will be much like how he grew up with Google, and later down the line, a smart phone. Joining him on the panel were Ken O’Brien, agronomy innovation leader with Corteva, and Don Scribner, director of product for TerraClear.

So far, there have been many bells and whistles when it comes to AI, but when looking past those shiny pieces of equipment and technology, Scribner believes AI is setting up farmers for success in a more realistic way.

“You see autonomous tractors. You see spot spraying happening. Combines are changing their settings as we go. But if you kind of think about what it's doing today, it's really setting up, and it's sensing and acting really quickly,” Scribner said. “Where it's going to step forward is this ability to start bringing in more and more inputs … give information quickly to farmers, so you can maybe make changes before you go to the field, as you're in the field, and maybe make a different decision than you would have in the past.”

While AI is set to make decisions easier in the future, some worry about potentially being replaced by the technology. O’Brien doesn’t anticipate that in his field of work. However, he thinks it’s important to work with the technology instead of against it.

“I don't think technology like AI or digital solutions in general are going to replace agronomists, but I tell the agronomists at Corteva or Pioneer all the time, I do think agronomists who understand how to use these tools are going to replace those who don't. They're going to be more valuable to their customers. They're going to understand how to increase performance more,” O’Brien said.

Another worry farmers are voicing is the lack of security that can come along with AI. Many worry about a data breach or someone getting a hold of their or their farm's personal information. Panelists urged farmers to be careful with their information, even if they do not utilize AI into their current farming operation.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/529eea6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x4284+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fe5%2F7d31458f4b2796395b2694b2247e%2Fimg-3348.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:56:26.251682

Wakil Direktur Utama Pertamina Oki Muraza mengatakan, perusahaan kini tidak hanya berfokus pada bisnis hidrokarbon sebagai warisan (legacy business), tetapi juga telah mengembangkan beragam solusi energi hijau. Salah satu inovasi utama yang ditonjolkan adalah program pengembangan bioetanol di lingkungan Pertamina Group.

“Pertamina tengah memanfaatkan berbagai jenis feedstock lokal seperti molase (produk samping industri gula), batang sorgum, dan nira aren untuk memproduksi bioetanol. Produk ini nantinya akan digunakan sebagai bahan bakar campuran (blending) untuk gasolin,” terang Oki pada kegiatan forum Konvensi Sains, Teknologi, dan Industri (KSTI) di Bandung, 8 Agustus 2025.

Selain bioetanol, lanjutnya, Pertamina juga menampilkan progres pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sebagai solusi bahan bakar ramah lingkungan untuk sektor penerbangan, serta bahan baku minyak goreng bekas atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO). Ke depan, Pertamina mendorong terbentuknya ekosistem nasional untuk pengumpulan UCO sebagai bahan baku SAF. Dengan langkah tersebut, Indonesia diharapkan mampu menjadi pusat produksi SAF untuk kawasan ASEAN.

“Kedepannya kita berharap akan ada ekosistem untuk pengumpulan minyak goreng bekas atau used cooking oil menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Cita-cita besarnya Indonesia nanti akan menjadi hub bagi produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel di ASEAN,” imbuh Oki.

Pada kesempatan yang sama, Pertamina juga menyampaikan apresiasinya terhadap dukungan pemerintah dalam inisiatif menyelenggarakan forum KSTI 2025 yang digelar di Gedung Sasana Budaya Ganesha (Sabuga), Bandung, Jawa Barat yang berlangsung pada tanggal 7 - 9 Agustus 2025.

Menurut Oki, Forum KSTI 2025 dinilai sangat strategis dalam membuka peluang kolaborasi antara industri, perguruan tinggi, dan lembaga riset.

Partisipasi Pertamina dalam acara ini menegaskan posisi perusahaan sebagai pemimpin transisi energi di Indonesia. Dengan mengedepankan inovasi, kolaborasi, dan riset berkelanjutan, Pertamina berkomitmen mendukung agenda nasional menuju energi yang lebih bersih, efisien, dan berdaulat.

“Tentunya kita mendapatkan lebih banyak lagi kerjasama dengan universitas-universitas termasuk dengan balai penelitian, BRIN yang nantinya akan membantu Pertamina dalam menjalankan mandat dari pemerintah. Baik itu di hulu, meningkatkan produksi di hilir, meningkatkan efisiensi, menghasilkan BBM yang ramah lingkungan, dan juga di bidang energi terbarukan, sebagai kontribusi untuk meningkatkan porsi dari renewables atau energi terbarukan di dalam bauran energi nasional,” ujar Oki.

Hari Kebangkitan Teknologi Nasional menjadi momentum bagi Pertamina untuk mempercepat adopsi teknologi inovatif yang berdampak langsung pada keberlanjutan energi.

Inovasi teknologi bukan sekadar tren, tetapi kebutuhan strategis bagi keberlangsungan energi.

As a founding member of the Alliance, launched during India’s G20 Presidency in 2023, the country has been instrumental in shaping its vision and mobilizing support from both developed and developing nations.

Through robust policy initiatives such as the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme and targeted financial incentives, India is not only advancing its domestic biofuel industry but also contributing significantly to global energy transition goals. By fostering international collaboration and promoting technology sharing within the Alliance’s framework, India is cementing its leadership in the global biofuels sector.

Institutional progress and International partnerships

The GBA formally adopted its Governance Framework during the fifth Temporary Executive Committee (TEC) meeting held on July 24, 2025, marking its transition into a full-fledged international organization. Earlier, in October 2024, the Alliance signed the Host Country Agreement with the Government of India, establishing its Secretariat in New Delhi.

These developments signal a major step toward institutionalizing the GBA and strengthening its international mandate. India’s role as host further enhances its strategic position in the global biofuel landscape.

The GBA’s membership has expanded to 32 nations and 14 international organizations, with keen interest received from other countries and organizations as well.

Economic and strategic benefits for India

The Alliance is expected to generate several benefits for India’s biofuel economy. Among its goals, the GBA aims to provide new opportunities for Indian industries by positioning the country as a global knowledge base and production hub for biofuels — including ethanol, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG).

India’s active participation in the Alliance reinforces its influence in the global biofuels sector, offering a platform to showcase its advancements and attract international collaboration.

Key initiatives and global outreach

As an international organization, the GBA has undertaken a range of initiatives to promote the awareness and adoption of biofuels worldwide. It has actively participated in major national and international events such as COP28, COP29, the World Economic Forum, and India Energy Week (2024 and 2025). These engagements have enhanced visibility at the intersection of policy and industry.

The Alliance has also hosted curated roundtables, panel discussions, a Knowledge Webinar Series, and released joint statements to further global dialogue on biofuels. Its participation in high-level forums like the G20 and G7 has contributed significantly to the global narrative on sustainable energy transitions.

Public awareness and research publications

To broaden its public outreach, the GBA launched several social media campaigns, including the “Do You Know” initiative, aimed at highlighting key facts and benefits of biofuels. Additionally, it published two whitepapers — “Potential of Non-grain-based Biofuels in India’s Energy Transition” and “Role of Bio-based Diesel in Diesel Transition” — which advocate for the critical role of biofuels in decarbonization and global energy sustainability.

With India moving forward beyond E20 to higher ethanol blends, providing diversified fuel choices might be revisited sometime in the future.
In the event of incompatibility, the use of lesser ethanol blends where available (e.g., E10) is recommended for modifications from authorised service workshops.","Speaking at the Biofuels 360° Summit in New Delhi, Pankaj Jain, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas Secretary, put an end to speculation on India's ethanol blending strategy with a straightforward statement: petrol pumps will only have E20 on sale, which is 20 per cent ethanol and 80 per cent petrol, in the future. There will be no buffet of fuel blends such as E10, E20, or E30. Speaking exclusively with Acko Drive, Jain explained that the government's plan for now is to stick with the E20 blend and ensure that there's no confusion among customers, logistical nightmares for oil companies, and delays in achieving environmental goals. ""For now, we only have the e20 blend, but other blends will happen in due course, of course, the matter is under consideration with the inter-ministerial committee, so it's too soon to comment.""

Jain presented the move as a step towards long-term decarbonisation, citing international precedents like Brazil's E27, while assuring the public that Indian vehicles and fuel systems are prepared to handle E20. Yet he also left room for higher levels in the future, once the market, the manufacturing, and the infrastructure fully fall into line.

Why Only E20, for Now?

Jain noted that one blend makes logistics easier, avoids consumer complexity, and facilitates faster policy implementation. Having several alternatives, such as E10, E20, or E30, available at fuel stations would make distribution, retail, and campaigns more complex.

Supporting E20 with Global Examples and Indian Readiness

Jain referred to Brazil's long experience with E27 (27 per cent ethanol) as evidence of viability. Most international automakers already support such blends, implying Indian-origin or India-sold cars should have no problems with E20. He expressed belief in the ecosystem developed thus far, such as regulatory structures, fuel standards, and manufacturer participation, to enable the transition to E20.

Looking Beyond E20? Perhaps Later

Whereas there's no instant step towards dual blends, Jain kept the door ajar. With India moving forward beyond E20 to higher ethanol blends, providing diversified fuel choices might be revisited sometime in the future. Meanwhile, however, E20 continues to be the country's uniform, crystal clear and single.

Context: India's Biofuel Journey

This is according to India's ethanol blending plan: from an aspirational vision a few years ago to exceeding 10 per cent ethanol blending ahead of the timeline, and now attaining E20 earlier than anticipated. In parallel, the government is promoting second-generation ethanol (from farm waste) and investigating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on a phased basis.

Public Concern and Industry Response

Though official guarantees have been made, unease lingers. Car manufacturers and some drivers are concerned with engine incompatibility, decreased fuel economy, and corrosion, particularly on older, non-E20-tuned cars. The ministry and independent research oppose these concerns: fuel efficiency effect allegedly minimal, component wear acceptable, and engine damage mostly anecdotal. These assurances are meant to pre-empt disinformation and support public confidence.

Will Existing Vehicles Require Changes?

For most post-April 2023 vehicles, fuel systems have already been upgraded to be compatible with E20 by automakers. Yet, numerous cars made before this time, particularly pre-2015 models, can suffer from material wear or engine knocking from increased ethanol levels. Compatibility lists were issued by manufacturers, and in a few instances, minor modifications like replacement of fuel lines or resetting the ECU might be necessary.

What Do Owners of Older Cars Do?

Owners of older cars are recommended to consult OEM advisories to ascertain E20 compatibility. In the event of incompatibility, the use of lesser ethanol blends where available (e.g., E10) is recommended for modifications from authorised service workshops.

Regional Readiness: States Leading and Lagging

States like Delhi-NCR, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka are already a step ahead in terms of E20 adoption because of robust ethanol manufacturing capability and superior blending infrastructure. In contrast, some north-eastern states and parts of the hill regions are set to experience slower rollout because of logistical issues, limited ethanol availability, and fewer blending facilities.

The Big Question: Is Going E20-Only the Right Move?

Requiring only one fuel mix streamlines rollout and enhances clarity. Is it overly inflexible, though? With no fallbacks, how do we guard against older car owners or areas of lower awareness? As India goes greener, must flexibility in fuel selection be sacrificed for tempo, or is consistency the wiser, more scalable route?",https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/E20_Fuel_Pump_7db62410de.webp,N,,2025-08-09 10:56:13.223411

Under the “make-in-India” framework, the project includes installation training, warranty support, and long-term service for operators. The equipment will feature modular designs for easier scaling and maintenance, advanced thermal management, and digital controls to ensure stable operation under demanding plant conditions.

AEG Power Solutions has supplied similar systems for hydrogen projects in Europe and North America. “India is emerging as one of the most important green hydrogen markets, and local manufacturing is critical to its growth,” an AEG executive said.

The agreement is expected to reduce reliance on imported rectifiers, which have faced high duties, long lead times, and inconsistent after-sales support. Local production will allow customization for India’s climate and renewable energy patterns, shorten delivery times, and improve service response.

Industry experts say the move supports India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, which aims to produce 5 million tonnes of hydrogen annually by 2030. Reliable domestic supply of power electronics is seen as a major step toward lowering project costs, speeding up commissioning, and improving the competitiveness of green hydrogen against fossil fuel–based alternatives.

The partnership is also expected to create skilled jobs in research, manufacturing, and field service, while building domestic expertise in high-voltage electronics.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/green-hydrogen.png,N,,2025-08-09 11:56:11.745279

The PUC granted a site permit to Gopher State Solar for its project in Renville County , north of Bird Island in Kingman, Osceola and Bird Island townships.

The company has secured a 1,645-acre area and will place solar panels on 977 of those acres, as previously reported by the West Central Tribune. The project of up to 200 megawatts will use photovoltaic panels and connect to Great River Energy’s existing Panther Substation, according to the news release.

The company estimates it will cost $187.75 million to $242.5 million to develop, including construction and all of the associated engineering and permitting needs, according to the report by the West Central Tribune. It estimates the operation will generate $32 million in tax revenues over an expected 40-year life span.

A site permit was also approved for Coneflower Energy’s solar project of up to 235 megawatts in Custer Township in Lyon County. Coneflower has proposed two interconnection options — a new 345-kilovolt transmission line to a future Xcel Energy substation or a new switching station to connect to an existing 115-kilovolt transmission line, according to the news release.

Both projects are expected to be operational by late 2027.

Based on extensive community input and feedback from state and local agencies, the PUC directed the solar companies to undertake several key mitigation activities, according to the news release.

These requirements, which were a direct result of public engagement and consistent with site permits for other recent solar energy projects, include working with landowners to develop and implement visual screening to minimize aesthetic impacts, creating vegetation management plans for pollinator-friendly plants and employing local Minnesota workers.

“The feedback we received from local communities was critical to our decision-making process,” said Commissioner John Tuma in the news release. “We heard directly from landowners about their concerns, and as a result, the final permits require additional visual screening and landscaping. This is a great example of how engaging in the process helps us create a better result for everyone.”

These projects align with the PUC’s core mission of ensuring safe, reliable and sustainable utility services at just and reasonable rates, according to the news release.

Responding to growing public interest and concerns around ethanol-blended fuels, Puri strongly defended the success and future of the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme. He revealed that India had achieved its ambitious E20 blending target in the current Ethanol Supply Year (ESY)-five years ahead of the original 2030 timeline, and well in advance of the revised 2025 goal.

“Ethanol blending gained serious momentum only after 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office. At the time, blending stood at just 1.53 per cent. By 2022, we reached 10 per cent-five months ahead of schedule-and now E20 is already a reality,” Puri said. He emphasised that ethanol-blended petrol is safe and reliable, countering widespread concerns about vehicle damage.

“There has not been a single case of engine failure or breakdown since E20 became a base fuel 10 months ago. Look at Brazil-they've run on E27 for years without issues,” Puri stated, warning that “vested interests” were attempting to derail India's ethanol revolution through misinformation.

Environmental and Economic Benefits, Minister Puri underlined the multiple gains from ethanol adoption:

* Over ?1.4 lakh crore in foreign exchange savings

* Significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions

* Cleaner air and better engine performance

* Increased income for farmers

He noted that innovative ethanol production methods, such as 2G ethanol refineries in Panipat and Numaligarh, are turning agricultural waste like parali (crop stubble) and bamboo into clean fuel-addressing both pollution and farmer livelihoods.

Highlighting a major transformation, he said ethanol derived from maize had grown from 0% in 2021-22 to 42% in 2025, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of India's biofuel programme.

Flex-Fuel Vehicles and Future Targets. On the rollout of Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs), Puri said that Indian automobile manufacturers are already developing E85-compatible vehicles, in coordination with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

“The Ethanol Blending Roadmap (2020-25) has laid the foundation. With the success of E20, we'll now scale gradually to E25, E27, and E30, with BIS standards and incentives in place.”

Farmers as Energy Partners

The Minister stressed that ethanol blending is more than a fuel strategy-it's a social and economic revolution.

“This is about empowering our Annadatas (farmers), turning them into Urjadatas (energy providers). Over the past 11 years, ethanol procurement has enabled ?1.21 lakh crore income to farmers, reduced crude imports by 238.68 lakh metric tons, and saved ?1.40 lakh crore in foreign exchange,” he said.

Pioneering Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Puri also spoke about India's push into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The Ministry is working with oil marketing companies, airlines, and global partners to build a phased SAF roadmap.1% SAF blending for international flights by 2027

2% target for 2028, with further scale-up as supply grows. He cited the example of the Indian Oil Corporation refinery in Panipat, which is already producing SAF from used cooking oil, showcasing India's innovation in sustainable energy.

§48 – Energy Credit The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.
FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.","This is an updated version of the alert published on July 4.

President Trump signed H.R.1, commonly referred to as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (the ""Act"") into law on July 4, 2025. Below are our summaries of the amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations.

The focus of the changes in the Act are as follows:

Special rules apply to wind and solar, including (i) a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for facilities beginning construction after July 4, 2026, (ii) removal of ""energy property"" under section 48 from 5-year MACRS depreciation, and (iii) amendments to the applicable domestic content percentages under section 48E;

Enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, including (i) application of the ""material assistance"" rules to wind and solar facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, (ii) extending the period for assessment to 6 years for a deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"", and (iii) introducing accuracy-related penalties for understatements of income tax by more than 1% due to overstating the ""material assistance cost ratio"" of property qualifying for credits under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E;

Codification of the beginning of construction rules in IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, for purposes of the FEOC requirements;

""Metallurgical coal"" is eligible for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45X in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, and until Dec. 31, 2029; and

Clean hydrogen production facilities beginning construction before Jan. 1, 2028, remain eligible for credits under section 45V, with no applicable FEOC requirements.

Reference Guide for Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the Act, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after the year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property continues to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

""Energy property"" as defined in section 48 is no longer listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property continues to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits terminate for wind and solar facilities that (i) begin construction after July 4, 2026, and (ii) are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction by July 4, 2026, are not subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar will phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill initially passed by the House of Representatives included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property will be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2027) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit is allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) are apparently not subject to the rule above.

Observation: Residential solar electric property is not subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers is still eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 may qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009, has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power are eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is fixed at 30% and can not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh does not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance is no longer necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate can not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the base credit amount is the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026).

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit terminates for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027; and

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit is terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently do not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate phases out based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, are not credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate phases out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) is credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, is not credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the Act), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025 that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules are required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components are credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers may still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period is extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, can not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and Treasury will provide distinct emissions rates for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z is not credit eligible, and Treasury is authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury is authorized to prescribe rules for sales to related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (and fuel sold or used before July 4, 2025 that has not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) is not allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF does not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) does not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A is extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount is increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and is in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit may be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the “tech-neutral” ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

As of July 4, 2025, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification will not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§48D – Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit

For qualified property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is increased to 35%.

Observation: An advanced manufacturing facility must begin construction before Jan. 1, 2027, to be eligible for credits under section 48D.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The Act does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" are prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X than to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;19

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act; or21

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally means 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" means the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" also means a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

There is an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale does not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" is determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentages are:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentages are:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components, the threshold percentages are:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components, the threshold percentages are:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals, the threshold percentages are:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Act codifies that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury is required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027, applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Treasury must issue material assistance safe harbor tables by Dec. 31, 2026. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier is required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, is not included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification introduces an additional layer of complexity. The statute further authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity may be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty applies to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" means a disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" causes an ""excessive payment"" and incurs the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification is required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 10:56:26.229602

Taylor Swift received plenty of backlash for taking numerous flights on two private jets during her 2023 tour.
For example, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce planet-warming gas pollution for aircrafts by as much as 94%, according to the Department of Energy.","The week after July 4 is apparently a big one for billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Bob Iger.

That's when dozens meet for a massive annual summit coined as a billionaire summer camp. Business leaders from across the country fly into the Sun Valley Friedman Memorial Airport in Sun Valley, Idaho.

According to Business Insider, the airport may see as many as 190 aircraft arrive on the Tuesday following July 4, just about double what the airport usually welcomes.

Tim Burke, the director of the airport, told Business Insider that the event leads to ""the busiest week of the year here in the Wood River Valley.""

The annual summit is intended to bring CEOs together to discuss business and future power plays. But its carbon footprint is difficult to ignore. The influx of nearly 200 jets into a small-town airport highlights how many people — particularly the ultra-wealthy — prioritize convenience over the planet.

A 2023 report by the Institute for Policy Studies found that the top 1% of people may be responsible for half of all aviation emissions.

Another report from the European Federation for Transport and Environment stated that private jets may be up to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes.

That all adds up fast when dozens of private jets pile into a single rural airport. But it's certainly not the first case of public frustration over luxury travel and its environmental cost.

Taylor Swift received plenty of backlash for taking numerous flights on two private jets during her 2023 tour. Jeff Bezos also drew criticism when he added an $80 million jet to his collection.

Some of the criticism is because everyday consumers and families are encouraged to change their habits, like driving less or cutting energy use, to help the planet.

On a Facebook post from news anchor Maggie O'Mara (@MaggieOMaraJournalist), one commenter asked if the point of the summit was to ""laugh at the rest of us?""

Some alternatives could prove healthier for the planet if people can encourage the top 1% to get on board.

For example, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce planet-warming gas pollution for aircrafts by as much as 94%, according to the Department of Energy. Some aviation leaders are also experimenting with hybrid-electric aircraft, which can use about 5% less fuel than standard aircraft.

Supporting companies pushing for change, like those investing in sustainable airline fuel and low-emissions aircraft, could help move the industry in a cleaner direction.

It may also signal to billionaires that strong leadership means taking responsibility for actions that impact the environment.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/billionaire-summer-campimage-rec9YF9e5b4HicZri.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 10:56:29.759428

“We already have 113 compressed biogas (CBG) plants operational, with another 73 currently under construction,” he said, underlining the progress in clean energy infrastructure.
“Our domestic gas production is rising at an annual rate of 18%, though we still import about 50% of our natural gas requirements,” he noted.
In the meantime, we will continue to import, increase domestic production, and diversify our sources,” he said.
To reduce risk and ensure stable supplies, India now sources oil and gas from nearly 40 countries around the world.","Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, on Friday outlined India’s ongoing efforts to enhance domestic energy production while acknowledging the country’s continued reliance on imports to meet rising demand.

Speaking at the Pioneer Biofuels 360 Summit in New Delhi, Puri said India is making notable advancements in the bioenergy and natural gas sectors. “We already have 113 compressed biogas (CBG) plants operational, with another 73 currently under construction,” he said, underlining the progress in clean energy infrastructure.

The Minister pointed to the growing number of CNG-compatible vehicles entering the Indian market as another positive development. “If you look at the new car models being launched, many are CNG-compatible. That in itself is a success story,” he added.

Highlighting the scale of LPG distribution in the country, Puri noted that India now has 33.5 crore LPG connections, including 10.5 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. However, despite this extensive network, he admitted that around 60% of LPG is still imported.

“We are defying the usual trends. Even with such wide coverage of LPG connections, we remain dependent on imports,” he said.

To address this gap, the government is pushing forward on multiple fronts to increase domestic fuel production. “Our refineries will scale up output, and we’re ramping up efforts in exploration and production (E&P),” Puri said.

On the natural gas front, he reported positive growth. “Our domestic gas production is rising at an annual rate of 18%, though we still import about 50% of our natural gas requirements,” he noted.

Puri reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), stressing that while full energy self-sufficiency will take time, progress is being made. “A country like India, facing these challenges, is steadily moving toward self-reliance. In the meantime, we will continue to import, increase domestic production, and diversify our sources,” he said.

India, the third-largest energy consumer globally, currently uses around 5.4 million barrels of oil per day. It imports roughly 80% of its crude oil and 50% of its natural gas needs.

The 10th International Conference on Bioenergy and Biomass (ICBB) was held at the IPB International Convention Centre in Bogor on August 4–5, organised by the university’s Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Centre (SBRC) in partnership with the International Society for Biomass and Bioenergy.

“Our theme reflects Indonesia’s future energy needs — securing supply through the sustainable use of biomass and bioenergy,” said Dr. Meika Syahbana Rusli, SBRC Chair at IPB University.

A major focus was the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), seen as both an opportunity and a challenge for the country. Dr. Meika noted that while Indonesia has made progress in biodiesel production, SAF faces technical, economic, and logistical hurdles. “Our roadmap is ambitious: 1% of total fuel from SAF by next year, 2.5% by 2030, and 5% by 2035. These targets will not be easy to achieve,” he said.

SBRC is working on technology to turn solid biomass into bio-oil through gasification, which has drawn interest from Airbus Singapore. With supplies of lipid-based feedstocks for SAF expected to decline by 2030, biomass could become the primary raw material.

Edi Wibowo, Director of Bioenergy at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said the government is preparing new regulations to speed up bioenergy growth. “We want to maximise this potential to strengthen national energy independence and security,” he said.

The cross-border Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Analysis was commissioned by Washington State Department of Commerce (Commerce) and the British Columbia Ministry of Energy and Climate Solutions, and the Alberta Hydrogen Analysis was commissioned by the Government of Alberta.

The studies were conducted by Deloitte and developed to enable policymakers, industry stakeholders, Indigenous and Tribal Nations, and regional partners to better understand the economic landscape, funding tools and policy frameworks that support the development and deployment of hydrogen. Together, these studies serve as a resource to help develop robust cross-border hydrogen economies that attract investment, enable multi-sector uses and support high-quality jobs across the region.

“The Pacific Northwest has long been at the forefront of energy innovation,”Matt Morrison, PNWER executive director, said. “These new hydrogen studies build on this momentum and chart a path for how we can work together across jurisdictional borders to build an interconnected, low-carbon hydrogen economy that competes on the global stage.”

Pacific Northwest Low-Carbon Hydrogen Analysis

British Columbia and Washington state are demonstrated leaders in planning for and investing in low-carbon hydrogen economies to drive growth, diversify energy tools and enhance regional energy resilience. This first-of-its-kind study explores cross-border collaboration opportunities that leverage geographic proximity and existing relationships to drive economic growth, infrastructure development and hydrogen accessibility.

“Washington is a clean hydrogen leader nationally and internationally. We recognize the important role clean hydrogen plays in reducing harmful emissions, bringing good jobs to the state, and strengthening our robust clean technology industry,” Commerce Director Joe Nguyen said. “By building on our longstanding relationship with British Columbia and working more closely together, we can boost clean hydrogen market growth in our region and amplify its positive impacts here at home and across the broader Pacific Northwest.”

“Low-carbon hydrogen is part of a sustainable, clean energy future,” Adrian Dix, Minister of Energy and Climate Solutions, said. “Through B.C.’s Clean Energy and Major Projects Office, we are working with project proponents, industry, First Nations and local communities to create a world-leading hydrogen economy, and this collaborative work will help all of us in the Pacific Northwest to achieve that milestone.”

Each jurisdiction is critically positioned with alternative electricity grids and existing hydrogen technology expertise that supports infrastructure and energy development. The Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association (PNWH2), part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs program, plans to build eight hydrogen hubs across Washington, Oregon and Montana over the next 6-10 years.

Key Recommendations:

Share data and coordinate planning of hydrogen projects and initiatives across jurisdictions in the Pacific Northwest.

Evaluate opportunities to harmonize policies to facilitate cross-border hydrogen development, including funding mechanisms and seamless trade.

Support ways to involve, partner with and benefit Tribes, First Nations and communities. This includes educational resources, associations and collaboration to uplift indigenous voices.

Advance regional hubs and cross-jurisdictional corridors for aligned hydrogen and synthetic fuel use.

Commerce’s Green Electrolytic Hydrogen and Renewable Fuels Recommendations for Deployment in Washington Legislative Report (January 2024) informed study results. In recognition of shifting federal policy in the U.S. and Canada, the study emphasizes state/provincial-level planning and coordination between British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho.

Alberta Hydrogen Analysis

The Government of Alberta launched its Hydrogen Roadmap in 2021, which outlines a comprehensive strategy for hydrogen production, research and development, carbon capture and use cases across sectors. The new Alberta Hydrogen Analysis expands these efforts by putting forward recommendations to enhance Alberta’s hydrogen funding and regulatory landscape, support new and existing hydrogen hubs, assess potential for hydrogen-fueled transportation, and explore export potential to other Pacific Northwest provinces and states. The Government of Alberta will take the Alberta Hydrogen Analysis into advisement as it revisits the Hydrogen Roadmap in 2025.

“Hydrogen can be a game changer for Alberta and the Pacific Northwest’s energy diversity and security. The results of this research will inform Alberta’s Hydrogen strategy and create new partnerships, all while advancing innovation to ensure Alberta’s hydrogen economy continues to develop. Alberta will continue to grow as a Canadian and global leader in low-cost clean hydrogen production.” Brian Jean, Minister of Energy and Minerals, said.

Alberta has a well-established hydrogen value chain with hydrogen hubs in Edmonton, Calgary and other locations. The Government of Alberta aims to expand hubs in Alberta and the greater region to develop a comprehensive network of integrated hydrogen supply chains. Washington, Oregon, Montana and Idaho are expected to see significant increase in demand for hydrogen by 2050, giving rise to bi-lateral trade capacity and necessary cross-border cooperation. Alberta is the jurisdictional host for the 2026 PNWER Annual Summit in Edmonton next year.

Key Recommendations:

Ensure regulatory efficiency, codes and standards in a governance toolkit tailored to hydrogen hub operations.

Lead a formal platform for hydrogen hubs across Canada to share knowledge and best practices.

Build new market demand by implementing incentives and support tools to reduce hydrogen adoption barriers.

Fund research and development opportunities to lower costs through technology, innovation and attract capital investment.

Pursue hydrogen exports by conducting assessments on transportation logistics corridors to identify bottlenecks and investment opportunities.

Enable carbon capture, utilization and storage to reduce lifecycle emissions and support low-carbon certification.

Activate technology and innovation to underpin a successful long-term hydrogen economy strategy.

Both studies were presented in a session at the PNWER Annual Summit in Bellevue, Washington, and will be made available for online viewing. Policymakers, Tribal and First Nations, and industry leaders are encouraged to engage with the findings and participate in upcoming engagement activities.

Using these studies as a foundation, PNWER aims to lead the establishment of a Pacific Northwest Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition in partnership with the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Association and Montana Renewables. Modeled after the Minnesota SAF hub, the coalition will convene regional stakeholders in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and western Canada to support the production, storage and deployment of SAF in the Pacific Northwest. The coalition is planned to meet in late summer 2025.

The Pacific Northwest Low-Carbon Hydrogen Analysis was supported with funding from Washington’s Climate Commitment Act. The CCA supports Washington’s climate action efforts by putting cap-and-invest dollars to work, reducing climate pollution, creating jobs, and improving public health. Information about the CCA is available at www.climate.wa.gov. PNWER gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Province of British Columbia through the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation, and the Province of Alberta through the Ministry of Energy and Minerals and Ministry of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction.

Responding to a question on the success of the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme, the Minister highlighted that ethanol blending gained serious momentum only after 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed office. In 2014, ethanol blending was merely 1.53%. By 2022, India achieved 10% blending, five months ahead of schedule. The original target of 20% blending (E20) by 2030 was advanced to 2025 and has already been achieved in the current Ethanol Supply Year (ESY). This success, the Minister noted, was made possible through sustained policy reforms such as guaranteed pricing for ethanol, allowing multiple feedstocks, and rapidly expanding distillation capacity across the country.

Dispelling misinformation and false narratives surrounding ethanol-blended fuel, Puri emphasized that there has not been a single case of engine failure or breakdown reported since E20 became a base fuel over the last 10 months. Citing Brazil’s example, he said the country has run on E27 for years without any issues.

Some lobbies with vested interests are actively attempting to create confusion and derail India’s ethanol revolution. However, such efforts will not succeed. The E20 transition is already firmly underway, backed by strong policy support, industry readiness, and public acceptance—and there is no turning back.

Elaborating on the benefits of E20, the Minister said it results into reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, enhances engine performance, and has already led to over ₹1.4 lakh crore in foreign exchange savings. He pointed out that 2G ethanol refineries in Panipat and Numaligarh are converting agricultural residues like parali and bamboo into ethanol, providing a win-win solution for clean fuel, pollution control, and farmer income. He further highlighted the remarkable growth of maize-based ethanol—from 0% in 2021–22 to 42% this year—calling it a transformational shift.

On the issue of Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs), Puri said that the Indian automobile industry has already demonstrated its capability. Indian OEMs have begun rolling out prototypes for E85-compatible vehicles. Continuous consultations have been held with the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and other major auto manufacturers, and the direction is clear—progressively moving towards higher ethanol blends. The Ethanol Blending Roadmap (2020–25) has laid a strong foundation, and the successful rollout of E20—five years ahead of target—demonstrates both industry readiness and consumer acceptance. The country will now gradually scale towards E25, E27, and E30 in a phased, calibrated manner with the support of BIS standards and fiscal incentives.

The Minister stressed that ethanol blending is not just about mixing fuel—it is about empowering Annadatas by turning them into Urjadatas., reducing crude imports, saving foreign exchange, creating green jobs, and honouring India’s climate commitments. Over the past 11 years, ethanol procurement has enabled ₹1.21 lakh crore income to farmers, reduced crude imports by 238.68 lakh metric tons, and saved ₹1.40 lakh crore in foreign exchange.

Speaking about India’s efforts in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Puri said the Ministry is working closely with oil marketing companies, airlines, and global technology partners to develop and scale up SAF. Like ethanol, India will adopt a phased approach to SAF adoption. A blending mandate has already been initiated, with a target of 1% blending for international flights by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028, and scaling further as supply stabilizes. He also cited the example of the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. Refinery in Panipat, which is using used cooking oil to produce SAF—showcasing India’s innovative and sustainable pathway forward.",https://indianpsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image002WXOH.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 11:57:05.940005

At the forefront of this transformation is OPAL Fuels, a renewable natural gas (RNG) innovator that has captured the attention of investors and policymakers alike. With a staggering 33% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) RNG production growth in 2025, OPAL is not just riding the wave of climate-conscious investing; it is engineering the wave itself.

Strategic Positioning in the RNG Sector

OPAL Fuels' success stems from its dual focus on technological agility and policy alignment. RNG, derived from organic waste streams like dairy manure and food waste, is a critical bridge between legacy fossil fuels and a net-zero future. Unlike synthetic alternatives, RNG leverages existing infrastructure, making it a cost-effective and scalable solution. OPAL's vertically integrated model—spanning feedstock acquisition, production, and distribution—positions it to capitalize on the sector's rapid expansion.

The company's infrastructure pipeline is equally compelling. By 2026, OPAL plans to triple its RNG production capacity, with new facilities in key agricultural regions of California and Texas. These projects are not speculative; they are underpinned by long-term offtake agreements with major transportation and energy companies. This visibility into future revenue streams reduces operational risk, a rare advantage in the volatile clean energy sector.

Policy Tailwinds: The 45Z Tax Credit Extension

The recent extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit through December 31, 2029, under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (H.R.1), has supercharged OPAL's growth trajectory. The 45Z credit, which provides a per-gallon incentive for low-carbon fuels, is now more accessible than ever for companies like OPAL that prioritize domestic feedstock.

The 2025 amendments to the 45Z credit—requiring feedstock to originate from North America and excluding indirect land use change emissions—align perfectly with OPAL's operational strategy. The company's partnerships with U.S. dairy farms and waste management firms ensure compliance with these new standards, while the prohibition on double crediting for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) eliminates competition for overlapping incentives. This creates a “first-mover” advantage for OPAL in the RNG-to-transportation segment, where demand is surging due to corporate net-zero pledges and federal clean fuel mandates.

Data-Driven Investment Case

To quantify OPAL's momentum, consider the following:

- Production Growth: OPAL's RNG output has grown 33% QoQ in 2025, outpacing the industry average of 18%.

- Cost Structure: The company's all-in production cost of $1.20 per gallon (vs. $1.50 for peers) is driven by its proprietary anaerobic digestion technology and low-cost feedstock.

- Policy Leverage: With the 45Z credit now extended for five years, OPAL's effective tax rate is projected to drop by 15%, boosting EBITDA margins.

Risks and Mitigations

Critics may point to RNG's reliance on volatile policy environments and the need for continued infrastructure investment. However, OPAL's diversified feedstock portfolio, long-term contracts, and alignment with bipartisan climate goals (e.g., the Inflation Reduction Act) insulate it from regulatory shifts. Additionally, the company's recent $200 million debt financing at historically low interest rates ensures it can execute its expansion plans without diluting shareholder value.

Conclusion: A Near-Term Buy

For investors seeking exposure to the decarbonization revolution, OPAL Fuels offers a rare combination of near-term scalability, policy tailwinds, and operational discipline. The 45Z extension through 2029 is not just a regulatory win—it is a catalyst for compounding growth. With RNG demand projected to grow at a 25% CAGR through 2030, OPAL is poised to capture a disproportionate share of this market.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 11:57:10.834661

Indian Oil's Panipat refinery has been crowned the country's first to pump out sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil, The Times of India reported. The word ""sustainable"" makes eco-warriors faint with joy, and SAF is just one ""E"" shy of SAFE. Maybe we should toss in Union Minister Nitin Gadkari's beloved ethanol and call it SAFE: Sustainable, Awesome, Fry-powered Ethanol.

Inspectors from Swiss certification firm Cotecna's Indian arm have certified the Panipat refinery, declaring it fit to turn your post-pakoda sludge into jet fuel. They have also saddled us with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), a UN dream to make planes fly without guilt.

By 2027, India has been roped into blending 1% SAF for international flights, inching to 2% by 2028. Domestic flights will follow. Late arrivals are not new.

INDIA NO STRANGER TO SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

SAF is no stranger to our headlines, even if it makes little headway. Back in August 2018, SpiceJet flew a Bombardier from Dehradun to Delhi on a 75:25 mix of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and jatropha-based biofuel, cooked by the Indian Institute of Petroleum.

In 2022, IndiGo flew with a 10% SAF blend on a ferry flight from Toulouse to Delhi. These trips are made to make headlines, followed by the kind of silence you hear after a flop Bollywood sequel.

Jatropha, that weed we have idolised since childhood for its firepower, was once India's biofuel heartthrob. In the 2000s, we planted it like crazy, believing it would free us from oil imports. It did not. Yields on marginal lands were as pathetic as Raid 2, and it gobbled farmland, jacking up food prices. Now, it's a sidekick, not Shah Rukh Khan of biofuels.

Ethanol has had it better because it found a guardian in Nitin Gadkari. India hit 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025, five years early, saving Rs 1.36 lakh crore in foreign exchange and pumping production from 38 crore litres in 2014 to 661.1 crore litres.

If your scooter is whining about mileage, and your car's fuel injectors are throwing tantrums, you clearly are from the petrol lobby. Tough luck, aam aadmi, tweet your tears, but ethanol is here to stay. Buy an E-20-compliant car and see the blending go up to E-27 as declared.

The government is now eyeing ethanol for SAF via the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, aiming for 30 billion litres annually from crop waste and municipal trash. It is pricier than ATF, like Chayos chai versus roadside cutting, but who, if not you, will sustain the sugar industry by buying its byproduct?

REAL PAKODA OF COOKING OIL PUZZLE

advertisement

Now, the real pakoda of a puzzle: collecting used cooking oil. Where will the Panipat refinery source the crude oil to refine, in this case, used mustard oil. By door-to-door collection, like trash collected every morning? Will we have 3 coloured bins now: green, blue and yellow for the oil? Or grovelling to pakoda-walas to donate their black, tar-like treasure, reused till it's basically liquid regret? The answer, my friend, is frying in the kadhai!

India could churn out 19-24 million tonnes of SAF yearly, but a 5% blending target needs 140 million litres of oil. That's a Himalayan pile of pakodas to fry. Supply chains are shakier than a cycle rickshaw on a Gurugram flyover. Villagers in Chhattisgarh and Karnataka scrounge jungles for jatropha seeds, which then hitch-hike hundreds of miles to refineries.

Here's where you, proud Bharatiya naagrik, become the hero India didn't ask for. Set up a pakoda stall, and you are not just self-employed, you are a cog in the crude oil supply chain to Panipat. Fry hard, dream big! India's gunning for 8-10 million tonnes of SAF by 2040, needing Rs 6-7 lakh crore in investments to cut oil imports by $5-7 billion annually. Over 1.2 million jobs could sprout, if we ever sort out this logistical circus.

advertisement

So, fuel your imagination, not disappointments. Turning your kitchen oil into jet fuel is like betting on a bullock cart to win Formula 1. If we can somehow wrangle the oily drippings from a billion samosa-holding hands, maybe, just maybe, that cart will zoom past the chequered flag. Until then, keep frying pakodas and save the planet.

In April, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency certified the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 Enhanced Performance (EP) for the type, featuring lighter materials, improved aerodynamics, and upgraded turbine cooling. The result is at least a one percent reduction in fuel burn, translating into lower emissions, reduced costs, and potentially longer nonstop flights.

For airlines, even a marginal gain matters. On an 18-hour flight, the EP could save around $1,200 in fuel.

Citing Brazil’s long-standing experience with higher ethanol blends, Puri noted that the country has been running on E27 for years without any operational issues. Speaking at a Fireside Chat Session on the sidelines of the Pioneer Biofuels 360 Summit, the minister also alleged that some vested interest groups are actively trying to spread misinformation and derail India's ethanol revolution.

“The E20 transition is already firmly underway, backed by strong policy support, industry readiness, and public acceptance—and there is no turning back,” said the minister.

His comments came in response to growing social media backlash over complaints about decreased fuel efficiency and mileage following the rollout of E20 in the country. Many users criticized the government, arguing that no other country mandates the use of E20 and that fuel prices have not been reduced despite the 20% ethanol blending.

Defending the ethanol policy, Puri highlighted multiple benefits of E20. “It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality, enhances engine performance, and has already resulted in foreign exchange savings of over ₹1.4 lakh crore,” he said.

He also pointed to the operational success of 2G ethanol refineries in Panipat and Numaligarh, which convert agricultural residues like paddy straw (parali) and bamboo into ethanol—offering a sustainable solution that addresses clean fuel needs, pollution control, and increased income for farmers.

Puri further underlined the significant rise in maize-based ethanol production, which has grown from 0% in 2021–22 to 42% this year. “This is a transformational shift,” he said.

On the topic of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the minister said the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is working closely with oil marketing companies, airlines, and global technology partners to develop and scale up SAF production and adoption.

""India will follow a phased approach to SAF, just like ethanol,"" Puri said.

The refinery received its certification from Cotecna Inspection India, a branch of the Swiss-based Cotecna Inspection Group, after a detailed verification process. The move is the result of close coordination between the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

The aviation industry is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise because aircraft cannot yet rely on battery-powered propulsion for long flights. SAF is seen as a game-changing solution, capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. It works as a direct replacement for aviation turbine fuel (ATF) without requiring changes to aircraft engines, making it one of the fastest deployable green technologies for the sector.

Panipat’s SAF is also compliant with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), a global framework developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to help airlines meet carbon reduction targets. This compliance ensures the fuel meets both domestic and international sustainability standards, opening doors for global adoption.

Used cooking oil that is often wasted is collected from restaurants, food processing units, and households. It is then filtered to remove food particles, purified to eliminate contaminants, and refined through a series of chemical processes to produce jet-grade SAF. This not only provides an alternative fuel source but also helps prevent improper disposal of waste oils, which can harm the environment.

The government is planning a SAF blending mandate starting with a requirement that 1% of all fuel uplifted for international flights from India must be SAF by 2027. The long-term vision includes expanding this requirement to domestic flights and gradually increasing the blending percentage in the following years.

India has also been conducting test flights with SAF-blended fuel over the past two years, working with airlines, oil companies, and research bodies to ensure the transition is smooth and technically sound. The Panipat milestone now provides the infrastructure backbone to scale up production.

Globally, aviation accounts for about 2-3% of CO₂ emissions, but its share is expected to grow as more people fly. India’s SAF initiative, starting at Panipat positions the country as a serious player in sustainable aviation and could also open export opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.

Among these players, Thai Airways International (THAI) stands out as a rare success story—a national carrier that has not only survived a near-bankruptcy crisis but is now poised to redefine its role in the Asia-Pacific aviation ecosystem. With a 26.5% EBIT margin in Q1 2025 (the highest among full-service carriers in the region), a debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37 (down from 20.66 in 2019), and a 170-billion-baht five-year strategic plan, THAI's transformation offers compelling long-term investment potential.

Financial Turnaround: From Insolvency to Resilience

Thai Airways' journey from insolvency to financial stability is a masterclass in corporate restructuring. By Q1 2025, the airline had slashed liabilities from 400 billion baht in 2020 to 95 billion baht, while shareholders' equity grew to 55 billion baht. Its liquidity position—152 billion baht in cash and equivalents—provides a robust buffer against market shocks. This financial discipline is reflected in its operating performance: a 12.3% year-on-year revenue increase in Q1 2025, driven by a 21.1% rise in available seat kilometers (ASK) and a 20.8% jump in revenue seat kilometers (RPK).

The airline's EBITDA of 13,661 million baht in Q1 2025 (up 26.5% YoY) underscores its operational efficiency. This outperforms regional peers like Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Cathay Pacific, which are still grappling with post-pandemic recovery.

Strategic Initiatives: Building a Future-Proof Airline

THAI's 170-billion-baht investment plan (2024–2029) is a blueprint for sustainable growth. Key pillars include:

1. Fleet Modernization: 120 billion baht allocated to expand the fleet from 78 to 150 aircraft by 2033, with next-gen Boeing 787s and Airbus A321neos enhancing fuel efficiency and passenger experience.

2. Fleet Rationalization: Reducing aircraft types from eight to four and engine variants from nine to five, slashing maintenance costs and training complexity.

3. Digital Transformation: Upgrading booking platforms, enhancing direct sales (targeting 25% of revenue), and deploying AI-driven maintenance systems.

4. Premium Cabin Expansion: Increasing premium cabin revenue share from 0.5% in 2024 to 10% by 2033, capturing higher-margin business travelers.

5. Strategic Partnerships: A joint business agreement with Turkish Airlines expands THAI's European network to 60+ routes without additional aircraft.

These initiatives align with global trends, such as the shift to fuel-efficient aircraft and digital-first customer engagement. THAI's net-zero emissions goal by 2065 and partnerships with PTT Global Chemical for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) further position it as an ESG leader.

Competitive Positioning: Outperforming Peers in a Challenging Sector

THAI's strategic focus on profitability and operational agility sets it apart. While many carriers rely on tourism—a volatile revenue stream—THAI has pivoted to high-value business travelers, ensuring stable cash flows. Its 22% market share at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) reinforces its role as a regional hub, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) projecting 5.2 billion travelers in 2025.

The airline's debt restructuring and liquidity position also mitigate risks. For context, THAI's debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37 is significantly lower than Air France-KLM's 2.8 or Lufthansa's 1.5, offering greater flexibility in volatile markets.

Long-Term Investment Potential: A Buy for Resilient Growth

For investors, THAI's combination of financial discipline, strategic clarity, and operational execution makes it an attractive long-term play. Key catalysts include:

- Fleet Expansion: Deliveries of 45 Boeing 787s and 32 Airbus A321neos from 2027 will drive capacity growth and route optimization.

- Premium Revenue Growth: A 10% premium cabin share by 2033 could boost margins, as business-class tickets typically yield 3–5x higher revenue per seat.

- Digital and ESG Momentum: Enhanced digital platforms and sustainability initiatives align with investor priorities, potentially attracting ESG-focused capital.

However, risks remain, including fuel price volatility and regulatory costs (e.g., CORSIA compliance). THAI's strong liquidity and phased capital deployment—funding the first two years of its plan with existing cash—mitigate these concerns.

Conclusion: A Reformed Titan in the Making

Thai Airways' turnaround is not just a financial success story but a strategic repositioning for the future. By balancing disciplined growth with innovation, the airline is transforming from a national carrier into a global competitor. For investors seeking exposure to a reformed aviation leader with a clear path to profitability, THAI offers a compelling case. As it resumes trading on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) and executes its 170-billion-baht plan, the airline's focus on premium services, digital agility, and sustainability positions it to thrive in the post-pandemic era.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-08 16:56:08.450195

Global SAF production is projected to increase from 2.2 billion liters in 2025 to 14 billion liters by 2030 in the base case, with an accelerated case estimating up to 20 billion liters.

Europe is expected to remain the largest SAF consumer through 2030, supported by the ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and other regional policies.

Current supply is mainly based on waste oils such as used cooking oil and tallow, which face long-term availability constraints.

United Airlines has contracted approximately 14 billion liters of SAF, the highest volume among airlines, with procurement strategies moving toward investment in production capacity.

More than 60 SAF projects are planned to begin operations in 2025.

On 7th August 2025, cCarbon hosted its latest webinar unveiling the 2025 edition of its Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Outlook, offering a detailed assessment of the sector’s current status, policy environment, production pathways, feedstock trends, and forward projections to 2030. The presentation drew on cCarbon’s extensive research across North America, Europe, and Asia, supported by proprietary facility-level tracking, offtake deal monitoring, and policy analysis.

Current Market Status

Global SAF production reached 1.17 billion liters in 2024, up from just 29 million liters in 2019, reflecting a steady growth driven by regulatory mandates, voluntary offtakes, and maturing production technologies. For 2025, output is expected to nearly double to 2.2 billion liters, with North America and Europe leading the way.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, beginning at 2% SAF blending in 2025 and scaling to 70% by 2050, creates long-term demand certainty. In North America, state-level programs like California’s LCFS are generating significant credit volumes, while Asia-Pacific markets such as Japan, Singapore, and potentially China are laying groundwork for rapid adoption.

Feedstocks and Supply Chain Pressures

Waste-based feedstocks dominate current supply: Used Cooking Oil (UCO) – projected to hit 465,000 tonnes in 2025 (CAGR 158% since 2019) while Tallow & Waste Oils – projected at 457,000 tonnes in 2025 (CAGR 105%)

These low-CI feedstocks are highly valued in compliance markets but face long-term constraints. By 2030, renewable diesel and SAF combined could require 80% of global current tallow supply. Vegetable oils such as soy and canola remain secondary due to higher CI scores and sustainability scrutiny. Emerging options like forestry residues, agricultural waste, and ethanol-based feedstocks are expected to scale later in the decade, while Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels remain cost-intensive.

Offtake Agreements and Market Maturation

2022 was a watershed year with 39 offtake deals signed, totaling over 21 billion liters in future supply. Since then, annual deal volume has declined, reflecting market maturation, supply constraints, and a shift toward strategic partnerships and equity investments.

United Airlines leads with over 14 billion liters contracted (≈35% of global airline offtakes) and Southwest Airlines follow with multibillion-liter commitments

Top suppliers include Gevo, Fulcrum BioEnergy, and Alder Fuels, each targeting distinct feedstock and technology niches.

Technology Pathways

The HEFA route accounts for roughly 90% of current production due to its commercial readiness and feedstock compatibility. The HEFA pathway currently dominates SAF production because it is technically mature, commercially proven, and compatible with existing refinery infrastructure. However, its reliance on waste oils and fats such as used cooking oil and tallow limits scalability. Global supply of these feedstocks is finite and already faces competition from renewable diesel production, creating a bottleneck for further HEFA growth.

To meet 2030 production targets and longer-term decarbonization goals, the industry is focusing on scaling three additional pathways that can draw from more widely available or scalable feedstocks

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) – ethanol-based

Gasification/Fischer-Tropsch – municipal solid waste and biomass residues

PtL – green hydrogen plus captured CO₂

Regulatory Momentum

Existing frameworks such as the US Renewable Fuel Standard, California LCFS, Canada’s CFR, and ICAO’s CORSIA are complemented by emerging mandates in Singapore, China, India, and Japan. The US SAF Grand Challenge targets 10 billion liters/year by 2030.

Capacity Build-Out

Over 65 new SAF projects are slated to start in 2025 alone. Planned capacity additions between 2025 and 2028 are dominated by large projects from Shell (15.2 billion liters planned) and SGP BioEnergy (10.4 billion liters), alongside expansions from Neste, TotalEnergies, and major North American refiners.

SAF Certificates (SAFc)

SAFc instruments are emerging to verify and track SAF use, aligned with schemes like ISCC and RSB, and frameworks such as CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive. These certificates trade in a wide range (USD 300–500/tCO₂e abated), with prices negotiated bilaterally.

Challenges and Market Perceptions

While the SAF sector is expanding, several structural issues remain. High production costs — often three to four times higher than fossil jet — continue to slow adoption. Feedstock availability, particularly for waste oils and fats, limits near-term scale-up. Infrastructure for blending, storage, and distribution is still under development in many regions, and the regulatory environment remains uneven across markets.

Polling during the webinar reinforced these themes. Most respondents viewed higher costs relative to conventional jet fuel as the main constraint to wider SAF adoption, consistent with the cost differential outlined in the presentation. Limited availability and supply was the second most cited challenge, reflecting the feedstock constraints and slow project ramp-up discussed earlier. Regulatory incentives, infrastructure readiness, and uncertainty over environmental benefits were mentioned less frequently but remain relevant to scaling.

When asked about the likely timing for cost parity without subsidies, the largest share of respondents pointed to after 2035, underscoring a cautious outlook on near-term competitiveness. A smaller group expected parity between 2030 and 2035, while a notable minority believed it would never occur. These views suggest that market participants expect SAF adoption to remain reliant on policy support and targeted investment for at least the next decade.

Conclusion

The SAF sector is at a pivotal stage. The next five years will determine whether momentum from policy, investment, and offtake commitments can overcome cost and supply constraints. With clear mandates, diversified feedstock strategies, and continued capacity expansion, SAF could deliver a material share of aviation’s decarbonization pathway by 2030.

Joining Growth Energy in celebration of the August 8th birthday are leaders from across the heartland, who have helped to make the RFS America's single most successful policy for increasing U.S. energy security, holding down fuel costs, reducing emissions, and strengthening the farm economy.

Since the RFS became law in August 2005, American biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol. In that same time period, American ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue to American farmers. As a result of these benefits, the program is supported by a broad, bipartisan spectrum of stakeholders.

Growth Energy

""The RFS is the foundation of America's bioeconomy,"" said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. ""It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it's still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren't yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.""

Farmers

""The RFS is more than a law. It's a vital outlet for surplus grains that provides stability and prosperity to American farmers facing higher input costs and uncertain export markets,"" said Bill Couser, a farmer from Iowa who grows commercial corn that he sells to local plants to be processed into fuel ethanol. ""I don't know that our family's farm would be as strong as it is today if it weren't for the RFS and the American biofuels industry.""

""Since the RFS was enacted, America's net farm income has more than doubled. In Iowa alone, biofuel plants purchase more than half the state's corn crop — transforming it into homegrown fuels, high-quality animal feed, food-grade CO2, and a host of other co-products,"" said Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a third-generation corn and soybean farmer based in northwest Iowa. ""It's an integral part of the agricultural supply chain.""

Lawmakers

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard program has helped us produce fuel that reduces our emissions and fosters energy independence—and I'm proud to help continue leading the push in the Senate to increase the use and supply of American-grown, American-made biofuels across the country,"" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). ""We're pushing hard for our bipartisan bill to enable the year-round sale of E15 nationwide, and as founding co-chair of the Sustainable Aviation Caucus in the Senate, I'm working to bolster and help expand our nation's sustainable aviation fuel industry. Investing in American biofuels doesn't just help us reduce our nation's carbon footprint—it helps lower gas prices for middle-class families and support our farmers. It's a win-win-win that would not be possible without the RFS.""

""Over the last 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been essential to empowering heartland communities, adding value to crops grown by our hardworking farmers, securing American energy independence, and giving consumers a cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). ""Iowa farmers already feed our nation, and by guaranteeing homegrown Iowa biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply, the RFS secures their role in fueling our nation's future. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration to ensure the RFS stays strong, so we can keep delivering for Iowa's famers, biofuel producers, and rural communities.""

""Nebraska is the nation's second-largest producer of ethanol, and much of that is made possible by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), established 20 years ago,"" said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). ""The RFS has played a critical role in supporting Nebraska's ag economy, driving both the use and production of renewable fuels across the state.

Defense contractors are pressing ahead with the development of alternative aviation fuels for military use, even as the Trump administration has moved away from a number of sustainability efforts.

The use of alternative aviation fuel can directly improve mission and operational effectiveness for the United States and its partners and allies, providing “strategic value by increasing energy resilience and broadening the range of viable fuel sources,” said Javier Botello, associate fellow for fuel systems and aviation fuels at Lockheed Martin.

“It allows military operations to tap into synthetic or regionally produced fuels in places where conventional supply chains may be disrupted or constrained. It allows forces to operate across a wider range of bases, including allied or commercial facilities that are [synthetic aviation turbine fuel]-enabled,” Botello said in an email. “For the U.S. military and allied forces, this translates into greater operational reach, logistical robustness and alignment with sustainability mandates.”

Jon Hemler, lead analyst for military aerospace and weapons systems at Forecast International, said leveraging alternative fuels can strengthen energy security by expanding fuel sourcing and reducing fossil fuel dependency.

“For military operations, this could mean flexibility and resiliency for the supply chain and improved logistics,” Hemler said in an email. “Certain [alternative aviation fuels] lower emissions and lead to more effective combustion, which could reduce thermal signatures and improve performance and efficiency for aircraft.”

While alternative aviation fuels offer significant defense advantages, challenges such as lack of infrastructure, limited availability and higher costs still persist, Hemler said.

“At the moment, AAFs only make up a small percentage of in-use aviation fuels, and that translates to higher procurement costs and availability hurdles,” he said.

Additionally, the Trump administration has sought to end various programs and policies aimed at addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices.

For example, on the first day of his second term in January, President Donald Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change, and rescinded a number of executive orders issued by former President Joe Biden prioritizing climate and environmental issues in an executive order titled, “Initial Rescissions Of Harmful Executive Orders And Actions.”

Under the previous administration, there was “significant growth” in sustainable aviation fuel production, but the Trump administration has sent “more mixed signals” on pursuing alternative fuel initiatives, Hemler said. The same goes for military sustainability initiatives, such as the Department of Defense Climate Adaptation Plan 2024–2027, which called for the prioritization of climate-informed decision-making and the training and equipping of a climate-ready force.

“There appears to be a continuation of some programs, but the Trump administration has also taken a more critical tone on climate issues while strongly supporting domestic fossil fuel production,” he said. “As a result, continued investments and efforts toward integrating AAFs appear at risk, and it’s unclear how long-term implementation will be affected.”

Despite these challenges, defense contractors are developing several alternative aviation fuels, from synthetic aviation turbine fuel to hydrogen fuel cell technology, experts said.

Synthetic aviation turbine fuel, or SATF, is produced through alternative methods rather than being refined directly from crude oil. These alternative chemical processes include Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a catalytic process that converts carbon monoxide and hydrogen into a variety of hydrocarbons; alcohol-to-jet pathways, which convert alcohols, such as ethanol or isobutanol, into fuel; or converting renewable oils and fats into renewable diesel, Botello said.

While SATF performs “on par” with traditional jet fuel, it does burn more cleanly due to lower sulfur and aromatic content, resulting in “fewer particulate emissions and reduced engine soot accumulation,” leading to enhanced engine health and reduced maintenance demands, Botello said.

“When produced from renewable sources, SATF can achieve 50 to 80 percent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the raw materials and production pathway,” he said. “This supports environmental goals, particularly as defense and aviation sectors strive to meet international climate targets and U.S. Department of Defense objectives.”

One of the more significant challenges the defense sector faces when it comes to synthetic aviation turbine fuel use is the assessment and approval process.

“Military aircraft operate under unique performance and safety requirements,” Botello said. “Any new fuel, including SATF, must therefore undergo a rigorous assessment process that confirms the fuel’s compatibility with aircraft systems under operational stress.”

The Air Force and industry partners are moving forward with approving sustainable aviation fuel such as SATF for military use.

Roberto Guerrero, deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for operational energy, said in an email the service’s current focus is ensuring ASTM International’s standards development processes for new sustainable aviation fuels are “compatible with our weapon systems,” as well as “understanding our energy demands and how innovations in both platforms and mission planning systems that reduce fuel demand impacts our operational effectiveness.”

In July 2024, Boeing released guidance to its defense customers that company-built military aircraft can operate on sustainable aviation fuel at the currently approved limits of up to 50 percent blend with conventional fuel.

Boeing Defense, Space and Security CEO Steve Parker stated in a company press release that sustainable aviation fuel “is widely accepted today as a drop-in replacement that works with existing aircraft and also provides opportunities for global interoperability as well as strategic resilience through local fuel production. We hope this [No Technical Objection] will clear the way for more widespread SAF adoption by our military customers and propel greater alignment between commercial and military fuel standards, to the benefit of all.”

In January, Lockheed Martin approved the use of synthetic aviation turbine fuels in the F-35, with the Norwegian Air Force becoming the first to fly the fighter jet with SATF. In June, the company expanded use of the fuel to the F-16 Fighting Falcon and C-130 Hercules.

While Hemler called these developments a “significant step,” it’s less a win for the Defense Department and more a win for international partners and overall interoperability.

“U.S. defense primes are moving the needle forward. … These are aircraft that have a large global footprint and are operated by air forces all over the world,” he said. “So, I think we’re observing a response to international demand.”

Along with alternative fuels, some aviation companies are researching and developing hydrogen fuel cell technology to power next-generation military aircraft.

The fuel cell, which is a device that generates electricity through an electrochemical reaction instead of combustion, takes hydrogen from tanks in the aircraft and converts it chemically into electricity to power the electric propellers.

Val Miftakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “Hydrogen is very lightweight itself and stores more energy per kilogram than even jet fuel, and that’s how we can get this electric platform to potentially go even longer distances with higher payload than jet fuel. And that’s what some of the defense [world] is really interested in, where the aircraft [can loiter] for a number of hours, even longer than what’s possible on jet fuel.”

Hydrogen fuel cell technology can help lower manufacturing and operating costs for military aircraft, Miftakhov said in an interview on the sidelines of the Paris Air Show in June.

Maintenance costs are “much, much lower and fundamentally driven by the fact that you don’t have combustion or high temperature, high pressures that you have to deal with, that the materials have to deal with,” he said. “As a result, your equipment lasts longer and fails less, so maintenance costs are much lower, and maintenance intervals are much longer, so you can have your vehicle in operation for a longer time.”

One of the more significant benefits hydrogen fuel cell technology provides is noise reduction.

“The noise signature, acoustic signature is much lower, but thermal signature is virtually nonexistent, because, again, we don’t have any combustion, so no high temperature on the vehicle,” Miftakhov said. “It’s all under 100, 200 [degrees Celsius], some very low temperatures compared to a turbine or any kind of internal combustion engine.”

Additionally, hydrogen fuel can be made on military bases at the point of need.

“You can do it in a remote operation, you just have a couple of containers that you can drop at one time and deploy the solar panel, deploy the electrolyzer with storage, and you have fuel production right there,” Miftakhov said. “You don’t need to convoy JP8,” the type of jet fuel widely used by the U.S. military.

In March, the Air Force’s innovation arm, AFWERX, awarded ZeroAvia a Small Business Innovation Research grant to conduct a “feasibility study focused on integrating hydrogen propulsion into Cessna Caravan aircraft alongside advanced aircraft automation technology,” a company press release stated.

At the Paris Air Show, Airbus and MTU Aero Engines signed a memorandum of understanding to progress hydrogen fuel cell propulsion, “a promising and critical technology to decarbonize aviation,” an Airbus press release stated.

“If defense officials want to move toward more sustainable fuel options, then they will need to communicate the importance of the technology in securing energy independence and reducing logistical challenges,” Hemler said. “Operationalizing and growing AAFs for military use will require continued budgeting for research and development while addressing energy infrastructure needs.”

Increasing the use of alternative fuels in military aircraft is “a capital-intensive effort that requires cooperation and prioritization among industry partners, government and ministries of defense,” Hemler said. “There needs to be a unified long-term dedication to that goal, and changes in political and spending objectives can affect progress toward that end.”

Cathay Pacific’s recent procurement of 14 additional Boeing 777-9 aircraft has intensified demand for GE Aerospace’s GE9X engines, which power the 777-9 fleet. The airline now operates 35 GE9X-equipped aircraft under a long-term agreement that includes maintenance and overhaul services. This order reinforces GE Aerospace’s dominance in the high-capacity jet engine market, where the GE9X’s 10% fuel efficiency edge over its predecessor and compatibility with sustainable aviation fuels position it as a strategic asset for carriers seeking operational cost reductions and regulatory compliance.

For Boeing, the transaction indirectly supports its 777X production pipeline, as Cathay Pacific’s fleet renewal aligns with its strategy to modernize aging aircraft. The 777-9’s 20% lower fuel consumption and extended range compared to older models enhance its appeal for long-haul routes, particularly in Asia-Pacific corridors. Cathay’s CEO highlighted the partnership’s role in expanding the airline’s global connectivity from its Hong Kong hub, a move that could bolster Boeing’s visibility in a region critical to its commercial aviation revenue.

“SAF currently produced from used cooking oil, waste palm oil and low-quality vegetable oils has limited production capacity due to competition with the food supply,” he said on Monday.
The company identified that Indonesia has the potential to produce 500 million tonnes of biomass annually, far exceeding their requirement of 100 million tonnes,” Meika added.
According to environmental watchdog Auriga Nusantara, nearly 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared for biomass production between 2020 and 2024.
If the cooking oil-based SAF passes all regulatory and quality benchmarks, it will be green-lit for the first test flight in August.","JAKARTA: Airbus’s Singapore branch has partnered with Indonesian researchers to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from biomass, aiming to source up to 100 million tonnes annually from Indonesia.

Biomass refers to organic materials such as crop waste, wood and other plant-based matter that can be converted into renewable energy, including biofuel for aviation. Airbus is currently collaborating with researchers at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) in West Java on a comprehensive study of biomass availability, logistics, supply chain mapping and optimal factory locations in Indonesia to minimise transportation costs.

Meika Syahbana Rusli, Head of IPB’s Surfactant and Bioenergy Research Centre (SBRC), said Airbus is “very interested” in developing SAF from biomass and has recognised Indonesia’s significant potential as a key supplier.

“SAF currently produced from used cooking oil, waste palm oil and low-quality vegetable oils has limited production capacity due to competition with the food supply,” he said on Monday.

“Airbus estimates that by 2030, SAF must be produced from biomass. The company identified that Indonesia has the potential to produce 500 million tonnes of biomass annually, far exceeding their requirement of 100 million tonnes,” Meika added.

He explained that regions in Sumatra and Kalimantan have large amounts of unused empty palm fruit bunches, while Java Island produces significant volumes of rice straw, which is mostly discarded or burned by farmers.

Despite Indonesia’s strong potential to produce biomass, Meika noted that major challenges remain, particularly in collecting biomass efficiently from farmers, given poor infrastructure in many remote areas.

He also pointed out regulatory gaps and a lack of research on effective and efficient methods to process biomass into plant based jet fuel or bioavtur at scale.

Indonesia has seen a steady rise in both exports and domestic consumption of biomass in recent years, particularly in the form of wood pellets and wood chips. While this trend presents new business opportunities, it also raises concerns over the growing risk of deforestation.

According to environmental watchdog Auriga Nusantara, nearly 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared for biomass production between 2020 and 2024. The group warns that far more forested land could be at risk as the country scales up biomass development, with industries increasingly clearing natural forests and replacing them with fast-growing monoculture plantations.

This expansion threatens the habitats of many endangered species, including orangutans in Sumatra and Kalimantan.

Last month, PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional (KPI), the refinery and petrochemicals arm of state-owned energy giant Pertamina, started production of SAF derived from used cooking oil at its Cilacap refinery.

Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of crude palm oil (CPO), has been piloting projects on converting CPO into bioavtur since 2021, as well as exploring the bioavtur potentials of used cooking oil, of which it is the third-largest exporter globally.

If the cooking oil-based SAF passes all regulatory and quality benchmarks, it will be green-lit for the first test flight in August.

The energy ministry is targeting a one per cent share of vegetable oil in its bioavtur blend by 2027 as part of the country’s broader efforts to reduce oil imports and lower carbon emissions.

In a statement made in December 2024, the International Air Transport Association highlighted SAF as a key component in decarbonising the aviation industry and urged governments worldwide to provide incentives for scaling up SAF production. - The Jakarta Post/ANN",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/08/08/3457558.JPG,N,,2025-08-08 11:56:22.316600

In letters sent to Iowa landowners this week, Griffin pledged updated business plans “to open new markets and create greater opportunities for the region,” along with revised right-of-way proposals that “better support landowners and their long-term interests.”

The proposed 2,500-mile pipeline would transport CO2 from nearly 60 ethanol plants to an underground sequestration site in North Dakota, enabling the fuel to be used for sustainable aviation fuel and sold into low-carbon markets such as California. The project also qualifies for lucrative federal tax credits.

However, Summit’s plan has faced years of resistance from landowners, environmental groups, and lawmakers over safety, property rights, and farmland impacts.

In the 1990s, China looked to Brazil for engineering know-how, with turbines for the Three Gorges Dam manufactured in São Paulo.
Bastos also admits that there is a limit to the extent that GWM can localise manufacturing of important components like batteries.
“As to how much we can expect to onshore – that’s a difficult question,” André Cieplinski, of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in Brazil, told Dialogue Earth.
The CEO of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association, Elbia Gannoum, is more bullish on the state of Brazil’s wind industry and the role of government policy.","The three-pointed star of Mercedes-Benz still watches over the highway in Iracemápolis, but the old German car factory beneath it has been under new ownership since 2021.

Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors (GWM), the facility’s new owner, is scheduled to begin production at the site this month. Most of GWM’s sales are still of petrol cars, but the new Iracemápolis plant will focus on hybrids, turning out the Haval H6.

The GWM factory, setting up in Brazil’s industrial heartland of São Paulo state, is just one of several recent Chinese investments in the country’s clean energy sectors that bring manufacturing onshore. Further north, in the state of Bahia, the world’s largest electric vehicle maker, BYD, has already started production of Brazil’s first domestically built battery‑electric passenger car, at a plant that was previously owned by Ford.

BYD has two other factories in Brazil: a foothold in the south-eastern city of Campinas, established in 2015, which makes electric‑bus chassis and solar‑panel modules; and a plant in Manaus, Amazonas state, that assembles lithium‑iron‑phosphate battery packs for BYD buses.

Both the GWM and BYD plants will initially assemble cars from kits imported from China, but the plan is to gradually increase the number of components manufactured in Brazil. “From next year, we will localise several items. We need to be a local company, to produce in Brazil – not just to take advantage of government incentives, but to export to the wider region,” said Ricardo Bastos, GWM Brasil’s director of institutional affairs, in an interview with Dialogue Earth.

Investments by GWM, BYD and Chinese wind turbine maker Goldwind, which purchased a former General Electric factory in 2024, align closely with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s “sustainable” reindustrialisation agenda.

“Manufacturing output is a permanent conversation in Brazil, but this government is particularly keen on pursuing industrial policies, so there is plenty of space for looking favourably at Chinese investment that goes into manufacturing,” Armando Castelar, coordinator of applied economics at the Brazilian Institute of Economics (IBRE), told Dialogue Earth.

On his state visit to Beijing in May, Lula secured several commitments by Chinese firms to invest in clean energy manufacturing, including from turbine maker Windey to build an assembly plant in Bahia. Lula also came back with a USD 1 billion commitment from Envision Energy to build a sustainable aviation fuel complex, and a plan from automaker GAC to break ground on a new EV plant in Brazil by 2026.

Energy cooperation between China and Brazil is not new. In the 1990s, China looked to Brazil for engineering know-how, with turbines for the Three Gorges Dam manufactured in São Paulo. By the 2010s, the dynamic had flipped, and China became a major source of investment and technology for Brazil’s energy sector.

China’s State Grid – the world’s largest utility company – has played a central role in developing Brazil’s electricity grid. It entered the market in 2010 and, after a series of high-value acquisitions, began competing in energy auctions. Deploying the “ultra-high voltage” transmission technology it developed to bridge vast distances in China, the firm built two lines that span the length of Brazil – and it continues to construct some of the country’s most ambitious transmission projects.

Oil has become another pillar of energy cooperation since the 2010s. In 2009, state oil company Petrobras tapped a USD 10 billion oil-for-credit line from China Development Bank, beginning a relationship that has seen China become one of Petrobras’s largest creditors and export markets.

Chinese investment in Brazilian renewables started with hydropower, which still dominates Brazil’s energy mix. Since 2015, China Three Gorges has deployed more than USD 5 billion in hydro acquisitions and upgrades. State Power Investment Corporation followed suit, paying USD 2.4 billion for the São Simão dam in Goiás state, but both firms have since pivoted to Brazil’s wind-rich Northeast region.

Lula also returned from Beijing touting a pledge from China General Nuclear to invest more than USD 500 million in a renewable‑energy complex in Piauí, also in the Northeast, adding to an ever-growing pipeline of Chinese-led wind and solar projects in the region.

A ‘notable’ increase

These investments are part of what Claudia Trevisan, executive director of the Brazil-China Business Council, described to Dialogue Earth as a “notable increase in Chinese-led projects linked to sustainability.”

With vast potential for growth in its already significant solar, wind and biofuels sectors, as well as a huge electricity market and a grid that is already made up of 90% low-carbon sources, many analysts are excited about Brazil’s green future.

“Brazil has the potential to emerge as a green energy hub, not just for Latin America, but for the world – and I think China sees this potential,” Paulo Feldmann, an economics professor at the University of São Paulo, told Dialogue Earth.

On signing the “Fuel of the Future” law, which locks in demand for low-carbon fuels, Lula vowed in October 2024 that Brazil will “deliver the greatest energy revolution on Earth”. Chinese officials and executives also appear optimistic. The CEO of Goldwind has spoken of Brazil’s

“unrivalled” wind resources, while “green development” was placed at the centre of China-Brazil cooperation last November, when the two countries signed an agreement on aligning China’s Belt and Road Initiative with Lula’s New Industry Brazil and Ecological Transformation plans – even if Brazil has continued to snub membership of China’s flagship overseas investment initiative.

But the twin goals of industrialisation and green transformation do not always align, with surging imports presenting challenges to local manufacturing hopes. Last year, the Global South overtook the Global North as the main export market for Chinese solar panels. Meanwhile, emerging EV markets like Brazil remain small in absolute terms, but they are growing fast and overwhelmingly dominated by Chinese exports.

Both these trends have been positive from a climate perspective. In Pakistan, ultra-cheap Chinese panels have triggered a grassroots solar boom, and according to Rodrigo Sauaia, the CEO of Brazilian industry group Absolar, a similar phenomenon is underway in Brazil – “we could talk about a solar transformation in the past ten years,” he told Dialogue Earth.

“As the Global South looks to decarbonise, China’s scale and ability to deliver low-cost clean energy technologies make it an indispensable partner,” said Aya Adachi, an associate fellow at the German Council for Foreign Relations. However, Adachi noted that these countries are not simply looking to import products – “they are adopting local content requirements and tariffs to encourage more value-added production”, she says, noting that “between 2016 and 2024, around two-thirds of global trade defence measures targeting China came from developing countries”.

Edgar Barassa, an expert in e-mobility with Barassa & Cruz consulting, highlighted risks for local industrial capacities. “The challenge is that Chinese firms – facing domestic overcapacity in EVs and batteries – are incentivised to export surplus production or assemble vehicles abroad with minimal integration.” Speaking to Dialogue Earth, he warned that “if left unchecked, this dynamic risks entrenching a peripheral role for Brazil in the clean tech value chain”.

Sticks and carrots

In an attempt to confront this challenge, Brasília has combined an arsenal of sticks and carrots to bring production onshore. Among these, the Brazilian development bank (BNDES) has unlocked BRL 300 billion (USD 54 billion) in subsidised credit under the New Industry Brazil strategy, while the auto‑focused Mover programme provides tax credits to firms so long as they relocate production to Brazil and channel a share of their turnover into domestic research and development.

On the defensive front, the government has reinstated import duties on electric vehicles, rising to 35% by July 2026; re‑imposed tariffs on solar panels, raising them to 25% in November 2024; and approved a hike in tariffs on completed wind turbines, from 11.2% to 25% by January 2026.

To some extent, Beijing and its corporate champions also face a dilemma – whether to keep relying on exports of ultra-competitive Chinese products or to invest in local manufacturing, placating Brazilian demands for investment and helping turn Brazil into a launchpad for Latin American exports.

Brazil can be a base for Chinese production to export to South America,” says GWM’s Bastos, “but for this, we must comply with a lot of local content rules”.

Concern about “unbalanced trade” with countries in the Global South is increasingly prevalent among Chinese think-tankers. Liu Hongzhong, for instance, who teaches economics at Xi’an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi, urges “more balanced and sustainable economic and trade cooperation with countries in the Global South”.

According to Adachi, “Beijing is aware of the tensions created by growing trade imbalances with the Global South, but unlike its often forceful responses to trade actions by high-income nations, China has largely avoided retaliating against developing countries”.

The clutch of manufacturing deals that Lula secured in May are evidence that Beijing is listening, but the jury is still out on how successful Brazil will be in capturing more of the cleantech value chain from China.

“I am cautiously optimistic,” said Barassa, “but the challenge lies in translating memoranda of understanding into investment projects that generate measurable socio-economic outcomes”.

Celio Hiratuka, an associate professor at the State University of Campinas, echoed this sentiment: “It’s too early to tell if the government has been successful,” he told Dialogue Earth. “GWM appears serious about selecting suppliers and is betting on local content, but I think that BYD is still testing the market – their strategy might be to postpone the moment they need to [begin to] produce here in Brazil.”

Recommended

BYD has faced criticism for flooding the market with imports, including via its car-carrier ship, the BYD Shenzhen, which is the largest vessel of its type in the world.

Bastos also admits that there is a limit to the extent that GWM can localise manufacturing of important components like batteries. “Producing the cells would be very, very expensive, but we are talking with suppliers about assembling batteries in Brazil,” he said.

“As to how much we can expect to onshore – that’s a difficult question,” André Cieplinski, of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in Brazil, told Dialogue Earth. “But even if we can’t onshore the whole battery manufacturing process, if we are able to nationalise other components, the result can be net positive for jobs.”

Although Cieplinski said that the Brazilian development bank has been very important for the development of solar in Brazil, Absolar’s Rodrigo Sauaia suggested that the government has not gone far enough in its industrial policy: “Brazil is the only possible hub for local manufacturing of solar photovoltaics in South America, but for that to develop, there are still some policies we need to work on.”

Referring to the government’s tariffs on solar panels, Sauaia added that, “rather than choke the market, it would be better to establish constructive policies – to use the government’s buying power to create demand and to establish strong industrial policy that incentivises the establishment of manufacturing hubs in Brazil”.

The CEO of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association, Elbia Gannoum, is more bullish on the state of Brazil’s wind industry and the role of government policy. “The Brazilian government has made significant efforts to keep the local supply chain active with job creation and to attract wind turbine manufacturing to the country,” she told Dialogue Earth, noting that “between 60% and 80% of wind turbine components (including blades, towers, and nacelles) are already manufactured in Brazil”.

Hiratuka said: “The Brazilian government is going in the right direction with its industrial policy, but they need to stay firm in the face of pressure from Chinese firms.”

For Hiratuka, the main risk lies in the general election due to be held in 2026: “The current government is moving in the right direction, but everything could change with a political turn at the next election.”",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/08/President-Lula-and-Lei-Zhang-at-the-signing-of-an-agreement-_Ricardo-Stuckert_Palacio-do-Planalto_5fac444a54.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 11:56:34.794137

Section 45Y and 48E property continues to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

""Energy property"" as defined in section 48 is no longer listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property continues to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits terminate for wind and solar facilities that (i) begin construction after July 4, 2026, and (ii) are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction by July 4, 2026, are not subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar will phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill initially passed by the House of Representatives included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property will be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2027) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit is allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) are apparently not subject to the rule above.

Observation: Residential solar electric property is not subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers is still eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 may qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009, has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power are eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is fixed at 30% and can not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh does not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance is no longer necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate can not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the base credit amount is the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026).

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit terminates for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027; and

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit is terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently do not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate phases out based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, are not credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate phases out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) is credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, is not credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the Act), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025 that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules are required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components are credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers may still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period is extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, can not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and Treasury will provide distinct emissions rates for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z is not credit eligible, and Treasury is authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury is authorized to prescribe rules for sales to related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (and fuel sold or used before July 4, 2025 that has not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) is not allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF does not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) does not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A is extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount is increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and is in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit may be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the “tech-neutral” ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

As of July 4, 2025, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification will not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§48D – Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit

For qualified property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is increased to 35%.

Observation: An advanced manufacturing facility must begin construction before Jan. 1, 2027, to be eligible for credits under section 48D.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The Act does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" are prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X than to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;19

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act; or21

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally means 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" means the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" also means a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

There is an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale does not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" is determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentages are:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentages are:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components, the threshold percentages are:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components, the threshold percentages are:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals, the threshold percentages are:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Act codifies that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury is required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027, applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Treasury must issue material assistance safe harbor tables by Dec. 31, 2026. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier is required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, is not included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification introduces an additional layer of complexity. The statute further authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity may be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty applies to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" means a disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" causes an ""excessive payment"" and incurs the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification is required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

I welcome a vigorous, data-driven debate on climate change to ensure the issue isn’t hijacked to restrict economic and personal freedoms.","Q: How is the Trump administration working to restore sanity to climate policies?

A: In the previous Congress, I served as ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee. The budget committee’s top job is drafting and enforcing the annual budget resolution that provides a public framework to manage the public purse. The budget resolution is the blueprint for congressional action on spending, revenue and the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The committee also tracks the appropriations process to ensure spending levels abide by the budget resolution. However, despite there being another Senate committee with responsibility for the environment, the Democrat Senate Majority in the previous Congress derailed the Senate Budget Committee’s top mission to push a radical climate agenda. Instead of rolling up our sleeves to address the national debt and rein in deficit spending, the Budget Committee held 21 “climate change” hearings, with themes on outdoor recreation, “fossil fuel overlords” and a so-called climate-driven insurance crisis. Climate change is a serious issue; an issue that merits a serious, science-based discussion. For years, a partisan-driven effort to create public hysteria about a climate-induced apocalypse has been manufactured by the media and climate activists. They’ve fought to shape public perception that man-made climate change poses an existential crisis to humanity. This whole hog approach to a climate-induced apocalypse was ginned up to allow for a whole-of-government solution. And the Obama and Biden administrations whipped up the climate frenzy to empower the federal bureaucracy and put the government in charge of the economy and people’s everyday lives. Consider the partisan-driven (and misnamed) Inflation Reduction Act that broke into Uncle Sam’s piggy bank to spend hundreds of billions to “tackle the climate crisis” and “advance “environmental justice.” The good news is the Trump administration’s Department of Energy is injecting desperately needed sanity and science into the conversation. In July, it released a peer-reviewed analysis about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions developed by five independent scientists comprising the Department of Energy’s 2025 Climate Working Group, including the former chief scientific officer in the Obama Energy Department.

The Climate Working Group found most extreme weather events in the U.S., such as hurricanes, tornados, floods and droughts, do not show long-term trends and the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather aren’t supported by U.S. historical data. The report’s analysis of solar activity calls into question “consensus” theories that greenhouse gas emissions are primarily responsible for rising temperatures.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright observes that media coverage distorts science about natural disasters, such as this summer’s flash flooding in the Texas Hill Country. Separately, another independent climate scientist, Dr. Roger Pielke Jr., said historical data does not show flash flooding has become more common or severe. He’s also testified before the Senate Budget Committee to impress upon lawmakers the “absolute highest standards of scientific integrity” are needed to shape climate policy.

Q: How are you working to push science-based policies to address climate change?

A: As a lifelong family farmer, I bring common sense environmental stewardship to the policymaking table in Washington. I welcome a vigorous, data-driven debate on climate change to ensure the issue isn’t hijacked to restrict economic and personal freedoms. During the Obama administration, I pushed back on pig-headed federal regulations on cow gas and Meatless Mondays. The livelihoods of Iowa’s 86,000 farm families depend on sustainable practices, conservation and ecosystem management that are rooted in science, not scare tactics. That’s why I’m proud to invite my fellow Iowans to share their expertise to dispel Washington nonsense and a climate consensus driven by a political agenda versus scientific integrity. Last May, I welcomed Dr. Michael Castellano, a professor at Iowa State University’s Department of Agronomy to testify about water scarcity. Through my legislative and oversight work, I’ll continue to push a science-based approach to climate policies, from next-generation renewable energy and biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel and 45Z regulations, to the agricultural and environmental benefits of biochar. If the American people fall hook, line and sinker for the narrative that modern human activity is an existential threat to the planet, then Big Government will keep trying to dictate to American families what cars to drive, what foods to eat, where to live and whether energy resources will keep pace with demand. The world needs an all of the above energy strategy to lift people out of poverty and ensure an adequate food supply. The government shouldn’t put up artificial barriers to energy production, from traditional fossil fuels to alternative energy, including wind and solar.",https://www.grassley.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.png,N,,2025-08-08 11:57:12.326185

Delivery of BETA's aircraft to the Test Arena concludes a 6976 km journey across seven countries in the EU; marks company's first operations with a BETA-trained customer pilot

STAVANGER, Norway, Aug. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bristow Norway AS, a subsidiary of Bristow Group Inc., today flew BETA Technologies' all-electric ALIA CX300 aircraft at Stavanger Airport, marking the first operations of Norway's Test Arena for Zero & Low Emission Aviation. The flights, which are being conducted in cooperation with Avinor and the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway (CAA Norway), mark a step toward integrating and scaling Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) in Norway and the surrounding regions.

The Test Arena will consist of a series of evaluation flights over the next several months, to test likely customer routes at Avinor-owned airports throughout Norway. Early routes will see ALIA fly between Stavanger and Bergen airports, with potential for the program to expand to additional routes across Norway later this year. The aircraft will be flown by BETA-trained Bristow pilots.

Today's flight was conducted by Bristow pilot, Jeremy Degagne, and Beta pilot, Nate Dubie. In addition to kicking off Norway's first Test Arena, this flight represents another key step on the road to commercializing AAM. A BETA-trained Bristow crew will pilot and maintain BETA's aircraft throughout the six-month regulatory sandbox evaluation project helping pave the way for future delivery and integration of this technology into the region.

""As a nation wholly dependent on aviation — today as well as in the future — transitioning to a more sustainable aviation industry is a major priority for my government,"" said Minister of Transport Jon-Ivar Nygård.

""This first flight represents a significant step on a long and complex journey. As the Test Arena demonstrates, cooperation between authorities, airports, manufacturers, operators — and not least, political support — is essential. The systemic approach the Test Arena facilitates is unique, and I am proud that Norway is at the forefront.""

""Today's test flight is an important step in turning climate policy into practical solutions. If we are to succeed with the green transition, we must test, learn and build – not just plan. With this test arena, Norway is taking a leading role in the development of zero-emission aviation, while also creating new opportunities for green jobs and innovation,"" said Minister of Climate and Environment Andreas Bjelland Eriksen.

""Bristow is proud to be a part of this cutting-edge program and our participation in this test arena directly aligns with our philosophical 'crawl, walk, run' approach to developing Advanced Air Mobility for commercial operations,"" said Dave Stepanek, Bristow's Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer. ""The information we learn through the test arena program will provide valuable operational insights that could help operators, manufacturers, and regulators better understand how best to move forward towards commercial operations.""

""To be delivering ALIA to our partners at Bristow and kicking off operational testing here in Norway is a big moment for BETA,"" said Shawn Hall, BETA's Chief Revenue Officer. ""Bristow has been with us from the start and shares our drive for progress, and Norway, with its spirit of innovation and modernization, is a perfect place to move this technology forward. Handing off the aircraft to a customer is, in part, a huge milestone, but it's also an important launchpad for all that comes next for the industry.""

Norway has already established itself as a leader in innovative clean mobility, with electric cars comprising 89 percent of new car registrations in 2024. This Test Arena is an evaluation of the benefits of AAM for the region and its residents — as well as an investigation into the requirements to build out an ecosystem for integrated operations.

With its unique design that optimizes for payload, range, and IFR capabilities, ALIA is well-suited for Norway's distributed geography and cold-weather conditions.

""This essential and meaningful step will support the industry, accelerate innovation in new mobility, and strengthen our expertise. We are excited to continue this critical work"", said Lars Kobberstad, Director General of CAA Norway. ""Aviation is a safe mode of transport and a well-regulated sector. As the aviation authority, we will ensure that we facilitate testing new technologies and contribute to safe testing and future integrations. We will learn how rules and regulations must evolve to enable new technologies and concepts. Through this, we aim to build the necessary expertise early on for tomorrow's solutions.""

""The first flight of the Test Arena is a major milestone for Norwegian aviation and for Avinor, and a key step towards future commercial operations of zero- and low-emission flights in Norway,"" said Abraham Foss, Avinor's Chief Executive Officer. ""As a small, open economy with a dispersed population, Norway is entirely dependent on aviation and its broad network of airports. We are strongly committed to driving the long-term transition to a more sustainable aviation sector, while maintaining strong domestic and international connectivity.""

A team of BETA pilots and maintainers have delivered this aircraft, N214BT, to the Test Arena following a weeks-long journey across the EU. The flights, which originated in Shannon, Ireland, have taken BETA's aircraft over the Irish Sea, through the UK, over the English Channel, and to the Paris Air Show — where ALIA flew every day — followed by Germany, Luxembourg, Denmark, and, ultimately, Norway.

Braskem shrugs off US tariffs, expands ops in 2Q

Sao Paulo, 7 August (Argus) — The 50pc tariffs imposed by US president Donald Trump on Brazilian exports to the US will have no material impact on Brazilian petrochemical major Braskem, company executives said. Braskem produces basic chemicals and polymers, which are not subject to the tariffs imposed by the US . The company's polymer exports to the US have been occasional and in relatively small volumes. For basic chemicals, exports to the US accounted for less than 1pc of Braskem's total export revenue in the first half of 2025. Braskem's January-June exports totaled R44bn ($8bn). Approximately R390mn shipped to the US in the period, chief financial officer Felipe Jens said during the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday. These included benzene, butadiene, gasoil and pyrolysis gasoline, among other products. The primary factor affecting Braskem's performance is the current global downturn in the petrochemical industry, which has lasted longer than expected and continues to impact the company's entire supply chain, according to the company. Brazil plans In Brazil, Braskem is moving forward with investments in its polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production units in Alagoas and Bahia states. As outlined in the business plan approved by the board of directors in early 2025, the company is allocating approximately R80mn to two projects focused on expansion and technological upgrades. The investments aim to increase production capacity by up to 35,000 metric tonnes (t)/yr, with 15,000 t/yr coming from direct expansion of the two plants and 20,000 t/yr through technological improvements. The initiative also includes upgrades to the company's chlor-alkali plant, which are essential to support the PVC production increase, according to Jens. In addition to industrial expansion, Braskem is implementing an eucalyptus biomass steam generation project at its Alagoas PVC unit. The initiative is expected to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, aligning operations with the company's environmental commitments. ""These actions work together to make our operations more efficient, productive, and sustainable,"" Jens said. ""We remain focused on improving profitability and competitiveness without compromising our environmental goals."" Braskem Idesa back to full ops Braskem Idesa, the company's joint venture in Mexico, resumed full operations of its ethane cracker last weekend, marking a new phase of productivity at the industrial complex in Coatzacoalcos, in Veracruz state. The restart followed a technical shutdown that lasted longer than anticipated but was considered strategic to ensure full processing capacity for liquid ethane, an essential feedstock for polyethylene (PE) production. Chief executive Roberto Ramos confirmed that the cracker returned to full load on 1 August, enabling the replenishment of the complex's three PE plants: one low density PE and two high density PE units. The low density PE plant has reached full capacity, while one of the high density PE plants experienced a technical issue that delayed production by two days but is now also ramping up to full output. A key milestone in this phase is the start of operations at the liquid ethane receiving terminal, inaugurated in May. With the Quimica Puerto Mexico import terminal (TQPM) now active, Braskem Idesa has, for the first time in 15 years since the project began, full ethane supply capacity, which is expected to enhance stability and competitiveness in resin production. ""This asset group including the cracker and the three polyethylene plants represents our most advanced industrial operation,"" Ramos said. ""These are modern, automated and well-designed facilities."" ""With the terminal now operational, we are positioned to demonstrate the full potential of producing high quality resins at competitive cost,"" he added. Potential US asset sale Ramos confirmed that Braskem is negotiating the sale of three polypropylene (PP) plants in the US to fellow PVC producer Unipar Carbocloro. The deal could reach $1bn and includes facilities in Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The move is reportedly driven by financial pressure, with Braskem aiming to reduce cash burn and leverage. Ramos said that the plants have historically generated strong cash flow and that any sale would need to reflect their long-term value. Jens confirmed that Braskem is evaluating divestment options as part of its transformation plan, focusing on liquidity and economic value. While the US assets are strategically important, the company remains open to alternatives that support its broader goals. 2Q results Braskem's domestic resin sales rose by 1pc in the second quarter from a year before and by 3pc from the previous quarter, reaching 829,000t. The increase was driven by early buying, which in turn was prompted by tariff uncertainty. Domestic chemical sales grew by 1pc year-on-year and remained flat from the first quarter, supported by stronger benzene and propylene demand. PP production in the US and Europe held steady at 74pc, down by 4pc from the second quarter in 2024. Sales volumes in those regions rose by 2pc quarter-on-quarter and by 1pc year-on-year, reflecting improved US demand. The company posted a $45mn loss for the quarter, narrowing from a $708mn loss in the second quarter of 2024 and down from a $113mn profit in the first quarter this year.

EU bunker demand up 12pc in 2024 on container traffic

New York, 6 August (Argus) — EU bunker demand in 2024 surged by 4.9mn t to 46.3mn t, up 12pc from the previous year, driven largely by longer container ship voyages as vessels avoided the Red Sea following Houthi attacks. Container ship fuel consumption led the increase, rising by 5.4mn t to 17.0mn t in 2024, according to the latest data from the EU's Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) database. Many container lines rerouted around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope instead of using the Suez Canal, lengthening voyages, and increasing fuel burn. The MRV system tracks marine fuel demand for ships of 5,000 gross tons and above on all voyages involving EU or European Economic Area (EEA) ports. This includes full-voyage fuel consumption, even in international waters, as long as at least one port is within the EU or EEA. MRV-tracked marine carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions followed suit, rising 12pc to 143.2mn t in 2024. For the first time in 2024, the MRV also required reporting of two other greenhouse gases (GHG): methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O). Vessel operators reported 59,479t of CH₄ and 8,066t of N₂O, which translate to 1.7mn t and 2.1mn t of CO₂-equivalent emissions, respectively, based on their global warming potential of 28 and 265 times that of CO₂. Of the 59,479t of CH₄ reported to the EU MRV in 2024, the majority, 36,615t, came from LNG carriers, which often use boil-off gas from their cargo as fuel. LNG has lower CO₂ emissions than conventional marine fuel, but LNG or dual-fuel LNG engines can result in methane slip, where unburned methane escapes through the engine exhaust. Another 14,432t of CH₄ came from roll on/roll off passenger vessels (ro-pax), roll on/roll off cargo vessels (ro-ro), and ferries, many of which also run on LNG or LNG dual-fuel engines. MRV does not report different marine fuel types demand, just total demand. By comparison, Rotterdam, Europe's biggest bunkering port, reported 8.6mn t of conventional marine fuel sold in 2024, down 2.7pc from 2023. Biodiesel bunker blends reached 752,103t in 2024, holding steady. LNG and bio-LNG sales were up 52pc to 424,863t, and bio-methanol jumped up to 3,946t from less than 800t in 2023. Sustainable marine fuel demand grew ahead of the start of the FuelEU Maritime regulation in January 2025, which mandated 2pc in GHG emissions cut in 2025.

Regulatory clash set to disrupt ARA biofuel trade

London, 6 August (Argus) — A regulatory mismatch between EU-wide FuelEU Maritime rules and national Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) transpositions in Belgium and the Netherlands is set to disrupt biofuel and marine fuel markets from 2026, particularly in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) bunkering hub. The Dutch and Belgian governments plan to exclude biofuels made from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats — listed under RED Annex IX Part B — from counting towards maritime fuel mandates. This contrasts with FuelEU Maritime, which rewards their use to cut shipping emissions. The divergence is expected to distort supply-demand dynamics and raise compliance costs for suppliers and shipowners. Draft legislation in both countries obliges fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across land, inland shipping and maritime sectors. Under the Dutch RED III draft, Annex IX Part B biofuels — including UCO and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — will count towards land and inland shipping mandates only, capped at 4.29pc and 11.07pc respectively. For international maritime shipping, the cap is set at zero. This means suppliers cannot claim emission reduction units (EREs) for Part B fuels used in maritime shipping, effectively disincentivising UCO-based biodiesel sales in the ARA region. FuelEU Maritime, by contrast, mandates GHG cuts for maritime users starting at 2pc in 2025, rising to 80pc by 2050, and places no cap on Part B fuels. Like FuelEU Maritime, the Dutch RED III draft excludes crop-based biofuels from counting towards maritime GHG reduction targets. But unlike FuelEU, it also bars Annex IX Part B fuels — creating a sharper compliance gap for bunker suppliers. This leaves used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) in a precarious position. Widely used in marine fuels due to its scale and compatibility with existing engines, Ucome-based blends will remain attractive to shipowners aiming to meet FuelEU Maritime targets. But ARA suppliers will need to sell Annex IX Part A fuels — such as bio-LNG or Advanced Fame 0 — to meet RED III targets or face penalties. This could push up Ucome prices, as suppliers seek to offset non-compliance costs. Advanced Fame 0-based marine biodiesel blends are currently attractive to buyers because marine mandates have not yet taken effect. Under the existing system, HBE-G renewable tickets — which will be replaced by EREs next year — can be deducted from the price of Part A fuels, but this may not be viable next year. Part B fuels from the marine sector do not currently generate HBEs. Higher Ucome prices may inflate maritime-generated ERE values and boost demand for Part A fuels, raising overall biofuel costs and reducing ARA's competitiveness. Some shipowners may opt to bunker elsewhere. Many already source marine biodiesel from Asia, where prices are lower. Argus assessed B30 Ucome dob ARA at an average of $805.30/t during May–July, compared with $705.48/t in Singapore. Prices for alternatives like RFNBOs and ammonia remain high, limiting near-term uptake. FuelEU abatement prices for Ucome-MGO and Ucome-VLSFO have been relatively flat this year, but could rise if Ucome prices firm. Market reactions Market participants are exploring ways to navigate the mandates. One option is blending small volumes of Advanced Fame 0 into bunker fuels, although this is logistically complex and could raise prices at ARA ports. Another strategy involves sourcing marine-generated ERE tickets from over-compliant sellers. But supply may be tight, as only a limited share of inland and land-generated tickets can be transferred to the marine sector under the flexible credit allowance. Some suppliers have told Argus they are considering shifting some of their bunker volumes to other ports, including the Mediterranean region. Spain's RED III draft includes a proposed 1.7pc cap on Part B fuels — far more lenient than Belgium and the Netherlands. Spain's marine mandate starts at 1pc in 2027, rising to just 3pc by 2030.

“Our chosen theme reflects Indonesia’s future energy needs: securing our energy supply through sustainable use of biomass and bioenergy,” said Dr Meika Syahbana Rusli, SBRC Chair at IPB University.

One of the conference’s focal points was the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) — seen as both a strategic opportunity and a significant challenge for Indonesia. Dr Meika noted that while the country has made strides in biodiesel production, SAF remains hindered by technical, economic, and logistical obstacles.

“Our roadmap is ambitious: 1% SAF of total fuel by next year, 2.5% by 2030, and 5% by 2035. These targets are not easy to meet,” he acknowledged.

SBRC is also developing technology to convert solid biomass into bio-oil via gasification, an approach that has attracted interest from Airbus Singapore.

With supplies of lipid sources for SAF expected to diminish by 2030, biomass could become the main raw material for production.

Edi Wibowo, Director of Bioenergy at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, stressed that the government is preparing new regulations to accelerate bioenergy development.

“We want to maximise this potential to strengthen national energy independence and security,” he said.

Prof Ernan Rustiadi, IPB University’s Vice-Rector for Research, Innovation and Agromaritime Development, praised the collaboration between local and international partners.

Ocean and Key Ports Update

Due to ongoing operational challenges, the AE11 service will temporarily omit the Port of Genoa and instead divert to nearby Vado Ligure throughout August and September. The diversion is in place to mitigate further delays for our customers and maintain service integrity. We expect this to be a short-term measure and will communicate with our customers when the service returns to normal. Please see more details here and click here for sailing schedules.

The first sailing will be the Maersk Monte Alto, which departs on 29th September 2025. Click here for more information and the full service rotation.

Key terminals across the continent are experiencing some moderate disruption as we move through the summer months. In Northern Europe, Antwerp continues to face high yard density and low gang availability, with waiting times running higher than usual. To help alleviate the situation, customers are kindly asked to collect their import containers as soon as possible after discharge.

London Gateway and the Port of Rotterdam, meanwhile, remain stable, with minimal waiting times and moderate yard density.

Further south, Algeciras and Tanger Med 2 are operating efficiently despite high volumes, although yard peaks are forecasted for the first few weeks of August. Our teams continue to work on contingency plans and will take action to minimise delays for customers, should it be required.

Elsewhere, Maersk has commenced operations at Milazzo Port, Sicily, to strengthen network connectivity for its customers in southern Italy. Vessels will be handled at the Duferco Terminal Mediterraneo (DTM) and bookings are now being accepted.

To stay on top of any updates to your cargo, please sign up for ETA notifications.

Inland Update

In Germany, changes have been made to the import container release process at Hamburg, Bremerhaven, and Wilhelmshaven. Effective from 1st October 2025, the new process will replace the PIN-based release system with a digital authorisation known as ‘secure release order’.

This ensures that only one traceable party at any given time is authorised to pick up full import containers from the port, supporting safe and secure supply chains for our customers. Click here for more information and further details on the German Ports community platform, through which the new process will be facilitated.

Elsewhere in Germany, customers are reminded that inspection fees remain in place if a service is carried out at Export (INE), Import or Trans-shipment (INI). Fees have increased as of 14th July 2025. Read more here.

Heading further south on the continent, ongoing railway maintenance and closures continue to affect inland operations in Italy, with rail services in and out of the Port of Genoa unavailable throughout August. Maersk will strive to minimise the impact of these disruptions by continuing to offer our services by truck, however the situation will result in the need for longer routes and subsequently a Peak Season Surcharge (PSS) to be implemented throughout Italy.

A separate Peak Season Surcharge also comes into force for truck transport in and out of the Port of Venice due to difficulties accessing the terminal. We will continue to monitor both situations and remove the PSS as soon as it becomes operationally feasible to do so.

Finally, in Slovenia, major railway infrastructure upgrades are now under way, reducing available rail capacity across key routes. We advise customers to plan accordingly and consult with Maersk representatives for alternative inland routing. Read more details here.

Air Freight Update

Recently introduced by the European Commission, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates fuel suppliers delivering to EU airports to blend a minimum percentage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into their supply – starting with 2% in 2025 and growing incrementally to 70% in 2050.

The associated costs are being passed on by airlines and may affect pricing for shipments moving through airports in the European Union and United Kingdom. Due to these additional costs imposed by airlines, Maersk will introduce an SAF surcharge on applicable air freight shipments of €0.04 per chargeable kilogram from 1st September 2025. For further details, please visit our advisory page.

We are seeing increased demand for air freight from Vietnam into the United States of America amid the ongoing tensions between the US and China. Rotate data shows that volumes between Ho Chi Minh City and the US increased 62% in April 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

Sourcing from Vietnam has been increasing in recent years, and we expect air cargo demand to continue from the country if it has more favourable tariff rates than its Chinese neighbours. Please reach out to discuss export options through our global network of partner and own-controlled flights.

Customs Update

At the end of July, the European Union and US agreed on a new deal for trade and tariffs that sets a 15% baseline on goods being exported to the US from the EU. The UK, meanwhile, faces slightly lower baseline tariffs of 10%.

Final terms of the deal are still being ironed out, but we advise getting ahead of the game with proactive measures on your supply chain – including reviewing all origin documentation, understanding stacking risks for EU exports to the US, and preparing for potential cost increases and re-routing strategies.

Elsewhere, the EU’s latest sanctions package against Russia targets vessels acting as the company’s shadow fleet and – for the first time – third-country financial operators. Export bans are planned for machinery metals, plastics, and chemicals used in industrial production.

We advise customers to audit supply chains to determine any exposure to sanctioned entities, and also monitor financial transactions involving third-country intermediaries. Read more information here.

Ecommerce Update

Ecommerce in Europe is continuing its upward trajectory in 2025, with the likes of Germany expecting to see 4% annual growth and Spain growing 13% year-on-year compared to 2024. As online order volumes surge, consumer expectations for convenience and sustainability are redefining last-mile delivery.

One of the standout trends in recent months is the rapid expansion of Out-of-Home (OOH) delivery options at checkout. No longer a niche alternative, OOH is becoming the new standard across Europe – accounting for 58% of B2C package deliveries according to Last Mile Experts.

As such, more and more companies are looking to capitalise on consumer favourability for OOH options, including UK retail giants ASOS. According to Sendcloud data, 44% of European customers abandon their online purchase if their preferred shipping option isn’t available. Offering a variety of delivery choices – including out-of-home (OOH) options – at checkout is therefore crucial for reducing cart abandonment and securing sales.

Returns are also evolving, and home collection return services – where couriers pick up items directly from the customer’s doorstep – are gaining traction. Statista reports that 80% of European consumers now consider return convenience a key factor in purchasing decisions, driven by demand for frictionless, sustainable, and simple reverse logistics.",https://www.maersk.com/~/media_sc9/maersk/news/news/images/2025/08/07/europe-market-update/header.jpg?h=576&w=1024&hash=2FB7DC390CA242F7AB0EF49311C6DBEF,N,,2025-08-08 11:57:42.869988

Beyond its role in managing hundreds of billions in assets, Julius Baer has also set an ambitious climate agenda, anchored in sustainability, energy transition and net zero goals.

As the finance sector faces rising scrutiny for its environmental impact, Julius Baer is positioning itself as a progressive player through meaningful, science-based commitments.

Energy transition and efficiency

Central to Julius Baer’s decarbonisation efforts is a strategic shift towards energy efficiency and renewable energy.

The bank has transitioned all its Swiss offices to 100% renewable electricity and is replicating this model across its global footprint.

New office locations are selected based on energy efficiency criteria, with most premises adhering to green certification standards such as LEED or BREEAM.

By retrofitting or constructing buildings with sustainability in mind, Julius Baer is embedding climate-conscious infrastructure into its physical operations.

A further step has been the introduction of an internal carbon price of CHF100 per tonne of CO₂ equivalent on business air travel.

This initiative, aligned with UN Global Compact guidance, encourages behavioural change while generating funds to support low-carbon investments.

Sustainability and responsible management

Julius Baer’s broader sustainability strategy is built around two pillars: responsible wealth management and responsible citizenship.

The bank supports clients in aligning their capital with sustainable outcomes, offering ESG reports, climate transparency and bespoke investment mandates.

It aims to shift 36% of its discretionary mandates and balance sheet into companies with validated Science Based Targets by 2025 and 100% by 2040.

“I joined Julius Baer as Head Sustainability and Director of the Sustainability Board in 2019,” writes Yvonne Suter, Head of Sustainability, Member Sustainability Board and Member Responsible Investment Committee at Julius Baer, writes on LinkedIn.

“Together with my team, I oversee and implement the Group’s sustainability strategy, with its two key pillars of responsible wealth management and responsible citizenship.

“I am dedicated to applying credible insight in order to empower investors on their sustainability journey.

“To this end, I am working in partnership with sustainability thought leaders and investment experts to enable positive impact beyond financial returns.”

To further reduce its environmental footprint, the bank has invested in high-impact nature-based projects, including mangrove reforestation in Indonesia and tropical forest restoration in Panama.

It was also the first Swiss financial institution to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in partnership with major airlines, using proceeds from its internal carbon levy to fund these greener alternatives.

Julius Baer was an early adopter of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment and a founding signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Banking.

Internally, it drives sustainability through active governance, employee networks such as “Bärs4Sustainability” and sustainability-themed workshops.

Regular stakeholder engagement and transparency, including sustainability roadshows, reinforce its commitment to responsible practice.

Towards net zero

Julius Baer has laid out clearly defined, Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-approved net zero goals.

It is committed to achieving net zero emissions from its own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030, with a 90% reduction in emissions from a 2019 baseline.

It has been 20 years since Congress passed the Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, a bold, bipartisan commitment to strengthen our nation’s energy independence, support rural economies and reduce harmful emissions. For two decades since, the RFS has done exactly what it was designed to do. It has delivered real, measurable benefits to consumers, farmers and the environment. But as we celebrate this milestone, we also need to recognize how to build on our success.

Let’s start with consumers. Every time drivers fill up with fuels like E15 that contain lower-cost, homegrown biofuels, they’re saving money at the pump. The RFS introduced competition into a market previously dominated by fossil fuels. This helped hold down fuel prices for American families, especially during volatile periods for global oil markets. The sum of these savings has kept billions of dollars in Americans’ pockets. It’s a powerful reminder that energy policy can directly improve lives when it puts American innovation and consumers first.

The RFS has also unlocked a wider economic revitalization in rural America. Across the heartland, biorefineries have created tens of thousands of high-quality jobs in engineering, plant operations, research and transportation. These aren’t just numbers on a page. They’re real careers in communities that broader economic shifts have all too often left behind. For rural towns across the Midwest, biofuels are a cornerstone of economic opportunity and growth. Every mile driven on homegrown fuel, and every new job that results, strengthens the economic backbone of rural America.

And no one understands the impact of the RFS more deeply than America’s farmers. For generations, farmers have fed our families and fueled our economy. With the RFS, they have been empowered to help fuel our cars as well. By creating a reliable, high-demand market for corn, soybeans and other feedstocks, the RFS has given farmers a source of stability that is nothing short of essential. This steady demand helps farm families invest in their operations, adopt more sustainable practices and navigate the ups and downs of global commodity markets. The result is a more resilient and innovative agricultural sector.

Of course, the RFS is also a cornerstone of U.S. energy security. Two decades ago, we were heavily reliant on foreign oil. Today, thanks in part to the RFS, we’ve dramatically increased our use of domestically produced renewable fuel. Every gallon of ethanol or biodiesel made here in America is one less gallon we need to import. That strengthens our national security and gives us more control over our energy future. Even when major turmoil engulfed the Middle East in recent months, the American people did not have to contend with significant spikes in fuel prices. That is a major shift from 20 years ago. It’s no exaggeration to say that the RFS has helped rewrite America’s energy narrative moved from dependence to independence — and toward dominance.

And the environmental impact? According to Growth Energy’s research, the RFS has helped curb over 725 million metric tons of carbon emissions since its inception. That’s the equivalent of taking more than 150 million cars off the road for a year. The RFS proves there doesn’t have to be a zero-sum tradeoff between reducing emissions and increasing prosperity. This is a proven solution, already working and improving air quality in communities across the country.

For all the progress we’ve made, there’s more work to do. As I recently told the Environmental Protection Agency, it is essential that we continue to actively build on this success, not scale it back. We need strong, stable biofuels blending targets and consistent oversight of refinery exemptions. We need policies that reward innovation, open up new pathways for sustainable aviation fuel, and ensure that new technologies like carbon capture are fully recognized under the RFS.

The next chapter of the RFS must be one of momentum. That’s why I’m calling on policymakers on both sides of the aisle to recommit to the promise of the RFS. Let’s protect the gains we’ve made. Let’s expand access to higher blends like E15. Let’s modernize the program so it continues to drive innovation, investment and climate progress for the next 20 years and beyond.

The RFS is more than just another policy. It’s a promise. A promise to America’s farmers, to rural communities, to consumers and to our clean air future. That is a promise worth fighting for.

In a breakthrough for India’s clean-energy ambitions, the Panipat refinery has become the first in the country to receive certification to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil. Officials say the move signals a decisive step towards reducing aviation’s carbon footprint while aligning with global climate commitments.

The certification, granted after coordination between key ministries and regulators, confirms the refinery meets UN-backed CORSIA standards to cut global aviation emissions. SAF, which can be blended with conventional jet fuel, offers a cleaner-burning alternative capable of slashing lifecycle emissions and helping airlines meet tightening sustainability targets.

Government discussions are already under way to mandate SAF blending for international flights departing India. The proposal would require airlines to use at least 1% SAF from 2027, rising to 2% in the following years. While not yet approved for regular domestic commercial flights, test runs since 2018 , using biofuel derived from sources like jatropha, have proven the viability of such fuels in Indian skies.

The Panipat facility’s innovation lies in converting a waste stream , used edible oil, into high-value, low-carbon aviation fuel. This not only addresses the issue of safe disposal for cooking oil but also paves the way for a circular economy model, creating new economic opportunities in the collection and processing supply chain. Industry experts note, however, that scaling up production remains the key challenge, as global SAF output is still a fraction of overall aviation fuel demand.

If capacity expands as planned, the refinery’s achievement could mark the start of a greener era for Indian aviation, reducing dependence on fossil-based imports and setting an example for other sectors to adopt waste-to-fuel solutions. From the frying pan to the flight deck, Panipat may well be charting the flightpath to a cleaner future for the skies.
