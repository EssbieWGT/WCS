The announcement, made in July 2025, comes on the heels of a major leadership shakeup — with longtime CEO Seifi Ghasemi stepping down and new CEO Eduardo Menezes taking the reins. Menezes is steering the company back toward familiar territory: its traditional, low-risk industrial gases business built on steady, long-term contracts.

A Strategic Shift Back to Its Roots

Under Ghasemi’s leadership, Air Products leaned heavily into green hydrogen and sustainable energy ventures — bold moves aimed at driving industrial decarbonization. But those bets didn’t quite pay off as expected. The financial strain from these ambitious efforts triggered a strategic reset. Now, with Menezes at the helm, the focus is clearly shifting back to what the company knows best: stable returns over headline-grabbing innovation.

What This Means for U.S. Hydrogen Momentum

The fallout from the decision will ripple through the hydrogen production landscape in the United States. Some industry insiders worry this could be a setback for national sustainable energy goals, particularly when it comes to cleaner fuels for heavy transport and aviation. Still, the broader sector doesn’t appear to be slowing down.

Plenty of other players are still charging ahead. Companies like Plug Power and Invenergy, along with decentralized innovators such as Independence Hydrogen, remain on track with their own projects, many of which are expected to go live by the end of 2025. That continued momentum suggests that while Air Products’ exit makes waves, it’s far from a deal-breaker for the U.S. green hydrogen push.

Cars are not yet able to fly, but the aircraft than can soar the skies are constantly being improved upon, with a more sustainable future in mind. While electric cars and motorcycles have been around for many years now, electric aeroplanes have yet to show success. The aviation industry has struggled with this concept, until one forward-looking German company’s dream was set in motion.

Aircraft can only run on jet-fuel, right?

Historically, aircraft have run on various kinds of jet fuel, as well as aviation gasoline. The former is usually derived from kerosene, and the latter contains various amounts of lead. Both are not ideal when looking at environmental impact, which leads to the important question of how to mitigate harmful emissions in the aviation industry.

There have been some breakthroughs in the sector, with research being done on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) like biofuels, with some successful implementation. The problem is that these fuels have very high requirements in order to operate properly, which may be difficult for aircraft to meet, and are a lot more expensive to produce.

This leaves the industry with very little uptake of SAFs, despite its pledge to have halved its carbon emissions from 2005 to 2050. While the future may seem dire for sustainable aircraft, another highly probably option has been put forward by German eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) aircraft manufacturer, Lilium.

What Lilium proposed for the future of aviation

Lilium Aerospace GmbH is a manufacturing company that has developed the innovative electrically powered air vehicle, Lilium Jet. This design seeks to decarbonise the aviation industry, operating with 30 electric motors in its wings and opening a whole new world of possibilities for aircraft. This isn’t the first electric aircraft proposal, but perhaps the most interesting one to date.

While the range of this aircraft is still small, this is only the start to electric aeroplanes. Flying a respectable distance of 110 miles, the Lilium Jet is still perfectly suitable for city commutes, which is where its target lies. The aim is to one day have these aircraft available as a commuting option to bypass traffic congestion with zero carbon emissions.

While the Lilium Jet is an incredible design in theory, the company has experiences massive challenges along the road that make production of the jet almost certainly off the table.

Lilium’s failure brings two insolvency cases

While hopes were sky-high to get this aircraft up and running, the German manufacturers have had to file for insolvency not once, but on two separate occasions. After the first instance of insolvency, there appeared to be a wide range of investment interest, with Lilium CEO Klaus Roew stating:

“We are very pleased to announce the signing of an investment agreement with a very experienced consortium of investors, which is a major breakthrough.”

Mobile Uplift Corporation was reportedly interested in acquiring the assets to the company and investing $200 million into the Lilium Jet operations.

However, this breakthrough was short-lived, as investment money was never seen, and Lilium spokesperson soon after made a statement that their operations have ceased for the moment.

“As the funding options to secure Lilium’s future have not materialized in time, Lilium Aerospace has filed for insolvency today”

The great aspirations for an electric powered aviation industry have been set aside for the moment, and an unfortunate 700 or more employees are now without jobs as a result. Although there are many alternative options for sustainable aviation, Lilium’s visionary aircraft is not fundable at this time. Until the industry can find a way to afford more sustainable methods of flying, it looks like gasoline will remain the leading fuel for aviation.

The extreme heat is creating not just discomfort, but also major travel delays, as planes are delayed, tourist attractions close early, and passengers face increased health risks.

Heatwaves are growing more common and intense as a result of climate change, making their influence on travel more difficult to ignore. From reduced visiting hours at world-famous destinations to delayed flights and even evacuation orders due to wildfires, current conditions are driving passengers, airlines, and tourism officials to react in real time. Many people wonder if peak summer travel is still worth the risk.

Travel Plans Heat Up Literally

From Athens to Rome, hundreds of tourists have had to reconsider their summer plans. Due to excessive temperatures, Italian authorities have issued red alerts in towns such as Florence, Palermo, and Bologna, urging residents and visitors to stay indoors during peak hours.

In Greece, officials have reduced the hours of operation for popular attractions such as the Acropolis, closing it during the noon heat to prevent heatstroke and weariness among visitors and employees. Meanwhile, Spain is sending emergency staff to important travel hubs, anticipating increased demand on public services and transportation.

Airlines and Airports Are Feeling the Heat

The heatwave is affecting airports throughout southern Europe. Wildfires sparked by high temperatures interrupted airport operations in Rhodes, forcing emergency evacuations and causing havoc for arriving and departing travellers.

Airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair have begun issuing advisories, advising passengers to check their flight status often and plan for unexpected cancellations or delays. Overheated runways and heat-exhausted ground crews have also resulted in postponed flights at airports such as Rome Fiumicino and Madrid-Barajas.

Reconsidering Summer Travel

With peak-season temperatures getting increasingly harsh, tourists are reconsidering the timing and location of their travels. As southern cities become more difficult to navigate safely throughout the summer months, an increasing number of visitors are choosing for spring and fall getaways.

This trend encourages airlines and travel agents to market off-season discounts as alternatives to packed, sweltering locations. Scandinavia, the UK coast, and Eastern Europe are witnessing an increase in reservations as travellers seek milder climates and more peaceful experiences.

As temperatures continue high, officials advise travellers to take the following precautions:

Avoid outdoor sightseeing between 12 and 5 p.m

Stay hydrated and bring refillable water bottles

Use high-SPF sunscreen and wear protective clothes

Check the airline changes and travel insurance coverage

(Reuters) -India's Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) has extended the deadline for submitting bids for its green hydrogen project in Assam by two weeks, according to a tender document, as uncertainty looms over the state's flagship clean energy policy.

NRL, owned by explorer Oil India, has extended the last bid submission date to August 6 from July 23 without citing a reason for the extension, per the document seen by Reuters.

Last week, Reuters reported that the northeastern state of Assam had paused its green hydrogen policy, surprising investors who were already grappling with reduced incentives for renewable energy projects.

The delay has prompted companies to reassess their investment plans worth billions of rupees in the region that has historically lagged behind in clean energy adoption, Reuters had reported, citing sources.

Last week, Harit Molecules Foundation (HMF), an industry body representing green hydrogen project developers in India, wrote to NRL seeking an extension to submit bids for NRL's 10,000-metric-tonnes-per annum green hydrogen generation project at the Assam refinery, per an email seen by Reuters.

The HMF sought the extension citing a lack of clarity on incentives applicable to the project and the complex nature of the project.

NRL and Harit Molecules Foundation did not respond to requests for comment.

NRL had announced the green hydrogen tender last year and it is among the top tenders floated in the country to boost clean energy adoption.

Green hydrogen, produced using renewable electricity, is seen as a key tool in decarbonising heavy industries and transport.

Assam in February announced several incentives to attract clean energy investments into the state, but in June, it sharply reduced transmission subsidies and increased bank guarantees without giving reasons.

Multiple industry and government sources had told Reuters that the state was coming out with a new green hydrogen policy by July-end.

The flypast was followed by the Wedgetail performing a ‘touch and go’ on the runway before departing back to Birmingham Airport.

Group Captain Osselton, Programme Director for the E-7 Programme, said: “The Wedgetail appearance at RIAT not only reinforces the hard work and collaboration of all those contributing to the project but also reflects the importance of delivering the next generation of airborne surveillance and control capabilities to support the RAF’s operational effectiveness in the years to come.”

The Red Arrows aircraft flew in formation on the wings of the Boeing aircraft, as a crowd of over 50,000 people looked up at this unique spectacle.

I hope those watching the flypast were able to take plenty of photographs to mark this special mixed formation and true highlight of the 2025 Air Tattoo.”

The E-7 Wedgetail is the most capable and operationally proven airborne early warning and control platform in use today and has the growth path to match the expected threat over the next 20 years.

The mission crew will utilise state-of-the-art workstations to deliver a multi-domain battle management capability: providing situational awareness to UK, NATO and coalition force elements, directing offensive and defensive assets whilst maintaining continuous surveillance of an assigned area. The Wedgetail significantly enhances the lethality and survivability of friendly aircraft and naval assets, whilst operating in a hostile environment.

Stu Voboril, Boeing Vice President and E-7 Programme Manager said: “Today’s flight is an amazing testament to the work of our integrated Boeing and UK supplier team, in partnership with the RAF. Our work reflects the pride we take in supporting the strategic alliance among the UK, US, and allies, and the role the E-7 plays in strengthening global joint force mission advantage.”

The UK’s Wedgetail will serve under No. 8 Squadron and will be located at RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, alongside the nine-strong fleet of P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, both of which are based upon the widely used Boeing 737 Next Generation airframe, allowing the RAF to take advantage of synergies between the two fleets.",,N,,2025-07-21 12:56:15.188096

The airline also remains cautious regarding airline pricing, fuel costs, competition, aircraft availability, currency exchange rates, and the broader economic environment.","Ryanair Holdings plc, Europe’s largest airline group, has announced a 128 per cent increase in profit after tax for the first quarter of the 2026 financial year.

This significant leap from EUR 360 million in the prior-year Q1 to EUR 820 million was propelled by a 4 per cent rise in traffic to 57.9 million passengers and a substantial 21 per cent increase in average fares to EUR 51.

The Group’s total revenue for the quarter was up by 20% to EUR 4.34 billion and scheduled revenue saw a 26% increase to EUR 2.94 billion, boosted by the full Easter holiday in April, favourable prior-year comparisons, and stronger-than-expected close-in pricing.

Ancillary revenues climbed 7 per cent to EUR 1.39 billion, with the average spend on discretionary services per passenger rising by 3 per cent to over EUR 24.

Despite the revenue growth, Ryanair maintained tight cost control, with operating costs increasing by a modest 5 per cent to EUR 3.42 billion, translating to just a 1 per cent rise per passenger.

Ryanair’s competitive jet fuel hedging largely mitigated the impact of a 16 per cent increase in Air Traffic Control (ATC) fees and higher environmental costs due to EU Emissions Trading System allowances unwinding and Sustainable Aviation Fuel blend mandates.

Ryanair continues to invest heavily in its modern fleet, with 181 Boeing 737-8200s now part of its 618-aircraft fleet. These new aircraft, high-density seating versions of the 737 MAX 8 and dubbed “Gamechangers” by the carrier, offer 4 per cent more seats while consuming 16 per cent less fuel and reducing CO2 emissions.

In Q1 alone, Ryanair took delivery of 5 new aircraft and the Group made a significant USD 500 million commitment to acquire 30 spare CFM LEAP-IB engines, which are expected to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions per seat in its existing fleet by up to 20 per cent.

The airline’s network is expanding rapidly, with over 2,600 routes planned for Summer 2025, including more than 160 new routes. Ryanair is strategically allocating its growth to regions and airports that incentivise traffic growth through reduced aviation taxes.

The company foresees European short-haul capacity remaining constrained until 2030, a situation it believes will allow for controlled profitable growth to 300 million passengers per annum by FY34, leveraging its widening unit cost advantage and robust balance sheet. The first 15 Boeing MAX-10 deliveries are anticipated in Spring 2027, with 300 of these fuel-efficient aircraft due by March 2034.

Ryanair’s balance sheet is supported by a BBB+ credit rating from both Fitch and S&P. The airline maintains an unencumbered B737 fleet of over 590 aircraft. As of 30 June 2025, gross cash stood at a healthy €4.4 billion, with net cash increasing to EUR 2 billion (from EUR 1.3 billion at 31 March).

This strong liquidity positions the Group to comfortably repay approximately EUR 2.1 billion in maturing bonds over the next 10 months using internal cash resources. This financial flexibility is seen as a key factor widening the cost gap between Ryanair and competitors, many of whom face higher financing and aircraft lease costs.

Despite the positive results, Ryanair acknowledges exposure to various external risks, including potential tariff wars, macro-economic shocks, escalation of conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and disruptions caused by European ATC strikes and short staffing.

The airline also remains cautious regarding airline pricing, fuel costs, competition, aircraft availability, currency exchange rates, and the broader economic environment.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ryanair-kyte.png,N,,2025-07-21 12:56:19.396086

The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting.
Capturing the moment Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said.
Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England.","UK bioethanol producer Vivergo is proceeding with plans to close its 416mn litres/yr Saltend plant in eastern England, but has outlined ways the government could prevent this.

Vivergo has said deliveries of wheat will cease at the end of July, and redundancies will begin in August, ahead of closure in September. It already said it had stopped buying wheat in June.

The decision to close was made by Vivergo's parent company, food and ingredients group Associated British Foods (ABF), after a US-UK trade deal agreed in May that allowed duty-free imports of up to 1.4bn l/yr of US ethanol.

ABF confirmed at the end of June that it was in talks with the government, but no timeline has been put on the process. The first stage of the talks was for UK producers, like Vivergo and Ensus, operator of the 400mn l/yr Wilton bioethanol refinery in northeast England, to submit their strategic business cases. Ensus has said it could close Wilton.

Covering costs

Vivergo told Argus it wants the government to cover losses of £3mn/month, or £35mn/yr, which it said have been incurred as a result of government decisions.

Previously, ABF proposed a support package of £75mn/yr, for up to two years, for the entire UK sector.

In the longer-term, Vivergo said there is appetite from private investors to finance future projects. It pointed to a recent initial agreement to supply ethanol for a prospective alcohol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant planned by hydrogen developer Meld Energy at Saltend.

Meld told Argus that while the project will be ""underpinned by government support mechanisms"", the ""longer term plan is to eventually eliminate reliance on subsidy through reducing cost of production which will likely be through scale, efficiency and technology advancement"".

Meld chief executive Chris Smith also told Argus that sourcing bioethanol directly from Vivergo helped ""risk management"". He said locally-produced bioethanol brings ""greater certainty of supply"" and ""reduces local infrastructure requirements.""

Vivergo said failure to support the bioethanol sector would be ""shortsighted"", because in order to meet projected increases in UK SAF demand by 2035 the country would need ""seven more Vivergos"", or a more than 3.5 times increase in domestic bioethanol production.

Regulation frustration

Vivergo said another key way for the government to help is to tackle the eligibility of unrefined liquid dextrose ultrafiltration retentate (Uldur) for double counting under the UK's renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO).

Uldur, which is classfied in the UK as a waste ethanol feedstock, makes up a significant share of the total import pool from the US.

Biofuels made from certain raw materials classed as ""wastes"" and ""residues"" under the RTFO receive double the amount of renewable transport fuel certificates (RTFCs) for every litre of fuel produced. RTFCs are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet the RTFO mandate.

Vivergo says Uldur-derived ethanol is a co-product of the wet milling process rather than waste, and its eligibility for double counting is inconsistent with the RTFO's decarbonisation aims. It said producers using Uldur are able to make double-counting bioethanol using a more carbon-intensive production process than the fermentation of wheat, yet crop-based ethanol produced by Vivergo is ineligible for double counting.

Vivergo said producers of double counting product get an additional certificate worth around £260/t, meaning it is unable compete with the low prices of Uldur-based bioethanol importers from the US. And these will now be able to enter the UK duty free under the new US-UK trade deal.

The UK government is consulting on whether to continue classing Uldur as eligible for double counting.

Other changes proposed by Vivergo include increasing the ethanol mandate in road fuel, from E10 to E15 or E20. Vivergo previously said an E15 mandate could boost demand in the UK by 660mn l/yr. It also highlighted the potential for increased bioethanol use in marine and aviation sectors.

Capturing the moment

Another key point in the talks with the government is the capture of CO2, a by-product of bioethanol production, Vivergo said.

The company said it is 6-9 months away from having carbon capture facilities ready, at which point it would be capable of meeting around a third of the UK's 600,000 t/yr CO2 demand.

Ensus captures 250,000 t/yr of CO2 at its 400mn l/yr bioethanol refinery in Wilton, northeast England.

Vivergo said losing this would mean increased CO2 imports, and noted its output of high-protein animal feed as a co-product of wheat-to-ethanol production, which agricultural firms would otherwise have to import at a higher environmental cost.

The National Farmers Union has previously said that losing the UK bioethanol industry would be a ""huge blow"", as it currently has the ""capacity to purchase around 2mn t of wheat each year"", so without it ""farmers would lose a reliable market for their feed wheat.""",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-07-21 12:56:53.871827

New Oversight Role: Howden will independently assess insurance policies to support the eligibility of carbon credits under CORSIA, enhancing credibility and compliance.

Market Expansion: The initiative opens access to a broader range of insurance products, reducing political risk and unlocking institutional capital in carbon markets.

Aviation Decarbonization: Supports CORSIA’s legally binding emission offset scheme for international airlines, promoting the issuance of high-integrity carbon credits.

Howden, the global insurance intermediary, has been appointed by Gold Standard to independently assess insurance policies linked to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The move aims to de-risk investment in carbon offset projects by identifying insurance products that meet Gold Standard’s stringent eligibility criteria.

The new process supports the first phase of CORSIA (2024–2026) and enables carbon credit developers to access approved insurance options to mitigate political risks, a common barrier to scale in climate finance.

Charlie Pool, Head of Carbon Markets, Climate Risk and Resilience at Howden, said:

“This collaboration marks an important step for carbon markets. By broadening access to insurance products and reducing risks, the partnership will provide additional security, through independent verification, helping buyers purchase with confidence and in compliance with internationally recognised standards.”

CORSIA, developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), mandates that international carriers offset any growth in emissions above baseline levels. All participating airlines are legally required to use either eligible carbon credits or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet offset obligations.

The insurance assessment mechanism also helps avoid double counting between international and national carbon targets. Several carbon standards, including Gold Standard, now recognise the role of insurance in mitigating such risks.

Pool added:

“This is a perfect example of how embedded insurance enhances carbon market integrity, in this case supporting the aviation energy transition by allowing the issuance of credible carbon credits and facilitating compliance with CORSIA. The new insurance process will also allow more institutional capital, which was previously held back, to flow into the market, setting an exciting precedent that can be replicated elsewhere to unlock the full potential of carbon markets.”

Margaret Kim, CEO of Gold Standard, emphasized the role of insurance in expanding project eligibility under CORSIA:

“To enable climate action for people and nature, we need to broaden access to new and growing markets, including CORSIA. By recognising insurance policies through a rigorous assessment process and allowing their use to address political risk, we can enable more projects to supply credits for CORSIA’s first phase, in a way that is credible, reliable and based on solid foundations.”

The partnership between Howden and Gold Standard marks a critical step toward establishing scalable, high-integrity carbon markets tailored to the aviation sector’s climate obligations.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-116.png,N,,2025-07-21 13:56:42.696111

As the world's wealthiest individuals demand more from their travel experiences, the private aviation industry is poised to deliver—provided it continues to innovate in luxury, sustainability, and accessibility.","The private aviation industry is experiencing a seismic shift as luxury conglomerates and private equity firms align to capitalize on the growing demand for exclusive, time-saving travel. LVMH's landmark $800 million investment in Flexjet—valuing the private jet company at $4 billion—epitomizes this trend. The move, led by LVMH-backed L Catterton, underscores a strategic convergence of luxury brand equity and private equity's operational rigor, redefining how high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs) experience mobility.

The Strategic Rationale: Luxury Meets Private Equity

LVMH's foray into private aviation is not an isolated bet but a calculated expansion into the luxury experience economy. By acquiring a 20% stake in Flexjet, the French conglomerate leverages its portfolio of 75+ luxury brands—including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Bulgari—to create a seamless ecosystem of exclusivity. Flexjet, a 30-year industry leader, will now integrate LVMH's design and service DNA, offering members curated experiences such as private terminal access, luxury destination partnerships (e.g., Belmond), and bespoke cabin interiors. This synergy mirrors LVMH's 2018 acquisition of Belmond, which expanded its reach into luxury travel and hospitality.

For Flexjet, the investment unlocks critical resources to modernize its fleet and infrastructure. The company plans to acquire long-range aircraft like Embraer's Praetor series, while expanding its global maintenance network and training programs. With revenue doubling to $3.8 billion in 2024 and EBITDA projected at $425 million in 2025, Flexjet's financials already outperform peers like NetJets (which trades at a 3.5x revenue multiple, versus Flexjet's 5x). LVMH's backing amplifies this momentum, positioning Flexjet to dominate the fractional ownership segment—a market poised to grow at 14.3% CAGR through 2025.

Industry Trends: From Niche to Mainstream

The private aviation sector's rapid growth is driven by three forces:

1. Wealth Polarization: Ultra-wealthy individuals, particularly in tech and crypto, now prioritize privacy, convenience, and customization. Post-pandemic, private jets have become a status symbol akin to supercars or yachts.

2. Fractional Ownership Models: These reduce barriers to entry, allowing clients to pay for usage rather than full ownership. Flexjet's membership-based approach, akin to luxury country clubs, has proven more scalable than NetJets' traditional fractional model.

3. Sustainability Imperatives: Operators are investing in sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and AI-driven route optimization to meet environmental regulations and consumer expectations. Flexjet's partnership with Embraer for 182 new aircraft includes commitments to greener technologies.

The global private jet rental market is projected to reach $24.28 billion in 2025, with North America accounting for 63.5% of demand. However, regulatory headwinds in Europe—such as the EU's “Fit for 55” carbon policies—pose risks. Companies that innovate in sustainability, like Flexjet, will gain a competitive edge.

Implications for Investors

For investors, the LVMH-Flexjet partnership signals a broader trend: private aviation is transitioning from a niche asset class to a mainstream luxury play. Here's how to position a portfolio:

Direct Exposure to High-Growth Operators: Flexjet's valuation premium and LVMH's brand power make it a compelling long-term hold. Investors should monitor its fleet expansion and EBITDA margins.

Aerospace and MRO Providers: Embraer and Gulfstream (Lockheed Martin) benefit from Flexjet's aircraft orders. Maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) firms like Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. also stand to gain from increased fleet activity.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs): Companies like Neste and Aldol Aviation are scaling SAF production, aligning with Flexjet's sustainability goals. ETFs focused on green energy or aerospace innovation (e.g., XLRE) offer diversified access.

Luxury Partnerships: Track collaborations between Flexjet and LVMH brands. These could drive ancillary revenue streams, such as in-flight retail or exclusive travel packages.

Risks and Considerations

While the sector's growth is undeniable, investors must navigate risks:

- Regulatory Pressures: Stricter emissions standards in Europe could hike operating costs.

- Economic Volatility: A slowdown in UHNWI spending could dampen demand.

- Technological Disruption: Electric aircraft or AI-driven concierge services may require rapid adaptation.

Conservative investors should consider diversified aerospace giants like Embraer or Bombardier, while risk-tolerant players might explore private equity funds focused on luxury mobility.

Conclusion: The Future of Travel is Exclusive

LVMH's investment in Flexjet is a masterclass in luxury brand strategy and private equity execution. By merging LVMH's heritage of craftsmanship with Flexjet's operational expertise, the partnership elevates private aviation from a functional service to a curated experience. For investors, this convergence represents a unique opportunity to tap into a sector where exclusivity and innovation are no longer mutually exclusive.

U.S. ethanol is poised to play a critical role in the energy transition.
In response to global demand, U.S. ethanol is consistently improving its carbon intensity score.","As the U.S. Grains Council celebrates its 65th Anniversary this year and hosts its flagship biannual Global Ethanol Summit (GES) in October; it is an opportunity to reaffirm the Council’s steadfast commitment to developing export markets for agricultural products, including increasing visibility around the benefits of ethanol as a fundamental tool to reduce global carbon emissions.

Marketing year 2023/2024 saw a record-setting level of export volumes of U.S. ethanol to the world, reaching 1.746 billion gallons (6.609 billion liters), for a total value of $4.1 billion. This figure does not include exports to Japan. Current ethanol exports are on track for a similar performance this year.

While Canada, the United Kingdom, India and the European Union figure among U.S. top export destination markets, rapid expansion and uptake is also occurring in other less mature global markets. For example, several countries throughout Central America (Costa Rica, Guatemala and Panama) are moving forward with commitments to implement an E10 blending mandate, while Colombia and Peru are exploring ways of increasing current blending rates to higher levels. Similarly, Japan recently announced its intention to transition to E10 by 2023 and E20 by 2040, and the Philippines continues to blend at E10 but allows E20 on a voluntary basis.

Several drivers fuel this demand for U.S. ethanol, including economic, environmental and public health considerations. Concerns about air quality have led many foreign governments to consider ethanol as a readily available resource that provides immediate reductions in outdoor air pollution. Another aspect of USGC’s engagement involves ethanol educational programming, specifically to help raise awareness about the benefits of ethanol and its ability to help countries meet their climate goals.

Beyond ethanol’s role in on-road applications, there is tremendous potential for its use in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), particularly via the alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathway. There are also growing opportunities for its use as a sustainable marine fuel (SMF), in the chemical space, household energy and other emerging sectors. Council staff recently travelled to the Philippines, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan to showcase how ethanol can play a role in SAF and SMF development, while supporting new research initiatives and engaging with stakeholders.

U.S. ethanol is poised to play a critical role in the energy transition. In response to global demand, U.S. ethanol is consistently improving its carbon intensity score. To be effective as a decarbonization tool, policy frameworks must allow for the use of ethanol in all forms. Policies that constrict ethanol use in the form of feedstock restrictions and/or quantitative limits in favor of other technologies or fuels render the path to carbon neutrality more costly, placing a premium on clean energy and increasing the cost of decarbonization for consumers.

Ethanol production benefits American growers and represents a source of homegrown energy that stimulates rural communities and dynamizes their economies. U.S. ethanol is a readily available and affordable resource supported by existing supply infrastructure with a demonstrated record of effectiveness, and USGC will continue its efforts to assist countries around the world as they integrate this plentiful high-octane oxygenate into their energy matrix.

Estimate Trend

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share of $1.76 has witnessed no downward revision and one upward revision in the past seven days. The estimated figure suggests a decline of 35.06% from the prior-year reported number.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $27.84 billion indicates a 19.29% decline from the year-ago recorded figure.

Factors to Consider

Valero Energy is expected to have maintained a stable performance in the second quarter, owing to high refinery utilization rates during this period. Per the data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, spot prices for West Texas Intermediate Crude dropped nearly 21% from the prior-year quarter’s level. This might have supported the refining player’s profitability by reducing input costs.

Additionally, refining margins improved meaningfully during the quarter, driven by reduced global capacity from shutdowns at major refineries and strong seasonal demand, which boosted crack spreads, particularly benefiting Valero’s low-cost operations. The company’s strategic decision to close its high-cost Benicia refinery also aligns with broader industry consolidation, potentially enhancing future margins. Additionally, Valero has made notable progress in renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) initiatives, which could have aided the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.

These factors are expected to have positively impacted demand and pricing dynamics, potentially aiding Valero Energy’s quarterly performance.

The pilot project was executed in May, during which 1,000 metric tons of biogenic feedstock were processed.
With this project, INA continues to innovate and efficiently adapt to the requirements of the new energy era,” Goran Pleše, INA Operating Director of Refining and Marketing, said.
INA said it plans to complete all preparatory activities and be ready to ensure continuous supply of SAF to the market by 2029, in line with the European Union’s (EU) Renewable Energy Directive.
Through the directive, the EU set binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable energy sources in transport.","Croatia’s INA d.d. said its Rijeka refinery in the country has produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the first time.

As part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and align with European renewable energy regulations, the oil company has successfully completed a pilot project to process biogenic feedstock at the hydrocracking unit of the refinery, according to a news release.

In addition to SAF, a significant volume of renewable diesel, or hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), was also produced, the company said.

INA said the project was implemented in collaboration with the unit’s licensor, Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), aiming to test the co-processing of 5 percent palm oil mill effluent, which is a by-product of palm oil production, with fossil feedstocks.

The pilot project was executed in May, during which 1,000 metric tons of biogenic feedstock were processed. The entire process was certified by the independent auditor Bureau Veritas d.o.o., in line with the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification standard for sustainable biofuels, according to the release.

The preparation of the pilot project took eight months “due to the complexity of processing a new type of feedstock and its specific physical and chemical properties,” INA said. The project involved a range of activities, from procuring specialized filters and adapting laboratory methods to increasing the capacities of the hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units and ensuring controlled handling of the biogenic feedstock under existing operating conditions. the company stated.

During the test run, more than 400 samples were collected for detailed analysis conducted at INA’s central testing laboratory, while radiocarbon dating analysis was done on the biogenic content by accredited external laboratories Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb and Isotoptech Zrt. in Debrecen, according to the release.

“Processing biogenic feedstock within existing infrastructure is one of the most efficient ways to decarbonize refinery operations and increase the share of renewables in the transport sector. Thanks to the commitment of our internal team and the collaboration with partners from MOL Group and CLG, we have successfully created the necessary preconditions to meet the future needs of the market and our customers,” Ivica Jerbić, INA Director of Development, said.

“This pilot project has created the foundation for further activities and the introduction of continuous biogenic feedstock processing at the Rijeka Refinery in the near future. With this project, INA continues to innovate and efficiently adapt to the requirements of the new energy era,” Goran Pleše, INA Operating Director of Refining and Marketing, said.

INA said it plans to complete all preparatory activities and be ready to ensure continuous supply of SAF to the market by 2029, in line with the European Union’s (EU) Renewable Energy Directive. Through the directive, the EU set binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable energy sources in transport. By 2030, EU member states are required to ensure an appropriate share of renewables in the transport sector, with a particular focus on advanced biofuels and SAF, which will play a key role in decarbonizing the aviation industry, according to the release.

The trend of consolidation and collaboration across the aviation sector has continued, where the lengthy timelines frequently being seen for regulatory clearances have in some cases presented issues for parties' transaction timetables. There have also been warnings over partnerships and collaborations that may prematurely cross into action requiring prior regulatory approval.

Regulatory changes and reform have picked up, with significant steps towards ""greening"" the aviation industry. Proposed changes to airline ownership and control in Europe are also now in the offing.

Buoyant M&A activity for airlines

Qatar Airways received conditional clearance from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for its 25% stake in Virgin Australia. The FIRB decision follows approval from the Australian competition authority (ACCC) for a codeshare arrangement between the airlines on international flights between Doha and four major Australian cities. Cooperative conduct between the airlines is permitted for five years.

Luxembourg flag carrier, Luxair, has challenged the European Commission's (EC) decision to clear (subject to remedies) Lufthansa's acquisition of a controlling minority interest in ITA. Luxair's appeal to the EU's General Court contends that the Commission failed to conduct a detailed assessment of remedies. Additionally, the airline argues that the EC did not provide relevant information to enable Luxair to contribute to the EC's market testing of whether the proposed remedies were viable and sufficient.

Safran has secured conditional approval for its acquisition of a part of Collins Aerospace's actuation and flight controls business from Brazilian, EU, UK and North American competition authorities. The approval is contingent on Safran divesting its North American actuation business and related assets.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is undertaking a merger review of the anticipated acquisition by The Boeing Company of Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc. The merger aims to streamline Boeing's supply chain and improve production efficiency by bringing Spirit's aerostructure operations under Boeing's direct control. The merger is likely to be subject to merger reviews in other key jurisdictions.

The German competition authority (Bundeskartellamt) has given its approval for Lufthansa's acquisition of a 10% minority shareholding in airBaltic. While the Bundeskartellamt noted competitive overlaps, the relevant routes were ""minor markets"" with low revenues and therefore exempt from further review.

A proposed merger between Brazilian carriers Azul and Gol remains under competition review. However, the Brazilian competition authority (CADE) has agreed to a political request to revisit the codeshare arrangement between the two airlines entered into in May 2024 over concerns around potential gun-jumping (when independent firms act in a coordinated way akin to having merged or formed a joint venture prior to obtaining mandatory competition approvals). CADE had initially closed its gun-jumping investigation.

South Korean resort operator Sono Hospital Group (Sono) has become the largest shareholder of T'way Air after acquiring (indirectly) a 46.26% stake in T'way Holdings. The acquisition has been approved by the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC). Sono already holds the second-largest shareholding in Air Premia, although it has announced that it intends to sell off its shares.

In March, the KFTC and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport agreed to jointly monitor a set of remedies tied to Korean Air's acquisition of Asiana Airlines. Implementation of the remedies, adjusted by the KFTC in December, will be overseen by the ministry over the next 10 years. Asiana Airlines is facing an investigation by the KFTC as to whether fare changes made by the airline constitute non-compliance with the conditions.

DSV announced it had obtained all necessary regulatory clearances for its €14.3 billion acquisition of global freight forwarding and contract logistics business Schenker AG. This included clearance under the EU's new Foreign Subsidy Regulation.

Following the longest review suspension in China's recent merger history, ANA Holdings' acquisition of Nippon Cargo Airlines finally received conditional approval from the Chinese competition authority. The conditions include a requirement on ANA Holdings to continue existing cargo ground-service agreements, to provide fair services to new market entrants and to transfer a maximum of seven weekly cargo flights between Tokyo Narita and Shanghai Pudong to new entrants. The delays in securing this approval highlight the importance of accurately mapping out merger control timelines and risks.

Air France-KLM has announced that it intends to take a majority stake in SAS. Through an acquisition of the shares currently held by Castlelake and Lind Invest, Air France will increase its holding in the Scandinavian carrier from 19.9% to 60.5%.

Joint ventures and cooperation agreements

The CMA has provisionally accepted commitments offered by the five airlines party to the Atlantic Joint Business Agreement. The agreement facilitates cooperation between British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus, American Airlines and Finnair on the pricing and schedules of their transatlantic networks. To mitigate the CMA's concerns, the airlines have offered to provide slots to competitors at London Heathrow and London Gatwick, and to carry a minimum number of ""local passengers"" annually on the London-Dallas route. The commitments package was strengthened following initial market testing in the spring to include, among other things, additional slot commitments on the London-Boston route.

In March, the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) approved a cooperation agreement between Singapore Airlines and All Nippon Airways. Approval was conditional on commitments, including obligations to maintain seat capacity, develop and submit business plans, report flight schedules/individual capacity levels and appoint an independent auditor to report on compliance to the CCCS annually.

The CCCS has also given conditional clearance for commercial cooperation between Singapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. The agreement includes expanded codesharing of flights and partnering on the scheduling, pricing and marketing of routes between Singapore and Malaysia. The CCCS accepted commitments from the airlines to maintain pre-cooperation seat capacity, report on the operations of their respective low-cost carriers and appoint an independent auditor.

Etihad and Ethiopian Airlines have signed a strategic partnership agreement, featuring a codeshare arrangement and new flight routes. The collaboration, which remains subject to regulatory approval, will see the airlines launching new flights between Abu Dhabi and Addis Ababa. Etihad has also recently secured further partnerships with STARLUX, China Eastern and TAP Air Portugal.

Virgin Atlantic, Delta Air Lines and Air France-KLM have announced a partnership with IndiGo. The partnership will enable IndiGo to expand its long-haul network into Europe and North America. The other partners will gain links into India.

Competition and antitrust enforcement

The Dutch competition authority (ACM) has launched a market investigation into computer-controlled consumer prices in the aviation sector. The ACM seeks to understand how the prices are calculated and the effects that such algorithms and prices have on consumers.

Italy's Competition Authority (AGCM) has accused Ryanair of failing to provide accurate and complete information during the authority's abuse of dominance probe. Concurrently, Ryanair has expressed its intention to escalate its challenges to the AGCM investigation. This comes after the airline failed to overturn both Irish and Italian court rulings on the legitimacy of the AGCM's request that its Irish counterpart assist with the raids on Ryanair's Dublin offices that took place in 2024.

India's competition authority (CCI) has cleared GMR Airports of alleged anti-competitive practices at Indira Gandhi International Airport. The alleged monopolistic practices included GMR foregoing competitive bidding processes for parking and lounge service contracts. Complainants also argued that GMR had charged excessive fees on related tenders. The CCI rejected the complaint.

After many years of litigation, Singapore Airlines and Singapore Airlines Cargo announced that they had reached a settlement with the EC relating to interest on an overturned fine. The initial antitrust investigation into the airlines began in 2007. A similar settlement was recently agreed between the EC and Cathay Pacific Airways.

The US Supreme Court has rejected a petition to review a lower court's decision upholding an injunction against the operations of the Northeast Alliance, the joint venture between American Airlines and JetBlue. The joint venture was blocked by lower courts due to competition concerns in the domestic market for air travel.

Aircalin submitted remedies to the New Caledonian Competition Authority to resolve an investigation into the airline's commission system for travel agents. Aircalin introduced an incentive-based payment system for travel agencies, prompting concerns that the mechanism could distort competition by favouring Aircalin's integrated travel agency.

Regulatory developments – much more to come in 2025

The EC has published its long-awaited Clean Industrial Deal, outlining its strategy to ""accelerate decarbonisation and competitiveness"" across the European industry. A Sustainable Transport Investment Plan will support specific renewable and low-carbon fuels for the aviation sector, while the newly adopted Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF) simplifies subsidy rules to support companies transitioning to green energy sources.

The EC also recently provided clarity on the implementation of ReFuelEU Aviation, the regulation mandating a greater portion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the industry. It published a report evaluating the SAF market in the EU and potential improvements to the SAF flexibility mechanism.

Further direction has been provided by the EC in relation to the Renewable Energy Directive. The Commission has published updated guidance specifying a methodology for calculating the greenhouse gas emissions savings achieved through the use of low-carbon fuels.

Regulatory action to drive greater use of SAF fuels has also progressed in the UK, with the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Bill introduced to Parliament in May 2025. The legislation, which will establish a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers (guaranteeing set payments for fuel), is expected to be in place by the end of 2026. The bill is currently at the Committee Stage in the UK's House of Commons.

In May, the EC published a call for evidence regarding an upcoming revision of the Air Services Regulation. The regulation outlines the conditions for carriers to obtain operating licences and reshapes the governance of EU airlines. A proposal revising the regulation to increase resilience, competition and sustainability is planned for the second quarter of 2026.

The UK government has announced its plans to modernise flight paths in the ""largest redesign"" of UK airspace since its formation in the 1950s. The UK Airspace Design Service, put to Parliament at the end of May, aims to create more efficient and direct flight paths to bring both consumer and environmental benefits. The service is set to be fully operational by the end of 2025.

COVID-19 support to airlines remains in the spotlight

In Brussels, the EC is investigating Lufthansa for non-compliance with the conditions attached to its €6 billion recapitalisation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The EC's concerns relate to a ban on dividend payments and prohibitions on funding subsidiaries that were struggling before the pandemic. The investigation comes at the same time as Lufthansa's appeal to the EU's top court to reinstate EC approval for the recapitalisation aid.

All of these people will need to travel in some regard to get to events and many will be using of single use plastics, like water bottles and snack packaging, to keep fuelled on the go.

This is not to mention the emissions that artists themselves contribute from travelling to each tour destination with equipment.

This is something Coldplay has pledged to tackle in its most recent tour, with an aim to make fans as environmentally aware as possible.

How Coldplay reduces its CO₂ emissions

Coldplay reports that it reduced consumption and extensively recycles, cutting CO₂ emissions by more than 50%.

The tour has tried to make itself as environmentally beneficial as possible by funding nature and technology-based projects and drawing down significantly more CO₂ than the tour produces.

The tour is supporting:

Reforestation

Rewilding

Conservation

Soil regeneration

Carbon capture and storage

Where the tour cannot reduce emissions, the band says it will tackle these using guidance from the Oxford Principles for net zero aligned carbon offsetting.

The band has teamed up with DHL, one of the leading companies in sustainable transport and logistics, offering solutions to minimise logistics-related emissions and other environmental impacts.

What is DHL doing to reduce the tour's emissions?

DHL says that it started with a carbon intelligence and monitoring system to get a view of the tour's carbon footprint, laying the foundation to identify where best to optimise operations.

Through monitoring, DHL found that more than 80% of the CO₂ emissions came from transporting equipment by air.

DHL created GoGreen Plus, using carbon insetting allowing customers to directly reduce emissions at the source. For example, air freight carriers for the brand can purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel from GoGreen Plus, resulting in a fuel life-cycle reduction of 85% per flight.

“We've been highly impressed by DHL’s commitment to sustainability,” says Coldplay’s Co-Manager, Phil Harvey.

During the tour, DHL transported the tour wristbands between venues in trucks that use sustainable fuel.

How is Coldplay using sustainable power?

In the build up to each show, solar photovoltaic panels are installed behind each stage to charge batteries for when the band arrives at the venue.

Coldplay partnered with BMW to develop the world's first rechargeable show battery, made from recyclable BMW i3 batteries, meaning 100% of the show could be powered with renewable energy.

The band installed kinetic floors around the stadium, meaning the fans’ dancing will help power the show through the energy captured.

Coldplay is also using renewable diesel, a biofuel made from hydrotreated vegetable oil.

How Coldplay makes its shows more sustainable

Coldplay says that stages are built from lightweight, low-carbon and reusable materials including recycled steel which can be reused or recycled at the end of the tour.

LED wristbands worn by audiences are 100% compostable, made from plant based materials, alongside being reused each show to reduce production by 80%.

The show now uses low energy LED laser and lighting systems and a PA system that uses up to 50% less power alongside reducing environmental noise outside the venue.

The band also uses 100% biodegradable confetti and a new generation of pyrotechnics that have less explosive charge and new formulas that reduce harmful chemicals.

Social and fan impact

Coldplay have partnered with SAP to create a free app that offers advice to fans on how to use low carbon transport to and from the show.

All fans that commit to low carbon travel to the show will be rewarded a discount code.

The tour includes onsite activation energy zones, powered by solar and kinetic energy, that have interactive and educational experiences explaining clean technology and the natural world.

Fans are encouraged to bring refillable water bottles to the venue where refill stations will be provided for them.

Where possible, merchandise is made of natural fibres and recyclable elements and packaged in recycled paper or compostable bags.

Coldplay released a statement saying: “We’re happy to report that direct CO₂​​​​​​​ emissions from the first two years of this tour are 59% less than our previous stadium tour (2016-17), on a show-by-show comparison. These figures have been verified by the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative.

“We’d like to say a huge thank you to our incredible touring family and to all the brilliant people who’ve made this possible.

“Most of all, we’d like to thank everyone who’s come to a show and helped charge the show batteries on the power bikes and kinetic dance floors; everyone who’s arrived by foot, bike, ride share or public transport; everyone who’s come with refillable water bottles or returned their LED wristband for recycling; and everyone who’s bought a ticket, which means you’ve planted one of 7 million trees so far.

According to the report, India must mobilize around $1.5 trillion by 2030 to transform its energy sector, cut emissions, and strengthen climate resilience across the economy.

Scale of India’s Climate and Energy Commitments

India’s climate ambitions are sweeping. The country has announced its intent to achieve net zero emissions by 2070 and to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 45% from 2005 levels by 2030. Central to these ambitions is the target of reaching 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity in the power sector by 2030.

Currently, India has built up 242.8 GW of non-fossil fuel power, including 184.62 GW from renewable sources, 49.38 GW from large hydropower, and 8.78 GW from nuclear energy. This represents about half of the country’s total installed capacity of 484.8 GW, but to meet its 2030 pledge, India needs to almost double this capacity in just five years—a scale of growth that stands out globally.

Renewable Energy: The Foundation of the Transition

Deloitte estimates that the expansion of renewable energy alone will require $200–250 billion by 2030. Investments will be needed not just in developing new solar and wind power plants, but also in scaling up advanced manufacturing, integrating renewables into the national grid, and expanding transmission systems. As the report states, “India will have to add 300GW of RE capacity by 2030… reaching this goal will need around $200–250 billion in investment by 2030, covering areas such as advanced manufacturing, grid integration and system expansion.”

The Challenge of Energy Storage

A major hurdle in India’s clean energy drive is managing the variability of renewable sources like solar and wind. To ensure reliable, round-the-clock electricity, Deloitte highlights the need to scale up energy storage infrastructure by eight times by FY30, requiring $250–300 billion in investment. Accelerating battery storage, pumped hydro, and other advanced storage solutions will be vital for maintaining grid stability as renewables increasingly power the nation.

Green Fuels: Powering Industry and Transport

India’s clean energy transformation goes beyond electricity. The government’s policies on ethanol blending and sustainable aviation fuel are expected to drive $75–80 billion in biofuels investment. Meanwhile, the National Green Hydrogen Mission—targeting annual production of 5 million metric tonnes by 2030—is set to attract $90–100 billion. Developing these green fuels will reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, cut emissions, and help position India as a global green energy hub.

Resilient Infrastructure and Broader Climate Action

Building a climate-resilient India will require strategic investment in water management, climate-smart agriculture, sustainable transport, digital infrastructure, and waste management. Upgrading these sectors is projected to require more than $80 billion for water and agriculture alone, and as much as $650 billion for transforming transport systems.

Prashanth Nutula, a partner at Deloitte India, stresses that “a comprehensive strategy that aligns infrastructure, waste management and digital transformation will be crucial in creating resilient, future-ready communities and positioning India as a true pioneer in sustainable development.”

Financing: Mobilizing Capital at Scale

Meeting India’s climate targets at this scale calls for innovative financing beyond public budgets. Viral Thakker, Deloitte South Asia’s sustainability leader, points out that “financial instruments, such as green bonds, climate funds and blended finance models, are important in mobilising capital for sustainability initiatives.”

Unlocking these capital flows is key for long-term resilience, job creation, and protecting vulnerable communities from climate risks. As Thakker notes, “By strategically harnessing climate finance, India can accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, offering immense investment potential in sectors poised for sustainable growth and innovation.”

The Path Forward

Deloitte’s latest research offers a clear-eyed view of the investment challenge India faces in realizing its climate and clean energy aspirations. The stakes are not just environmental—they are deeply economic and social. Transforming this $1.5 trillion challenge into an opportunity could safeguard India’s development gains, ensuring prosperity, security, and sustainability for decades to come.",https://marksmendaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Marksmen-Daily-2025-07-21T110427.035-1000x600.webp,N,,2025-07-21 10:56:55.723343

The Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) draft revision of its Corporate Net Zero Standard suggests offering a more pragmatic approach for companies to substantiate progress against targets. We explore this approach, including the short-term use of market-based instruments to address the operational reality that full traceability isn’t always possible in today’s context.

Background

The SBTi has recently published a draft revision of its Corporate Net Zero Standard.1 Designed to accelerate corporate decarbonisation, the draft suggests modifying the target-setting process for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. In this series, we explore the following key topics:

Long-term Scope 3 targets: there is no requirement for companies to set long-term Scope 3 targets, which risks weakening climate ambition and decarbonisation trajectories.

Scope 3 requirements for category A and B companies: separate Scope 3 criteria are proposed for companies based on their size and location. ’Category A’ companies constitute large companies or medium-sized companies in high and upper-middle-income countries. Other medium-sized, small and micro companies fall under ‘Category B’.

Indirect mitigation in the value chain: the SBTi has introduced guidance on the use of indirect emissions mitigation to support corporate decarbonisation pathways, such as the use of a book-and-claim approach for sustainable aviation fuel.

The draft revision aims to support corporate decarbonisation while remaining pragmatic in its expectations around data and ambition. Some changes will make it easier to set targets and encourage greater uptake. They also run the risk of creating ambiguity. In this series on the SBTi’s proposed changes, our experts examine their implications and the fine line that exists between showing pragmatism in corporate decarbonisation and safeguarding long-term emissions reductions.

Rethinking the rules: Activity pool and indirect mitigation

In the current version of the SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard Criteria, only direct mitigation is accepted for substantiating progress against science-based Net Zero targets. While direct mitigation remains the priority in the new draft standard, the SBTi proposes to allow for the limited, temporary use of activity pools and indirect mitigation for Scope 3 emissions under specific conditions.

If direct traceability to specific emissions sources cannot be established, companies may be able to show progress on their Scope 3 targets through interventions at the activity pool level. This involves identifying a group of emissions sources that are not directly traceable to a specific origin but can be linked to a defined region or boundary. For example, a supply shed where a company sources a specific commodity such as wheat but cannot trace it back to the exact farm that the commodity comes from.

Furthermore, in limited cases where direct mitigation and activity pools are not possible, companies would be able to use indirect mitigation using energy and commodity certificates, as a time limited measure. Book-and-claim systems is the most common indirect mitigation method, allowing companies to claim emission reductions or other sustainability benefits associated with a product without physically receiving that product.

Potential impact of greater flexibility in the Net Zero Standard

The proposed changes provide a more realistic pathway for companies with complex value chains in sectors where direct mitigation can be challenging. Previously these companies may have either not set a target at all or addressed a narrower range of emissions sources in their value chain, whereas the proposed change is aimed at incentivising action in complex value chains where there is a lack of traceability.

By investing in indirect mitigation through market-based instruments, companies can influence industry trends that help drive demand for low-carbon alternatives, even when full traceability isn’t possible. Over time, these market signals can contribute to the broader transformation of value chains, making low-emission options more accessible and widespread, leading to transparency and disclosure requests being commonplace.

However, important questions are left unanswered by the current draft — particularly around when and how these tools should be used. While the SBTi has confirmed that companies will be required to justify the use of indirect mitigation over direct action, the current lack of detailed guidance may create uncertainty and could delay the structural decarbonisation that Net Zero targets demand.

The draft states that indirect mitigation must contribute to a Net Zero-aligned transformation relevant to the company’s value chain. To prevent misinterpretation or misuse, the SBTi should provide robust guidance on what constitutes a ‘Net Zero-aligned transformation’ — including sectoral benchmarks, credible examples and alignment with global climate goals.

There are also practical hurdles. Without transparent, verifiable methodologies, companies risk misreporting progress or double counting reductions — undermining both accountability and actual progress.

Increasing traceability in your supply chain: Where to start

Direct decarbonisation of company value chains should remain the bedrock of any credible Net Zero strategy, cutting emissions at the source and strengthening traceability through proactive supply chain engagement.

Yet, the reality is that accurate emissions measurement and reporting remain out of reach for many companies without improved traceability.

A strong first step for companies looking to improve their emissions data would be to conduct a comprehensive supply chain assessment to evaluate traceability and uncover opportunities for emissions reductions. This means mapping key suppliers, understanding what they provide and identifying gaps in emissions data — particularly where data is missing or unreliable.

To help close these gaps, companies should focus on suppliers with both high emissions intensity and limited traceability. Larger organisations can play a vital role in supporting these suppliers by:

Selecting targeted engagement strategies based on supplier profiles and clearly communicating the purpose of the collaboration.

Building long-term, strategic relationships that strengthen suppliers’ ability to decarbonise and report transparently.

Backing traceability initiatives aimed at collecting supplier-specific data to improve emissions accuracy.

Working directly with suppliers to help reduce their emissions at source.

These efforts will help suppliers gain the confidence and resources needed to invest in low-carbon technologies, ultimately contributing to more resilient and decarbonised value chains.

Only where gaps persist should companies turn to emerging guidance on indirect mitigation to complement direct efforts.

However, these measures must remain temporary, clearly justified, and transparently reported — and must never substitute for lasting, direct decarbonisation.

If your organisation is keen to explore the implications of the draft SBTi’s corporate Net Zero Standard v2.0 the Carbon Trust can support you. Additionally, your organisation may choose to take part in the pilot for SBTi’s draft Corporate Net Zero standard v2. The deadline for phase one of the pilot is 15 August 2025.

1 Please note that the draft revision is currently under consultation. None of the proposed changes have been finalised.

In 1Q26, Ryanair welcomed 57.9 million travelers, slightly more (up 4%) than in 1Q25, when 55.5 million passengers boarded its aircraft.
The low-cost carrier expects that the plane maker should certify the 737 MAX 10, of which Ryanair has 300 on order, in late 2025.
In terms of the short-term outlook, the airline stated that Boeing’s delivery delays continue to impact its 206 million passenger target for FY26.
However, Ryanair warned that 1Q26 fares will be lower than in 1Q26, while still expecting to recover the 7% fare decline it suffered in 1Q25.","Ryanair has reported its 1Q26 financial results, with the low-cost carrier, which had previously admitted to opting for lower yields to sustain its load factors during the previous quarters, increasing its revenue per passenger and more than doubling its Q1 after-tax profit (PAT) compared to the same period last year.

On July 21, the Irish low-cost carrier group unveiled an €820 million ($954.7 million) PAT as total revenues rose by 20% compared to 1Q25 to €4.34 billion ($5 billion). Revenue per passenger grew 15% year-on-year (YoY), with the airline’s average fare growing by 21% YoY to €51 ($59.3).

In comparison, 1Q25 total revenues were €3.6 billion ($4.1 billion), while PAT was €360 million ($418.9 million). Last fiscal year’s first quarter average fare per passenger was €42 ($49.8), with load factors remaining flat YoY. In 1Q26, Ryanair welcomed 57.9 million travelers, slightly more (up 4%) than in 1Q25, when 55.5 million passengers boarded its aircraft.

Michael O’Leary, CEO of Ryanair, remarked that Q1 substantially benefited from having a complete Easter in April, “weak prior-year comps, and marginally stronger than expected close-in pricing.” In 2024, Easter fell on March 31.

O’Leary noted that ancillary revenues rose 7% YoY to €1.39 billion ($1.6 billion), while operating costs increased to €3.42 billion ($3.9 billion) as the company’s jet fuel hedging offset rising air traffic control (ATC) fees. These, accounted as route charges in its financial report, surged by 16% YoY to €356 million ($414.4 million), “primarily due to significantly higher Eurocontrol/ATC rates and a 4% increase in flight hours.”

However, as Neil Sorahan, CFO of Ryanair, pointed out during the pre-recorded question-and-answer session, environmental expenses are expected to increase for the carrier. Sorahan stated that it was a “big number” that was included in the airline’s fuel expenses last year, or €850 million ($989.4 million), while during this fiscal year, environment-related costs are estimated to be €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) due to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend mandates. According to the CFO, “it is remarkable that none of this gets recycled back into environmental projects across Europe.”

At the end of the quarter, Ryanair had 181 Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 aircraft in its fleet, 25 more than in 1Q25, with its total fleet comprising 618 aircraft. The fleet growth is expected to facilitate increased passenger traffic, reaching 206 million by the end of FY26. The Irish airline, which has multiple subsidiaries across Europe, stated that it remains “confident that the 29 remaining [737 MAX 8-200] in our 210 orderbook will deliver well ahead of [summer 2026], when we hope to recover this year’s delayed traffic growth into FY27.”

In addition, Ryanair pointed out that Boeing reached the 38-per-month production rate of the 737 MAX in May, its current monthly limit imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) following the mid-air door plug blowout of Alaska Airlines flight AS1282 in January 2024.

The low-cost carrier expects that the plane maker should certify the 737 MAX 10, of which Ryanair has 300 on order, in late 2025. The first 737 MAX 10s should arrive in the airline’s fleet in spring 2027, with the aircraft, which Ryanair said offer 20% more seats at 228 per aircraft, and 20% lower fuel burn, facilitating the carrier’s growth to 800 aircraft and 300 million passengers per year by the end of FY34.

In terms of the short-term outlook, the airline stated that Boeing’s delivery delays continue to impact its 206 million passenger target for FY26. Despite this, its cost-controlling measures should offset the growing environmental expenses. However, Ryanair warned that 1Q26 fares will be lower than in 1Q26, while still expecting to recover the 7% fare decline it suffered in 1Q25.

“The final H1 outcome is, however, heavily dependent on the strength of close-in Aug. and Sept. bookings,” the airline stated. At this time, it has zero H2 visibility and has indicated that it was too early to provide meaningful FY26 PAT guidance; yet, Ryanair expects to reverse the full-year fare decline, resulting in “reasonable net profit growth in FY26.”

The overall aim is to create a healthy EU SAF market and unlock investment into SAF production in the EU, as well as ensuring competitiveness of the EU aviation industry and SAF value chain.","Substantial investment is required to develop and deploy SAF at scale.

Stakeholders across the aviation industry ecosystem have reiterated their commitment to the decarbonisation of air transport. However, they have underlined that accelerating the availability and affordability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is essential to achieving the European Union (EU) and aviation industry climate goal of net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

Organisations, including Destination 2050, FuelsEurope, Hydrogen Europe, Project SkyPower, European Express Association and European Cargo Alliance have highlighted that the Draghi report on European underscores that decarbonisation is a competitive challenge for hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Decarbonisation of the aviation sector is expected to cost around EUR61 billion annually. Furthermore, EU demand requires the construction of circa 12 new industrial-scale first-of-a-kind e-SAF plants.

Aviation is also critical to socio-economic growth. In addition to providing vital connectivity, in 2019 figures show that the industry supported 14 million jobs and EUR 851 billion to GDP in Europe.

Transitioning to a net zero industry requires substantial investment to develop and deploy SAF, to upgrade infrastructure and to support technological innovations within the industry. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative has largely stimulated bio-SAF production capacity, with around 1.2 million tonnes of the fuel produced in 2014. Achieving the higher overall targets and the e-SAF sub-target in 2030 and beyond is dependent on the unlocking of private investment, which today is hindered by high capital costs, regulatory complexity and a lack of market-based de-risking instruments.

While the EU’s ReFuel Aviation is described as the “backbone” of Europe’s SAF strategy, its success relies on swift, coordinated action to resolve the investment and implementation barriers.

Critical challenges

The market for commercially available HEFA-produced SAF remains nascent, with the corresponding challenge of the high cost gap with conventional kerosene and possible competitive gap with non-EU airlines and SAF producers.

In addition, next-generation SAF pathways, notably e-SAF and advanced biofuels, continue to face strong challenges in securing investment decisions for commercial deployment. To date, with the exception of one small pilot-scale project, none of the 40+ EU e-SAF commercially-full-scale projects have reached final investment decision (FID).

In response the aviation industry is urging policymakers at EU and national levels to take swift action and work alongside industry stakeholders to ensure a timely and robust ramp-up of SAF in Europe.

With emissions from air travel accounting for 2.5% of global CO₂ output, regulatory pressure, corporate commitments, and technological innovation are converging to make Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a cornerstone of the net-zero economy. As of July 2025, SAF production capacity has surged to 30,000 barrels per day (b/d) in the U.S. and is projected to hit 15.5 million tonnes globally by 2030. This rapid growth, coupled with structural bottlenecks and policy tailwinds, creates a compelling investment thesis for infrastructure, production, and technology players.

Policy-Driven Demand and the Race to Scale

The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation mandate (2% SAF blending by 2025) and the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge (3 billion gallons annually by 2030) have created a regulatory floor for demand. These policies are already reshaping supply chains. For example, the EU's reliance on imported feedstocks like used cooking oil (UCO) and soybean oil has driven up prices and created a premium for producers with secure, traceable feedstock access. Similarly, U.S. projects like Phillips 66's 10,000-b/d and Diamond Green Diesel's 15,000-b/d facilities are leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act's 45Z tax credit to expand capacity.

However, policy alone is not enough. Structural bottlenecks—such as limited feedstock availability, fragmented collection systems, and underdeveloped distribution networks—threaten to slow progress. For instance, the U.S. currently produces SAF at 30,000 b/d but faces a 2030 feedstock gap as demand outstrips supply of UCO and animal fats. This creates an urgent need for alternative pathways like e-SAF (green hydrogen + CO₂) and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) technologies, which are still in early commercialization but hold long-term scalability.

Investment Opportunities in Infrastructure and Production

The SAF supply chain offers three distinct investment layers:

Feedstock Logistics and Collection Systems

The lack of standardized UCO collection networks in regions like Asia-Pacific and Europe presents a critical gap. Independent traders control 80% of UCO in Asia, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. Companies building digital platforms to aggregate and trace feedstock—such as startups leveraging blockchain for transparency—could capture significant value. Similarly, waste segregation and pre-treatment infrastructure for municipal solid waste (MSW) and agricultural residues will become essential as HEFA's feedstock limitations become apparent.

Production Facilities and Technology Innovation

The U.S. and Asia are leading in SAF production, but Europe lags behind, with only 30% of announced projects under construction. This underdevelopment highlights opportunities for firms building modular, plug-and-play SAF plants or retrofitting existing refineries. For example, co-processing refineries (which blend SAF with conventional jet fuel) and standalone renewable diesel-to-SAF facilities are gaining traction. Investors should also monitor companies developing next-gen technologies like e-SAF, which could become a $100 billion market by 2040.

Distribution and Airport Infrastructure

Existing jet fuel infrastructure is incompatible with SAF blending at scale. Airports and fuel service providers face a $20–30 billion investment need to upgrade storage tanks, pipelines, and delivery systems. China's Civil Aviation Administration is already testing SAF refueling trials, while the U.S. is incentivizing airport upgrades through federal grants. This creates a niche for engineering firms and EPC contractors with expertise in aviation fuel logistics.

Data-Driven Insights and Market Dynamics

The SAF market is highly capital-intensive, with production costs currently 3–5 times higher than conventional jet fuel. However, costs are expected to decline as scale increases and policy incentives mature. For example, the 45Z tax credit in the U.S. provides up to $1.29 per gallon for SAF produced from non-ILUC feedstocks, a critical bridge until production becomes economically viable. Investors should also monitor the 45Z extension beyond 2027, as its expiration could disrupt momentum.

Risks and Strategic Considerations

While the long-term outlook is positive, near-term risks include:

- Feedstock Competition: SAF producers face headwinds from renewable diesel demand for road transport, driving up soybean oil and tallow prices.

- Policy Uncertainty: Delays in EU blending mandates or U.S. tax credit extensions could slow adoption.

- Technological Hurdles: e-SAF and FT (Fischer-Tropsch) pathways require breakthroughs in green hydrogen production and carbon capture.

To mitigate these risks, investors should prioritize companies with diversified feedstock portfolios, strong policy alignment, and partnerships with airlines or airports. For example, firms securing long-term supply contracts with major carriers like United or Lufthansa can lock in demand and reduce exposure to market volatility.

Conclusion: A Multi-Decade Transition

The SAF industry is at an inflection point. With global demand set to reach 196 million tonnes by 2050 and policy frameworks solidifying, investors have a unique opportunity to back the infrastructure and technology that will decarbonize aviation. The next five years will be critical in determining whether SAF becomes a foundational pillar of net-zero aviation or remains a niche solution. For those willing to navigate the early-stage risks, the rewards are substantial: a sector poised to grow at 30%+ annually, backed by trillions in global climate commitments.

In the coming months, watch for companies securing feedstock supply chains, securing government contracts, and pioneering next-gen technologies.

As U.S. airlines begin hitting their centennial -- American follows next year and United turns 100 in 2031 -- it's fun to consider what the flight experience was like in those early years.

It's also worth thinking about what dramatic transformations lie in airlines' future.

Aviation historian Shea Oakley spoke with me recently about the Douglas DC-3, a revolutionary aircraft for its time, which entered service in 1936. With its 21 seats, the DC-3 was the first aircraft with which airlines could make a profit through passenger service alone, without necessarily relying on mail delivery.

But to fly on the DC-3, or any aircraft, during the first decades of the airline industry meant subjecting oneself to plenty of discomfort and a fair bit of danger.

The first pressurized aircraft didn't appear until 1940, meaning flights had to stay low, where they are especially subject to turbulence.

Seats, Oakley said, were often metal or wicker.

Weather frequently grounded planes. And it was so noisy in the cabin that passengers would sometimes communicate by passing notes.

Further, crashes were much more common. Between 1930 and 1937, U.S. airlines with loads of at least three people had 45 accidents, according to PlaneCrashInfo.com.

""It was just a miserable experience,"" Oakley said. ""It was adventurous but miserable.""

Modern technology has solved many of those early pitfalls. Sure, economy flying isn't very comfortable, but that's a relative concern. Crash rates are way down. There's no need to scream to be heard. And planes fly high above the clouds, with satellite tracking and communications capabilities to, in many cases, steer clear of turbulence.

But back in the 1920s, human-induced climate change wasn't a known phenomenon, and airlines needn't worry about carbon emissions.

Over the next generations, solving the emissions problem will be the aviation industry's biggest challenge.

The global airline industry has committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. And while it's unclear if that lofty target is attainable, the pressure on airlines to fly cleaner isn't likely to substantially abate in the coming decades.

For now, flying the most modern planes with the densest seat configurations is the most effective way for airlines to reduce their per-passenger carbon footprint, as a recent analysis by industry data provider Cirium illustrated. But over the next several decades, a dramatic ramp-up in the production of sustainable aviation fuel, coupled further down the line with the realization of new flying technologies, are the path toward true transformation.

Already, numerous companies are at work on electric flying solutions geared toward being viable for commercial airlines, at least on short routes, as battery technology improves.

Zero-emissions, hydrogen-powered aircraft capable of covering long distances are also part of flying's future, even though Airbus has stepped back from its earlier goal of introducing a hydrogen-powered narrowbody by 2035.

And new aircraft shapes, especially the blended wing design under development by JetZero and other aviation startups, have the potential to reduce emissions by 50% through aerodynamic improvements.

Flying today is nothing like it was when Delta got into the passenger air business. But where safety, range and comfort were the big frontiers for the industry during its early years, efficiency is now the north star.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/All_TW_Art/TWSTF/RobertSilk300x171.jpg?n=6273&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-07-21 10:57:40.634531

Over the past two years, a series of high-profile near-miss incidents—ranging from midair collisions to runway incursions—have exposed systemic flaws in air traffic management and coordination between civilian and military operations. These events are not just operational blunders; they are reshaping investor sentiment, intensifying regulatory scrutiny, and creating both risks and opportunities for airline and aerospace stocks.

The Catalyst: A Year of Escalating Safety Crises

The most harrowing incident came on January 29, 2025, when an American Airlines regional jet collided with a U.S. Army helicopter near Reagan National Airport, killing all 67 people on board. This tragedy, the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster in 25 years, was preceded by a string of near-misses in 2023 and 2024, including a 100-foot near-collision between a Delta and American Airlines jet at JFK and a February 2023 incident where a FedEx and Southwest plane nearly shared the same runway. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported a 10% increase in fatal crashes in early 2025 compared to 2024, with staffing shortages and communication failures cited as key contributors.

These incidents have triggered a cascade of regulatory actions. The FAA launched a 14-year safety review in 2023, introduced the Approach Runway Verification (ARV) system, and accelerated hiring for air traffic controllers. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued urgent recommendations to decongest flight paths and modernize collision-avoidance systems. For investors, this regulatory tightening is a double-edged sword: while it could reduce long-term accident risks, it also raises operational costs and creates uncertainty for airlines already grappling with inflation and fuel price volatility.

Investor Sentiment: Volatility and the ""Guilt by Association"" Effect

The market's reaction to aviation safety incidents has been swift and severe. Boeing's stock plummeted 5% within hours of the Air India Dreamliner crash in early 2025, while GE Aerospace shares fell 2% as investors questioned the reliability of critical components. Smaller airlines and regional carriers have fared even worse. For example, Republic Airways, which operates regional jets for major carriers, saw its stock drop 8% following a May 2025 near-miss at Reagan National, where two commercial flights had to abort landings due to a military helicopter's proximity.

The ""guilt by association"" effect is particularly pronounced for airlines with fleets heavily reliant on Boeing aircraft. Low-cost carriers like Southwest and American Airlines, which operate large numbers of 737s and 787s, have faced sharper sell-offs than their more diversified peers. Conversely, Airbus and Embraer have seen modest gains as investors hedge against Boeing's vulnerabilities. This dynamic underscores a broader trend: in a crisis, market participants punish firms with perceived systemic risks, even if the incident is unrelated to their core operations.

Regulatory Scrutiny and the Cost of Compliance

Regulatory responses to 2025's safety crises are already reshaping the industry. The FAA's Controller “Stand Up for Safety” campaign, which prioritizes communication and error correction, has forced airlines to invest in new training programs and technology. For instance, the ARV system, which provides real-time alerts for runway conflicts, is being rolled out at major airports, but its implementation costs could add millions to operating budgets. Similarly, the NTSB's push to decongest military helicopter routes near Reagan National has led to temporary flight restrictions, reducing capacity for regional carriers.

Investors must weigh these regulatory costs against potential long-term benefits. While compliance expenses may squeeze short-term margins, they could also reduce accident risks and stabilize demand. For example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airline net profits will rise to $36 billion in 2025, driven by falling oil prices and strong passenger demand. However, carriers with weak balance sheets—like Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air—may struggle to absorb safety-related costs, increasing their vulnerability to market volatility.

Long-Term Opportunities: Safety as a Competitive Advantage

Despite the risks, the current crisis also creates opportunities for airlines and aerospace firms that prioritize safety and innovation. Airlines with robust safety records, such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines, have seen their stocks outperform peers, as investors seek refuge in companies perceived as less likely to face regulatory penalties or reputational damage. Similarly, aerospace firms investing in advanced collision-avoidance technologies—like Honeywell and Garmin—are gaining traction as the FAA mandates upgrades to TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) and ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) systems.

For investors, the key is to differentiate between short-term pain and long-term resilience. Airlines that can modernize their fleets, reduce reliance on aging aircraft, and adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) strategies are likely to outperform in the coming years. For example, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have committed to SAF investments, which could mitigate both environmental and safety risks while aligning with regulatory trends.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The aviation sector in 2025 is at a crossroads. Safety incidents have exposed vulnerabilities in air traffic management, regulatory oversight, and corporate governance, but they've also accelerated innovation and transparency. For investors, the path forward requires a nuanced approach:

Hedge against volatility: Diversify airline exposure by investing in a mix of legacy carriers with strong balance sheets and regional players with growth potential.

Prioritize safety-focused firms: Favor airlines and aerospace companies that are proactively modernizing their operations and fleets.

Monitor regulatory trends: Stay attuned to FAA and NTSB updates, as policy shifts will continue to shape the industry's risk profile.

Consider insurance dynamics: Insurers like Travelers and Allstate are navigating a new landscape where coverage for regulatory non-compliance is limited, creating opportunities for firms offering parametric or data-driven risk models.

In the end, the aviation sector's ability to adapt to its current challenges will determine its long-term success. For investors, the lesson is clear: safety isn't just a regulatory issue—it's a financial imperative.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 18:56:07.717666

At some airports using CT scanners, passengers may be allowed to leave liquids and laptops in their bags, but policies are not yet standardized.","Passengers in the United States will no longer be required to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints as part of a major policy shift by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The agency officially lifted the mandate at select airports equipped with advanced screening systems in July 2025.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the change as the start of a broader modernization of air travel security. “We’ve entered a new phase of aviation screening,” she said. “This is just the beginning.”

The new shoe policy was made possible by the deployment of advanced CT scanners and artificial intelligence-based detection systems at over 250 U.S. airports. These tools allow TSA officers to detect threats without requiring travelers to remove footwear, a practice that has been in place since 2001.

Following the announcement, Noem indicated that the TSA’s long-standing limit on carry-on liquids may be the next rule to be revised.

The 3-1-1 rule, which restricts travelers to liquids in containers of 3.4 ounces or less, placed inside a single quart-size plastic bag, was introduced in 2006 following a terror plot involving liquid explosives. However, TSA officials are now reviewing the necessity of its use in light of newer scanning technology.

Noem, speaking at The Hill Nation Summit, said, “The liquids, I’m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be.”

According to the Associated Press, approximately 255 of the 432 commercial airports in the U.S. now utilize CT scanners that provide 3D imaging of carry-on contents, allowing TSA officers to analyze the materials inside without unpacking.

The TSA confirmed that changes to the liquids rule are under review, but gave no timeline for implementation. The agency emphasized that full removal of the rule would depend on scanner availability and consistent security performance nationwide.

Several international airports have already lifted their liquids ban after installing similar technology. The U.S. could follow a phased approach, allowing liquid limits to be eased at certain airports first.

Experts have urged caution. Jeffrey Price, an aviation security professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said uneven deployment of CT scanners could lead to confusion. “If one airport allows large liquids and another does not, passengers are going to be caught in a grey area,” he said.

In addition, a former TSA official noted that clear public messaging will be essential if the rule is revised. “The devil is going to be in the details,” they said.

Currently, the TSA advises travelers to continue following the 3-1-1 liquids rule unless otherwise notified. At some airports using CT scanners, passengers may be allowed to leave liquids and laptops in their bags, but policies are not yet standardized.

In the long term, the TSA is exploring the possibility of walk-through screening systems that allow passengers to pass through security checkpoints without removing electronics, shoes, or liquids at all. Officials believe that as biometric technology and AI continue to advance, a more seamless travel experience is possible.

“Our goal is to provide the highest level of security with the least amount of disruption,” Noem said. “That’s the future of air travel.”",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/airport-security-control-liquids-in-bag.webp,N,,2025-07-20 14:56:08.213826

Carbon-neutral, powered solely by hydrogen, and capable of flying long distances with up to 200 passengers onboard, the ZEROe looks set to send shockwaves around the aviation industry when it enters commercial service.

In this article, we take a look at the development of the Airbus ZEROe, some of the previous designs and propulsion technologies that were considered, what place the ZEROe might occupy in the market, and the future of hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Development Of The Airbus ZEROe

The Airbus ZEROe project was launched in September 2020, with the goal of being in service by 2035. The ZEROe is billed as a hydrogen-powered, zero-carbon commercial aircraft that will help to decarbonize the aviation industry and will support airlines across the world with their ambitious sustainability goals.

Initially, the plan considered two primary options for hydrogen propulsion: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. Among the engines for the hydrogen combustion systems that were considered by Airbus were the turbofan and the turboprop. One of the options for the Airbus ZEROe also features a blended-wing body, which not only gives the aircraft a unique and unmistakable appearance, but also makes it more streamlined and able to fly more efficiently.

After extensive research and testing, hydrogen fuel cell technology was selected in 2025, with the European manufacturer turning away from the hydrogen combustion that had previously been favored. This choice was driven by the operational performance of hydrogen fuel cell technology, but does not rule out the future use of hydrogen combustion should it be deemed suitable.

Hydrogen fuel cell technology is very efficient, but generates a smaller amount of power compared to hydrogen combustion, therefore somewhat limiting the range of the Airbus ZEROe. When it comes to hydrogen combustion, the technology required is deemed easier to retrofit onto existing infrastructure and creates more power, but still produces some harmful emissions, albeit lower than those created by traditional jet fuel.

Water Is The Only Byproduct

The Airbus ZEROe features an electric propeller propulsion system that is powered by hydrogen fuel cells developed in partnership with ElringKlinger. These hydrogen fuel cells transform the hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction, which then, in turn, drives the propellers to create the movement needed to fly. Each of the aircraft's four propellers has its own hydrogen fuel cell stack.

Hydrogen fuel cell technology is not new, but there are currently none large enough to power an aircraft while maintaining a low enough weight to allow the aircraft itself to fly. The overwhelming positive hydrogen fuel cell technology is that this process only creates one byproduct: water. This means that as long as the hydrogen has been sourced in a sustainable manner, the process is completely carbon-neutral.

Airbus has also teamed up with MTU Aero Engines, signing a memorandum of understanding at the Paris Air Show in June 2025. MTU is one of the world's leading experts in aircraft engines, generating annual revenues in excess of $8.75 billion. The partnership aims to combine the expertise of Airbus and MTU, both leaders in their fields, to develop the most suitable plans for the ZEROe. The European manufacturer's Head of Future Programmes, Bruno Fichefeux, celebrated the agreement, saying:

“Our focus on fully electric fuel cell propulsion technology for future hydrogen-powered aircraft underscores our confidence and progress in this domain. Collaborating with MTU, a leader in engine manufacturing and innovation, is a perfect complement to our own advancements. This partnership will allow us to pool our collective knowledge, accelerate the maturation of critical technologies, and ultimately deliver a revolutionary hydrogen-powered propulsion system for future commercial aircraft. Together, we are not just imagining a sustainable future of flight, we are actively pioneering it.""

Greater Hydrogen Infrastructure Is Needed

The idea of a carbon-neutral, hydrogen-powered aircraft like the Airbus ZEROe sounds like an attractive option for many airlines. However, the fact remains that in order to facilitate the aircraft's entry into commercial service, the majority of airports around the world will need to completely overhaul their hydrogen infrastructure.

For example, hydrogen needs to be stored at temperatures as low as -253°C. This is currently impossible at many airfields, with a significant amount of technological investment still required to reach such temperatures on a regular and consistent basis.

In order for the hydrogen fuel cell technology onboard the Airbus ZEROe to be considered a carbon-neutral solution for aviation, the hydrogen used must be made from electrolysis using renewable energy. Currently, demand for this renewable hydrogen vastly exceeds the supply. For this reason, the hydrogen supply chain needs to be considered, covering all the lifecycle steps from production and liquefaction to transport and storage.

Airbus's 'Hydrogen Hubs At Airports' Program

That is why Airbus has launched its 'Hydrogen Hubs at Airports' program, which is working in partnership with more than 220 airports around the world, as well as multiple energy providers and airlines. In a statement, Airbus said:

“Hydrogen has the potential to be a transformative energy source for aviation. However, we recognize that developing a hydrogen ecosystem – including infrastructure, production, distribution and regulatory frameworks – is a huge challenge requiring global collaboration and investment.”

Airbus describes the program as a collaborative initiative that ""brings together airlines, airports, industry players, energy providers and technology specialists to address the key questions around producing, storing and distributing hydrogen."" Among the airlines currently involved in Airbus' Hydrogen Hubs at Airport program are:

Delta Air Lines .

Air New Zealand.

All Nippon Airways.

Korean Air.

Delays In The Development Of The Airbus ZEROe

Despite the concept coming to fruition in 2020, Airbus has since put the estimated delivery date of the first ZEROe aircraft back to 2035 at the earliest. The European manufacturer was previously testing technology on a modified Airbus A380 aircraft. However, this testing program has reportedly since been shut down, according to a report from Aerospace Testing International.

Apparent delays in the development of the technology needed to power the Airbus ZEROe have also been causing concern among some industry insiders, leading to questions about Airbus's ability to dominate in the future sustainable aircraft market. We will have to watch this space, with the coming months and years being crucial as several different manufacturers battle it out to produce hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft at scale.

Shifting Focus On Sustainable Aviation Fuel

With much skepticism surrounding the viability of programs like Airbus ZEROe hydrogen cell-powered aircraft, there are calls within the industry to focus efforts instead on Sustainable Aviation Fuel(SAF). These are already available and can be produced from various sustainable resources, including used cooking oil, agricultural and forestry waste.

Currently, sustainable aviation fuels are generally blended with conventional jet fuel so that they can be used in existing aircraft without the need for engine modifications. However, future investments may lead to the development of large-scale commercial aircraft capable of flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuels. Work will also need to be done to bring down the cost of such fuels, which currently put them out of reach of many operators worldwide.

Has Airbus Unlocked The Aircraft Of The Future?

Iconic aircraft such as the Airbus A380and modern, fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft such as the A350 are among the most celebrated aircraft in the European manufacturer's catalog. As such, there is no denying that Airbus is leading the way when it comes to traditional aircraft powered by jet fuel. However, it remains to be seen whether Airbus can live up to its reputation when it comes to more sustainable initiatives such as the ZEROe program.

The idea certainly holds much potential, and if it comes off, it could well be a game-changer for an industry that is constantly looking at ways to become more sustainable and meet its ambitious net-zero targets. The Airbus ZEROe may well be the key to long-range, hydrogen-powered air travel, but before its planned entry into service in 2035, the global hydrogen supply chain and infrastructure will need to be overhauled in order to support the regular use of such technology.

ZeroAvia is another manufacturer hoping to get its slice of the pie. The UK-based manufacturer was founded in 2017, and hopes to develop a 9-19 seat aircraft with a range of up to 300 miles by the mid-2020s, scaling the aircraft up to accommodate 40-80 passengers by 2027, and ultimately creating a hydrogen-powered aircraft capable of carrying up to 100 passengers on flights of up to 1,000 miles in length by 2030.

ZeroAvia has been backed by several of the world's largest airlines, including United Airlines, and the manufacturer's first aircraft, known as the HyFlyer II, has so far completed several test flights. However, given the challenges that the global giant Airbus is facing, despite its impressive array of connections and industry experience, it remains to be seen how successful smaller manufacturers such as ZeroAvia will be in the face of such stiff competition.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/everything.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 14:56:12.022071

He also has vast experience within business transformation.
“Currently I use being the Chairman of the Finnish Business Council Singapore as leverage to brand myself, and secondly my company.
Attracting new members, he says is difficult: “Not that many Finnish companies come here and we have a few that have still not joined.
There are currently 14,000 European companies in Singapore.” Pasi recently toured some Johor facilities with the Finnish Business Council and came away impressed.","Pasi Haatainen, a long-term Singapore resident and also Finnish Business Council Singapore (FBC) Chairman since 2021, has since 2007 been based in the city-state as a senior business consultant. Because of these roles, Pasi naturally stays informed about key developments for business and trade. He also has vast experience within business transformation. In the wake of Covid-19 he paints a not so rosy picture for the business climate, while also giving examples about the impact from the large-scale arrival of AI (artificial intelligence). And in this time of particularly decisive disruptions and changes, Singapore as a hub is being impacted in various ways – now opening up for large-scale integration with the state of Johor. Get a Finnish executive’s top-of-mind insights and observations on these topics!

Pasi first arrived to Singapore in 2007, having been laid off during the Nokia–Siemens Networks merger in the U.S – enticed to come over by several friends living there.

“It took me one hour to set up a company here and get the bank account sorted, and then Nokia hired me back as a consultant.”

Working for them during two years was actually how his consultancy businesses started, explains Pasi.

“And, from then on, I’ve just worked out of Singapore with different multinationals as clients. I was in Pakistan, Russia, many northern European countries also, and for the last 14 – 15 years mainly in Southeast Asia.”

Two of Pasi’s clients were also Finnish companies; Taival (a boutique strategy firm) and Headlong Finland Oy (a small IT company), who both hired him as Head of Business Development.

“Unfortunately, we couldn’t gain enough traction in the market for either. Simultaneously I have been running my consultancy; mainly doing transformation programmes for clients.”

Another more recent client was the Japanese company Rakuten Mobile, where Pasi and other senior consultants were hired to establish its global headquarters in Singapore.

“I headed that – setting up the company, getting government grants and hiring people – which took place right when Covid-19 started.”

Transformation management in focus

Although Pasi spent many years at Nokia in telecom, he doesn’t specialize in any single sector, applying his transformation expertise across multiple industries. Today, with his consulting firm Dationic (rebranded from Dynamic Business Consulting) his expert services focus on strategic planning, sales development, and digital transformation programmes and other services.

“We believe that short-term efforts can yield long-term benefits – which is essentially our approach with clients.”

As an MSc-qualified Transformation Leader with over twenty years of experience he drives such large-scale business programmes and change initiatives.

“I’ve deliberately not limited myself to one industry. I’ve been doing consulting, specialising purely on transformation management. So, big MNCs and application rollouts in different business domains such as telecom, insurance, banking, mining, and a coffee business. And that doesn’t really matter because when you talk about change management it’s mainly about people and the organisation, as well as technology and processes. I get more crystallized on the added value of the services. Of course, if a customer asks specifically for other assistance I can also consider,” Pasi explains.

“Usually, companies hire me to manage their big programmes, and in a few of those cases they were suffering for whatever reason and brought me in to get things back on track. Oftentimes they also hire me to manage their vendors, as they prefer someone independent for that. If they use any large consulting company, it will definitely sell them more than is actually needed. The customers’ problem is that they don’t always know the pitfalls and terms – and should definitely have a well-defined and fair contract. For a lot of the transformation and change problems corporations use external resources that they don’t have inhouse. Then, they ought to start with analysing the vendor contract(s),” adds the Finn. “I help them to define the new contracts and do vendor analysis as well, as an easy, fast-fix.”

His clients are mainly European, American, Indonesian or Filipino – who are more inclined to use independent consultants.

Nothing has changed

Digital transformation and AI are also unavoidable topics, since they connect strongly to Pasi’s services: “Nobody talked about ‘digital’ fifteen years ago; it was just a change programme, maybe ‘transformation’- or ‘process re-engineering’ programmes. Now, everything’s digital, but nothing has changed concerning that it’s all about the people, processes and technology. So, get back to basics!”

“A lot of times, companies start off with changing some technology, whatever that may be. But it always comes back to that you have to change people’s behaviour and the organisation. Then technology also follows through; that’s the easy part! People and processes are absolutely the most difficult ones to change! Ultimately, even with all the new digital tools, transformation success hinges on those. You can introduce cutting-edge tech, but if the team isn’t on board and processes aren’t aligned, it won’t stick – because nobody really wants to change!”

“Usually, you have to have a well-defined strategy, and then the transformation is what drives that through. And people think that everything’s transformational, when it’s actually normal operational excellence. Real transformation is about growth, innovative concepts and doing something new; that’s usually when transformation programmes come into play,” he elaborates.

“In the Nordics we conducted large transformation programmes already in the 1990s, while in Asia a lot of companies are still struggling to do the same! Out here businesses have been very labour-intensive, and now they are beginning to realise that they can no longer compete just based on hiring more and more people; hence these kinds of digital transformation efforts – of which the majority always fail!”

Golden era for consultants

Meanwhile, the ‘digitalisation’ trend has led to a lot more consultancy work over all. Accenture, for instance, employs approximately 774,000 people worldwide. But that escalating need for management consultants is fast coming to an end and will likely go into reverse, leading to redundancies.

“With the arrival of AI this will now turn around, so 50% or more of those are probably going to be laid off in next five years!” believes Pasi.

Having scores of consultants spending endless hour on producing and polishing power points will no longer be needed with generative AI.

“For me, as a self-employed, AI is a blessing; one that levels the playing field. Now I can effortlessly produce research papers, and use cases for customers – regardless of what it is. And a lot of times the customers doesn’t realise what their current problems are and what their competitors are doing – lacking the research capabilities. And with AI LLM models customers can do it by themselves as well – or use people like me.”

“In other words, one experienced consultant equipped can with AI do what it used to require a whole team of juniors to accomplish. That’s why I believe we’ll see a golden era for senior advisors – companies will seek out veterans who can ‘jump onto a moving train and fix things immediately’, rather than paying for big teams of analysts. So, from that point of view, I’m kind of optimistic, and that more and more the customers will want immediate value, rather than the kind of transformation we were focusing on five years ago.”

“But at the same time, it’s tougher. Right now, the main problem in the business climate – and this is not limited to the consulting area – is that it’s very difficult to get new contracts signed.”

Pasi observes that, across industries, decision-makers are hesitating to commit to new projects because of geopolitical and economic uncertainties – hence the delaying mentality that slows down deal-making.

Joining forces with EuroCham

Overall, getting new customers for Pasi happens through networking.

“Currently I use being the Chairman of the Finnish Business Council Singapore as leverage to brand myself, and secondly my company. People mainly buy from people, not from the company.”

He notes that LinkedIn is “by far the best marketing tool for independent consultants” – a platform he leverages to build his personal and company brand (though he admits he could utilise it even more).

Pasi is also a board member of EuroCham as the FBC representative.

“FBC just rejoined as member and want to combine forces with EuroCham and do a lot of events, which I think is going to give more opportunities for Finnish companies to network and to get a bigger audience. I think that might give more value for Finnish B2B and B2C members as well. Events are a lot of times based on what’s in demand of that year. Sustainability was still a hot topic last year but has now cooled down. There was maybe too much hype around it and too many events. Now of course AI is still big, and it’s all about the quality of what is presented.”

Post Covid-19, events fatigue has also set in: “People went to so many physical events that they got tired of that too. Also, people work more from home these days and, consequently, go out less. Recently, we got more requests to just arrange networking events without any specific topic. So, we’ve had a whisky tasting and will have one for champagne! We also arrange company visits, as part of accommodating as much as possible what the members want.”

FBC members and Finland friends can also look forward to a big party later in the year, namely the 40th anniversary of the council’s establishment. “We will end this celebration year with a bang!” promises its chairman.

Attracting new members, he says is difficult: “Not that many Finnish companies come here and we have a few that have still not joined. I think one of the reasons is that you can easily find a lot of information by yourself in Singapore. And it’s an extremely social place: there are a lot of networking opportunities, compared to say Shanghai. Also, in my opinion, once outside Finland, Finns think they can handle things on their own.”

One way to try to entice Finnish companies to Singapore are the incentives offered for setting up headquarters there – regional or even global!

“Right now, the Singapore government offers businesses from overseas a big promotion. Put the regional or global headquarter here, and you’ll get a lot of different grants and tax incentives. And if you want to put your global headquarters here, the Singapore government will love you! At FBC we are not driving this, but we accommodate and share knowledge as much as possible.”

“Nightingale, a Finnish Health tech company put their regional headquarters here,” Pasi exemplifies.

Costs a major hindrance

Something undisputable is that Singapore is a hub for international trade and a gateway to Asia, with extensive trade networks and strategic maritime location. But despite foreign investor confidence in Singapore (with its may FTAs, cross-border investment facilitation and protection for foreign investors’ rights) there is crucial difference compared to before, and by no means any small matter. In 2025, the increased costs of living, and other challenges relating to Singapore and running a business there have become, to quote Pasi, a “major hindrance”.

“Rents have gone up on average between 50 – 100%, so this has hit really hard in the wake of Covid. And I don’t know how sustainable this is. The rents for individuals or household rents have continued going up insanely high. And over 3,000 F&B outlets closed down in 2024 alone!

I think Singapore will suffer, and I can through EuroCham confirm that many from various national business groups share this view.”

“Also, we have hard times getting highly skilled people in here because the spouse can’t easily get a work permit, while in Malaysia and Thailand you can.”

Overall, my view is that Singapore needs to address these cost- and talent issues or it could risk losing some appeal. And, actually, Hong Kong is now looking more attractive again. I have friends working there who say that their rents are lower, while salaries are higher. Cars cost one-third or one-fifth of the price here! And currently they don’t have enough skilled foreigners either.”

Moving production across the channel

For Singapore there are two clear paths emerging in 2025. “I meet a lot of people throughout the year who are about to set up their company and considering Singapore for global headquarters, especially digital mobile-only companies and based on Shopify. Mainly they give taxation as reason and that the people they hire are working from home all around the world and not in Singapore. So, putting the headquarters here is less about the people,” says Pasi. “And even Singapore is recognising that.”

Enter ‘JS-SEC’, the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (launched in January) – an agreement for strengthening Johor and Singapore to jointly compete for global investments

by improving cross-border goods connectivity, enabling freer movement of people, and strengthening the business ecosystem within the region. JS-SEC’ is intended to supercharge cross-border investment, enhance supply chains and foster a Singapore–Johor economic corridor.

“Singapore is actively encouraging companies to headquarter here while placing operations in Johor to take advantage of cross-border efficiencies. There are currently 14,000 European companies in Singapore.”

Pasi recently toured some Johor facilities with the Finnish Business Council and came away impressed. ‘They’re really heavily pushing the Johor economic zone everywhere,’ he says, noting that it’s a strategy for Singapore to remain attractive despite rising costs.",https://scandasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pasi-Haatainen.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 12:56:11.815399

Leading this new chapter is Boom Supersonic, an ambitious American aerospace company developing a next-generation aircraft called the Overture. Designed to fly at twice the speed of today’s airliners, the Overture promises to revolutionize air travel. In our article, we will analyze everything we know about Boom’s Overture as of July 2025, covering its origins, technology, test flights, airline interest, public opinion, and the future of supersonic flight.

Boom Supersonic's vision is not merely to build a faster airplane, but to create a sustainable and commercially viable one. The manufacturer promises speeds of up to Mach 1.7, a sleek design focused on the passenger experience, and the use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Overture aims to make a bold attempt to reintroduce supersonic travel in a responsible and scalable manner. But as with all high-flying ambitions, it comes with its share of challenges, questions, and remarkable milestones.

The Birth Of Boom Supersonic And The Overture Project

Boom Supersonic was founded in 2014 by Blake Scholl, a former Amazon executive with a passion for fast travel and aviation innovation. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, the company began with a bold goal: to make supersonic commercial flight economically viable and environmentally responsible. The company managed to raise more than $600 million from 53 investors, including companies and private individuals, as well as a special grant from the US Air Force, as reported by Crunchbase. Boom has steadily built momentum toward its flagship aircraft, the Overture.

According to the official Boom Supersonic website, the Overture is designed to fly at Mach 1.7, which is twice the speed of current subsonic airliners, and the plane can carry between 60 and 80 passengers over a range of 4,250 nautical miles (or 7,871 Km). Boom plans to focus first on transoceanic routes, such as New York to London or Tokyo to Seattle, as these are the routes where the sonic boom will have the least impact on populated areas. The aircraft's design incorporates four engines, a delta wing, and a fuselage optimized for aerodynamic efficiency.

As mentioned on the Boom Supersonic website, in 1973, FAA regulation 14 CFR 91.817 prohibited all supersonic flight over land in the US until June 6, 2025, when President Donald Trump issued and signed an executive order entitled “Leading the World in Supersonic Flight,” lifting the 52-year ban on supersonic flight over the US. This is good news for pioneering supersonic companies such as Boom Supersonic, as the company can conduct test flights over the mainland and, in the future, offer supersonic domestic flights on routes like New York to Los Angeles.

The XB-1 Demonstrator: Supersonic Testing Begins

Before committing to full-scale production of the Overture, Boom has been developing and flight-testing the XB-1, a one-third-scale supersonic demonstrator. This jet is crucial for validating the aerodynamic design, materials, and propulsion systems planned for Overture. The XB-1 took its first flight on March 22, 2024, at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California. It has also become the first civil aircraft to go supersonic over the continental United States.

To date, XB-1 has completed at least 13 test flights as of July 2025, including its first supersonic flight (Mach 1.1) on January 28, 2025. These tests have validated key design features, including laminar flow over the fuselage and wings, stability at high speeds, and structural integrity under various flight conditions. The data collected from these flights is being directly fed into the development of the Overture and can be accessed here.

NASA also captured the XB-1 using Schlieren photography, revealing clearly defined shock waves (insert video from above) around the aircraft during flight. This not only serves as a powerful demonstration of supersonic travel but also supports Boom's ongoing research into ""boomless cruise,"" where aircraft might fly at speeds that minimize or eliminate the sonic boom on the ground. The entire process is described in detail by Space.com.

Cutting-Edge Technology Inside Overture

Overture’s performance hinges on advanced technologies, including a carbon-composite airframe for weight savings and a delta-gull wing for supersonic efficiency. The heart of any supersonic aircraft is its propulsion system, and Boom's solution is the next-generation turbofan Symphony engine.

Unlike Concorde's thirsty Olympus turbojets, Symphony is a medium-bypass turbofan developed in collaboration with Florida Turbine Technologies, GE Additive, and StandardAero, the latter of which will assemble the powerful jet engines at their site in San Antonio, TX. It promises 35,000 pounds of thrust, optimized for Mach 1.7 flight without the need for afterburners, which is a significant leap in efficiency.

Another important feature we have mentioned above is an advanced noise design principle, known as “boomless cruise” and aerodynamic shaping, which aims to minimize sonic-boom impact. Combined with over-water supersonic operation, these efforts address the regulatory and environmental constraints that hindered earlier SST efforts.

The Overture will also operate entirely on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and its design incorporates advanced carbon composite materials to minimize weight. The engines are also expected to meet the ICAO Chapter 14 noise levels, making them suitable for more airports worldwide. Boom anticipates beginning Symphony engine testing in 2026, with flight-ready units prepared for Overture's certification program.

Boom's engineering team has focused heavily on ensuring low-drag performance, safe flutter behavior, and material durability at supersonic speeds. Lessons from XB-1 testing are being applied to fine-tune these systems. For instance, the nose droop mechanism, a Concorde-era feature designed for improved landing visibility, is now being modernized with camera systems on the Overture.

Airline Interest: Orders, Partnerships, And Strategic Vision

The Boom project has attracted interest from several major airlines. American Airlines signed a deal for 20 Overture aircraft, with options for 40 more, and placed a non-refundable deposit to secure their order. United Airlines also signed a contract for 15 aircraft with options for 35 more, while Japan Airlines holds pre-orders for 20 units. In total, Boom reports over 130 aircraft in its order backlog.

The strategic vision behind these orders is to reclaim long-haul premium business routes. For instance, an Overture could cut transatlantic flight times in half, making the journey from New York to London a 3.5-hour trip, similar to the flight time during the golden era of Concorde flights. Airlines anticipate using these jets on high-margin routes where passengers value time saved over ticket cost, suggesting that the Overture will initially cater to business and premium-class travelers.

Boom has also signed a defense-focused partnership with Northrop Grumman to explore military variants of the Overture, possibly for rapid personnel transport. Key suppliers include Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Safran Landing Systems, reflecting a Boeing-style global supply chain.

Public Opinions And Industry Skepticism

As with any ambitious aviation project, opinions from the public and industry are mixed. On Reddit’s r/aviation, many users express enthusiasm for the return of supersonic flight, noting XB-1’s real flight data as a sign of serious progress. Others remain skeptical, raising concerns about funding, timelines, and challenges with certification.

Some aviation experts argue that while Boom is making measurable progress, the challenge of building and certifying a supersonic airliner by 2029 remains enormous. Developing an engine like Symphony without a major OEM (original equipment manufacturer), such as Rolls-Royce or GE, as the lead partner is viewed as especially risky and subsequently, lengthy. Even so, Boom's transparent communications and frequent test updates have earned it more credibility than earlier supersonic startups.

Still, concerns persist about sonic boom regulations, airport compatibility, and economic viability. Community sentiment reflects cautious optimism, with many noting that even if Boom misses its target, it has revived serious interest in supersonic travel and pushed regulators and manufacturers to re-examine the category.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Supersonic Air Travel

What lies ahead for Boom Supersonic and the future of fast travel? If all goes according to plan, Boom expects the Overture to be flying passengers by 2030. FAA and EASA certification processes will be a major milestone, with Symphony engine testing set to begin in 2026. Flight testing of the full-scale Overture aircraft is expected by 2027, followed by customer deliveries a couple of years later, as stated by the BBC.

Beyond Boom, other companies like NASA and Lockheed Martin (with the X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology project) are also pursuing quieter and more efficient supersonic concepts. Meanwhile, regulatory frameworks around sonic booms are evolving, with studies underway to permit supersonic overland flight under strict noise limits.

Boom's legacy may not hinge solely on flying at Mach 1.7, but rather on making supersonic flight desirable and viable for the 21st century. From factory floor to final approach, Boom Supersonic is positioning itself at the forefront of the next aviation revolution, and the world is watching.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/the-boom-overture-supersonic-aircraft-everything-we-know-so-far-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 12:56:16.974117

These include the uncertainties surrounding the impending U.S tariffs and the viability of low cost carrier models upon the exit of Qantas’ owned Jetstar. He also heavily criticised the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

U.S. tariffs may cause airlines to refuse delivery of aircraft

Airlines may be reluctant to take delivery of aircraft due to the ongoing uncertainty around U.S. tariffs and their impact on the cost of the planes, Walsh said, as reported by Reuters.

“It’s not just going to be a major Boeing and Airbus issue. It’ll impact all aspects of the aerospace industry and have an impact on most, if not all, airlines as well,” he said.

The 50% tariff that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose on Brazilian exports starting in August could hammer the revenue of planemaker Embraer like the COVID-19 pandemic did, its CEO Francisco Gomes Neto, warned last week, flagging risks to U.S. partners.

Neto said the tariffs would amount to a trade embargo on the regional jets it supplies to U.S. airlines and could trigger order cancellations, deferred deliveries and tough consequences for Embraer’s U.S. suppliers.

EU’s green fuel mandate costly, not helping environment

IATA also stepped up criticism of the European Union’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies there remain low.

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” Walsh said.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel is expected to reach two million tonnes, or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel.

By IATA’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel”.

“The EU in effect has facilitated monopoly suppliers to increase prices with no environmental benefit,” said Walsh, adding that the region needs to re-evaluate its SAF targets.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a six per cent SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines, Reuters reported in June.

On the supply front, at least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production in 2025, targeting exports regionally and to Europe. Singapore is among key exporters of the green fuel to the EU.

Walsh also questioned the use of palm oil as a means to produce sustainable fuel.

“I think that you could argue there is sustainable palm oil and there is palm oil that wouldn’t be considered sustainable, and I think in some parts of the world there it’s too black and white,” Walsh said.

We need to have a much more “nuanced approach” to the usage of palm oil as a feedstock and “much more detailed assessment of the sustainability of the feedstock”, he added.

Low-cost carrier model remains viable, but may not work at every airport

The budget airline model is not dead, but it does not always work at every airport, said Walsh. He added that it probably does not make sense for budget carriers to operate at certain airports because of their nature or cost structure.

“Just because you see some low-cost airlines exiting the market, I don’t think you can read across that the business model is not relevant for the future,” he said. “I firmly believe it is and will continue to be. But it doesn’t always work at every airport. Airlines that are labelled budget or low-cost, that doesn’t necessarily guarantee their financial success.”

The viability of budget airlines at high-cost airports such as Changi Airport was thrust into the spotlight after Jetstar Asia said it was exiting Singapore at the end of July, flagging increased competition and operating costs as some push factors.

“Heathrow Airport is no different. For example, there’s no real low-cost operation at Heathrow, principally because of the cost of the airport and the access to slots.”

The airline industry is a highly competitive one, Walsh added. He pointed out that, although 408 new airlines were started in the past decade to December 2024, there were 420 failures as well, making a net loss of 12. Profitability on a global level is wafer-thin – the net profit margin this year is forecast at 3.7 per cent.

In the global fight against climate change, the aviation industry finds itself at a crossroads. While commercial air travel has connected the world like never before, it remains a significant source of carbon emissions. For an industry that relies on high-energy-density fuels to keep planes in the sky, the transition to sustainability presents unique challenges. But a potential solution is already here: sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil fuels, SAF is produced from renewable sources, drastically reducing carbon emissions while maintaining the same performance standards. Industry leaders and policymakers are increasingly looking to SAF as a cornerstone of aviation’s decarbonization strategy. But is it enough? And what will it take to make SAF the industry standard rather than an expensive niche product?

The Urgency: Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

Aviation currently accounts for about 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, a figure expected to rise as air travel demand grows. While other industries are transitioning to electrification, aircraft remain heavily dependent on liquid fuels due to their energy density and reliability.

SAF presents a compelling alternative. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The benefits extend beyond carbon reduction: SAF also produces fewer sulfur oxides and particulate matter, improving air quality around airports.

Beyond environmental concerns, SAF enhances energy security by diversifying fuel sources. Instead of relying on petroleum imports, countries can develop domestic SAF production, leveraging agricultural waste, industrial byproducts, and even captured CO₂.

What Is SAF Made From?

SAF isn’t a single product but rather a category of fuels derived from various sustainable sources. Unlike experimental energy solutions, SAF is already compatible with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure, making it a viable near-term solution.

Bio-Based SAF: Turning Waste into Jet Fuel

One of the primary pathways for SAF production involves biomass-based feedstocks. These sources range from waste oils to agricultural residues:

• Used Cooking Oil & Animal Fats: Waste oils from restaurants and animal processing industries can be refined into SAF. These are considered low-carbon-intensity sources since they repurpose existing waste.

• Lignocellulosic Biomass: Agricultural and forestry residues—such as wood chips, corn stover, and wheat straw—can be processed into SAF without competing with food production.

• Sugars & Starches: Although less common due to food security concerns, crops like sugarcane and corn can be converted into jet fuel through fermentation.

Synthetic Fuels: The Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Revolution

Beyond biomass, a more futuristic approach involves power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, also known as e-fuels. This method uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen, which is then combined with captured carbon dioxide to create a synthetic hydrocarbon fuel. If powered by wind, solar, or nuclear energy, PtL fuels could potentially achieve near-zero emissions.

Another promising pathway, alcohol-to-jet (AtJ), converts ethanol or butanol—produced from sustainable sources—into jet fuel. This technology is still emerging but could scale significantly as bioethanol production expands.

Challenges to Scaling Up SAF

Despite its promise, SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption today. Scaling up production remains one of the biggest hurdles.

1. Cost Barriers

SAF is currently two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. High production costs stem from the complexity of refining alternative feedstocks and the limited availability of processing infrastructure. Without strong incentives, airlines may struggle to justify the switch.

2. Production Bottlenecks

For SAF to become a mainstream fuel, production capacity must expand exponentially. A 2021 report by the World Economic Forum estimated that global SAF production must increase 1,000 times by 2050 to meet industry net-zero targets.

3. Sustainability & Certification

Not all SAF is created equal. Some biofuels, if not carefully sourced, can contribute to deforestation, water depletion, or competition with food supplies. To prevent unintended environmental consequences, stringent certification frameworks—such as those developed by CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation)—are crucial.

4. Policy & Incentives

Governments play a critical role in SAF adoption. Tax credits, fuel mandates, and direct subsidies can help bridge the cost gap. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a blender tax credit for SAF, while the European Union is moving toward mandating minimum SAF usage for flights departing from EU airports.

Where We Stand: The Future of SAF

Momentum for SAF is growing. Airlines, airports, and fuel producers are ramping up investments, and governments are enacting policies to accelerate adoption.

• Major airlines—including United, Delta, and British Airways—have pledged to increase SAF usage, with some setting targets as high as 10% SAF by 2030.

• Boeing and Airbus are testing aircraft on 100% SAF to pave the way for future approvals.

• Oil giants like Shell and BP are investing billions into SAF refineries, betting on long-term demand growth.

The road ahead remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: if aviation is to thrive in a carbon-constrained world, SAF must move from the fringes to the mainstream. Whether through policy, technological breakthroughs, or shifts in consumer behavior, the next decade will determine whether sustainable aviation fuel can truly take flight.",https://i0.wp.com/aviatealabama.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/create-a-high-resolution-highly-detailed-image-for-a-blog-post.png?fit=1024%2C768&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-20 13:56:09.179600

However, the city's ability to rebuild and adapt after extreme weather events has created unique investment opportunities in sectors like aviation and tourism. Recent typhoons—Super Typhoon Saola (2023), Typhoon Yagi (2024), and Typhoon Wipha (2025)—have tested Hong Kong's infrastructure and operational resilience, but also revealed a robust recovery framework. This article analyzes how these sectors rebound post-typhoon and why they represent compelling long-term investment prospects.

Aviation: A Model of Resilience and Innovation

The aviation sector in Hong Kong has demonstrated remarkable adaptability in post-typhoon recovery. The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is a prime example. During Typhoon Wipha in July 2025, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) activated contingency protocols, including emergency rest centres and AI-driven passenger flow analytics, to manage 100,000 stranded passengers. Despite the cancellation of 500 flights, operations resumed within 24 hours, with 400 flights resuming by the afternoon. This efficiency is underpinned by the Three Runway System (3RS), a HK$141.5 billion project scheduled for completion in 2024, which diversifies runway configurations and reduces single-point failure risks.

Technological innovations further bolster resilience. Cathay Pacific and the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) are accelerating adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which cuts lifecycle emissions by 80%. This aligns with global decarbonization trends, positioning the sector for regulatory and market-driven growth. HAECO, a key airport services provider, has also integrated solar PV systems and cooling paints to reduce energy dependency during outages.

Tourism: Rebounding Through Strategic Partnerships

The tourism sector, though more vulnerable to typhoon disruptions, has shown strong rebounds. For instance, after Typhoon Wipha, Hong Kong Disneyland and other attractions reopened swiftly, leveraging partnerships with local airlines to attract stranded passengers. The closure of 500 flights during Wipha created a temporary surge in demand for local tourism, with hotels and dining sectors reporting 15–20% revenue spikes in the following week.

Historical data reveals a pattern of recovery. After Super Typhoon Saola (2023), which caused HK$0.48 billion in damages, visitor numbers rebounded within six weeks, driven by discounted travel packages and promotional campaigns. The government's collaboration with airlines and tour operators to offer “post-typhoon deals” has become a standard practice, mitigating long-term economic impacts.

Lessons from Recent Typhoons

Comparing recovery timelines from 2023 to 2025 highlights a trend of increasing efficiency. For example:

- Super Typhoon Saola (2023): Full airport operations resumed within 36 hours; tourism sector recovered 90% of pre-typhoon revenue in 60 days.

- Typhoon Yagi (2024): 48-hour recovery timeline; tourism rebounds accelerated by 30% compared to 2023.

- Typhoon Wipha (2025): 24-hour recovery; tourism revenue rebounded to 95% of pre-typhoon levels within 21 days.

This improvement is attributed to enhanced infrastructure, digital tools, and policy coordination. The AAHK's use of AI-driven weather forecasting and real-time passenger analytics has reduced recovery costs by an estimated 12% annually.

Investment Thesis: A Dual-Track Approach

Aviation Infrastructure Plays:

Hong Kong Airport Authority (0014.HK): The 3RS project ensures long-term capacity growth and operational redundancy. Its stock has outperformed regional peers by 8% annually since 2023.

Cathay Pacific (0293.HK): Adoption of SAF and partnerships with HKSAFC position it as a leader in sustainable aviation. Its post-typhoon recovery performance has historically outpaced competitors.

Tourism-Linked Sectors:

Hotel Chains and Leisure Operators: Companies like Hotel Chain A and Disney Resort Operators benefit from post-typhoon demand spikes and government-led promotional campaigns.

Local Restaurants and Retailers: Quick-service chains and duty-free stores see a 20–30% revenue boost post-typhoon due to stranded passenger spending.

Risks and Mitigation

While the investment case is strong, risks include climate volatility and regulatory changes. However, Hong Kong's proactive approach—such as the HK$141.5 billion 3RS project and SAF adoption—mitigates these concerns. Diversifying across aviation and tourism assets also reduces sector-specific exposure.

Conclusion

Hong Kong's aviation and tourism sectors exemplify how strategic infrastructure, technology, and policy coordination can transform typhoon-related disruptions into opportunities. For investors, these sectors offer not only resilience but also alignment with global trends in sustainability and digital transformation. As typhoon frequency rises, the ability to recover swiftly and profitably will become a critical differentiator—making Hong Kong's post-typhoon rebound a compelling long-term investment theme.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 10:56:49.942344

A new Channel 5 documentary, Lip-Reading The Royals: The Secret Conversations, which aired last night, featured a forensic lip reader analysing a charming family moment from last year's Trooping the Colour.

On Saturday, June 14, the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with their three children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, joined King Charles and Queen Camilla on the Buckingham Palace balcony to witness a flypast by the Red Arrows.

However, lip reader Nicola Hickling provided insight into how William issued a fatherly order to his children as they observed the spectacle. It appears that George was also struck by something slightly closer to Earth.

Nicola suggests that William instructs his children: ""Eyes up to the sky."" Following this, all three look upwards, before George turns to his father and remarks: ""The crowd is so loud.""

She further noted that a gesture made by Louis indicated he had spotted a propeller, prompting George to ask: ""Where?"" Subsequently, Kate asked her youngest: 'Wow, did you enjoy that?""

Cristo Foufas, a royal analyst, said: ""Kate and William immediately go into mum and dad mode then. 'Can you see it? Oh, they're coming around again', you know, 'Did you enjoy it?' All of those sorts of things they're saying to make it a special moment for their children.""

He claimed that the couple must have seen a ""million flypasts"" and that the displays were likely as ""dull as ditch water"" to them by now, but William and Kate weren't ""letting that get to them"".

Cristo added that the future King and Queen were ""making themselves enthusiastic"" about it and attempting to make the proceedings ""really special"" for their children.

Trooping the Colour has celebrated the official birthday of the British monarch for over 260 years, with more than 1,400 soldiers, 200 horses, and 400 musicians coming together annually for the ceremony.

This year's event, which showcased the traditional pageantry, saw Charles and Camilla participating in a carriage procession down the Mall towards Horse Guards Parade, according to BBC reports.

At Charles's behest, the Royals donned black armbands to honour the victims of the Air India crash, which sadly resulted in the loss of 241 passengers and crew, along with at least eight individuals on the ground.

In a nod to sustainability, the Red Arrows used a greener fuel for the 2025 display, comprising sustainable aviation fuel and biofuel, creating the iconic coloured trail.

Selama ini, kebutuhan energi untuk kehidupan dilayani oleh bahan bakar fosil selama lebih dari 100 tahun. Namun, bahan bakar ini akan habis cadangannya dan dapat berdampak bagi lingkungan, di antaranya global warming dan climate change. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan bahan bakar atau energi alternatif yang dapat menjamin kehidupan berkelanjutan.

Diperkirakan porsi energi primer fosil terutama batubara mencapai di atas 40%, sedangkan energi primer nonfosil, yaitu energi terbarukan dan energi baru, dari segi bioenergi dan biofuel diharapkan di atas 60%.

Hal yang mendasari penelitian ini salah satunya karena sektor pembangkit listrik, transportasi, dan industri berperan utama dalam emisi CO2. Beliau mengembangkan Model Sistem Pengelolaan Energi yang menjaga tiga pilar, yakni ekonomi, sosial, dan lingkungan. Sistem ini menggunakan milestone ekonomi dengan PDB/kapita memenuhi target 2045, lingkungan dengan emisi CO2 memenuhi target 2050, dan milestone sosial berupa lapangan kerja sektor energi diharapkan meningkat.

ITB melakukan kolaborasi bersama PT. Pamapersada Nusantara dalam pengembangan teknologi peningkatan kualitas batubara (Coal Upgrading Technology, CUT) dan pembangunan pabrik percobaannya (Pilot Plant).

Strategic Expansion and Market Relevance

This new route signifies VietJet Thailand’s continued strategic expansion in the Indian market, following earlier services connecting Mumbai to Bangkok and Phuket. Kolkata stands as an essential gateway for travel between eastern India and Thailand, ranking third behind Delhi and Mumbai in terms of passenger volume to Bangkok.

The introduction of Thai VietJet Air as a budget airline on this route is expected to increase competition, potentially driving airfare reductions and providing passengers with more travel options. This addition aligns with the growing trend of low-cost carriers (LCCs) expanding their reach beyond traditional domestic markets into more extensive international routes.

Impact on Global Travel and Aviation

The launch of Bangkok–Kolkata flights underscores a larger global aviation trend where budget carriers actively expand their footprints in strategically important routes. Such expansions exert competitive pressure on traditional, full-service airlines, pushing them to either lower fares or improve their service offerings.

Moreover, VietJet Thailand’s new flights are likely to stimulate increased passenger traffic between Thailand and India. Both nations have significant cultural and commercial ties, and easier travel access could further enhance tourism, business interactions, educational exchanges, and healthcare tourism.

Enhancing Regional Connectivity

Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok’s primary international hub, saw over 50 million passengers in recent years, driven by expanded infrastructure such as a third runway and additional terminal facilities. The Kolkata route enhances Bangkok’s position as a vital connection hub in Southeast Asia, providing travelers with improved regional connectivity to neighboring countries.

,,2025-07-20 07:01:57+00:00,Simple Flying,Why Did Boeing Build The 777X With The Longest Wings Ever On A Twinjet?,Luke Diaz,,,,,https://simpleflying.com/why-boeing-build-777x-longest-wingspan/,"The result of those giant wings, per Boeing, is a claimed 10% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to the Airbus A350-1000.
The wing’s higher aspect ratio is the key to the improved aerodynamics, but the folding wingtips are what make that possible.
Unlike the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, whose folding wings have an actuating system made by Moog Aerospace, the mechanism in the 777X will be provided by Liebherr Aerospace.
The 777X Has Uniquely Bird-Like Wings Inspired by birds, the new wings were designed to allow the giant twinjet to glide through the air with unparalleled efficiency.
The distinctive curved form happens as the 777X wing flexes under load.","Boeing’s highly anticipated next-generation widebody, the 777X, has made headlines for its stunning curved wing form with a span of 235 feet (71.8 meters) that beats even the gigantic 747 and Lockheed C-5 Galaxy by 10 feet (3 meters). On top of the sheer length of the highly flexible wings, the one-of-a-kind folding wingtips are something that has never been seen before in commercial aviation.

The Liebherr Aerospace folding mechanisms allowed the 777X to add 11 feet of wing on both sides without shattering the footprint it will maneuver in on the ground at airports around the world. The 777-9 is the longer of the two models currently undergoing testing and certification. It will also be the longest passenger jet ever produced once it is ready for service: at 251 feet (76.7 meters) in length, this makes it longer than both the 747-8 and the Airbus A380.

Even with its massive proportions, the innovative new design allows it to be the most efficient widebody in history. The result of those giant wings, per Boeing, is a claimed 10% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to the Airbus A350-1000. With that in mind, let’s dive into the design and engineering behind the aerodynamics, materials, and other exceptional engineering that produced the marvel that is the 777X.

A Next-Generation Widebody

The Boeing777X will not only have a much larger wingspan and longer fuselage than its predecessor, but it will also have a more spacious, comfortable, and modern cabin with larger windows as well. The advanced composite construction of the jet saves weight and adds strength to make it not only more fuel efficient but capable of hauling more cargo and more passengers while flying further than anything else in its class.

The gigantic General Electric GE9X turbofans that will power the largest widebody twinjet in aviation history, the 777-9, are also the biggest engines ever fitted to a commercial plane. The 777X series will make a list of firsts in the history of flying when it becomes fully operational.

The era of double-decker,quadjets is over, following the shuttering of Airbus A380 production in 2021 and Boeing 747 production in 2023. Only a handful of 747s remain in operation, with newer models primarily serving cargo operators, and the largest operator of A380s in the world, Emirates, is currently refurbishing as many of the giants as it can.

The future of ultra-long-haul flying and massive commercial jets will rest firmly on the shoulders of the 777X series alongside its competitor, the A350 family. These giant twinjets will also be good for the environment as they produce far fewer emissions than quadjets. Looking to the future, ICAO notes that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is also in the works by both Airbus and Boeing, promising a cleaner and better flying industry for all.

It All Comes Down To The Wingspan

By generating more lift with reduced drag, the 777X's extended wingspan improves aerodynamic efficiency and lowers fuel consumption. The wing’s higher aspect ratio is the key to the improved aerodynamics, but the folding wingtips are what make that possible. The engine cowlings that surround its massive GE9X engines under the wings have also been designed for laminar airflow to complement the new and improved wing shape.

Scott Fancher, the Vice President and General Manager of Airplane Development at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said after announcing the 777X at the 2013 Dubai Air Show (per Boeing) that:

""The 777X builds on the heritage of the 777-300ER and incorporates many advanced technologies designed for the 787 to create a new standard for widebody airplanes. It will truly be a worthy successor to the 777-300ER.""

After the destruction of the Antonov AN-225 'Mriya' in Ukraine by Russian air attacks, the only planes left in the world that beat the 777X in size are the Airbus A380 and the Stratolaunch Roc. The Roc has an incredible 385 feet (117 meters) total span, and owing to its special mission of air launching space vehicles, it is the largest plane ever built by exterior dimensions.

The Roc, however, won’t be flying any passengers around, so, with the A380 at just under 262 feet (80 meters) wide, the 777X will be the second widest of all commercial jets. According to a report by the Air Current, Boeing claims the longer total wing length is 3% more fuel efficient than a similar design with a winglet instead of the folding tip. The wingtips are almost completely made of carbon fiber, as is much of the total wing structure.

The First Of Its Kind: Examining The 777X's Folding Wings

The additional 22 feet (7 meters) of wingspan provided by the wingtips is largely how the 777X attains 10% lower fuel burn than older 777s and the A350. The 777X becomes a Category E aircraft when the wingtips are folded down. Since the majority of the world's major airports are Category E airports, especially legacy 777 hubs, it is essential for the carriers that will operate them to retain access to the same airport infrastructure, including runways, taxiways, and terminals.

Boeing has a lot of experience with folding wings thanks to the US military, but no commercial aircraft in the world has ever been outfitted with such a device. The folding wingtip will bring one of the most radical visual changes to commercial flying in years, as passengers watch the action of the tips folding down and locking in position before takeoff, or folding up on landing.

Safety is paramount, and failure of the wingtips to fold will ground the 777X, so reliability is essential. Unlike the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, whose folding wings have an actuating system made by Moog Aerospace, the mechanism in the 777X will be provided by Liebherr Aerospace. Liebherr is a 75-year-old German-Swiss company and one of Europe’s largest industrial equipment manufacturers across several industries, as well as the first in the world to develop a leading-edge actuation system for commercial aviation.

The wings begin to fold automatically once the huge jet’s ground speed broaches the 50 knot threshold during landing. Boeing inspected over 400 airports to confirm that the 20-second folding time would be sufficient to allow for rapid taxiway exits and smooth ground operations. The new avionics, which are all glass like the 787 Dreamliner, feature a specific display that indicates the position, transition, and status of the wingtips to pilots. The full system is a groundbreaking change to airliner technology.

The 777X Has Uniquely Bird-Like Wings

Inspired by birds, the new wings were designed to allow the giant twinjet to glide through the air with unparalleled efficiency. The wings can bend up to 26 feet from their resting neutral position in flight, which dramatically improves lift and efficient airflow. The distinctive curved form happens as the 777X wing flexes under load.

Dubbed the 'unconstrained wing,' the unique aerodynamic qualities of these huge wings are how the aircraft achieves its top-of-class fuel efficiency and range. The wing design’s higher lift-to-drag ratio, aspect ratio is 10:1 compared to the legacy 777’s 9:1 ratio. That is a longer and narrower wing shape by 10% overall, which is optimal for cruising with the lowest fuel consumption.

The strong yet pliable wing area also increased by roughly 15% in comparison to its predecessor, from 4,702 to 5,562 square feet (436.8 to 516.7 square meters). Not only are the wings larger, stronger, and more aerodynamic they can also store more fuel. The 777X tank capacity can hold up to 350,410 pounds (158,943 kilograms), compared to the 777 at 320,863 lbs (145,541 kilograms). Across the board, the metrics represent a ~10% improvement in many side-by-side comparisons to the outgoing 777 series.

That epic wing flexibility, along with the other enhancements, is thanks to advanced composite materials that are stronger than any of its widebody predecessors. Incredible carbon fiber composites are responsible for the realization of the advanced wing design. We can only hope that the 777X program will reach production soon, and these amazing aircraft will be seen with their folded wingtips on the ramps of airports all around the world.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/length.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 03:56:11.200755

Come potrebbero cambiare i viaggi",Federica Petrucci,,,,,https://quifinanza.it/lifestyle/travel-economy/crisi-carburante-aereo-effetto-prezzi-voli/920335/,"La domanda di carburante aereo sta rallentando a livello globale.

Una frenata che potrebbe sembrare una buona notizia per i viaggiatori italiani, perché suggerisce minori costi per le compagnie aeree e quindi – almeno in teoria – biglietti meno cari.

Ma la realtà, come spesso accade, è ben più sfaccettata. E quella che potrebbe diventare una conclusione logica in realtà è un interrogativo. Una domanda da porsi, cioè: assisteremo a un calo dei prezzi o a una riduzione dell’offerta? In altre parole, viaggeremo di più spendendo meno, o voleremo meno perché le tratte diminuiranno?

Cosa sta succedendo al mercato del carburante aereo

Secondo l’ultima analisi condotta da Reuters, la domanda globale di jet fuel è destinata a rimanere sotto i livelli pre-pandemia almeno fino al 2026, a causa di tre fattori principali: il calo dei viaggiatori cinesi all’estero, le politiche restrittive sull’immigrazione negli Stati Uniti e l’efficienza crescente dei nuovi aerei.

In particolare, la Cina – seconda economia del pianeta – continua a puntare sul turismo interno, dopo un periodo prolungato di chiusure e timori legati alla pandemia. I viaggi internazionali dei cittadini cinesi, che rappresentavano una quota importante della domanda di voli long-haul (a lungo raggio), sono ancora ben lontani dai numeri del 2019. Le compagnie aeree internazionali stanno dunque riducendo l’offerta verso il mercato cinese, con ripercussioni dirette anche sull’equilibrio complessivo della domanda di carburante aereo.

Nel frattempo, negli Stati Uniti, le politiche migratorie sempre più stringenti volute dall’amministrazione Trump scoraggiano i turisti stranieri, soprattutto quelli europei. Secondo BMI, società del gruppo Fitch, nel 2025 si prevede un calo del 16,3% degli arrivi internazionali negli USA. E i dati Cirium evidenziano già un -1,2% dei passeggeri britannici diretti oltreoceano rispetto al 2024.

Il paradosso dei carburanti: meno voli, ma più efficienza

Al rallentamento della domanda si aggiunge un altro fattore strutturale, ovvero l’innovazione tecnologica nei velivoli. I nuovi modelli di aerei sono infatti molto più efficienti dal punto di vista energetico. L’A320neo di Airbus, introdotto negli anni 2010, ha ridotto del 15% il consumo di carburante rispetto alla generazione precedente. Boeing non è da meno, con il 737 Max che offre un risparmio analogo. E per il futuro, Airbus promette un aereo ancora più performante, in grado di tagliare i consumi del 20-30% rispetto alla linea attuale, anche se l’entrata in servizio è prevista tra 10-15 anni.

Questo significa che anche se i voli non diminuiscono drasticamente, la quantità di carburante utilizzato per trasportare lo stesso numero di passeggeri cala sensibilmente. Di conseguenza, la domanda di jet fuel si raffredda, influenzando l’intero comparto petrolifero. Non a caso, il carburante per aerei pesa per circa il 7% sulla domanda globale di petrolio, e una sua contrazione può contribuire ad allentare la pressione sui prezzi del greggio.

Prezzi dei voli davvero in calo?

Per i consumatori italiani, la speranza è che un minor costo del carburante si traduca in tariffe aeree più basse. Tuttavia, questa equazione non è affatto automatica. Infatti, mentre l’efficienza dei mezzi e il calo della domanda potrebbero ridurre i costi operativi delle compagnie, altri fattori potrebbero controbilanciare questo effetto.

In primis, è probabile che di fronte a un calo dei profitti (per l’abbassamento dei prezzi) le compagnie optino per la riduzione delle tratte. Se alcune destinazioni, specialmente long-haul, diventano meno redditizie per le compagnie (soprattutto in assenza dei turisti cinesi o statunitensi), potrebbero essere cancellate o operate con minore frequenza. Il risultato? Meno concorrenza e, quindi, prezzi stabili o persino in aumento su alcune rotte.

Secondariamente, le compagnie aeree si trovano ad affrontare un contesto macroeconomico incerto, tra inflazione dei servizi, aumento del costo del personale e investimenti richiesti per la transizione ecologica (incluso l’utilizzo di carburanti sostenibili come il SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel – ben più costosi del jet fuel tradizionale). È quindi probabile che cerchino di mantenere i margini, evitando di trasferire ai passeggeri eventuali risparmi sui carburanti.

Cosa cambia per chi viaggia dall’Italia?

Per i viaggiatori italiani, l’impatto di questo scenario sarà diverso a seconda della destinazione e della tipologia di volo. Ecco alcune implicazioni chiave:

Le tratte verso gli Stati Uniti e l’Asia potrebbero essere ridotte, oppure operate con meno frequenza. È plausibile che l’offerta venga ridimensionata, con impatti sui prezzi e sulla disponibilità, specialmente in alta stagione.

Considerando invece i voli intra-europei, l’Europa continua a registrare una domanda sostenuta, anche se i dati IATA mostrano una stagnazione nei voli domestici in alcuni Paesi. Tuttavia, i prezzi potrebbero restare elevati a causa della ridotta concorrenza in alcuni mercati.

If those align, then yes, supersonic travel could make a comeback.
Legally and ethically, ""the return of supersonic travel must be accompanied by a modernisation of air passenger rights, ensuring that speed doesn’t come at the cost of fairness,"" he said.","There has been a flurry of momentum in the supersonic travel industry in the past few years, with multiple companies across the globe vying to be the first to relaunch commercial flights at the speed of sound, which has been nonexistent since Concorde's grounding over 20 years ago. For example, the Colorado-based Boom Supersonic company has made significant progress with its upcoming Overture jet, while Fly Concorde Ltd, a UK-based initiative, aims to revive the iconic Concorde experience.

What's more, early last month, US President Donald Trump issued an executive order ending the Federal Aviation Administration's 55-year ban on supersonic flights within US airspace. The noise rules had been in place since 1968 and a corresponding FAA restriction on flights exceeding Mach 1 was established two years later. These rules previously prevented Concorde operations on transcontinental flights. Yet, while Mr Trump's ""Concorde Bill"" has opened the doors for the development of supersonic travel and excitement is growing, according to Anton Radchenko, founder and CEO of AirAdvisor, ""we need to balance that excitement with the operational, environmental and safety realities that still stand in the way"".

Mr Radchenko told The Express: ""We’re seeing some real momentum in this space, with notable developments such as Boom Supersonic securing multiple partnerships, prototypes in progress and the recent Concorde Bill in the U.S. lifting a major regulatory hurdle. But these developments are just the beginning.""

The Boom Supersonic aerospace company is leading the charge in building a new generation of passenger jets. Overture is Boom's flagship aircraft, targeting Mach 1.7 - about 1,300 mph - and plans to fly aircraft with capacity for 64 to 80 passengers by 2029. Boom has secured pre-orders from major airlines including United, American Airlines and Japan Airlines, highlighting just how much commercial interest there is in the industry. Boom promises to slash the travel time for long-haul flights, with flights between London and New York cited to be just 3.5 hours.

Concorde retired in 2003 after nearly 30 years of service. However, it was plagued with problems. It was expensive to maintain and fuel, with limited seating and no economy class. Its sonic booms and high fuel consumption also drew criticism and limited where it could fly. The final nail in the coffin was the fateful Air France Flight 4590, which crashed in 2000 and killed all 109 on board and four on the ground. After this, confidence in its flights fell and never fully recovered. This also coincided with a downturn in global air travel after the 9/11 attacks, which further reduced demand for luxury supersonic flights.

However, Fly Concorde Ltd, a UK startup, has emerged with a mission to bring back the legendary Concorde. Backed by international engineers and aviation entrepreneurs, the company's new aircraft being an updated version of the original Concorde with many innovative features. The new jets are set to run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), be 50% lighter than their 20th-century predecessor and operate at altitudes around 60,000 feet.

However, Mr Radchenko said: ""Realistically, we are still at least five to eight years away from commercially viable supersonic routes. Technological readiness, public perception and regulatory harmonisation across global airspace will all need to align, and that’s a tall order.

Economic viability, he added, is also a significant hurdle.

He said: ""Supersonic travel still demands more fuel, stricter maintenance, and higher ticket prices. The Concorde’s downfall wasn’t just about noise or a crash; it was also that it simply wasn’t profitable. For it to return sustainably, it must work not just for business-class elites but for broader operational models that airlines can support long-term.

The expert explained that passenger rights will also need to be overhauled to adapt to this new, faster form of travel. Current compensation frameworks, such as EU261 or the US Department of Transportation's rules, are based on traditional flight schedules and operational norms. For example, delays of two or three hours trigger specific entitlements.

""But what happens when a supersonic flight, which promises to cut London-New York to under four hours, gets delayed by just one hour?"" Mr Radchenko asked. ""In relative terms, that’s a major disruption, yet under current rules, it may not qualify for compensation. Regulators will need to revisit how delay thresholds are calculated in the context of much shorter scheduled flight times.""

So, realistically, how close are we to being able to fly with our hair on fire again? According to Mr Radchenko, ""I don’t think it’s likely to resume on a commercial scale before 2030, but we are certainly closer than ever before.

""The foundational pieces are being put in place. What’s needed now is global collaboration, responsible rollout, and public trust. If those align, then yes, supersonic travel could make a comeback.

Legally and ethically, ""the return of supersonic travel must be accompanied by a modernisation of air passenger rights, ensuring that speed doesn’t come at the cost of fairness,"" he said.

He added: ""The goal should be to enhance both the travel experience and consumer confidence, and that means embedding robust protections from the very first takeoff.""",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/1200x630/6303408.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 03:56:22.445803

Those who align with Hong Kong's resilience-driven strategy are poised to thrive in an uncertain future.","In an era of escalating climate volatility, the resilience of critical infrastructure has emerged as a cornerstone of long-term investment strategy. Typhoon Wipha, which battered Hong Kong in July 2025, offers a compelling case study. With over 200 flights cancelled, public transport suspended, and Cathay Pacific's operations grinding to a halt, the storm exposed vulnerabilities in the city's aviation and logistics ecosystems. Yet, it also catalyzed a surge in strategic investments aimed at fortifying infrastructure and adopting risk-mitigation technologies. For investors, this dual narrative of disruption and innovation presents opportunities to capitalize on sectors poised for transformation.

The Immediate Fallout: A Test of Resilience

Typhoon Wipha's intensification forced the Hong Kong Observatory to issue its highest storm warning (No. 10), with hurricane-force winds and torrential rains paralyzing the city. The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) became a focal point of disruption, as Cathay Pacific, HK Express, and other carriers cancelled flights en masse. Over 280 flights were scrubbed in two days, with passenger operations suspended entirely for 12 hours. The ripple effects extended beyond aviation: ferry services, MTR lines, and road transport to the airport were shuttered, compounding logistical bottlenecks.

The financial toll was staggering. Airlines incurred losses from waived rebooking fees, stranded passengers, and operational delays. For HKIA, the cost of deploying 1,000 staff, opening temporary rest areas, and maintaining 24/7 retail operations added to the burden. Yet, the airport's swift activation of contingency systems—such as the Queue Ticket System for taxis and emergency rest centres—highlighted the value of preparedness.

Long-Term Infrastructure: Building for the Future

The Three Runway System (3RS), a HK$141.5 billion project, has become a linchpin of Hong Kong's resilience strategy. Scheduled for full completion by late 2024, the 3RS will expand HKIA's capacity to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually. This expansion not only addresses pandemic-era recovery but also future-proofs the airport against extreme weather. By diversifying runway configurations and integrating automated systems, the 3RS reduces single-point failure risks, a critical factor in storm-prone regions.

Beyond runways, the airport's “Airport City” vision—encompassing retail hubs like 11 SKIES and a 20,000-seat performance venue—positions HKIA as a multifunctional hub. This diversification mitigates revenue risks tied to flight cancellations, creating a buffer during weather disruptions. For investors, the 3RS represents a blue-chip infrastructure play, with its completion expected to drive long-term passenger and cargo growth.

Risk-Mitigation Technologies: Innovation in Action

Hong Kong's aviation sector is also embracing cutting-edge technologies to counter climate risks. The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) has deployed AI-driven weather forecasting tools and real-time passenger flow analytics to optimize resource allocation during typhoons. These systems enable proactive staff deployment and dynamic queue management, minimizing passenger discomfort and operational costs.

HAECO, a key airport services provider, has emerged as a leader in green technology. Its expansion of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems—now generating 4 million kWh annually—reduces reliance on grid power during outages. HAECO's adoption of cooling paints and LED lighting further cuts energy use, aligning with its 2030 electrification roadmap. For investors, HAECO's sustainability initiatives signal a shift toward ESG-aligned infrastructure, a sector with strong growth potential.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is another frontier. The Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) has spurred collaboration among airlines, fuel producers, and regulators to accelerate SAF adoption. Cathay Pacific and HKBAC now offer SAF blends, reducing lifecycle emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. With global SAF demand projected to reach 10% of total fuel use by 2030, investors in SAF producers and logistics enablers stand to benefit from this green transition.

Global Trends and Investment Implications

Globally, the aviation sector is racing to meet net-zero targets. The International Air Transport Association's (IATA) SAF Registry, launched in 2025, has streamlined tracking of SAF transactions, fostering transparency and scalability. Meanwhile, hydrogen-powered aircraft and battery-electric propulsion remain in early testing phases, with Airbus and ZeroAvia leading trials. These technologies, though nascent, could redefine the industry by 2040, offering investors high-growth but high-risk opportunities.

Hong Kong's strategic location as a Greater Bay Area (GBA) nexus amplifies its relevance. The HZMB Bridge and HKIA Logistics Park are enhancing cargo connectivity, while AI-driven cargo handling systems at HACTL optimize throughput. For logistics investors, the GBA's integration with Hong Kong's climate-resilient infrastructure presents a compelling value proposition.

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm

Typhoon Wipha underscored the fragility of even the most advanced infrastructure. Yet, Hong Kong's response—combining robust expansion projects with innovative risk-mitigation technologies—demonstrates a forward-looking approach. For investors, this blend of physical resilience (via 3RS) and digital resilience (via AI and SAF) offers a blueprint for long-term success.

Key Investment Opportunities:

1. Infrastructure Giants: Stake in the 3RS through AAHK or construction contractors.

2. Green Tech Pioneers: HAECO's solar and electrification initiatives.

3. SAF Ecosystems: Invest in HKSAFC-aligned companies or global SAF producers.

4. Logistics Innovators: HACTL's AI-driven cargo solutions and GBA-linked logistics hubs.

As climate volatility intensifies, the aviation and logistics sectors will require continuous reinvention.

BRUSSELS – The European aviation sector, represented by the DESTINATION 2050 partners*, together with fuel suppliers (Fuels Europe, Hydrogen Europe, Project SkyPower) and cargo and express delivery operators (European Cargo Alliance, European Express Association), issued an urgent call for accelerated policy support to unlock the full decarbonisation potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The joint call highlights the pressing challenges of affordable SAF deployment across Europe. Chief amongst them is that the current SAF market remains nascent – HEFA‑based fuels (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) are the only commercially available option today and face a substantial cost gap compared to conventional kerosene. At the same time, next‑generation SAF pathways – such as e‑SAF and advanced biofuels – continue to struggle with access to investment, in particular in reaching Final Investment Decisions (FID).

In response, the industry has laid out a 10‑point action plan, designed to address early‑mover disadvantages and catalyse the scale‑up of SAF production and deployment. The plan lays out the key regulatory and financial measures needed to de‑risk investment, bridge the significant cost gap and incentivise innovation in fuel technologies critical to decarbonising air transport.

This call to action was handed over today to Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, during the Implementation Dialogue he convened to specifically address the ramp up of renewable and low‑carbon transport fuel production.

The initiative comes at a pivotal moment, as the European Commission prepares to unveil its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan in Q3 2025 – which is expected to finally provide the support needed to effectively accelerate and deploy SAF and related infrastructure.

Participating in the Implementation Dialogue, the ACI Europe President and CEO of Fraport, Stefan Schulte commented: “By setting SAF mandates, ReFuelEU Aviation provided the ‘sticks’ needed for legal certainty, but failed to provide the ‘carrots’ – namely, the financial incentives and flexibility mechanisms required to ensure SAF is produced at scale and at competitive prices. Today, the industry has come together to present a 10‑point plan to address this imbalance.

A National Push Toward Sustainability

President Ramaphosa’s plan for climate leadership is already changing the game. Through initiatives like the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP), South Africa has attracted over R193 billion in investments and added more than 6,300 MW of renewable energy to the national grid. It’s a clear sign: South Africa is serious about building a green economy that creates jobs and protects the environment.

South Africans Expect More from Brands

Sustainability here isn’t a buzzword — it’s a movement. From Cape Town to Durban, consumers are making it clear: they want brands that care about the environment. Companies that take real action don’t just stand out; they secure trust and loyalty from customers who want to shop with a conscience. In a market where reputation matters, going green is fast becoming a must-have.

DHL’s GoGreen Portfolio: Simple Steps, Real Impact

Logistics keeps our economy moving, but it also comes with a carbon footprint. DHL recognises this and has been investing in sustainable logistics for years. The GoGreen portfolio is designed to make it easy for any business, big or small, to lower its environmental impact and show customers it’s serious about sustainability.

DHL GoGreen offers climate-neutral delivery by offsetting the carbon emissions from every shipment through certified global climate projects. It’s a straightforward way for South African businesses to demonstrate climate action — whether it’s supporting renewable energy or reforestation. With GoGreen, every parcel delivered is a step towards a carbon-neutral future.

Instead of simply offsetting emissions, GoGreen Plus lets South African companies actively reduce their supply chain emissions within DHL’s own operations. Through the “book & claim” model, you can invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Sustainable Marine Fuel, bio-LNG, and electric vehicles. The environmental benefits are allocated to your shipments, verified by independent auditors like SGS, and reported in line with global standards such as ISO 14083 and the GLEC Framework.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

SAF is a game changer for logistics. Made from renewable sources like used cooking oil or agricultural waste, it can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, or even 94% in some cases. For South African businesses shipping overseas, using SAF means you can substantially reduce your Scope 3 emissions — those tricky, indirect emissions from outsourced transport — and make real progress towards net-zero targets.

Easy Wins for Local Businesses

You don’t have to be a giant corporation to make a difference. DHL’s Green Logistics Toolkit recommends practical steps: switch to LED lighting, install rooftop solar panels, or use warehouse energy-management systems to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions. And by choosing GoGreen Plus when you ship, you’re taking action on Scope 3 — without needing to overhaul your entire supply chain. Eco-friendly packaging and AI-powered route optimisation add up to a lighter footprint and happier customers.

Global Proof, Local Opportunity

More than 40,000 businesses across Asia-Pacific are already using GoGreen Plus and seeing measurable results. In Malaysia, AFFIN Group is on track to cut shipment emissions by 70%. In Taiwan, CHIMEI Corporation is aiming for a full 100% reduction using SAF. These stories show what’s possible for South African exporters and importers looking to boost their sustainability credentials and stand out in a competitive global market.",https://www.dhl.com/discover/content/dam/south-africa/logistics-advice/sustainability/Building a greener Future.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:02:38.267558

Sebagian kalangan mempertanyakan relevansinya terhadap kebutuhan pariwisata nasional saat ini. Namun, jika ditelaah dengan pendekatan strategis dan kerangka pembangunan jangka panjang, langkah ini justru menandai fondasi penting bagi transformasi besar sektor penerbangan dan pariwisata Indonesia.

Garuda Indonesia bukan sekadar maskapai penerbangan. Ia adalah flag carrier, simbol kehadiran negara dalam ekosistem langit global. Dalam sejarahnya, Garuda lahir di tengah perjuangan kemerdekaan dan tumbuh menjadi kebanggaan Indonesia di kancah dunia.

Maka, ketika Presiden Prabowo menyatakan tekad untuk membesarkannya kembali, yang dimaksud bukan sekadar bisnis penerbangan, tetapi pemulihan martabat udara nasional.

A. Diplomasi Ekonomi dan Akses Pasar Global

Pembelian 50 pesawat Boeing merupakan bagian dari diplomasi ekonomi yang lebih besar. Sebagai hasil negosiasi bilateral dengan Amerika Serikat, tarif ekspor produk Indonesia ke pasar AS berhasil ditekan dari 32 persen menjadi 19 persen.

Imbal balik dagang ini membuka ruang lebih luas bagi pelaku UMKM, produk pariwisata, dan industri kreatif Indonesia untuk menembus pasar global, terutama dari daerah-daerah destinasi wisata seperti Bali, Yogyakarta, Mandalika, dan Danau Toba.

Jika dipandang dari sudut konektivitas, kebijakan ini menjawab salah satu titik lemah paling krusial dalam daya saing pariwisata Indonesia.

Menurut Travel and Tourism Development Index 2024 yang dirilis World Economic Forum, Indonesia masih berada di posisi ke-52 dari 119 negara dalam aspek infrastruktur transportasi udara. Artinya, meskipun destinasi dan kekayaan budaya kita menduduki peringkat 6 besar dunia, ekosistem konektivitasnya masih tertinggal jauh dari potensi.

Pembelian pesawat berbadan besar seperti Boeing 777 juga tidak bisa hanya dipahami melalui lensa pariwisata massal. Sebaliknya, pesawat-pesawat ini membuka peluang pembukaan rute jarak jauh langsung (direct long-haul) ke pasar wisatawan berkualitas dari Eropa, Timur Tengah, dan Amerika.

Ini sejalan dengan arah baru pariwisata Indonesia yang berfokus pada quality tourism yakni mendorong wisatawan dengan masa tinggal lebih lama, pengeluaran lebih besar, dan kontribusi ekonomi yang lebih berkelanjutan.

B. Infrastruktur Bandara Sudah Lebih Siap

Kritik mengenai keterbatasan bandara dalam menerima pesawat jumbo memang relevan. Namun, data pembangunan infrastruktur udara sejak 2015 menunjukkan arah yang progresif.

Bandara seperti Soekarno-Hatta, Ngurah Rai, Kualanamu, Sultan Hasanuddin, hingga Yogyakarta International Airport telah siap melayani pesawat berbadan besar. Pemerintah juga terus merevitalisasi dan memperluas bandara di destinasi-destinasi prioritas sebagai bagian dari Proyek Strategis Nasional.

C. Menuju Energi Bersih: Bioavtur dan SAF

Argumen lain menyangkut harga avtur yang mahal dibanding negara tetangga seperti Singapura. Namun dalam konteks transisi energi, Indonesia tengah melangkah menuju penggunaan bioavtur yang lebih ramah lingkungan.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berbasis inti sawit, sumber daya yang Indonesia miliki dalam jumlah besar, tengah dikembangkan melalui riset intensif antara Pertamina, BPDPKS, dan sejumlah universitas. Target pemerintah adalah memproduksi 2,4 juta kiloliter SAF pada 2030.

Perlu dicatat, pesawat-pesawat Boeing terbaru telah dirancang kompatibel dengan SAF, menjadikan pembelian ini sebagai bagian dari strategi hijau nasional.

D. Dampak Ekonomi: Konektivitas dan Pertumbuhan PDB Pariwisata

Studi Oxford Economics yang dirilis oleh IATA menunjukkan bahwa setiap kenaikan 10 persen dalam konektivitas udara akan meningkatkan kontribusi sektor pariwisata terhadap PDB sebesar 0,5 persen.

Maka penguatan armada Garuda akan berdampak langsung pada pertumbuhan ekonomi sektor pariwisata yang pada 2023 telah menyumbang lebih dari 3,8 persen terhadap PDB nasional dan berpotensi menembus 5 persen pada tahun 2027 jika didukung konektivitas udara yang kuat dan merata.

Di sisi lain, pengalaman negara seperti Turki yang menjadikan Turkish Airlines sebagai jembatan utama masuknya wisatawan global, atau Emirates yang menjadikan Dubai sebagai hub dunia, menunjukkan bahwa kekuatan maskapai nasional menjadi kunci sukses dalam mengembangkan pariwisata berkelas dunia. Indonesia memiliki peluang serupa dengan menjadikan Jakarta, Denpasar, dan Makassar sebagai simpul udara regional dan global.

E. Garuda adalah Wajah Bangsa Indonesia dan Kunci Transformasi Pariwisata

Konektivitas udara bukan sekadar persoalan logistik. Ia adalah infrastruktur emosional dan simbolik. Setiap maskapai yang mendaratkan pesawatnya di negeri lain membawa pesan, inilah wajah negara kami. Dalam hal ini, Garuda membawa bendera Merah Putih, dan dengan membesarkannya, Indonesia membangun kembali kehormatan dan kepercayaan dunia.

Transformasi pariwisata tidak cukup dengan promosi destinasi atau kampanye digital. Ia memerlukan reformasi struktural, perkuatan maskapai nasional, integrasi rute, pemanfaatan energi bersih, dan diplomasi udara yang cerdas. Keputusan Presiden Prabowo bukan hanya membenahi kekurangan masa lalu, tetapi menyiapkan landasan untuk melompat ke masa depan.

Langkah ini memang tidak populis dalam jangka pendek. Namun, ia menandai tekad politik yang kuat untuk memperbaiki akar sistem, bukan sekadar mempercantik permukaan. Dalam semangat itu, membesarkan Garuda adalah bagian dari upaya membesarkan Indonesia melalui sektor pariwisatanya.

The platform, launched in 2022 to help scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage, will now allow customers—including airlines, corporations, and freight forwarders—to manage SAF from a variety of suppliers in one place, reports Green Air.

This change is expected to streamline how users track and allocate their SAF purchases, even when physical access to SAF at specific airports is limited. By the end of March, Avelia had attracted 57 corporate and airline participants and facilitated over 900 SAF retirements, resulting in more than 33 million gallons of SAF being used across 17 airports in Europe, Asia, and North America. That SAF use, according to the partners, has prevented over 300,000 tonnes of CO₂e emissions—equivalent to 530,000 passengers flying from London to New York.

Avelia is now introducing a ‘Bring Your Own SAF’ (BYOS) model, enabling airlines to include SAF they purchased outside Shell’s network on the platform. This change is expected to enhance industry credibility around book-and-claim systems and help standardize SAF tracking across the aviation sector.

To further ensure transparency and broaden industry participation, Avelia is developing a multilateral governance structure to oversee platform operations and standards. All platform data will now be independently managed and hosted by Accenture, offering users a secure and verified digital environment.

“Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF,” said Raman Ojha, President of Shell Aviation.

Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg of Accenture added, “This safeguards data compartmentalisation and transparency, giving customers clear control. It also builds the secure, scalable foundation needed for a flexible industry platform.”

Avelia’s growing list of participants includes major global players such as Alaska Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Google, JetBlue, Rolls-Royce, Bank of America, and others.

Although the exact emissions reduction targets under the India-Japan JCM have not yet been disclosed, the potential is significant.","In a move to expedite decarbonization efforts while reducing clean energy costs, Japan and India are finalizing a Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). This bilateral framework will allow both nations to share emission reduction credits. It will also aid Japan in fulfilling its climate commitments.

Japan's goal of achieving net zero by 2050 and India's 45% emissions reduction target by 2030 highlight the natural partnership between the two countries in decarbonization and economic growth. With Japanese companies increasingly interested in entering the Indian market as a relocation destination for production bases or as an investment opportunity, this article explores the potential of partnerships in the carbon market sector.

What is the Joint Credit Mechanism?

Under the JCM, Japanese companies will invest in and deploy advanced carbon reduction technologies in India. In return, Japan will receive carbon credits that can offset its emissions or be traded within its national carbon market.

The initiative falls under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which ensures internationally recognized and verifiable emissions reductions. Once finalized, carbon credits will be officially registered and tracked. Joint committees will be formed to oversee project implementation and to verify credit issuance through the formulation of a detailed report. Consequently, this mechanism will help both countries meet their nationally determined contributions under the Paris framework.

A wide range of sectors, including solar thermal energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel, are expected to benefit from JCM investments.

Originally initiated by Japan, the JCM facilitates the transfer of technical expertise and climate-friendly technologies from developed to developing countries. While developed nations benefit by outsourcing their emissions reductions, often at a lower cost, this supports sustainable development in host countries. It helps mobilize international finance, alleviating the cost burden for the recipient country. Currently, Japan has established similar agreements with 11 other countries, including Indonesia, Kenya, and Vietnam.

An India-Japan Partnership

India and Japan have discussed a JCM partnership since 2014. In 2023, a $600 million USD fund was jointly launched by India's quasi-sovereign wealth fund, the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) to invest in sustainable projects. JBIC contributed 51% of that total, while the remainder came from India.

The fund aimed to invest in sustainable projects in areas such as e-mobility, renewable energy, and waste management. Other key initiatives, such as the Perform, Achieve, and Trade, or ""PAT"" scheme, have facilitated a long-standing India-Japan collaboration in energy efficiency. This partnership has reduced 10 million tons of CO₂ emissions, saved 25 million tons of oil equivalent energy, and generated $10 billion in investments.

What Are the Benefits?

For a country like India, which is vulnerable to climate change, adopting clean technologies is both essential and urgent. Achieving low or zero carbon emissions necessitates access to these technologies. However, such technologies often come with high upfront costs.

This may exceed what the governments of developing countries can currently fund. They are typically expensive or not widely available. For example, generating electricity from coal is cheaper than using green hydrogen, solar or thermal power, despite the environmental cost. In this context, Japan's role becomes critical. It helps to equalize the cost of clean energy with conventional, polluting sources by subsidizing these technologies.

Today, problems such as a severed supply chain, amid an unstable global situation, have aligned both countries' efforts and broader climate ambitions to build effective carbon markets.

Coal continues to dominate India's power mix due to its lower capital costs. However, with Japanese subsidies, alternatives such as energy storage systems and solar thermal plants could become economically viable. They could thereby accelerate India's energy transition. It has the potential to transform India's energy sector by improving the competitiveness and affordability of renewable energy technologies.

Strengthening India-Japan Strategic Ties

Beyond emissions cuts and costs, the JCM has the potential to generate jobs in both nations by fostering investments in low-carbon technologies. It promises to drive economic growth by creating skilled jobs, becoming a double-edged weapon. India can strategically channel these funds into underdeveloped clean energy sectors, leveraging Japanese expertise to expedite its transition to a low-carbon economy. This aligns with India's dual goals of sustainable development and economic expansion. Meanwhile, Japanese companies gain access to a rapidly growing market for clean technologies.

The initiative is likely to strengthen India-Japan strategic ties. This complements their collaboration in infrastructure, defense, and economic security. It also counterbalances China's growing regional influence, having a ripple effect on different domains of collaboration. However, the ultimate goal is for India to adopt and scale these technologies independently, making JCM a high-stakes and high-impact partnership.

India Fields Itself

India is poised to introduce its long-awaited carbon market by 2026. The market for the sale and purchase of carbon credits does not currently exist in our country. Under this program, those who use fossil fuels or emit carbon would buy carbon credits. Meanwhile, those who use power from non-fossil sources would receive carbon credits that they can sell in the market.

The introduction of carbon credits should incentivize manufacturers to adopt green energy solutions, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing compliance with global regulations. India's strong potential in green hydrogen, energy efficiency, waste management, and biogas also reaffirms Japan's commitment to supporting these initiatives.

Major Roadblocks

There have been significant roadblocks to warming India-Japan relations in the climate domain. The negotiations with India have been ongoing since 2014. They highlight the complexity of such high-stakes climate agreements. Challenges also remain in ensuring that emissions reductions are not double-counted. It will be crucial to uphold the mechanism's credibility and prevent any compromise of its integrity.

Additionally, there is a concern that Japan might use the JCM to delay more decisive domestic climate actions. Critics argue that developed countries should prioritize cutting emissions at home first, as it feeds into domestic political debate on climate. However, supporters of the mechanism contend that international cooperation through frameworks like the JCM facilitates faster and more cost-effective global progress toward climate goals.

Furthermore, long-term sustainability is another critical issue. India must ultimately develop the capability to adopt and scale these technologies independently. This will require not only funding but also knowledge transfer, training, and the development of infrastructure. Without such capacity-building, the JCM risks becoming a short-term fix rather than a foundation for lasting transformation. India must cultivate the ability to sustain and expand these technologies over time.

Conclusion

India is the world's third-largest GHG emitter, primarily due to its coal and industrial activities. The trend with other JCM partnerships, such as those in Vietnam, already shows achievements in measurable CO₂ reductions in key sectors. A similar trajectory can also be expected for India by targeting high-emission areas with solutions like sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen.

Although the exact emissions reduction targets under the India-Japan JCM have not yet been disclosed, the potential is significant. The Japan-India JCM could serve as a global blueprint for climate cooperation if implemented effectively. It has the potential to reduce the cost of climate action, accelerate technology transfer, and strengthen diplomatic ties. That helps both nations move closer to their climate goals.

Focus is on the potential of green ammonia, hydrogen, and solar energy in industrial transformation, as well as the importance of carbon dioxide removal technologies. There is a need for technology transfer, financing, and strategic partnerships to boost sustainability efforts.

Both nations are committed to climate action. Innovative technologies and strong policy frameworks can create mutually beneficial pathways toward decarbonization. Japan's approach to carbon markets aligns well with India's sustainability goals. Japan's commitment to strengthening investment ties with India through the JCM framework, which promotes energy security and a low-carbon future, is well-timed.

By aligning sustainability objectives with strategic interests, this partnership can show how developed and developing countries can collaborate meaningfully to address one of the most significant challenges of our time: climate change.

Long-term, the RISE open-fan program targeting a 20% fuel efficiency improvement by 2028 and the company’s $1 billion annual R&D and capex investments underpin a projected 2025–2028 double-digit revenue CAGR.

Quality & Moat

GE Aerospace’s quality is reflected in its high-margin, recurring services mix—services represent 70% of revenue and grew 29% year-over-year in Q2 2025. The business generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow in 2024, a 28% increase, and converted over 100% of adjusted net income into cash, demonstrating robust cash-flow generation. Return on equity stood at 36.8% in FY 2024, driven by lean operating improvements under the FLIGHT DECK model. Its economic moat is anchored in a large installed engine base, proprietary engine technologies (e.g., the CFM joint venture), and long-term service contracts. Under CEO Larry Culp, management has reduced net debt to $5.65 billion (debt-to-equity ~1.02×) and outlined a disciplined capital allocation framework targeting investment-grade liquidity and returning 70–75% of free cash to shareholders.

Valuation

GE Aerospace trades at roughly 39.7× forward earnings, below the aerospace sector average (~82×) but above its own five-year median (~30×). Its PEG ratio of ~3.05 suggests the stock’s high valuation relative to growth expectations, while a P/B of 14.0× indicates a premium to book value. Compared to peers, the multiple reflects GE’s superior aftermarket growth and margin expansion, though it may leave limited upside absent further multiple expansion.

Market Sentiment

Analyst sentiment is positive: ~76% of analysts rate the stock a Buy, with an average price target implying ~14% upside to $263.27. Institutional ownership remains elevated (~70%), and short interest is low at ~1.46% of the float (2.3 days to cover), indicating limited bearish positioning. News and social media coverage have been constructive following the Q2 beat, though focus is shifting to potential tariff headwinds and supply chain updates.

Key Risks

Cyclical Demand Exposure: A slowdown in global air travel or defense budget cuts could dent engine orders and aftermarket services revenue, exposing the company to macroeconomic cyclicality.

Supply Chain Constraints: Ongoing material shortages and supplier delays pose execution risks; despite a 26% sequential improvement in material inputs in H2 2024, further bottlenecks could hamper production and delivery.

Tariff and Trade Headwinds: Approximately $500 million of tariff-related costs are anticipated in 2025; failure to pass these fully to customers could compress margins.

Valuation Risk: High P/E and PEG multiples increase vulnerability to earnings misses or downward guidance revisions, potentially amplifying share price volatility.

Geopolitical and Regulatory Uncertainty: Export controls, shifting defense procurement policies, and environmental regulations around sustainable aviation fuel could increase compliance costs or limit market access.

Bull Case

Services-Led Growth: Recurring, high-margin MRO and long-term service agreements (70% of revenue) provide resilient cash flow and support margin expansion.

Engine Production Ramp: Backlogs for LEAP and GE9X engines (~$175 billion) underpin sustained revenue growth through 2028, driven by narrow-body and wide-body fleet renewals.

Technological Leadership: RISE open-fan program targets a 20% fuel efficiency gain, supported by $1 billion annual R&D, bolstering long-term competitive advantage.

Robust Capital Returns: Management plans to return 70–75% of free cash flow via dividends and buybacks, including a $19 billion authorization, enhancing shareholder value.

Strong Financial Position: Investment-grade balance sheet with net debt reduced to $5.65 billion and high cash conversion provides flexibility to invest and weather cycles.

Bear Case

Macro-Cyclicality: A downturn in air travel or defense spending could sharply reduce orders and aftermarket volumes, impacting top-line growth.

Execution and Quality Risks: Delays in overcoming supplier constraints or durability issues (e.g., LEAP engines) could disrupt delivery schedules and margin targets.

Margin Pressure from Tariffs: Inability to fully offset $500 million of tariffs through pricing or cost savings could weigh on operating margins.

Rich Valuation: At near-record multiples, any EPS or guidance miss could trigger a disproportionate share price decline.

Regulatory and Geopolitical Risks: Stricter export controls, defense budget shifts, or environmental regulations may increase costs or reduce addressable markets.

On Our Radar

3Q 2025 Earnings Release: Expected around October 22, 2025, investors will focus on production ramp progress and guidance updates.

Tariff Policy Update: Potential U.S. tariff adjustments on aerospace parts due August 1, 2025, could impact gross margins.

Defense Sector Earnings Week: Late July 2025 reports from Lockheed Martin, RTX, and others will provide context on defense spending trends.

Investment Recommendation

GE Aerospace’s leadership in high-margin aftermarket services, strong growth outlook from engine backlogs, and robust cash flow generation make it an attractive proposition for long-term investors seeking exposure to aerospace and defense trends. However, current premium valuation multiples and exposure to cyclical demand and supply chain headwinds suggest that patient investors may consider waiting for a pullback or confirmation of sustained margin improvements before initiating new positions. A long-term investor may view today’s levels as offering a compelling entry into a high-quality aerospace franchise, while shorter-term traders should monitor upcoming earnings and tariff developments closely.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-07-19 23:03:18.273082

Moree farmer Matthew Madden said he is keen to get on board as new crop genetics enable more viable canola crops to be used in rotation with cereal crops in northern NSW.
Mr Madden planted 240 hectares of canola in April, which has just started to produce the yellow flowers that have made canola crops a tourist attraction and a popular social media backdrop.
National grower group Graingrowers has also stepped up its push for a national LCLF feedstock strategy that includes domestic SAF production.
Current biofuel production in Australia from crops primarily involves ethanol production from wheat starch and molasses.","Canola crops in the Liverpool Plains and the north west ‘Golden Triangle’ region could soon be fuelling the future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in Australia.

Advocacy from farmer groups and a $250 million Federal Budget commitment to grow an Australian Low Carbon Liquid Fuels (LCLF) industry has launched the new market opportunity.

Qantas has also committed to using 10% SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030 and private investors are in the planning phase for a new large-scale refinery to produce biofuel from crops like canola.

Moree farmer Matthew Madden said he is keen to get on board as new crop genetics enable more viable canola crops to be used in rotation with cereal crops in northern NSW.

Mr Madden planted 240 hectares of canola in April, which has just started to produce the yellow flowers that have made canola crops a tourist attraction and a popular social media backdrop.

“I’m looking forward to a future where we have a home-grown industry for SAF and other biofuels,” Mr Madden said.

“It creates a new market opportunity for our crops, and if Australian companies like Qantas are seeking to use SAF to reduce carbon emissions we should be the one’s supplying the feedstock to produce it.”

While Mr Madden’s 2025 canola crop will not be taking to the air, he will be advocating for prompt government action on kickstarting domestic SAF production through representing the northern NSW region with NSW Farmers and Grain Producers Australia.

National grower group Graingrowers has also stepped up its push for a national LCLF feedstock strategy that includes domestic SAF production. It has called for targeted grants for critical LCLF processing infrastructure such as fuel refining facilities and oilseed crushes.

Current biofuel production in Australia from crops primarily involves ethanol production from wheat starch and molasses. While Australia has significant grain and molasses resources, the production and consumption of biofuels remain relatively low.

Zach Whale, General Manager of Policy and Advocacy at Graingrowers, said SAF presents a ‘brilliant’ market diversification option for farmers using canola in cropping rotations.

“There is one big hungry market for Australian oilseeds, particularly in the EU. We export 70 per cent of our canola, much of which is used in flourishing biodiesel industry in the EU.”

“Our farmers are helping the EU meeting their carbon reduction targets. We should be doing the same thing here using feedstock from canola crops grown in regions like north western NSW.”

“Producing low-carbon liquid fuels from this feedstock can play a key role in meeting national emissions reduction targets while simultaneously boosting rural economies.”

Mr Whale said there are a couple of key hurdles to overcome before takeoff.

“The basic economics is one. It costs more to produce SAF than conventional fuel and no one wants to pay more for air travel and freight. That’s why government investment is critical to support the industry to get economies of scale.”

“There is enthusiasm from the federal government and private investors to achieve this.”

The economics are also why northern NSW is so important: the Golden Triangle region, roughly defined as the area east of the Newell Highway, stretching from Bellata to North Star and Yallaroi, encompasses around 350,000 hectares of some of the highest yielding cropping country in Australia.

Australian-owned fuel companies GrainCorp and Ampol have teamed up with industry super fund IFM Investors to work on refining canola oil in Australia for use in the aviation industry. GrainCorp’s aspirations are to establish a new canola crush with capacity to process 1million tonnes a year in NSW or Western Australia- the two biggest canola growing states.

“We also need to ensure our canola meets the technical certification criteria and mandates for aviation fuel,” Mr Whale explained.

In the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap published last year by the CSIRO, it was assessed that local SAF production would prove the most likely gateway investment in other fossil fuel replacements, such as biodiesel.

The same CSIRO research identified that just 4.5 million tonnes of canola could yield 2 million tonnes of lower-carbon liquid fuel, which is equivalent of around 250,000 return flights between Sydney and Melbourne.

NSW Farmers President Xavier Martin said further research and investment in the biofuels industry is essential to unlock the full potential and benefits of these alternative fuels.

“These fuels can be produced out of materials farmers already produce and can provide whole new income streams for farm businesses while slashing on-farm energy and fuel costs.”

“Biofuels could also play a key role in furthering the sustainability of the agricultural industry, with these fuels burning much more cleanly than fossil fuels and originating from renewable resources.”",https://www.netimes.com.au/wp-content/uploads/NET-July-25-18.jpeg,N,,2025-07-19 23:03:39.054325

One of the key developments includes NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) planning a large-scale green hydrogen project at Pudimadaka in Visakhapatnam.
The total investment across the state’s green hydrogen ecosystem is projected to reach ₹1.85 lakh crore.
Another major concern is the substantial water requirement for green hydrogen production.","Andhra Pradesh is aiming to achieve 1 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production annually by 2030, a move that will require significant investment and infrastructure development. Union Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development, Pemmasani Chandra Shekhar, shared this vision during an event in Amaravati, encouraging private players to take advantage of the state’s investor-friendly policies.

This goal aligns with the broader National Green Hydrogen Mission, approved by the Union Cabinet in January 2023, which outlines a national target of producing 5 MMT of green hydrogen per year by 2030. The mission carries a total allocation of ₹19,744 crore to support this clean energy transition.

“Andhra Pradesh is positioning itself as a central hub for India’s green hydrogen sector, aiming to contribute 20% of the country’s total production target,” said Mr Shekhar. One of the key developments includes NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) planning a large-scale green hydrogen project at Pudimadaka in Visakhapatnam. This facility is expected to produce 1,500 tonnes of green hydrogen per day, along with 7,500 tonnes per day of derivatives such as green ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The total investment across the state’s green hydrogen ecosystem is projected to reach ₹1.85 lakh crore. Another major company, Hero Future Energies, is exploring plans to establish a green hydrogen facility in Tirupati. The minister noted that Andhra Pradesh’s extensive port infrastructure enhances its position as an export-ready clean energy destination, signaling both scalability and profitability to global investors.

While the growth potential is substantial, Mr Shekhar highlighted several challenges that need to be addressed for the green hydrogen sector to scale sustainably. Green hydrogen holds great promise for clean energy, but its widespread adoption is currently hindered by high production costs. At present, green hydrogen is priced between USD 3 to 6 per kilogram, significantly more expensive than grey hydrogen, which costs around USD 1 to 2 per kilogram. Bridging this gap requires advancements in technology, particularly through the development of more efficient electrolysers and the scaling up of renewable energy sources to power the production process at lower costs.

Another major concern is the substantial water requirement for green hydrogen production. Creating just one kilogram of hydrogen through electrolysis consumes approximately 9 liters of freshwater. This poses a significant challenge, especially for countries like India, where water demand is expected to exceed supply in the coming years. To make green hydrogen a sustainable option, there is an urgent need to explore alternative solutions, such as seawater electrolysis or water recycling technologies.

Infrastructure remains a critical barrier in building a robust green hydrogen economy. The current lack of dedicated pipelines, safe storage facilities, and refueling stations limits the ability to transport and distribute hydrogen efficiently. These logistical gaps make it difficult for green hydrogen to reach end-users at scale and must be addressed through coordinated investments and planning.

Overcoming these challenges will require a combined effort from governments, industry players, and research institutions. Strategic policy support, public-private partnerships, and innovation in production and distribution technologies are essential to make green hydrogen cost-competitive, sustainable, and accessible. With the right infrastructure and resources in place, green hydrogen can play a transformative role in the global shift to clean energy.

Despite these hurdles, the state is pressing forward with integrated plans and incentives. Mr Shekhar urged domestic and international investors to participate in Andhra Pradesh’s full value chain — from electrolyser manufacturing to derivative fuel production. He emphasized the importance of the state’s proposed Integrated Clean Energy (ICE) Policy 2024, which includes tax incentives, subsidies, and other supportive measures to accelerate green hydrogen adoption.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pemmasani-Chandra-Sekhar.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:04:09.747263

While adjusted EPS of $2.69 for Q2 2025 fell short of guidance, the company maintained its quarterly dividend at $1.79 per share, a 2.3% yield. This move, however, comes with a critical caveat: the payout ratio now stands at 104%, meaning the company is paying out more in dividends than it earns. Historically, Air Products has managed to keep its payout ratio below 100%, a metric that raises red flags for investors wary of overextension.

The disconnect between cash flow and dividend commitments is partly driven by non-recurring charges. A $2.3 billion after-tax restructuring cost—linked to exiting three U.S. projects, including a green hydrogen initiative in New York—weighed heavily on GAAP results. Yet, even excluding these one-time hits, the company's adjusted earnings have declined 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes and rising input costs. This trend raises the question: Can Air Products continue to fund its dividend without sacrificing reinvestment in growth or liquidity?

Strategic Restructuring: A Double-Edged Sword

The company's restructuring efforts—aimed at streamlining operations and focusing on core industrial gas and hydrogen projects—have been aggressive. Exits from high-risk ventures like the California-based sustainable aviation fuel expansion and Texas carbon monoxide projects resulted in $2.9 billion in pre-tax charges. While these moves reduce exposure to volatile markets, they also signal a shift away from high-growth bets that could have bolstered future cash flow.

Capital expenditures remain a key lever. Air Products plans to invest $5 billion in 2025, a figure that underscores its commitment to long-term projects but also strains near-term liquidity. The company's debt load—$14.15 billion as of March 2025—has grown amid increased short-term borrowing, and its debt-to-equity ratio now stands at 0.48. While this is lower than peers like Linde and Air Liquide, it remains elevated for a company targeting free cash flow breakeven by 2026.

Credit Metrics and Analyst Sentiment

Moody's Ratings recently revised its outlook for Air Products to “negative” from “stable,” citing concerns over free cash flow generation and debt management. The downgrade highlights a critical vulnerability: Air Products' ability to service its debt while maintaining dividend payments. With a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0x (excluding joint venture debt), the company is operating at the lower end of its current A2 rating threshold. If leverage creeps above 2.5x or retained cash flow-to-debt falls below 25%, a further downgrade could loom.

Analyst sentiment is similarly split. While the consensus remains a “Moderate Buy” with a $331.53 price target (12% upside from current levels), recent upgrades and downgrades reflect uncertainty. UBS raised its target to $344, citing long-term hydrogen demand, while B of A Securities cut its target to $282, warning of near-term margin pressures. The divergence underscores the tension between Air Products' strategic pivot and its immediate financial constraints.

The Dividend Dilemma: History vs. Reality

Air Products' dividend history is a testament to its resilience. The company's $1.6 billion annual payout is supported by a $2 billion cash balance and $3.5 billion in undrawn credit facilities, offering a buffer against short-term shocks. However, the 104% payout ratio is a red flag. For context, industry leaders like The Coca-Cola Company and Procter & Gamble typically maintain payout ratios below 80%, ensuring flexibility during downturns.

The key differentiator here is Air Products' business model. Its on-site industrial gas contracts—often take-or-pay agreements—provide stable cash flow, even in economic downturns. This structural advantage, combined with a global footprint in 50+ countries, offers a degree of insulation from regional disruptions. Yet, the company's foray into high-risk projects (like green hydrogen) and its recent exit from others complicate the calculus.

Investment Implications

For income-focused investors, Air Products remains a compelling but cautious bet. The 2.3% yield is attractive, but the payout ratio and credit risks demand careful monitoring. The company's ability to achieve free cash flow breakeven by 2026 will be pivotal. If Air Products can stabilize margins, reduce debt, and maintain its focus on core industrial gas projects, the dividend could remain intact. However, a repeat of the Q2 2025 earnings miss or a failure to curb capital spending could force a dividend cut—a scenario that would likely trigger a sell-off.

For growth-oriented investors, the restructuring presents mixed signals. While exiting high-risk projects reduces volatility, it also limits upside potential. The hydrogen sector, in particular, is a double-edged sword: it's a $300 billion market by 2030 but requires heavy capital investment with uncertain returns. Air Products' $5 billion capex plan is a bet on long-term demand, but it comes at the expense of near-term liquidity.

Final Verdict

Air Products' long-term dividend story is far from dead, but it's in a holding pattern. The company's industrial gas dominance and take-or-pay contracts provide a solid foundation, but its debt load, high payout ratio, and restructuring costs introduce significant risks. Investors should view this as a “wait-and-see” scenario: the dividend may hold for now, but the path to sustainability hinges on Air Products' ability to balance reinvestment, debt reduction, and shareholder returns.

In the short term, a watchful eye on free cash flow trends and debt metrics is essential. For now, Air Products remains a high-yield, high-risk proposition—a stock that rewards patience but demands vigilance.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:04:36.708072

It specifically intends to exclude biodiesel from the United States because the Ontario government claims it is subsidized and is driving Canadian competitors out of the market.

In a posting on its regulatory proposals website, the government said:

“Subsidies for U.S. biofuel producers, specifically the 45Z tax credit under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, threaten to shut down Ontario’s biodiesel production.”

“The U.S. 45Z tax credit provides significant subsidies to American producers of cleaner fuels, such as ethanol, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and other transportation fuels. Such subsidies are not available to Canadian producers. The credit is awarded on a per-gallon basis, with the amount varying based on the fuel’s lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and whether a facility has satisfied labour requirements.”

Article content

“Renewable fuel policies such as the federal Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) and provincial policies including those in Ontario, BC and Quebec are driving demand for increased volumes of renewable content such as ethanol and biodiesel in Canada. The 45Z tax credit is offering U.S. producers a strong competitive advantage over Canadian producers in this growing market for clean fuels. This is impacting the operational viability of Ontario’s facilities. The continued presence of U.S. subsidies could result in permanent closure of Ontario’s biodiesel facilities and impact Ontario’s resource recovery objectives if no action is taken.”

“In this policy proposal, we are seeking feedback on a domestic renewable content requirement for diesel fuel placed in the Ontario market. Ontario is proposing to require three per cent of the renewable content required in diesel fuel to be produced in Canada. This requirement represents 75 per cent of the renewable content that is currently blended in diesel fuel. This enables the continued processing of some Canadian waste feedstock at clean fuel facilities in Ontario.”

“Local biodiesel facilities are critical players in sustaining a circular economy in Ontario. A circular economy is one where waste streams can be harnessed to produce value-added products, such as clean renewable fuels. Some feedstocks in biofuel production may be supplied from Ontario’s waste streams (e.g. animal fats, used cooking oil and organics).

“The proposed domestic renewable content requirement would help maintain and sustain a circular economy in Ontario by supporting the continued operations of Ontario biodiesel facilities, which have a key role to play in effectively managing Ontario’s waste streams.

“I think that you could argue there is sustainable palm oil and there is palm oil that wouldn’t be considered sustainable, and I think in some parts of the world there it’s too black and white,” he said.
We need to have a much more “nuanced approach” to the usage of palm oil as a feedstock and “much more detailed assessment of the sustainability of the feedstock”, he added.","The head of global aviation representative organisation The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has attacked the EU on its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, saying the policy is proving too costly and is not helpful to the environment, as SAF stocks remain low across Europe.

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” IATA director-general Willie Walsh said.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel, is expected to reach 2 million metric tons, or 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Mr Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel.

By IATA’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel.”

“The EU in effect has facilitated monopoly suppliers to increase prices with no environmental benefit,” said Mr Walsh, adding that the region needs to re-evaluate its SAF targets.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a 6% SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines, Reuters reported in June.

On the supply front, at least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production this year, targeting exports regionally and to Europe. Singapore is among key exporters of the green fuel to the EU.

Mr Walsh also questioned the use of palm oil as a means to produce sustainable fuel.

Despite contributing only 2.5% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, aviation faces intense scrutiny due to its significant challenges in decarbonization. The industry's dependence on energy-dense fossil fuels and the current technological constraints of alternative energy sources make it particularly difficult to reduce its carbon footprint. As part of global efforts to meet international climate goals, such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), aviation has become the center of attention in the climate change mitigation effort. Industry stakeholders are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices that can reduce environmental impact. Among these solutions, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) have emerged as one of the most promising, offering the potential for substantial emission reductions without requiring major technological modifications to aircraft. This paper examines SWISS International Airline's initiatives to implement Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a component of its comprehensive sustainability strategy. With this case study, this research analyzes the integration of SAF into the airline's operations and assesses the challenges and opportunities encountered during the process. The methodology employs qualitative research techniques, combining primary data obtained from interviews with corporate responsibility executives with secondary data from corporate sustainability reports to provide an in-depth understanding of the adoption of SAF. Being a contemporary and under-researched phenomenon, qualitative and exploratory research was employed to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the complexities inherent in the adoption of SAF. While focusing primarily on SWISS, the research examines the broader implications of SAF implementation within the aviation sector. It investigates the tecno- economic, environmental, and regulatory factors that influence the viability and scalability of SAF, as well as the role of market-based mechanisms, such as emissions trading systems. The findings of this innovative study provide insights how SAF can contribute to mitigating the aviation industry's carbon footprint and enhance its sustainability, thus establishing a foundation for the future of sustainable aviation.",https://ojs.southfloridapublishing.com/ojs/public/journals/1/favicon_en_US.png,N,,2025-07-19 02:49:32.180147

Heat to build over the next week, some crop stress likely... Changes are coming to the weather pattern that will produce hotter temps and high relative humidity across areas of the U.S. through next week, inducing some crop stress. World Weather Inc. says hot temperatures are likely in the Central and Southern Plains, Delta, lower Midwest and interior southeastern states from this weekend through the end of next week, with heat indices of 95 to 115 likely. A westward shift in the heat and dryness is likely in the last days of July, allowing some cooling and rainfall back into the lower Midwest and southeastern states. Northern and eastern Midwest crop areas will be sufficiently moist to carry on normal crop development during the next two weeks.

China doesn’t want trade war with U.S. but isn’t afraid of one... China wants to bring its trade ties with the U.S. back to a stable footing, its commerce minister said. China is facing an Aug. 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with the U.S. after Beijing and Washington reached a preliminary deal last month to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs. Commerce Minister Wang Wentao aid the current overall tariff level imposed by the U.S. on China was “still high” at 53.6%. “Both sides have come to understand that they need each other, as lots of the goods and services that we exchange are irreplaceable, or at least difficult to exchange in the short-term,” Wang said. “China does not want a trade war, but it is not afraid of one,” he reiterated.

Lula won’t bow to Trump, calls tariffs ‘unacceptable blackmail’... Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he would not take orders over tariffs from a foreigner and later called President Donald Trump’s threatened duties “unacceptable blackmail.” Trump attributed the tariffs, set to start Aug. 1 to Brazil’s treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro and to trade practices against U.S. companies that he said are unfair. Brazil’s government has been holding discussions with industry groups and companies that will be affected by the U.S. tariffs, while also readying potential retaliatory measures if a deal isn’t reached.

LanzaJet’s pioneering ethanol-to-jet fuel plant set to launch by fall... The world’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet fuel plant, owned by LanzaJet Inc., is expected to begin operations in Soperton, Georgia by the end of September, after multiple delays due to equipment issues. The $200 million project, funded in part by the U.S. government, will initially use Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), even though it won’t qualify for the U.S. 45Z tax credit due to feedstock origin rules. CEO Jimmy Samartzis said the company is pushing to start with available low-carbon ethanol and transition to qualifying American sources once they become more viable. The Georgia facility is projected to produce 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel annually.

WSJ: Union Pacific eyes Norfolk Southern in potential megamerger... Union Pacific is in early-stage discussions to acquire Norfolk Southern, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The potential merger would mark a massive consolidation in the railroad industry, combining Union Pacific’s $140 billion market value with Norfolk Southern’s $60 billion footprint. WSJ sources familiar with the matter cautioned that the talks are preliminary, and there’s no certainty a deal will materialize—or clear regulatory hurdles. The possibility remains that other suitors could emerge. If completed, the deal would reshape North America’s freight rail landscape.

China’s pork imports steady... China imported 90,000 MT of pork during June, unchanged from the previous month and year-ago. Through the first half of 2025, China imported 540,000 MT of pork, up 4.9% from the same period last year.

Canada and New Zealand resolve dairy trade dispute... Canada and New Zealand have reached a “mutually satisfactory” resolution to a long-running dispute over access for dairy products, the Canadian government said. New Zealand launched a claim against Canada in May 2022, arguing that Ottawa’s implementation of dairy tariff rate quotas under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade agreement were against its rules. Under the new agreement, Canada has committed to make commercially meaningful changes to the way it administers its dairy quotas under CPTPP, according to the New Zealand government. The Canadian government added that this means there are technical policy changes but these are limited to quotas administered under the terms of CPTPP and does not amend Canada’s market access commitments.

Brazil has set a target of ceasing deforestation, both legal and illegal, by 2030, as well as to reach net zero emissions by 2050.","Brazil's environment ministry issued a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through seven guidelines and mitigation targets that will be measured every three years as of 2024.

The strategy is part of a larger project known as Plano Clima that seeks to promote energy efficiency, low-carbon agriculture and cattle raising practices, green hydrogen supply and wider use of renewable fuels. Each of the seven sectors included in the national strategy for mitigation plan issued on Friday will follow specific guidelines with targets, action plans, cost projections, financing pathways, monitoring and assessment.

Sectors include agriculture and cattle raising, nature conservation, cities and urban mobility, energy and mining, industry, solid waste and effluents, as well as transport, all aligned with another strategy plan to employ climate adaptation. Mitigation action plans will set targets from 2024-27, 2028-31 and 2032-35, the ministry said.

All documents will be available for public consultation from 28 July-18 August.

The country's emissions come mostly from deforestation and agribusiness activities, which are ahead of burning fossil fuels in the transport and industry sectors, according to the environment ministry. Early in the week, the US Trade Representative (USTR) launched an investigation to determine if Brazil's illegal deforestation undermines the competitiveness of US timber and agricultural industries.

National deforestation fell by 32pc in 2024 from a year before, according to space institute Inpe. But Brazil also scorched an area greater than the size of Italy in 2024, according to environmental network MapBiomas.

The US$200 million facility, located in rural Georgia, is owned by LanzaJet and was initially scheduled to start production in 2024, reported Bloomberg.

LanzaJet CEO Jimmy Samartzis confirmed the revised timeline in a recent interview, citing equipment-related issues—not problems with the core technology—as the reason for the latest setback.

“The modifications we made to the equipment that was hindering us, unrelated to the technology itself, should satisfy what we need,” Samartzis said. “My hope is that by the end of the third quarter we are fully operating.”

The project, partly funded by the US government, is seen as a key test case for the emerging ethanol-to-jet fuel industry. In 2024, LanzaJet imported ethanol made from Brazilian sugarcane to begin pilot production. However, the company has yet to make a commercial sale of its green jet fuel.

Diamond Edge Ventures Inc. (DEV), the corporate venture arm of Mitsubishi Chemical Group (MCG Group), has announced an investment in Licella Holdings Ltd., an Australian technology leader in advanced recycling and renewable fuels.

The funding will help accelerate Licella’s global expansion and commercial deployment of its proprietary Catalytic Hydrothermal Reactor (Cat-HTR™) technology.

Licella’s commercial-scale Cat-HTR™ plant for biomass-to-biofuels in Prince George, Canada.

Licella's Cat-HTR™ process is an innovative technology that converts waste plastics and biomass into oil in supercritical water under high temperature and high pressure, which is then refined to produce chemical feedstocks and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Mitsubishi Chemical Corp. (MCC) is involved in the plastic-to-oil conversion business together with ENEOS Corp., and recently constructed a new chemical recycling facility at MCC’s Ibaraki Plant (Kamisu City, Ibaraki Prefecture).

The Hydro-PRT™ technology of U.K.-based Mura Technology, which was adopted for this facility, is based on Licella's Cat-HTR™ technology. Licella's Cat-HTR™ process is characterized by its ability to convert not only plastics but also biomass into oil. It is envisioned that Licella's technology will be used to produce SAF, bio-naphtha, renewable diesel, and other products from woody residue.

“Stable supply platform for green chemicals” is a major pillar of the MCG Group's management vision “KAITEKI Vision 35,” and the MCG Group is now studying ways to diversify its raw materials with a view to increasing the scale of its chemical recycling facilities in the future. With this investment, the MCG Group will deepen its collaboration with Licella, aiming for the social implementation of oil conversion technology using waste plastics and biomass as feedstock and expansion of the business.

Curtis Schickner, President of Diamond Edge Ventures, said: “Licella’s Cat-HTR™ platform offers a scalable and flexible pathway to produce circular chemicals and sustainable fuels from hard-to-recycle waste streams and biomass—exactly the kind of innovation needed to build a stable supply platform for green chemicals. By partnering with Licella at this pivotal stage, including supporting its efforts with the Japanese consortium on sustainable aviation fuel production, we are helping to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, circular economy.”

Dr. Len Humphreys, Co-Founder & CEO of Licella, said: “We are proud to partner with Diamond Edge Ventures and Mitsubishi Chemical Group at this important moment for Licella. Their funding and strategic support validate the commercial readiness of our Cat-HTR™ platform and its unique ability to deliver scalable, low-carbon solutions for hard-to-recycle plastics and biomass residues. Together, we aim to accelerate the shift to fossil-replacement solutions that contribute to MCG’s vision for a greener, more sustainable chemical industry.”
