""This project stands at the crossroads of two global challenges—waste management and decarbonization of transportation. Our Phase-1 completion confirms that we can turn trash into clean jet fuel at scale in Ghana 🇬🇭, with measurable environmental and economic impact,"" said Mr. Frederick Opoku Agyekum, Project Development Director of F&B Bio Recyclage Ltd.

The project has already attracted strong interest from international SAF off takers, infrastructure investors, and development finance institutions due to its replicable model, positive carbon intensity profile, and scalability across emerging and developed markets alike. In addition, we have established strong partnerships with local governments, waste management authorities, as well as leading technology and engineering partners to ensure smooth project implementation. These collaborations position us to deliver the project effectively, while creating both economic and environmental value.

Technology and Process: The project leverages state-of-the-art gasification technology to convert solid waste—such as municipal solid waste or industrial residues—into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This syngas is then processed through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven catalytic process developed in the 1920s and refined over decades, to produce liquid hydrocarbons suitable for use as SAF and biodiesel. These fuels offer a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels, with the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels.

The Fischer-Tropsch process is particularly well-suited for this application due to its ability to produce high-quality fuels from diverse feedstocks, including biomass and solid waste. Recent advancements in catalyst formulations and reactor designs have further improved the efficiency and scalability of this technology, making it a cornerstone of modern biofuel production.

Technical Specifications

• Technology: Integrated gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

• Products: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and biodiesel meeting ASTM D7566 & ASTM D975 specifications

• Efficiency: Optimized energy recovery and product yield

• Final Output: 2000 bbl/d (SAF & Bio diesel)

Next Steps; With Phase 1 successfully completed, we are now advancing to Phase 2, which will focus on:

• Detailed engineering and procurement activities

• Environmental permitting and regulatory approvals

• Construction planning and contractor selection

• Financial close and project financing completion

We are currently receiving proposals for Phase 2 from qualified engineering firms and technology partners, to progress toward the Front-End Engineering Design (PRE-FEED) phase. This will be followed by a comprehensive FEED (FEL-3) phase, culminating in the Final Investment Decision (FID) and the commencement of Construction.

We extend our sincere appreciation to our Team, Technology and Engineering partners, advisors, and stakeholders whose expertise and collaboration have been instrumental in achieving this milestone.

In total, the IEA identified 107 countries that had reduced their dependence on fossil fuel imports for electricity generation because of their transition to renewables other than hydropower.
Without those renewables, 60% of electricity generation in the UK would depend on imported fossil fuels the IEA report said.

In the executive summary to its annual renewable energy report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said, “Global renewable power capacity is expected to double between now and 2030, increasing by 4,600 gigawatts. This is roughly the equivalent of adding China, the European Union, and Japan’s power generation capacity combined to the global energy mix. Solar PV accounts for almost 80 percent of the global increase, followed by wind, hydropower, bioenergy, and geothermal.

“In more than 80 percent of countries worldwide, renewable power capacity is set to grow faster between 2025 and 2030 than it did over the previous five year period. However, challenges including grid integration, supply chain vulnerabilities, and financing are also increasing.” You can download the full report at this link.

Carbon Brief has taken the data supplied by the IEA and converted it into a chart that illustrates the changes.

The 2025 Renewables report shows that more than 100 countries have cut their dependence on fossil fuel imports and saved hundreds of billions of dollars by continuing to invest in renewables. This is despite the global full court press in favor of expanding the use of fossil fuels from the US being conducted by the current US administration.

The UK, Germany, and Chile have reduced their need for imported coal and gas by around a third since 2010, mainly by building wind and solar power. Denmark has cut its reliance on fossil fuel imports by nearly half over the same period. Renewable expansion allowed these nations to collectively avoid importing 700 million tons of coal and 400 billion cubic meters of methane in 2023, which is equivalent to about 10 percent of global consumption.

In doing so, the fuel importing countries saved more than $1.3 trillion between 2010 and 2023 that would otherwise have been spent on imported fossil fuels. The Renewables 2025 report compares recent trends in renewable expansion to an alternative “low renewable-energy source” scenario in which the increase in local renewable energy did not take place. Roughly 80% of this new renewable capacity was built in nations that rely on coal and gas imports to generate electricity.

In total, the IEA identified 107 countries that had reduced their dependence on fossil fuel imports for electricity generation because of their transition to renewables other than hydropower. 38 cut their reliance on electricity from imported coal and gas by more than 10 percentage points and eight had seen that share drop by more than 30 percentage points.

In its report, the IEA stressed that renewables “inherently strengthen energy supply security,” because they generate electricity domestically, while also “improving…economic resilience” in those countries. The effect is seen most strongly in countries that previously relied on methane gas exports from Russia. Bulgaria, Romania and Finland, which all were dependent on Russian methane supplies, have all brought their reliance on imported fossil fuels close to zero in recent years by building renewables.

In the UK, where there has been mounting opposition to renewables from right wing political parties, the IEA says reliance on electricity generated with imported fossil fuels has dropped from 45% to under 25% in the past ten years, thanks primarily to the growth of wind and solar power. Without those renewables, 60% of electricity generation in the UK would depend on imported fossil fuels the IEA report said. The same is true for China and the European Union. Finally, the IEA points out that spending on renewables rather than imported fossil fuels keeps more investment in domestic economies and supports local jobs.

Renewable Transportation

The IEA Renewables 2025 report also deals with the transportation and heat sectors. For transportation, it said “renewable energy consumption in transport is expected to rise 50 percent by 2030. The largest share of this growth — 45 percent — will come from renewable electricity used for electric vehicles, especially in China and Europe.”

“Road biofuels contribute the second-largest share — 35 percent –with significant growth in Brazil, Indonesia, India and Malaysia, supported by tightening mandates and rising fuel demand. Aviation and maritime fuel use make up 10 percent of growth, primarily owing to mandates in Europe, and the remaining 10 percent comes from bio-methane, renewable hydrogen,and hydrogen based fuels, with activity concentrated in the United States and Europe.

“Globally, EVs are expected to account for more than 15% of the vehicle stock by 2030, with renewable electricity meeting more than half of electricity demand in key markets. In China, EVs represent more than one third of cars on the road by 2030 as vehicle costs decline and charging infrastructure continues to be enhanced. At the same time, renewable electricity is expected to make up over half of China’s total power generation.”

With respect to aircraft and maritime fuels, the IEA report claims sustainable aviation fuel will account for 2% of demand by 2030 — an indication that uptake of SAF will be constrained in the near term by higher prices. “Mandates in the European Union and United Kingdom, incentives in the United States, and blending targets in Japan drive most of this growth.”

Demand for biodiesel in the maritime industry is projected to double by 2030. That sounds promising, but only means it will account for about 1% of all maritime fuel usage. There is a long way to to yet in that sector.

For road transportation, the IEA is forecasting an increase in biofuel use of 50% by 2030, except in the US, where “lower EV sales and recent changes to Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards that reduce overall fleet efficiency have prompted us to increase our [conventional] transport fuel demand forecast from last year.”

Heat

“Heat accounted for almost half of total final energy consumption and 37% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2024,” the IEA reports says. “Annual heat consumption expanded by 6 percent globally over 2018-2024. Renewable energy, excluding traditional uses of biomass, met only half of this increase, with its share in global heat consumption rising to 14 percent in 2024. Nearly 80 percent of global growth in renewable heat use was in the form of bioenergy — especially in industry — and renewable electricity — mainly in buildings.”

The largest increase in renewable heat in the past 6 years occurred in China, supported by strong policy incentives and falling renewable electricity prices. The next largest increase took place in India and the European Union. Heat pump deployment has played a major role, translating into rising consumption of both electricity and ambient heat for space and water heating. Large additional contributions also came from electric heating equipment and solar thermal and geothermal developments in China.

The Takeaway

What can we learn from this year’s Renewables 2025 report? Simply this. The transition to renewables is now unstoppable. Not only is renewable energy the least expensive source of electricity, it promotes energy security so that countries that do not enjoy a surfeit of fossil fuels can power their economies themselves without being dependent on other countries.

Think about it this way. One of the reasons Japan attacked the US on December 7, 1941 was because the US had interdicted its supply of oil. If Japan in 1941 had access to renewable energy, Pearl Harbor may never have happened, which means Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never have happened either. The price of fossil fuels is much, much higher than the price of gasoline at the pump.

The other benefit is that fossil fuels are so inefficient that two-thirds or more of the energy contained in them is wasted, much of it as heat. Renewables are orders of magnitude more efficient. What possible sense could it make to go to war — actually or virtually — over something so wasteful? That is just insane!

The US, sadly, is looking at things through the wrong end of the telescope. Its leaders will be vilified by history as clueless morons. Despite all their chest thumping on behalf of fossil fuels, they will end up being exposed as the idiots they truly are.

The IEA has been criticized repeatedly for being too conservative in its prognostications. If that is so, then the renewable energy future is even brighter than they claim.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/solar-farm-wisconsin-doral.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 19:57:50.653413

Oxfordshire, UK-based company Skyfly has been developing the Axe in the UK so far. The company completed Europe’s first airfield-to-airfield flight of an eVTOL aircraft using its Axe prototype in July.

The Axe has an all-electric range of 100 miles (160km) and an estimated top cruise speed of 100 mph (161 km/h). A hybrid option is under development, which will offer a 300 mile (480km) range.

The two-seat aircraft is powered by eight electric motors – two on each wingtip within a single nacelle and is powered by swappable lithium batteries housed within the fuselage.

USA flight testing

Following the Axe’s North American debut at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s AirVenture show at Oshkosh during July, Skyfly’s prototype Axe VCA (Serial Number 001, registration N250EV) will now remain in the USA.

Skyfly plans to conduct verification flights this winter and begin customer demonstrations in the New Year.

According to Skyfly, relocating flight testing to the USA will mean engineers can test the aircraft through the winter thanks to the more stable weather. It will also allow the Axe SN001 to act as a customer demonstrator in the country.

The company is targeting summer 2026 for the first customer deliveries.

Michael Thompson, CEO of Skyfly said, “Receiving FAA Experimental authorization is a major milestone for Skyfly. It allows us to move forward with piloted flight testing under the world’s most respected aviation regulator, while positioning the Axe at the heart of the US market – the largest and most dynamic general aviation community in the world.

“With this approval, the Axe begins the next phase of its journey from prototype to production aircraft, as we continue to demonstrate that a safe, efficient, and truly practical personal electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft is already here.”

MOSAIC rules for eVTOLs

In July, the FAA introduced the MOSAIC rule, which puts smaller eVTOL aircraft into the LSA category. This offers a simpler and shorter certification pathway outside of Part 23, which is for larger aircraft and includes airworthiness standards for utility and commuter category aircraft.

It allows smaller eVTOL aircraft, such as the Axe to be flown by those holding a Sports Pilot Certificate, in addition to a full pilot license. The new rules will also allow the Axe to be used for some commercial purposes.",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Axe-Oshkosh.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-10-10 20:57:51.014751

From plant to plant, the list of variables any leadership team may have to navigate when working to bring a CCS project to bear can seem never-ending and nuanced—even the smallest differences can create big challenges. Above-ground geography and below-ground geology both matter, but for different reasons. CO2 infrastructure experts and technology providers are important, so too are carbon-focused end-users. Internal team buy-in is crucial, almost as much as the support of external stakeholders.

The road to fully integrated CCS or carbon neutrality is—and has been—different from plant to plant for producers not linked to a multi-state pipeline solution. Those that have made progress to date have taken a multifaceted approach. Some are further along than others, sometimes based on their location.

Ethanol Producer Magazine checked in with several ethanol producers across the country on progress in planning, permitting and their respective carbon-intensity reduction plans. Support for individual, plant-specific CCS has sprouted and spread—despite its challenges—from the Corn Belt to the West Coast.

Conestoga’s Net-Zero Goal

Conestoga Energy CEO Tom Willis says his team in Kansas was all about carbon before carbon was ever cool. According to Willis, Conestoga was the first to take low-carbon fuel to California under the LCFS back in 2010. Through two Kansas plants, Conestoga produces roughly 200 million gallons of ethanol per year: 115 MMgy at the Arkalon facility near Liberal and 62 MMgy at the Bonanza plant in Garden City.

The Arkalon facility has been capturing CO2 for roughly 15 years as part of an enhanced oil recovery CO2 injection program operated by CapturePoint LLC throughout parts of Kansas and Oklahoma.

“We looked at carbon and said we could expand and grow,” Willis says of his team’s early adoption of a carbon-focused strategy. Today, Conestoga refers to itself as a low-carbon solutions provider, not just an ethanol producer.

“We are trying to become net zero,” Willis says.

To do that, Conestoga has expanded its CCS efforts to both plants. In May, the company announced drilling was complete on its first Class VI CCS well near its Garden City plant. Willis called the well the “cornerstone of Conestoga’s initiative to permanently store carbon dioxide emissions generated during the ethanol production process.”

The CCS project will be a long-term staple of Conestoga’s net-zero vision, Willis says, but the company will continue to explore ways to lower its CI score and maintain a strong connection to markets in need of carbon solutions, both domestic and foreign.

After completing work on the Class VI well, several interested parties from fertilizer manufacturers to warehouse owners have reached out to Conestoga regarding carbon-sequestration possibilities. “They are coming to us,” Willis says. “We don’t have to go to them.”

The carbon-centric model is one others can follow, Willis says, regardless of a plant’s geographic or geologic footprint. While he notes some plants aren’t able to sequester, he also says every plant can benefit from carbon-related planning or investments, some but not all of which are related to the continuance of the 45Z tax credit.

In addition to the 2024 purchase of a Class VI well which included the leases and easements, Conestoga has also purchased CCS equipment and a CO2 flood field that can use fermentation CO2 for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery efforts in Kansas. The Class VI well work has now moved onto the permitting stage for the U.S. EPA to review.

In August, Conestoga also acquired SAFFiRE Renewables LLC from Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures LLC. As envisioned, SAFFiRE’s process technology will enable the production of ultra low-carbon intensity ethanol and intermediates.

Willis says his team is working on the buildout of a pilot plant at the Arkalon facility that could be ready by Q4 2026.

The SAFFiRE technology will aid Conestoga’s efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel feedstock. “The IP acquired in this transaction will provide us with tremendous optionality, not only as it relates to SAF feedstock production, but across our operations,” Willis said in August. “The momentum behind low-CI fuels is undeniable, driven by regulatory requirements, corporate commitments and environmental necessity.”

On top of the Class VI well work, investment in SAFFiRE and the overarching company approach to become a multifaceted low-carbon solutions provider that just happens to make ethanol, Conestoga is planning to invest in paying and training farmers for grain traceability. Such an effort will further reduce the plant’s CI score and help make Conestoga’s sustainability-infused growth plan “sustainable,” Willis says.

One Earth Sequestration

Since first partnering with the Illinois State Geological Survey in 2020, Illinois-based One Earth Energy continues to make progress on a CCS well and CO2 pipeline project that would capture and inject fermentation CO2. A proposed 5.62 mile underground pipeline would move fermentation CO2 from the ethanol plant to an injection well that has already been drilled.

Steve Kelly, general manager for the plant near Gibson City, says his team continues to work through the EPA to receive the Class VI permit for the well. The EPA expects a final permit decision in March 2026, according to the agency’s Class VI well permit tracker.

One Earth Energy created a website—One Earth Sequestration—to keep the public updated on the project, specifically around water quality and safety. The new website explains the state-of-the-art safety features that will be used, including automatic shut-off valves, around-the-clock in-person monitoring, reduced pipeline segments, leak detection, flow measurement devices, monitoring wells, six-foot burial and underground signage and more. Kelly and the team have also organized hazmat training hosted by the Illinois Fire Service, in addition to specific CO2 pipeline training hosted by ExxonMobil. The current work is all in addition to the pre-feasibility and geological studies One Earth Energy already completed to ensure such a project would be economically and environmentally sound, Kelly says.

The next milestones on the timeline revolve around the Class VI permit, acquiring the Certificate of Authority from the Illinois Commerce Commission to construct a CO2 pipeline and securing a Special Use Permit in McLean County, Illinois, at the sequestration well site.

Kelly says the company has worked with governing bodies ranging from local municipalities up to state and federal agencies. It has also worked with landowners to voluntarily secure pore space and pipeline lease agreements. One Earth has held more than 70 public meetings or sessions with farmers.

The CCS work and investment will impact the plant and community in multiple ways, Kelly says. “Once completed, our CCS will capture and compress 521,000 metric tons of CO2 annually. That’s like taking nearly 124,000 gasoline-powered cars off the road for one year.”

According to One Earth Sequestration, the project will generate $231 million in economic activity for Ford County, Illinois, including more than 300 new jobs and nearly $19 million in county and state tax revenue.

“For One Earth Energy, it means we’ll have the opportunity to expand our business into sustainable aviation fuel, which is the next step in renewable fuels,” Kelly says. “It also brings additional stability and longevity to our business and community.”

Chief Ethanol Set for November

Nebraska-based Chief Ethanol General Manager Wayne Garrett joined Brooke Rollins, USDA Secretary, in Nebraska in August to talk biofuels, agriculture and America’s renewable energy future. In November, Garrett expects to be capturing CO2 from fermentation ethanol.

Starting in 2021, Chief Ethanol partnered with Catahoula Resources and the Energy Minerals Group along with Battelle to develop CCS solutions for Chief’s two ethanol plants in Nebraska.

The new CCS infrastructure will capture and store 350,000 metric tons of CO2 through compression stations that will ultimately link to a Catahoula operated pipeline solution.

Gevo Selling Carbon Credits

Gevo Inc. has already earned dividends from its $210 million acquisition of a North Dakota Ethanol plant fully equiped with operating CCS assets. After purchasing Red Trail Energy in early 2025, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber renamed the assets Net-Zero North.

In July, Gevo announced it was officially selling carbon abatement credits into the market. The CCS process creates a carbon removal credit or CO2 removal certificate (CORC). In Gevo’s case, a global financial and technology company purchases CORCs and then retires them to meet its own CO2 abatement requirements.

Puro.earth, a Nasdaq-funded firm that certifies CORCs across the globe and provides a marketplace for suppliers and buyers, provided certification of the Gevo produced CORCs.

“Gevo is demonstrating that durable carbon removal isn’t some distant solution,” says Trenton Spindler, chief growth officer of Puro.earth, “It’s available now. With Puro.earth. certified CORCs, buyers worldwide can act decisively to tackle their toughest emissions with confidence in real, permanent results.”

Puro.earth has strict standards for CORC generation, including 1,000-plus-year permeance of storage. In July, Puro.earth’s CORC index showed CORC prices at roughly $150 each. From 2020 to November 2024, Puro.earth said the use of CORCs increased by 1,200%, rising from 12,000 units produced and sold per year to nearly 160,000. Starting in 2022, many CORC buyers began seeking offtake agreements of three- to five-year periods, but by 2024, many larger CORC buyers were looking for even longer-term CORC supply agreements.

Blue Flint’s CCS Tax Equity Benefits

CCS work at Harvestone Low Carbon Partners’ Blue Flint Ethanol plant in North Dakota continues to pay off. After commencing operation of a 125,000-metric-ton CO2 capture infrastructure and pipeline project in 2023, HLCP announced nearly a year later that it had closed on a first-of-its-kind tax equity financing round with Bank of America worth $205 million.

HLCP was able to structure a tax equity financing package that would allow Bank of America to participate in the 45Q federal tax credit benefits and purchase 45Z clean fuel tax credits generated by Blue Flint’s CCS biorefinery operations.

Karen Fang, global head of sustainable finance at Bank of America, says her team has a strong track record of innovative financing transactions for decarbonization technologies including CCS. Essentially, Bank of America receives that tax credit benefit in exchange for financing. HLCP has not said how it will utilize any Bank of America proceeds, but it does operate additional ethanol facilities that are actively developing or studying CCS infrastructure in North Dakota and Indiana.

Permitting in Process

The Andersons Inc. has acquired full ownership of the four ethanol plants it previously co-owned with a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp., a move the publicly traded grain and biofuels company says will allow for greater efficiency and streamlining of its operations. In its Q2 earnings call, the company stated that the regulatory environment for biofuels, “may support new opportunities,” including at the company’s Clymers, Indiana, facility where a Class VI well permit has been filed with the EPA for CCS.

Front Range Energy in Colorado continues developing its CCS operation, with a completed test well on its property, and is awaiting the Class VI permit. Through a subsidiary called Carbon Capture Solutions, Front Range Energy is playing a part in shaping the future regulatory and compliance framework for CCS in Colorado. In December 2024, representatives from Carbon Capture Solutions participated in discussions with the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) regarding state-level authority over geologic carbon storage. ECMC has now created a state-based policy on CCS with the goal of obtaining primacy over the EPA, similar to other states, including North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana.

In California, Aemetis awaits approval of its Class VI well permit for CCS operation that will inject roughly 1.4 million tons of CO2 into a saline formation. Baker Hughes, an oil and gas drilling company, is leading the underground engineering and drilling work, including consultation and project design. ATSI, an engineering, procurement, construction and project management firm, is helping on the project as well.

Expertise and Experience

Vault 44.01 is contracted or partnered with seven different ethanol producers. The CCS experts help each create on-site or near on-site CCS capabilities. Scott Rennie, president and CEO of Vault 44.01, says despite a range of challenges each plant may face, Vault 44.01 has a unique combination of technical expertise and CCS experience.

Hugh Caperton, senior vice president of development for Vault, says the company has grown a presence across the ethanol sector because it has expertise in all facets required to make a CCS project successful, including landowner agreements, commercial development structuring, technical expertise and permitting.

Cardinal Ethanol was the first to join with Vault 44.01. Today, other Vault 44.01 partners include plants owned by Valero, POET and Alto Ingredients. Cardinal Ethanol could earn its Class VI well permit in January 2026, according to projections by the EPA tracker database.

Rennie is quick to point out that the state where a CCS project is located greatly impacts the timeline for completion. North Dakota has seen multiple projects completed because the state has primacy over CCS regulations and permitting. States without primacy must rely on federal regulations, drawing out the timeline. The current administration has made a big difference in the speed at which the Vault team can move on permitting progress, Rennie says.

“We’ve made more progress on our permits recently than we have in the previous two years under the past administration,” Rennie says.

Like Rennie, Caperton is optimistic about the pace of project timelines in 2025 and beyond. He points out that CCS has always had bipartisan support in Congress. Every project will have challenges in design, community engagement and permitting.

“For us, it comes down to having the right skillset and energy level to bring these things to completion,” Rennie says. “Our team had a track record even before we started helping ethanol producers.”

Both Rennie and Caperton believe the ethanol sector’s CCS abilities will act as a seed from which producers and future industries can grow.

“CCS is a gateway,” Caperton says.

For its current producer partners, Vault is focusing on on-site or near on-site CCS. Initially, the team explored options to create connected CO2 sequestration hubs. Rennie says the economics and land commitment agreements were too difficult to pursue. The cost of running and operating pipeline can sometimes be in the range of $1 million or more per half mile. Some CO2 hubs connecting ethanol plants would need at least 40 miles of pipeline, Rennie explains, as most plants in a concentrated area suitable for a hub are 40 to 50 miles apart.

In most cases, Vault is capturing a single source of CO2 and has a flowline on the producer’s property connected to a sequestration or compression station.

“If you were to look at our projects from outer space, the projects are going to look very similar,” Rennie says.

In March last year, Alto Ingredients signed with Vault to further its CCS aspirations. Through the agreement, Alto will install CCS equipment at its Pekin, Illinois, dry mill, and Vault will transport and permanently store the CO2 underground within close proximity.

Bryon McGregor, president and CEO of Alto, says the agreement with Vault will serve shareholders and community stakeholders alike. In addition to operating two ethanol production facilities, Alto operates a liquid CO2 facility in Boardman, Oregon. In early 2025, Alto acquired Kodiak Carbonic LLC, a beverage-grade liquid carbon dioxide processor for $7.25 million.

“In our ongoing pursuit to optimize product value, we identified the beverage-grade liquid CO2 plant as a significant opportunity and pursued the acquisition to continue to expand our premium ingredients portfolio,” McGregor says.

The Time Is Now for On-Site CCS

Rennie says there has never been a better time for CO2 producers like Alto, Cardinal Ethanol and others to pursue CCS. “Now is the right time. The industry has learned a lot about CCS and the current administration has a proclivity for action and accountability.

“The project with Alto exemplifies our view that one of the best options for CCS is often a local solution.”

Sylvain Riba, president and CEO of the Houston-based team of underground energy storage and subsurface injection experts at Geostock Sandia, says the ethanol industry has maintained CCUS momentum since an uptick started in 2020. Riba and his team have been involved with eight ethanol-related CCS wells in the Midwest over the past five years, including the well for North Dakota’s Blue Flint Ethanol.

“We make the earth the best place to store energy,” Riba says. “We know how to drill wells and demonstrate this is the right place to store.”

Geostock Sandia expanded its drilling services for Class VI wells in the early 2000s and has since been a big participant in the CarbonSAFE program under the U.S. Department of Energy. Prior to that, Geostock Sandia helped lead the creation of salt cavern storage for hydrocarbons in the U.S.

Like the natural gas industry, Riba says many ethanol producers are now aware of the value and need for storing carbon.

“A lot of producers realize it’s possible to reduce the intensity of the existing industry and infrastructure in-place,” Riba says.

Successful projects led by teams like Geostock Sandia have helped show what is possible, he adds. The addition of voluntary carbon markets and private equity investors that want to participate in CCS or credit markets has also helped build momentum in the ethanol space.

“If I’m an ethanol producer today, I need to know CCS is safe, it is cost effective and it can really help improve your product,” Riba says.

He explains that a project started in 2025 will still take roughly three years to go through studies, well testing, permitting, infrastructure build-out and additional work, he says. Geostock Sandia can provide management of the process, man the facilities or train current workforce and help maintain the infrastructure for the life of the well. States including North Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana are all prime for well drilling, he says.

Because of the work and history of Geostock Sandia, Riba says the process today is simpler than most might think. It’s about logistics and managing the land, all skills ethanol producers already possess, he says. Trading on the carbon market is similar to any other daily process, including managing grain payments, he adds.

“Underground storage is really safe and now the momentum is there and it is a really good time to do it,” Riba says. “You don’t have to bring a lot of technology or create a complex logistics process. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.”

This partnership aims to advance key environmental objectives, including the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable energy technologies, and zero-emission transportation solutions. By pooling their resources and expertise, both nations are committed to reducing emissions, promoting renewable energy, and achieving net-zero targets. This collaborative effort not only highlights the shared environmental goals of Australia and Singapore but also sets a strong precedent for international cooperation in tackling climate change and fostering a greener, more sustainable global economy.

Singapore and Australia have formalised a new agreement aimed at advancing their clean energy ambitions, particularly in the areas of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biofuels, and other green energy initiatives. The announcement, made on October 8 during the 10th Annual Leaders’ Meeting, marks a pivotal moment in the partnership between the two nations. This agreement falls under the umbrella of an upgraded Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP 2.0), which encompasses a broader range of goals, including net-zero emissions targets, enhanced defence cooperation, and bolstered trade relations.

This newly signed agreement seeks to foster closer collaboration between Singapore and Australia on clean energy technologies, with a special focus on sustainable aviation fuel. One of the key components of this collaboration is the agreement signed between Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry and the state of Victoria in Australia. The deal outlines several key areas of exploration, including the development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, the advancement of zero-emission transportation solutions, renewable energy storage technologies, hydrogen energy, and offshore wind power projects.

The CSP 2.0 framework aims to support these efforts over the next decade, offering a structured approach to achieve long-term goals while promoting innovation and investment in the clean energy sector. The plan also includes increased public and private sector cooperation, with both governments committing to mobilising the necessary resources to accelerate the development of these technologies.

In terms of current progress, Singapore’s biofuels sector is more advanced than Australia’s, with the country already housing one of the world’s largest sustainable aviation fuel refineries. The Neste refinery in Singapore has a production capacity of 1 million tonnes of SAF annually, setting a significant benchmark for global biofuel production. This infrastructure plays a crucial role in helping Singapore meet its environmental and sustainability goals, and the country plans to further solidify its leadership in this field by introducing a SAF blending rule in 2026. This rule will require airlines to use at least 1% SAF in all departing flights, with the long-term goal of raising this proportion to between 3% and 5% by 2030.

Australia, however, is not far behind in its clean energy ambitions. While the country’s biofuels sector is still in development, it has an advantage in biofuel feedstock production. Australia’s agricultural industry, particularly its tallow production, plays a vital role in the global renewable fuel supply chain. Tallow, a key raw material for producing renewable fuel, is abundant in Australia, and the country has become a significant supplier of this material to Singapore. In 2024, Singapore imported 296,000 tonnes of Australian tallow, underscoring the deepening energy relationship between the two nations.

To support Australia’s transition to cleaner energy sources, the government has established a federal fund worth A$1.1 billion (approximately US$730 million). This fund is designed to help meet the country’s ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030, with particular focus on sustainable fuel development, renewable energy projects, and clean energy infrastructure. The commitment to supporting the green energy transition is a clear indication of Australia’s determination to play a significant role in the global shift toward sustainability.

In addition to clean energy projects, Singapore and Australia have also strengthened their cooperation on electricity trade through the finalisation of the Cross-Border Electricity Trade framework. Initially developed in 2024, this framework aims to enhance regional electricity trade and energy security, contributing to the broader goals of achieving net-zero emissions for both countries. This framework is expected to facilitate the development of energy transmission infrastructure between the two nations, paving the way for new projects such as Australia’s SunCable initiative.

The SunCable project is one of the most ambitious clean energy projects in the region. It seeks to transmit solar power generated in Australia to Singapore via an undersea cable, known as the Australia-Asia Power Link. Scheduled for completion by 2035, this project has the potential to revolutionise the way both countries approach energy generation and consumption, providing Singapore with a reliable, renewable energy source and supporting Australia’s renewable energy export goals.

Beyond the development of clean energy infrastructure, the two nations are also working on standardising renewable energy certificates (RECs) to help industries in both countries meet their sustainability targets. This move aims to streamline the process of tracking and trading renewable energy credits, providing businesses with the tools they need to prove their environmental commitments and make significant strides toward achieving their sustainability goals.

Australia and Singapore have forged a groundbreaking agreement focused on clean energy and aviation, aiming to reduce emissions, promote sustainable aviation fuel, and drive renewable energy innovation. This partnership paves the way for a greener, more sustainable future for both nations and the global community.

The collaborative efforts between Singapore and Australia represent a powerful example of how nations can come together to drive the global transition to cleaner energy. By pooling their resources, expertise, and infrastructure, the two countries are positioning themselves at the forefront of the sustainable energy revolution. Through joint ventures in SAF, biofuels, and renewable energy, Singapore and Australia are not only working toward achieving their own ambitious climate goals but are also setting a global precedent for how nations can work in tandem to address climate change and build a sustainable future. The next decade will undoubtedly witness further developments in these areas, as the CSP 2.0 framework lays the groundwork for a greener, more interconnected world.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-10-03-at-12-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 15:56:19.747958

Unlike upcoming technologies like hydrogen or electric planes, which need major infrastructure overhauls and aircraft redesigns, SAF works seamlessly with current aircraft and fueling systems. This allows for immediate emission reductions of up to 80% over the entire product lifecycle. As the industry aims for net-zero emissions by 2050, SAF acts as a vital bridge between today’s operations and future innovative propulsion technologies, making it a key element in achieving long-term sustainability goals.

The UAE has positioned itself as a global leader in this transition by incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its comprehensive Net Zero 2050 Strategy and utilizing its distinctive strengths as an energy hub and international aviation center. Through collaborations with leading airlines, energy corporations, and technology enterprises, the UAE is advancing with extensive SAF production utilizing both bio-based feedstocks and synthetic fuel pathways powered by renewable energy and green hydrogen.

Flagship airports in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are strategically advancing as innovation hubs for sustainable aviation. These developments integrate SAF deployment with cutting-edge green infrastructure and smart operational practices. By harmonizing government policies, industry collaborations, and R&D initiatives, the UAE is not only shaping regional standards but also setting a global benchmark for sustainable aviation leadership. [The upcoming Dubai Airshow (November 17-21, 2025) will feature prominent panels and demonstrations focused on propelling sustainable aviation forward.]

Over the next 15 years, SAF is poised to become the primary driver for reducing aviation's carbon footprint. It is the key to helping airlines meet their near- and mid-term net-zero goals. Driven by regulatory requirements in regions like the EU, US, and parts of Asia, airlines are expected to steadily increase their use of SAF from less than 1% of today's global jet fuel demand to double-digit blending levels by the late 2030s.

Combined with ongoing advancements in aircraft and operational efficiencies, SAF is set to deliver the majority of near-term emission reductions. This will bridge the gap until hydrogen and electric technologies reach commercial-scale maturity beyond 2040. The market's rapid acceleration is clear: projected SAF deliveries are estimated to surge from 2.28 million metric tons in 2025 to a staggering 74.8 million metric tons by 2040. This growth is already underway, with SAF deliveries to airports having jumped by an impressive 453% between 2021 and 2024.

Several key factors are driving this accelerated adoption. Multi-year off-take agreements between airlines and producers are building market stability, while policy incentives like subsidies and tax credits are making SAF a more viable option. The rapid scaling of innovative production pathways, such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and power-to-liquid (PtL), is also crucial. As blending and depot infrastructure expands at major hubs, it will facilitate smoother integration into existing supply chains, while increasing corporate demand for sustainable travel will further support market growth through ""book-and-claim"" systems

The accelerated adoption of SAF is being driven by two key developments: long-term production contracts and investments in blending depot infrastructure.

Multi-year SAF production agreements between airlines, producers, and energy companies provide financial stability for fuel suppliers, enabling them to expand refinery capacity and invest in advanced technologies like power-to-liquid (PtL) and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). Simultaneously, contracts to develop blending depots and distribution networks ensure SAF can be efficiently integrated into existing supply chains at airports worldwide. These depots facilitate mixing SAF with conventional jet fuel to meet certified blending ratios, while also streamlining logistics, reducing costs, and guaranteeing consistent availability for airlines.

Together, these production agreements and blending infrastructure contracts are resolving distribution bottlenecks and creating the necessary ecosystem for rapid SAF adoption. As both parts of the value chain develop, airlines will gain dependable access to larger SAF volumes at more competitive prices, speeding up the industry's journey toward net-zero goals.

At Dubai Airshow 2025, SAF will take center stage with dedicated sustainability forums, live demonstrations, and industry partnerships showcasing ways to increase production and adoption. The event will emphasize airline–producer collaborations, new fuel technologies, and policy frameworks driving aviation’s net-zero transition.",,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:15.235857

Something that I heard a few times while there was that there has been some “industry fatigue”—the idea that biochar has generated plenty of interest and conversation over the years, but still hasn’t fully delivered on its potential. That said, it was clear from the diverse group of energized attendees from across every corner of market development that real, measurable progress is finally underway. The discussions got me thinking of a story I wrote about 14 years ago, titled “Beyond the Hype.” For that piece, I spoke with soil scientists, researchers and producers about biochar’s promise, from climate mitigation to bioenergy. One small-scale producer told me about the hurdles of scaling up and the difficult economics, saying: “Although researchers are currently willing to pay $1,000 to $2,000 per ton for biochar, in the long term it will probably be worth about $100 per ton … if you’re making 2 or 3 tons a day, that doesn’t pay the bills.”

That early perspective has aged well. While his estimate was on the low end of today’s price points, the challenges he flagged—especially around scaling—were echoed throughout the conference. We explore this theme further in our page-32 feature, Buzzing on Biochar, which follows the journeys of two successful companies producing biochar and biocarbon pellets as a fossil fuel replacement.

On the topic of industry gatherings, I’m writing this just days ahead of the North American SAF Conference, also in Minneapolis. While the sustainable aviation fuel industry has certainly weathered turbulence over the past year (and still is), there are still many bright spots—especially on the global stage. In our page-20 feature, “Decarbonizing Paradise,” Associate Editor Katie Schroeder tells the story of Par Pacific, which is moving toward commercial-scale SAF production in Hawaii. As the state’s only refinery, Par has faced its share of challenges, but the project is now nearing the finish line and bringing with it meaningful economic and environmental benefits. This facility’s startup marks a major milestone in an otherwise challenging period for project development.

You’ll also want to read “A Full Circle Feedstock” on page 26, which explores the journey of a family-owned sawmill turning residuals into wood pellets with the addition of innovative drying technology. For Conner Holdings, risk turned into reward. As Junior Staff Writer Caitlin Scheresky reports, the company entered the pellet sector with little prior experience. CEO James Foss put it this way: “It was risky, but it was a calculated risk. We have two operating sawmills with residuals, so we already had our feedstock.” He added that during the installation process, the company’s owner “seemed like he was kicking himself for not doing this sooner.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Anna_Simet_2025_1471b63243.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:58:17.201779

Global demand for biofuels is expected to reach 825 million metric tons per year by 2030, according to the Renewables 2025 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA). This figure represents a 25% increase from 2024 levels. The IEA states that biofuels could account for 27% of global vegetable oil production and 80% of waste and residue oil supply by the end of the decade.

Strong reliance on imports

Since 2020, used oil imports to the European Union and the United States have increased twentyfold. Around 60% of these volumes originate from China and Indonesia. This rapid development raises concerns about the reliability of the supply chain. The IEA notes that the United States, formerly a net exporter, has become a net importer due to the expansion of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

New blending obligations in Europe, targeting a 6% share for aviation fuels by 2030, alongside maritime requirements and incentives for low-carbon intensity fuels, are driving up demand for these oils. They are especially valued for their favourable lifecycle emissions profiles.

Diverging regional strategies

Globally, feedstock imports remain limited to around 10% of total demand, but regional differences are becoming more pronounced. Indonesia and Brazil maintain strong domestic availability thanks to local palm oil and sugarcane supplies. In contrast, European and North American markets increasingly rely on imports to meet renewable fuel targets.

Europe remains the largest demand centre for used and residue oils, although consumption is also growing in Southeast Asia to supply Singapore’s refining capacity. In July 2025, used oil prices in the European Union reached their highest level in two years, while U.S. soybean oil futures rose 20%.

Strengthened regulatory oversight

In response to supply chain concerns, authorities in both Europe and the United States have tightened regulatory frameworks. The European Commission launched a Union-wide biofuel database to ensure traceability and prevent double-counting. The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme suspended certificates for over 130 companies and revised its audit procedures.

In the United States, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated tax credits for imported biofuels, except those sourced from Canada and Mexico. Proposed updates to the Renewable Fuel Standard also halve credit values for fuels made from imported feedstocks.

Limited supply of advanced feedstocks

Despite growing interest in next-generation fuels, pathways relying on advanced feedstocks remain limited. In the IEA’s accelerated scenario, cellulosic ethanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels could quadruple in volume to 45 million metric tons annually by 2030.

The use of lignocellulosic biomass and alcohols is expected to remain restricted to certain markets such as the United Kingdom and the European Union. Technological and economic barriers continue to limit broader deployment.

Rising competition across sectors

Even though sustainable aviation fuel will account for only 2% of total feedstock demand by 2030, its expansion is placing direct pressure on already limited used oil supply. The IEA estimates that 55% of SAF inputs will come from waste oils due to their compliance under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and ReFuelEU Aviation regulations.

This growing competition between road transport and aviation for the same premium feedstocks is likely to increase price volatility throughout the decade.

Accelerated scenario and structural constraints

In its accelerated scenario, the IEA projects an additional increase of 125 million metric tons in feedstock demand, reaching 950 million metric tons annually by 2030. Meeting this would require coordinated strategies including yield optimisation, crop rotation, use of degraded land, and the development of emerging technologies.

Despite these constraints, the IEA forecasts a 43 billion litre increase in global biofuel consumption by 2030. However, the agency notes that many producers, particularly of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF, experienced tight or negative margins in 2025.

Performance-based standards are expected to account for one-third of total biofuel demand by 2030, up from just under 20% in 2024, as governments move from volumetric mandates to emission reduction frameworks.

Andy Beshear, First Lady Britainy Beshear and other members of Team Kentucky will travel next week to the United Kingdom, France and Ireland to meet with business leaders and trade officials to further Kentucky’s presence in the region and spur job growth for Kentuckians.

The visit provides an opportunity to build on the Governor’s record-breaking tenure, which includes the highest private-sector investment figure for any administration in state history.

“New jobs mean more opportunities for Kentucky families to pay the bills and live good lives, which is why my administration has worked hard to secure new investment – including foreign investment, which is essential to our success,” Gov. Beshear said. “This visit provides us a great opportunity to connect with leaders of existing Kentucky businesses, companies we want to see invest, and trade organizations as we continue to show the world there’s no better place to do business than our New Kentucky Home.”

The delegation from Team Kentucky will meet with more than 45 companies during the weeklong trip, 16 of which are in existing industries in the commonwealth that currently employ approximately 4,000 people statewide. Collectively, the companies have active projects with the potential to bring up to 2,900 full-time jobs and over $3.5 billion in investment to the state, in addition to future growth opportunities. The Governor will also meet with trade officials in the U.K. and France, which are Kentucky’s second- and third-largest export markets, respectively, with more than $9.7 billion worth of goods exported to the two countries in 2024.

Cabinet for Economic Development Secretary Jeff Noel, who will join Gov. Beshear on the trip, noted the importance of building on existing relationships to secure future wins for Kentucky: “We are fortunate to have a strong and diverse group of international companies here in Kentucky, and this is a great chance to build on that foundation and further those relationships to bring even more great jobs to our state. I look forward to joining the Governor on this critical mission, and I’m excited to see what new opportunities arise following these discussions with innovative and growth-minded companies.”

Kentucky has over 530 internationally owned operations that employ more than 115,000 people statewide. European-owned companies employ over 40,000 people at 238 facilities in Kentucky and represent 17 countries. The commonwealth is home to 26 U.K.-based companies that employ over 2,700 people, 40 French-owned businesses that employ over 5,600 workers, and eight Irish-owned operations that employ nearly 1,000 Kentuckians.

Gov. Beshear’s foreign trade mission builds on the best five-year period for economic growth in state history.

Since the beginning of his administration, Gov. Beshear has announced more than 1,200 private-sector new-location and expansion projects totaling over $43 billion in announced investments, creating more than 63,200 jobs. This is the highest investment figure secured during the tenure of any governor in the commonwealth’s history and $20 billion more than the next highest total.

The robust job creation has been accompanied by rising wages across the commonwealth. Since 2022, the average incentivized hourly wage has topped $26 in three consecutive years for the first time.

Gov. Beshear has announced some of the largest economic development projects in state history, which have solidified Kentucky as the electric vehicle battery production capital of the United States: Ford Motor Co. and SK On’s transformative $5.8 billion, 5,000-job BlueOval SK Battery Park in Hardin County; AESC’s $2 billion, 2,000-job gigafactory project in Warren County; Toyota’s $1.3 billion investment in Scott County; Ford Motor Co.’s $2 billion commitment in Louisville; and Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing’s $712 million investment, creating 1,572 jobs in Shelby County, among others.

The Governor’s administration also secured the largest General Fund budget surplus and Rainy Day Fund. In 2023, Kentucky recorded over 2 million jobs filled for the first time ever and has stayed above that number ever since.

Kentucky also secured rating increases from major credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings, S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.

The project, funded by the Office of Energy Policy within EEC, is one of two SAF studies currently underway in Kentucky. The second, led by WSP, is funded by the Kentucky SAF Coalition.

The study identified corn oil as the safest bet for making SAF in Kentucky thanks to its low risk profile, according to Eduardo Santillan-Jimenez, Ph.D., associate director of CAER’s Sustainable and Alternative Fuels Research Group. He noted that such a finding can guide the decision-making of stakeholders interested in investing in SAF-related projects in the Commonwealth.

By Dave Melanson, UKnow

SAF is an alternative to jet fuel that can be made from everyday materials like plant oils, animal fats and recycled cooking grease, can be blended up to 50% with traditional jet fuel for use in commercial aircraft and represents a market potential of $80 billion globally (by 2035). Jet fuel is the fourth most consumed fuel in the Commonwealth and is critical for Kentucky’s three air hubs as well as for national defense aviation operations at the Kentucky National Guard, Fort Knox and Fort Campbell.

“As the aviation industry looks to diversify its fuel sources and become more sustainable, SAF represents an advanced energy economic development opportunity for Kentucky. It creates new markets for agricultural products, brings investment to processing infrastructure and directly supports fuel diversification and local production supporting Kentucky’s Energy Security Plan,” said Kenya Stump, executive director of the Kentucky Office of Energy Policy.

Essential to this growth, however, is understanding the supply chain risk necessary to attract infrastructure and manufacturing investments. The risk assessment conducted by UK CAER focused on soybean oil, corn oil and distillers corn oil — which are some of the most important agricultural commodities in Kentucky — as well as on animal fats (from livestock rendering), yellow grease (used cooking oil) and brown grease (FOG recovered from grease traps and/or from wastewater treatment plants).

Six types of risks were reviewed based on a U.S. Department of Energy standard that helps investors better understand the risks of using biomass as a resource, making it easier to support and grow the bioeconomy.

“Risk was highest in supplier and supply chain categories,” said Santillan-Jimenez. “The risk associated with the other categories was found to be low. Both yellow and brown grease show high supplier and supply chain risk, while soybean oil shows high supplier risk but medium supply chain risk. Notably, corn oil shows medium supplier risk and low supply chain risk, making it the less risky feedstock overall.”

Cirium’s recent webinar, “Rethinking flight emissions: the case for time-based CO2 calculations” brought together experts from RouteZero and Asset Impact to discuss why the industry needs more robust, data-driven methods for tracking and reducing emissions.

Key takeaways

Traditional distance-based models are too simplistic for effective emissions management.

Time-based, data-driven methods capture the operational realities that matter for decarbonization.

Reliable data supports practical climate action, credible reporting, and effective capital allocation.

Immediate adoption of granular emissions tracking offers meaningful progress while enabling the industry to prepare for future technological shifts.

Why traditional calculations fall short

Most emissions calculations today use the “great circle distance” model, which measures emissions by calculating the direct distance between two airports and applying a standard factor. This method is convenient but fails to reflect the complexity of real-world operations:

Aircraft specifications: Factors like engine efficiency, winglets, and aircraft age significantly impact fuel burn.

Operational realities: Route deviations, weather delays, and extended taxi or wait times add variability.

Aircraft weight: Each flight’s unique weight profile, including passengers and cargo, alters fuel consumption.

As a result, these models treat identical routes as if they have identical emissions, ignoring factors that can make a real difference. The webinar illustrated this with flights from New York to Miami: although traditional models rated them the same, a time-based analysis revealed a substantial emissions difference due to aircraft efficiency and actual flight duration.

Time-based, flight-specific calculations: a better way forward

A time-based, granular approach – like Cirium’s EmeraldSky methodology – accounts for the real variables affecting every flight:

Detailed aircraft data: Specifics on type, engine, age, and modifications.

Flight weight estimation: Actual operational weights, with passenger and cargo estimates factored in.

Real-world operations: Use of satellite-based and diverse data sources to capture flight and taxi times.

Sophisticated fuel burn models: Independent, third-party analysis capturing how fuel use changes during the different stages of a flight.

The result is much more accurate emissions accounting, enabling better decisions by airlines, investors, and policymakers.

Real-world applications: how granular emissions data is already shaping real-world strategies

Data-driven corporate climate action

Dan Brown, RouteZero co-founder and CEO described how detailed flight data enables companies to meaningfully decarbonize business travel. By evaluating every flight’s emissions and other relevant factors, companies can empower employees to choose lower-emission flights without reducing necessary travel. Over a year, these choices can produce significant emissions reductions.

Informing investment and finance

Vincent Jerosch-Herold, Asset Impact’s Chief Product Officer shared how investors and banks benefit from flight-level data. Banks gain a clearer view of which airlines are operating the most efficiently, helping them direct capital to industry leaders in decarbonization. This transparency drives sustainable investment in cleaner fleets and fuels, supporting innovations such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and next-generation aircraft.

Combating greenwashing with transparency

Credible, science-based data is crucial as scrutiny of corporate sustainability claims intensifies. Nearly 70% of organizations now cite greenwashing as a risk. Both Dan and Vincent agreed that transparency and precise measurement are the best defences. Companies that report clear, measurable, flight-specific reductions – not just general pledges – will stand apart in credibility and compliance.

The path to net zero: immediate steps and long-term vision

The journey to net zero aviation by 2050 will require breakthroughs in aircraft technology and SAF production, both demanding years of research and significant investment. However, as emphasized in the webinar, actionable change is possible now by adopting more accurate, flight-level emissions accounting. This enables organizations to:

Make better travel and purchasing decisions

Provide robust data to investors and regulators

Set and verify real, quantifiable emissions targets

By moving beyond outdated calculation models and focusing on accurate, transparent emissions data, the aviation sector can accelerate progress and support a more sustainable future.",https://assets.fta.cirium.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09091435/RethinkingFlightEmissionsWebinar_banner.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:56:54.514117

""His energy and enthusiasm for this fuel, the support provided by Dennis K Burke, Inc, and our joint efforts with the National Biodiesel Board, were instrumental in the adoption of biodiesel in Boston and the region.""

His family's service station in Chelsea, MA became the birthplace of new fuels in the state, becoming the first retailer of both biodiesel and E-85 ethanol. In fact, it was from that very station that the EPA announced its groundbreaking Nonroad, Locomotive, and Marine (NLRM) regulations, underscoring Burke's reputation as a trusted partner in progress.

Ed didn't stop there—he carried his vision all the way to Washington, testifying before the U.S. Senate on the importance of E-85 regulations and infrastructure, giving a voice to early adopters and ensuring policymakers heard from those on the ground leading the transition.

Through his longstanding involvement with AltWheels, Ed Burke has helped cultivate a community of innovators, from fleet managers to clean energy advocates, always pushing the conversation forward. His leadership at Dennis K. Burke, Inc. reflects the same balance of tradition and innovation: a company rooted in service yet unafraid to pioneer the fuels and technologies of the future.

Ed Burke was honored at the AltWheels Fleet Day on October 6th, 2025 at the 22nd Anniversary AltWheels Fleet Day in Norwood MA, where leaders across the energy and transportation sectors again gathered to celebrate innovation and progress toward a cleaner future.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Ed_Burke_5b2dcd017a.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:56:58.638545

This critical legislation aims to restore and strengthen Wisconsin’s forest products industry, a cornerstone of the state’s rural economy.

GLTPA Executive Director Henry Schienebeck testified before the committee on October 9, 2025, expressing strong support for the bill and gratitude to its authors—Senator Mary Felzkowski, Senator Romaine Quinn, Senator Rob Stafsholt, Representative Chanz Green, and Representative Jeff Mursau—for their leadership.

“For decades, Wisconsin’s forest products industry has been the backbone of our rural communities,” said Schienebeck. “Senate Bill 456 represents a bold and necessary step toward revitalizing this sector. By supporting infrastructure upgrades and enabling the development of a state-of-the-art biorefinery in Hayward, this bill will create a reliable market for low-value wood and woody biomass, improve forest health, and position Wisconsin as a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel production.”

The GLTPA represents over 1,000 members across Wisconsin and Michigan, including loggers, truckers, foresters, mills, landowners, and allied businesses. The association emphasized that the industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, including mill closures and the loss of nearly 30% of the region’s wood-consuming market.

Schienebeck noted that Wisconsin’s forests grow twice as much fiber as is harvested annually, but forest health is in decline due to increasing natural mortality and reduced harvesting on private lands. The proposed biorefinery would help reverse this trend by creating new demand for underutilized wood resources.

“Wisconsin is ready,” Schienebeck added. “We have the workforce, the experience, and a proud tradition of sustainable forest management. This bill will not only strengthen our economy—it will make our forests healthier and help reduce carbon emissions in international aviation.”

With hybrid-powered flights on offer, the country is ensuring that even the aviation sector pledges towards 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with their zero-emissions jet. By rewriting the rules of flight, the innovation is rewriting the rules of sustainable commitment as well. Sweden’s 30-seater hybrid is the future of aviation.

Sweden is committed to sustainable soaring in the skies

Sweden is now at the very core of the launch towards future aviation possibilities. The hybrid-electric aircraft, still under development, that will be powered by SAF will spell the end of fossil jet fuel. Sweden is transitioning to 100% SAF in terms of domestic flights, which will occur within the next 10 years.

Sweden surely is committed to a broader climate strategy and holds onto the goal of being a net-zero country by 2045. To date, aviation has been one of the biggest industries causing pollution, and the transition to SAF means utilizing a fuel that is not fossil-based. SAF was created using waste oils, captured CO₂, and agricultural residues. Sweden is looking at using nothing less than 100% SAF when considering future aviation design options.

The country is not just considering SAF for their future aircraft, but has aligned with airports and carriers to ensure infrastructure upgrades are in place that support the production, distribution, and refueling of SAF. All airlines would need to comply with Sweden’s SAF mission.

ES-30 running on SAF and soaring to sustainable heights

Heart Aerospace is the heart of this sustainable transformation, and the startup company is busy building the ES-30. This 30-passenger hybrid-electric aircraft will begin flying by 2030 and will be best suited for shorter-haul flights. Offering a 32 km full electric range and a hybrid SAF-based engine, this hybrid aircraft will fly to about 200 km.

The ES-30 is being designed for commercial routes and will be great for communities like Gotland, Sweden’s most remote island, where daily flights to the mainland become essential. Local authorities in Gotland have already signed the agreements with Heart Aerospace and the Elfly Group to start electric aviation testing.

Infrastructure and regulatory protocol are becoming essential

Moving towards an electrical aviation future expands beyond just the aircraft. Airport infrastructure needs to support these electric aviation flights. Already onboard are airports like Säve in Gothenburg that have agreed to include charging stations, battery safety zones, and SAF blending facilities. At the same time, Sweden’s transport and environmental agencies are looking to fast-track certifications for electric aircraft, as these agencies are currently battling with archaic setbacks.

Sweden sees the government collaborating with research institutions and ambitious startups. With over 100 projects devoted to ensuring that air taxis enjoy a more sustainable future, Sweden surely is committed to producing commercial electric planes that will take over the skies. Sweden is saying goodbye to polluting airplanes for good by running 100% on their chosen sustainable fuel.

Sweden and their Swedish ambition to be free of fossil fuels

Sweden seeks to reduce emissions, and in doing so, Sweden is reaching up to the sky. Rewriting the script for future aviation with mandates for utilizing 100% SAF, Sweden is investing in a future where all sort of fossil jet fuel ceases to exist. Sweden is involving the more remote areas like Gotland as well as innovative hubs like Gothenburg when setting out its zero-emissions flight trajectory.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-03-071057.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:57:33.420972

**********************************************************************

Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Joint Business Community Luncheon today (October 10):

Ms Agnes Chan (Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce), Dr Jonathan Choi (Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong), Dr Wingco Lo (President of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong), Mr Anthony Lam (Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries), Mr Wang Haimin (Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association), Mr Davide De Rosa on behalf of InterCham (President of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. I thank you for giving me this opportunity to come and join you, once again, for this essential annual gathering - the Joint Business Community Luncheon.

My thanks, first of all, to the main organisers: the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce; the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong; the Federation of Hong Kong Industries; and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong.

I have been told that over 400 of you are here today from five local chambers and 19 international chambers, together with a number of Consuls-General and other consulate officials.

Business and institutional leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators, investors and more, you're here for more than a fine social occasion - and the good lunch that comes with it.

I would like to take this opportunity to give you a better sense of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government's policies, and how they may fit with your plans - your future, your business and your career in Hong Kong, this beloved community we all call home.

The theme of the 2025 Policy Address is ""Deepening Reforms for Our People, Leveraging Our Strengths for a Brighter Future"". As I emphasised in the Policy Address, my ultimate objective is to improve the livelihood of the people of Hong Kong. And that's best realised through economic growth driven by continuing reforms.

Successful reform is a collective commitment. Working together, we can, and we will, create a brighter future for us all. And build an even more dynamic, innovative and business-friendly hub, as noted by Agnes.

International recognition

The results to date are no less reassuring. Confidence is returning to our businesses and industries, and our communities, shops, streets and homes. And the world has recognised these achievements.

In June, the annual World Competitiveness Yearbook, produced by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development, ranked Hong Kong third in the world, up two places from last year. In government efficiency and business efficiency, we rose one place and five places, respectively, to second overall, topping the rankings in ""tax policy"" and ""business legislation"". For international business and investors, Hong Kong is one big welcome mat.

And what a month September was, with Hong Kong in the international ratings spotlight, four remarkable times. Each honour recognises a distinctive facet of our revitalised economy.

I will start with innovation. Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are, collectively, recognised as the world's top innovation cluster, in the World Intellectual Property Organization's annual Global Innovation Index. That's up one place from previous years and our highest ranking ever.

In talent, we claimed fourth place, overall, in the World Talent Ranking, up from ninth in 2024 and 16th the year before. This also marks our highest-ever ranking in the report. And Hong Kong finished first in Asia and world's best in the percentage of graduates in sciences.

For economic freedom, Hong Kong was once again ranked No. 1, as the world's freest economy by the Canadian-based Fraser Institute last month.

And in finance, we placed third in the world in the Global Financial Centres Index, just one point back of London, and only two behind New York.

Those, and other international plaudits, are a compelling reflection of Hong Kong's cheering improvements - and in multiple sectors of our economy as well. They're powered by government policy and, more importantly, by the collaborative efforts of Hong Kong - of everyone in this room.

I would like to share with you some of the Government's policies and plans underlying those rankings, and new initiatives from my Policy Address last month. Together, they're designed to advance our economic development a good deal further.

Northern Metropolis

First of all, the Northern Metropolis. It is at the heart of the HKSAR Government's long-term policy priorities. An innovative new engine for our economy, a far-reaching and welcoming space for community and family, the Northern Metropolis symbolises the rewarding future we all want for Hong Kong. A future built on co-operation and the wide-ranging rewards it promises.

Given the boundless potential of the Northern Metropolis - given, too, its sheer size and the scale of funding required to bring it to full and sustainable life - I am taking a leading role in its development. As head of the new Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis, I called our first meeting last week. And I am determined to fast-track its evolution, removing every possible speed bump in its path.

We aim to enact new, dedicated legislation within next year to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis. The legislation will streamline procedures for setting up and funding statutory industry park companies, fine-tune parameters for land development, and speed up compensation payment for land resumption. Speed, speed, speed.

We will expedite land and construction project approval and implementation. We will smooth the cross-boundary flow of people, goods, data, capital and more to attract the investors, businesses and research organisations that want a stake in the Northern Metropolis, and its far-reaching economic potential.

And that's just touching on the open-minded measures we are pursuing to bring Hong Kong's new powerhouse engine to engaging life, as expeditiously as possible. In my Northern Metropolis playbook, ""soon"" is not nearly soon enough.

The San Tin Technopole, a key area in the Northern Metropolis, will provide some 210 hectares of land dedicated to innovation and technology (I&T). The Government will publish the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole before year's end. With that, San Tin will begin its inevitable rise as the fast-beating I&T heart of the Northern Metropolis.

Tenants - from life and health technology, new energy, artificial intelligence and other strategic industries - have begun to move into the first three buildings of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park. Construction of five other buildings in the Park will be completed, progressively, from 2027.

This Hong Kong Park, together with Shenzhen Park, make up the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, an area that straddles our boundary with the neighbouring city of Shenzhen. Co-operation is central to the Zone and the Northern Metropolis, to Hong Kong and Shenzhen, and to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, of which we are a part. Our concerted collaboration will propel the Greater Bay Area's rise and shine as one of the world's greatest I&T hubs.

The Northern Metropolis will also excel as a centre for education. We are building a University Town there, on some 90 hectares of land. In my Policy Address, I noted that a Working Group on Planning and Construction of the University Town would be set up, one of three working groups under the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis.

It had its first meeting last week, highlighting the Government's strategy of integrating educational excellence and industry at University Town.

That's part of a larger goal, outlined in my Policy Address, of developing Hong Kong into an international education hub.

Hong Kong is proud to be home to five of the world's 100 top universities. In fact, in the latest World University Rankings just announced by Times Higher Education, all six of our previously ranked universities have risen to higher positions. Meanwhile, two more of our publicly funded universities have entered the Rankings for the first time. That, ladies and gentlemen, means that all eight of our publicly funded universities are on the Rankings, and in higher positions than last year. So we're making good progress, and that's thanks to everybody involved in the education sector, particularly in higher education.

Hong Kong demonstrated outstanding performances in key indicators of the Rankings, making sustained progress in such areas as teaching reputation and staff-to-student radio. That's probably why our universities are highly popular, with a double-digit year-on-year increase in the number of self-financing non-local applicants.

In my Policy Address, I also announced that the number of self-financing places for non-local students wishing to study at our post-secondary institutions will rise to 50 per cent, from the previous 40 per cent, beginning in the 2026/27 academic year - this is a strategy designed to create a more diverse and international student body.

To help our eight publicly funded universities recruit overseas and Mainland teachers and students, I have set aside funding support of $40 million for them. And the Government will establish a task force designed to attract more international teaching and research talent to Hong Kong.

Talent attraction

Talent is an essential component in the integrated development of education, technology and industry in the Northern Metropolis. Indeed, talent is central to every sector, industry, business and institution in Hong Kong.

Which is why we've introduced a range of talent admissions schemes since the end of 2022. Since then, more than 230 000 people have come to work here, with 70 per cent of them under the age of 40. The Top Talent Pass Scheme alone has brought in nearly 100 000 young professionals, mostly employed in the financial and I&T sectors. These are high-income individuals and degree holders from prominent international universities. For those whose Top Talent Pass has expired, some 55 per cent of them have applied for an extension of stay, continuing their contribution to our economy. And our businesses are willing to pay much higher salaries to them, which means that they are in high demand, and companies reckon that with what they pay, they get more out of it.

Attracting enterprises

Attracting businesses is also a policy priority of the Government. The results are just as encouraging. The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, set up by me less than three years ago, has already attracted over 100 - the exact number is 102 - strategic companies to Hong Kong. They are bringing in investments of $60 billion and will create some 22 000 jobs.

Just yesterday, the Office welcomed three of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical firms to Hong Kong, alongside companies specialising in generative AI (artificial intelligence), autonomous driving, microelectronics, Web3 and new media.

Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), our investment promotion agency, has helped over 1 300 Mainland and overseas companies set up or expand their business in Hong Kong. They are expected to bring in direct investment of more than $175 billion, while creating some 20 000 job opportunities.

To build on this success, I announced, in my Policy Address, that the Financial Secretary will lead a team of government and public organisations in putting together packages of preferential policies. These will include land grants and premiums, as well as financial subsidies and tax incentives.

The initiative is designed to encourage strategic industries and high-potential companies to set up in Hong Kong. Our goal is clear: to promote diversified, high-quality, long-term economic development.

Targeted industries include life and health technology, pharmaceuticals, aircraft recycling and trading, AI and new energy.

Artificial intelligence

Yes, artificial intelligence has become central to our lives. It helps with decision-making, reduces errors, and boosts productivity. It is the future of our development. I think the world has no choice.

The Government will promote AI as a core industry for Hong Kong. I have set aside $1 billion for the establishment, next year, of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute. It will enable upstream R&D (research and development), as well as midstream and downstream outcomes.

And the $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, announced earlier, will help universities attract prominent researchers in AI and other fields.

The Hong Kong Investment Corporation, established in my first year in office, is investing in AI companies, in fields ranging from cloud computing to drug development.

Sustainable development

As for new energy, we are developing a sustainable aviation fuel industry chain, in concert with Mainland authorities and a local company setting up its business in the Greater Bay Area.

And we now have 28 hydrogen energy trial projects either underway or under preparation, covering everything from hydrogen buses to a hydrogen gas station. We will also develop hydrogen standard certification and work with Guangdong to develop the Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor.

Going global

Our co-operation with the Mainland extends beyond the Greater Bay Area. Given the shifting global trade order, and our country's steadfast commitment to multilateralism, there is fast-growing demand for ""Made in China"" products. I see growing opportunities in helping Mainland companies go global through Hong Kong's customised, wide-ranging and world-class professional services.

In my Policy Address, I announced the establishment of a task force focused on supporting Mainland enterprises in going global. I am glad to add that this GoGlobal Task Force has already been launched earlier this week.

The task force brings together the overseas offices of InvestHK and the Trade Development Council, as well as Hong Kong offices on the Mainland. It is also joined by partners from various industries including legal, accounting, financial services, banking, chambers and professional organisations. It will smooth the way for Mainland companies taking their businesses globally.

Through Hong Kong, a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", companies will connect, faster and more effectively, with international markets and buyers. Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident we can contribute to our country's development of its markets and business opportunities in the Global South, in Belt and Road regions and emerging markets everywhere. Thanks to the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle. Thanks to you, the companies and professionals driving Hong Kong's unparalleled strengths.

Culture, sports and tourism

But we need fun as well. There's a great deal more in this year's Policy Address, including wide-ranging measures designed to promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism. We work hard, but also we need to play hard, eat hard, drink hard and spend hard.

These measures range from the development of an arts trading hub and deepening ties with Art Basel, to boosting the West Kowloon Cultural District's international visibility, targeting yacht tourism and promoting sports development.

That certainly includes next month's 15th National Games, together with December's 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games. These landmark Games mark the first time Hong Kong has served as a cohosting city - alongside Guangdong and Macao - in the country's top sports games.

That, ladies and gentlemen, will surely be an integrating, entirely electrifying, moment for Hong Kong, for our country, for us all.

In the interest of time, I think I better stop here. I look forward to taking your questions about this year's Policy Address. And Hong Kong's flourishing future.

Thank you for your time.

Honeywell UOP, a global leader in energy and process technology, is driving the next phase of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) revolution through innovation, scalability, and collaboration. With over a century of refining expertise and more than 5,900 patents, the company is advancing cutting-edge solutions such as the FT Unicracking™ process and Experion® PKS control systems to make SAF production more efficient, cost-competitive, and feedstock-flexible. ChemAnalyst spoke with Dr. Rajesh Gattupalli, President of Honeywell UOP, discussed his leadership vision, Honeywell’s role in accelerating the global energy transition, and how integrated technology partnerships with organizations like Johnson Matthey and USA BioEnergy are helping the aviation industry chart a faster path toward net-zero emissions.

Complete Interview with Rajesh Gattupalli

To start, could you introduce yourself and outline Honeywell UOP’s role in advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) within the global energy transition?

Rajesh Gattupalli: As president of Honeywell UOP, I oversee a team that develops solutions aimed at improving energy, resource and cost efficiency in the refining and petrochemical sectors. The business also works on technologies designed to reduce emissions and support the development and production of new fuels such as SAF at scale. With over a century of experience, 5,900 patents, and more than 70 licensed processes in 6,000 facilities, we deliver expert energy solutions worldwide.

Honeywell is developing innovative technology that addresses some of the biggest challenges in the SAF industry – production costs, efficiency and feedstock availability. By enabling efficient production and pioneering technologies that expand feedstock options, our technology will play a significant role in advancing SAF production.

Honeywell’s FT Unicracking™ process is being positioned as a breakthrough for SAF. What sets it apart from conventional hydroprocessing technologies in terms of yields, efficiency and costs?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Honeywell’s (FT) Unicracking™ process technology provides a 3–5% increase in SAF production, up to a 20% cost reduction and reduced waste streams as compared to other similar hydroprocessing technologies. What makes it stand out is its ability to turn Fischer Tropsch liquids and waxes derived from waste, biogas, or CO2 combined with green hydrogen into high-quality SAF that meets strict aviation standards.

By boosting yields, lowering costs and cutting waste streams, FT Unicracking offers producers a reliable and commercially viable way to scale SAF, enabling production from low cost, domestic feedstocks while achieving significant emission reductions.

The technology has already been selected for several publicly announced projects that will create hundreds of millions of gallons of SAF per year by using this technology.

This process is designed to handle a wide variety of feedstocks, including waste and forestry residues. How does Honeywell ensure consistent quality and efficiency across such diverse inputs?

Rajesh Gattupalli: One of the strengths of the Fischer Tropsch value chain, including our FT Unicracking process technology, is its ability to handle a wide variety of feedstocks, from municipal solid waste and forestry residues to CO2 combined with green hydrogen. FT-Unicracking can, for example, take Fischer Tropsch liquids and waxes from processed biomass—including leftovers from crops, wood waste, or even food scraps—and convert them into SAF that complies with the strict standards of the aviation industry, while also delivering a lower environmental impact.

We ensure consistent quality and efficiency across such diverse inputs by combining proven process technology with advanced catalysts, automation and control systems. The integration with Honeywell’s Experion® PKS control system helps optimize performance, improve reliability and ensure the final product consistently meets aviation fuel standards, no matter the variation in feedstock.

Reliability and scalability are critical for SAF producers. How does FT Unicracking™ support continuous operations and enable both greenfield projects and retrofits to scale quickly?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Reliability and scalability are vital for SAF producers, and this is where Honeywell brings unmatched expertise. We offer modular renewable fuels technology that can be built off-site and quickly installed at existing refineries or greenfield sites, lowering risk and accelerating start up compared to traditional methods. This approach can reduce the time between feasibility study to facility startup by more than 15% and reduce capital costs by up to 10%.

Altogether, Honeywell’s licensed SAF capacity projects more than 500,000 barrels per day upon full operation. That level of commercial deployment gives producers confidence that our solutions can support both greenfield projects and retrofits at speed.

Honeywell highlights the strong commercial appeal of its SAF solutions. How does this technology encourage faster adoption within the aviation sector?

Rajesh Gattupalli: The strong commercial appeal of Honeywell’s SAF solutions comes from the fact that they are proven, scalable and designed to lower risk for producers and airlines alike. By expanding the range of viable feedstocks, reducing production costs and shortening project timelines, our technologies make it easier for SAF projects to reach investment decisions and move into operation.

This combination gives producers confidence to build and airlines confidence to commit to long-term offtake agreements. Agreements like the USA BioEnergy project in Texas, supported by a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines, show how our technology is already helping the aviation sector move quickly toward wider adoption of SAF.

Experion PKS will be deployed alongside FT Unicracking™ at the Bon Wier biorefinery. How does its advanced control system enhance plant efficiency, safety and resilience compared with conventional approaches?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Honeywell distinguishes itself by integrating process technology with automation for end-to-end solutions. Using Honeywell’s Experion Solution Suites with Honeywell UOP licensed technology units, USA BioEnergy can manage investment risks, improve scheduling flexibility, and prepare operators for startup.

Experion PKS optimizes plant performance through real-time automation, predictive maintenance, and advanced safety systems, aiming to reduce downtime and costs while increasing efficiency. Built-in redundancy, cybersecurity, and analytics further ensure stable operations. At the Bon Wier biorefinery, Experion PKS supports reliable scaling of operations and risk management.

The Bon Wier project brings together Honeywell, Johnson Matthey and USA BioEnergy. How does this collaboration create a model for integrated SAF production and what lessons can be applied globally?

Rajesh Gattupalli: USA BioEnergy’s biorefinery demonstrates how advanced technology can rapidly scale SAF production. Together with Johnson Matthey’s technology, we offer an integrated solution that combines Fischer-Tropsch technology, Honeywell’s FT Unicracking process, and the Experion PKS control system. This approach streamlines project timelines, reduces capital costs and ensures reliability from start to finish.

The key takeaway is that collaboration between technology providers, feedstock suppliers, and producers accelerates SAF projects. With global demand for biofuels set to rise, this integrated model offers a blueprint for expanding sustainable aviation fuel production worldwide.

Feedstock availability and costs are often seen as bottlenecks for SAF growth. How is Honeywell addressing these challenges through technology innovation and partnerships?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Honeywell’s technologies are designed to help producers overcome cost and feedstock availability challenges. We have pioneered technologies that expand the range of viable feedstocks, including Ecofining™ to process natural oils, greases and waste oils; our Ethanol-to-Jet process to convert ethanol from corn, sugarcane and cellulosic materials; eFining™ to turn captured CO2 and green hydrogen into methanol for SAF; and FT Unicracking to process Fischer Tropsch liquids and waxes derived from waste, biogas, and captured CO2 combined with green hydrogen. Each of these pathways helps reduce pressure on traditional feedstocks and lowers the cost barrier for producers.

We are also forming strategic alliances and collaborative efforts to bring these solutions to market faster. Our agreement with USA BioEnergy is converting one million tons of forest thinnings into 65 million gallons of SAF annually, while our global technology alliance with Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy and SAMSUNG E&A is helping producers leverage waste and biomass feedstocks at scale. These collaborations show how combining technology innovation with industry collaboration can directly address the feedstock and cost challenges facing SAF growth.

Beyond SAF, what role does Honeywell see for other alternative fuels—such as renewable diesel, e-fuels and hydrogen—in aviation and broader transportation decarbonization?

Rajesh Gattupalli: We take an “all-in” approach to energy transformation. Meeting the needs of aviation and transportation will require multiple fuel pathways working together, not just a single solution. That’s why Honeywell is advancing renewable diesel, e-fuels, hydrogen and other alternatives alongside SAF.

The world will continue to need more energy, and the challenge is to expand supply while keeping costs competitive, ensuring security and reducing emissions. By optimizing today’s fuels while scaling the alternatives of tomorrow, we can broaden the mix of available energy sources. This approach gives airlines and industries greater choice, creates resilience and helps deliver the fuels needed to keep up with demand growth.

Looking ahead, what technological breakthroughs or system-level innovations is Honeywell prioritizing to ensure SAF becomes both sustainable and cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel worldwide?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Looking ahead, we are prioritizing both technological breakthroughs and system-level innovations that make SAF cost-competitive while ensuring it meets industry and emission-reduction standards. We continue to build on our hydrocracking expertise, which we have pioneered for more than 70 years, while advancing new pathways like eFining™, which uses abundant feedstocks such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce SAF.

At the system level, we are investing in modular technologies that shorten project timelines and reduce capital costs, as well as digital solutions like Experion PKS that improve efficiency, reliability and safety across facilities. We are also expanding the range of viable feedstocks through technologies such as Ethanol-to-Jet and FT Unicracking, so producers have more flexibility to source what is most available and cost-effective in their region. And through collaborations with complementary technology and service providers like Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy and SAMSUNG E&A, we are demonstrating how integrated, end-to-end solutions can scale globally.

By combining these technological pathways with system-level advances, we are working to make SAF both sustainable and cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel worldwide.

ChemAnalyst Insights on JET Kerosene Market

Jet kerosene, the conventional aviation fuel refined from petroleum, is increasingly being complemented by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—a bio-based, “drop-in” alternative that can be seamlessly blended with traditional kerosene for use in existing aircraft and infrastructure. While both fuels share compatibility, SAF’s distinct advantage lies in its lower carbon footprint, achieved by recycling atmospheric CO2 through renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste.

In North America, jet kerosene spot prices remained relatively subdued during the second quarter of 2025, reflecting weaker market momentum compared to the previous year. Despite firm crude oil values, ample refinery production, high inventories, and cautious airline procurement kept jet fuel rates under pressure. June recorded a mild month-on-month uptick, supported by seasonal travel demand and speculative buying, though underlying fundamentals stayed soft.

Airline fuel consumption trailed prior-year levels throughout the quarter—usage dipped in April even as passenger volumes rose—while average fuel costs per gallon declined from March. Supply conditions remained favorable, with Gulf Coast refiners operating steadily and imports from Nigeria’s Dangote refinery and Russia helping to sustain market balance.

Meanwhile, industry focus is steadily pivoting toward SAF. Although current availability remains limited, evolving policy mandates and corporate ESG commitments are beginning to reshape procurement strategies—placing long-term structural pressure on conventional jet fuel demand.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-10 11:57:38.899141

The project, funded by the Office of Energy Policy within EEC, is one of two SAF studies currently underway in Kentucky. The second, led by WSP, is funded by the Kentucky SAF Coalition.

The study identified corn oil as the safest bet for making SAF in Kentucky thanks to its low risk profile, according to Eduardo Santillan-Jimenez, Ph.D., associate director of CAER's Sustainable and Alternative Fuels Research Group. He noted that such a finding can guide the decision-making of stakeholders interested in investing in SAF-related projects in the Commonwealth.

SAF is an alternative to jet fuel that can be made from everyday materials like plant oils, animal fats and recycled cooking grease, can be blended up to 50% with traditional jet fuel for use in commercial aircraft and represents a market potential of $80 billion globally (by 2035). Jet fuel is the fourth most consumed fuel in the Commonwealth and is critical for Kentucky's three air hubs as well as for national defense aviation operations at the Kentucky National Guard, Fort Knox and Fort Campbell.

""As the aviation industry looks to diversify its fuel sources and become more sustainable, SAF represents an advanced energy economic development opportunity for Kentucky. It creates new markets for agricultural products, brings investment to processing infrastructure and directly supports fuel diversification and local production supporting Kentucky's Energy Security Plan,"" said Kenya Stump, executive director of the Kentucky Office of Energy Policy.

Essential to this growth, however, is understanding the supply chain risk necessary to attract infrastructure and manufacturing investments. The risk assessment conducted by UK CAER focused on soybean oil, corn oil and distillers corn oil - which are some of the most important agricultural commodities in Kentucky - as well as on animal fats (from livestock rendering), yellow grease (used cooking oil) and brown grease (FOG recovered from grease traps and/or from wastewater treatment plants).

Six types of risks were reviewed based on a U.S. Department of Energy standard that helps investors better understand the risks of using biomass as a resource, making it easier to support and grow the bioeconomy.

""Risk was highest in supplier and supply chain categories,"" said Santillan-Jimenez. ""The risk associated with the other categories was found to be low. Both yellow and brown grease show high supplier and supply chain risk, while soybean oil shows high supplier risk but medium supply chain risk. Notably, corn oil shows medium supplier risk and low supply chain risk, making it the less risky feedstock overall.""",https://research.uky.edu/sites/default/files/styles/big_16x9/public/2025-10/eduardo_santillan-jimenez_lab.png?h=9f2ba84c&itok=FZsg4dAy,N,,2025-10-10 11:57:57.391791

Brookfield’s 20-billion-dollar Global Transition Fund raise marks a milestone in global finance.","Brookfield Asset Management has raised 20 billion U.S. dollars for its second global energy transition fund. This makes it the largest private fund ever created for clean energy and decarbonization projects.

The fund, called the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II), will invest in renewable energy, carbon capture, nuclear, and other low-carbon solutions worldwide. Brookfield said the fund exceeded its target.

The company will commit about 25 percent of the capital from its own balance sheet, showing strong confidence in the opportunity. More than 200 global investors joined the fund, including major pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and insurers.

Brookfield also secured 3.5 billion dollars in co-investments from partners that will join in large projects. The firm has already deployed $5 billion from the fund into new projects. This shows a quick start in building clean energy infrastructure on a large scale.

From BGTF I to BGTF II: Bigger, Broader, and More Ambitious

Brookfield’s first transition fund, BGTF I, launched in 2021 with $15 billion. It focused on renewable power, carbon capture, battery storage, sustainable aviation fuel, and nuclear services through Westinghouse.

That first fund achieved strong performance. Brookfield says BGTF II now targets a net internal rate of return (IRR) of about 12%, slightly higher than the goal of the first fund.

BGTF II builds on that experience and scale. It seeks to change carbon-heavy industries, grow clean energy, and back technologies that reduce emissions. The company manages over $850 billion in assets. This gives it the reach and skills to handle a large platform.

Connor Teskey, President of Brookfield Asset Management, remarked:

“Energy demand is growing fast, driven by the growth of artificial intelligence as well as electrification in industry and transportation. Against this backdrop we need an ‘any and all’ approach to energy investment that will continue to favor low carbon resources. Our strategy will succeed by investing in the technologies that will deliver clean, abundant, and low-cost energy and transition solutions that underpin the global economy.”

Where the Money Will Go

BGTF II focuses on three major investment areas:

Clean energy expansions, such as wind and solar projects.

Transition technologies include battery storage, grid modernization, carbon capture, and next-generation nuclear.

Sustainable solutions that cut emissions in industries and transportation.

Early investments already include Neoen in France, Geronimo Power in the United States, and Evren in India. These projects plan to create more than 10 gigawatts of clean energy. They will use wind, solar, and battery storage.

Brookfield plans to deploy capital across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. The company is expanding into emerging markets, such as India and Brazil, where energy demand is increasing rapidly. Clean power investments can also make a big social impact.

Brookfield now oversees over 200 gigawatts of renewable power. This capacity, built or in development, can supply electricity to hundreds of millions of homes worldwide.

Record Scale in a Fast-Changing Market

The 20-billion-dollar fund comes at a time of record investment in clean energy. The International Energy Agency reports that global renewable power investment hit 680 billion dollars in 2024. Total energy transition funding also exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars.

Private infrastructure investors can raise over 2 trillion dollars by 2030 for clean energy projects. Brookfield’s new fund shows how private capital is stepping in to meet that demand.

The size of BGTF II sets it apart from rivals. It surpasses other large climate funds managed by firms like BlackRock, KKR, TPG, and Macquarie. Many analysts see it as proof that energy transition investments are moving from a niche market to the financial mainstream.

Some of the world’s biggest investors have backed the fund. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, European pension plans, and large insurers all made multi-billion-dollar commitments. Strong demand allowed Brookfield to close the fund early and above target.

Beyond Returns: ESG with Real-World Results

Brookfield’s first transition fund, BGTF I, helped avoid over 100 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions. This was achieved through the projects it financed. The new fund, BGTF II, is expected to double that impact over the next decade.

The company says its clean energy projects create tens of thousands of skilled jobs. These jobs are in construction, operations, and maintenance worldwide. In emerging markets such as India and Brazil, new renewable projects are creating steady jobs. They are also boosting local economies.

BGTF II boosts Brookfield’s role as a top investor in sustainable infrastructure from an ESG perspective.

Environmental: The fund supports renewable generation, energy storage, and industrial decarbonization — key areas for cutting emissions.

Social: The projects promote local job creation and responsible sourcing.

Governance: Brookfield promises clear ESG reporting. They provide third-party checks on emissions cuts and metrics for investors.

These steps align with global net-zero goals and contribute to keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Why It Matters: The Private Capital Shift to Clean Power

Brookfield’s new fund is a signal of how the global energy system is changing. The rise of artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles is driving rapid growth in electricity demand. At the same time, governments are tightening climate policies and pushing for more clean power capacity.

Funds like BGTF II help fill the gap between public targets and real-world project financing. Private capital can move faster than government budgets and can help deliver clean energy solutions at scale.

The fund also shows that investors see climate projects as long-term infrastructure instead of short-term experiments. Stable cash flows from renewables and storage assets attract institutions. They seek both returns and a positive impact.

Building the Next Generation of Clean Energy

Brookfield plans to deploy BGTF II’s capital over the next 5 to 7 years. Early focus areas include North America, Europe, India, and Latin America — regions with clear climate policies and rising energy demand.

If executed well, the fund could help close the global investment gap in clean power and low-carbon infrastructure. It will show that sustainability and profitability can go hand in hand, and it works best with strong management and scale.

The two-year extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit until 2029 is a positive regarding fiscal support for biofuels. However, the requirement that feedstocks must be sourced only from the United States (US), Canada, or Mexico restricts the use of international inputs, such as used cooking oil, which is widely utilized in SAF and renewable diesel (RD) production.

Furthermore, the SAF credit is reduced from USD 1.75 to USD 1.00 per gallon, weakening the relative competitiveness of SAF compared to RD. The bill also removes indirect land use change (ILUC) from lifecycle emissions calculations, allowing previously ineligible feedstocks to qualify for tax credits, departing from internationally agreed sustainability standards approved under the CORSIA Eligible Fuel Criteria.

The OBBBA phases out the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit for projects that have not commenced by the end of 2027, which is five years earlier than under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The accelerated phase-out shortens the investment horizon for hydrogen infrastructure, particularly affecting Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF development. Given the complexities involved in PtL projects, this change may stall progress and diminish the role of the US in scaling e-fuels technologies.

Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum.

Using internal research funding, a multidisciplinary team produced and characterized the SAF, along with two other commercially available fuels, before collecting emissions and particulate data to support the aviation industry’s emissions goals.

Fueling jets with SAF could help reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide air travel accounts for 2% of all carbon emissions, and 12% of all carbon emissions from transportation.

“Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,” said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI’s Mechanical Engineering Division. “With this project we’re gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.”

The team tackled three focus areas – production, characterization, and testing.

First, chemical engineers refined e-fuels manufactured with hydrogen produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The team then processed that into an in-house SAF meeting aviation fuels standards. Then SwRI’s fuels and lubricants specialists characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI's propulsion and energy specialists used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

Through a series of hydroprocessing reactions throughout several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They engineered a small batch – about one barrel of fuel – to characterize and test fuels prior to commercialization.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing, and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time, and risks for our clients.”

“We are excited to offer multidisciplinary solutions across all stages of the SAF development cycle,” said SwRI’s Executive Vice President Walt Downing. “This integrated project paired chemical and mechanical engineers with fluids and emissions experts to address several technical challenges.”

Di Sabatino will present at the Sustainable Aviation Futures Congress in Houston, October 14-16, 2025.

Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) is a leader in propulsion, aircraft technology, alternative fuels, and emissions characterization.

We already have the technologies to fight climate change – so why aren’t we deploying them faster?

That was the question I explored in my TED Countdown Talk. As Head of Climate Innovation at Tencent and an environmental engineer by training, I believe the biggest barrier to decarbonization isn’t the lack of technology – it’s how we work together.

The good news? There’s a way forward. Many scalable climate solutions are available today. From bacteria that turn CO₂ into fuel, to cooling materials that help save glaciers, we can make real impact now. The key is accelerating them by uniting science, engineering, and business to turn bold ideas into real-world solutions that help decarbonize the planet.

Catalyzing emerging low-carbon technology

“I’m more optimistic than ever that we have the answer to accelerating climate innovation, and it’s simple.”

Dr. Hao Xu, Head of Climate Innovation, Tencent

Although Tencent is not a major emitter, we are deeply committed to sustainability and tackling climate change. We have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and are leveraging our capabilities to fulfil our mission of creating tech for good.

Beyond improving data center efficiency and sourcing renewable energy, we’re focused on how to catalyze the next generation of climate technology. That’s why we launched our CarbonX program in partnership with industry, investors and innovators. Three years in, I’m more optimistic than ever, because we think the right answer is not so complicated.

Through CarbonX, we've learned that successful climate tech acceleration happens when four key areas work in harmony.

1. Scientific innovation: saving decades of climate tech R&D

Let’s start with the science, which is in advanced stages. We can capture solar energy, store it using cutting-edge chemistry, and convert CO₂ into valuable products – shaving decades off development.

Take Gasgene, a startup we work with through CarbonX. Using CRISPR – a gene editing tool – to reprogram clostridium bacteria, they've essentially taught these microorganisms to ""eat"" carbon dioxide and produce butanol instead. Butanol is found in clothing, paint, water bottles, toys and the like. With engineered clostridium, we can make these everyday products from captured carbon instead of fossil fuels.

2. Engineering expertise: scaling the science from lab to real world

Next is engineering, which acts as the bridge from lab to production, bringing scientific ideas to life at scale.

Imagine building a facility to produces 20,000 tons of butanol a year from captured CO₂. Engineers must decide: what size reactors are needed? Can we use standard equipment, or must systems be customized? How do we optimize for cost, safety and energy?

Think of it like LEGO – you use existing blocks wherever possible to build something new quickly and efficiently.

Feynman Dynamics, another CarbonX innovator, faced this challenge. Their goal: produce sustainable aviation fuel by combining captured CO₂ with green hydrogen. Their breakthrough? A catalyst that blends these ingredients at the molecular level, like a smoothie machine. Inspired by pharmaceutical chemistry, they created a reactor that delivers consistent, scalable performance, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

3. Business knowhow: turning innovation into industry

However, even the best-engineered solution can fail without a viable business model. Markets, costs and customer demand drive adoption and innovations must make commercial sense.

Yuanchu, a startup that captures CO₂ and turns it into calcium carbonate – used in paper, makeup, and toothpaste – found a smart market fit. Instead of mining limestone, they repurpose steel and industrial by-products, cutting both emissions and costs.

Another example is Moguang, which developed cutting-edge radiative cooling material that reflects over 90 percent of sunlight. It cools objects naturally without using electricity. We piloted this technology on the endangered Dagu Glacier in southwestern China. After three years, melting slowed by 80 percent.

Today, that same material is used in hundreds of thousands of smartphone screens and sports cameras. From glaciers to gadgets, climate tech innovation is full of possibilities.

4. Integration: solving the bottlenecks

So, what’s holding us back? It’s not invention, it’s isolation.

Scientists focus on discovery. Engineers optimize performance. Businesses look at balance sheets. But rarely do they work together from day one.

To accelerate climate solutions, however, these disciplines must collaborate from the start. That means:

Scientists asking: how much energy does it take to capture one ton of CO₂?

Engineers asking: can this be deployed at industrial levels?

Business leaders asking: when can we make this cost effective?

These aren’t easy conversations. But such cross-disciplinary tensions are essential to speed up progress and get us closer to decarbonization.

We’ve already seen this model succeed. With Gasgene, we helped form a clean chemical consortium, linking startups, chemical companies, and consumer brands to make carbon-based products a reality. That alignment enabled pilot deployment and scaling.

To recap, we don’t need to wait for new inventions. We need to work faster, and work together. That’s how we can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon world!",https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/10/10/12ab4d13eabf7aa2ccb4990e336b5634.png!article.cover,N,,2025-10-09 23:56:21.533646

As customer expectations evolve and regulations tighten, more businesses are recognizing that an effective sustainability strategy is not only a means of reducing environmental impact, but also a path to greater efficiency, growth and long-term profitability.

FedEx is working to support the sustainability goals of SMEs by embedding sustainability into its own logistics ecosystem, from more sustainable fleet solutions to data-driven tools that support better decision-making. Beyond reducing carbon emissions, these efforts are designed to drive down operational costs, seize new revenue opportunities and improve customer satisfaction.

At FedEx, sustainability principles inform business decision-making and, as a result, the services it offers customers. Pursuing its goal of carbon neutral operations by 2040 presents opportunities for FedEx to unlock greater efficiencies across its physical network, ultimately for the benefit of customers, team members, communities and the bottom line.

More efficient operations—from route optimization and digital documentation to the use of renewable energy and automation—can eliminate redundant processes and help teams focus on higher-value work. For instance, the FedEx South Pacific Regional Hub in Singapore began using solar panels that meet more than half of the facility’s total electricity demands, while the FedEx Incheon Gateway in South Korea is powered in part by 2,400 rooftop solar panels, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and potentially generating long-term cost savings. Other FedEx facilities across APAC are also being upgraded with energy-efficient systems.

Beyond facility efficiency and renewable energy, FedEx is also looking to alternative fuels to help reduce emissions and power its fleet. FedEx started to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in 2025; the fuel will account for roughly a fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX, addressing aviation emissions alongside ground transportation.

More Sustainable Deliveries With Smarter Networks

Last-mile delivery, often the most resource-intensive part of the supply chain, is being transformed by electrification and technology. In APAC, FedEx is rolling out electric delivery vehicles (EVs) for last-mile deliveries that are tailored to the needs of local markets.

This shift is already visible in markets like Singapore, where FedEx has introduced custom-built electric vans. In China, EVs now make up more than 20% of the country’s FedEx delivery fleet, while new additions were also made to the fleet in Malaysia, New Zealand, Japan and Thailand. FedEx also completed its first cross-border EV delivery between Malaysia and Singapore. In Taiwan, the company has even introduced electric tricycles to navigate dense urban environments more efficiently.

This transition has business implications beyond sustainability. With fewer emissions, lower fuel costs and reduced maintenance needs, FedEx is creating a more resilient network.

Delivering Measurable Impact for Customers

While FedEx continues to transform its own operations, it also recognizes the need to support customers to meet their sustainability goals. In particular, a company’s ability to measure and manage carbon emissions has become critical.

To address this, FedEx has developed FedEx®Sustainability Insights, a self-serve digital platform that enables customers to track and analyze emissions data related to their shipments across the FedEx network.

This tool provides granular data on shipment-related emissions by mode of transport, service type and geography, enabling businesses to identify high-emissions routes and make emissions-informed logistics decisions.

FedEx has also introduced paperless solutions such as Electronic Trade Documents, which allow customs information to be submitted electronically. This not only reduces paper usage across millions of packages daily but also helps to make cross-border shipping more efficient and increase customer satisfaction.

Making a Difference Beyond Business

FedEx’s sustainability approach also extends into the communities it serves. Through FedEx Cares, the company’s global community engagement program, it supports local sustainability and education initiatives across the region.

In FY25, FedEx has significantly stepped up its support for volunteer-driven environmental initiatives in APAC, with volunteer participation in community projects increasing 20% year-on-year. The number of sustainability-focused community programs also grew 14% year-on-year during the same period. These initiatives have made a tangible impact on local communities and ecosystems, from restoring mangrove forests in Bengkalis, Indonesia to cleaning up riverbanks in Tokyo, Japan. Collectively, FedEx team members have planted 3,465 trees and native plants, helping preserve and protect natural ecosystems where the company operates.

The annual FedEx Cares Purple Tote Campaign remains a cornerstone of the company’s community engagement efforts. In FY25, over 800 team members from across APAC dedicated more than 1,000 volunteer hours to collect and donate more than 3,600 kilograms of essential supplies. Through collaboration with 20 non-profit organizations, these efforts impacted over 1,600 beneficiaries, including young children, the elderly and underserved communities.

FedEx has also expanded its 2025 Library Program, recognizing education as essential to sustainable development in rural and underserved areas. The initiative reached 40 schools and communities across China this year, providing educational resources that benefit approximately 9,000 children and teachers by creating conducive learning environments.

For SMEs looking to give back to their communities, these programs offer useful models of how to align business goals with social impact. Volunteering can also strengthen employee engagement, while partnerships with non-profits can amplify reach and effectiveness.

Strengthening Customer and Employee Loyalty

Whether it’s through more sustainable operations or community initiatives, a strong sustainability strategy can help SMEs attract more environmentally conscious customers, build brand loyalty and differentiate themselves in competitive markets. Increasingly, consumers expect carbon-efficient delivery options and often prefer to buy from brands with credible sustainability practices. This creates a “flywheel effect”: responsible sourcing and shipping contribute to customer satisfaction, which can in turn drive repeat business.

Internally, sustainability also plays a role in talent acquisition and retention. Companies with strong sustainability values may be more likely to attract top talent and foster a culture of engagement. A positive workplace culture, supported by clear values and actionable initiatives, helps improve retention and boost team morale, which are particularly valuable for SMEs competing for skilled talent.

A Collective Effort

Businesses now view sustainability as a core strategy that requires collaboration across the value chain. FedEx works alongside its customers, technology partners and industry peers to help scale solutions that support sustainable, smarter trade across APAC.

Whether through carbon-efficient shipping options, emissions tracking tools or smarter infrastructure, SMEs can make informed decisions to help optimize their environmental performance. By doing so, they are building a foundation for long-term resilience and growth.

Ultimately, sustainability is about unlocking value.

(WJHL) – While many think tariffs are behind the struggles Tennessee farmers are facing this harvest season, some say stagnant prices and soaring input costs are the real culprits.
“We were already seeing these low prices, and of course, there is a supply and demand situation that takes place there,” Maddox said.
“The input costs are going up,” Klepper said.
“Agriculture is our number one industry in Tennessee,” Maddox said.
“Because the longer they drag out, the more it’s going to hurt Tennessee farmers.”","GREENE COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) – While many think tariffs are behind the struggles Tennessee farmers are facing this harvest season, some say stagnant prices and soaring input costs are the real culprits.

Tennessee Farm Bureau Director of Communications Lee Maddox said he’s “extremely concerned about where our farmers are going to be at the end of this year and especially going into next year,” adding that the agriculture industry in the state lost $430 million last year and $730 million over the past two years, well before the latest tariffs were in place.

“We were already seeing these low prices, and of course, there is a supply and demand situation that takes place there,” Maddox said. “But the inflation costs do not add up to the price that farmers get for the crops they produce.”

Mark Klepper has owned Woodlawn Farms for decades and says about 20% of his crop is exported. He told News Channel 11 that the price of fertilizer alone has more than tripled since he began, while the price he can sell his goods for has remained largely unchanged.

“The input costs are going up,” Klepper said. “And our crop prices are the same now that they’ve been for the last three or four years. And really, if you look back, I mean, other than a few peaks in a few years, the same prices we’ve had for the last 40 years.”

Klepper believes the best long-term fix is “to increase usage in the United States” to support farmers across the country.

According to Maddox, one way to do that is to increase the amount of biofuel we produce and to make it available year-round instead of seasonally.

“Biofuels is one of the most important ways that we can support a long-term future for our farmers who grow corn and soybeans,” Maddox said. “Both of those are used pretty readily for ethanol and biodiesel. And we’re even talking about, and there’s a lot of research being done on sustainable aviation fuel that would be derived from soybeans.”

However, he believes a new farm bill, which has not been updated since 2018, should be the priority as it brings certainty to the farmers and rural communities.

“Agriculture is our number one industry in Tennessee,” Maddox said. “It’s the number one driver of our economy. It contributes over $103 billion each year. And that’s significant in terms of what it means to our rural economies as well.”

Maddox acknowledged that eventually the tariffs will have an effect, especially if they go on long-term.

“We just encourage the administration to quickly try to resolve any of these tariff disputes,” Maddox said. “Because the longer they drag out, the more it’s going to hurt Tennessee farmers.”",https://www.wjhl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2025/10/featured_480b8d.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-09 22:57:06.677493

From Ambition to Action Asia’s energy transition is not just an environmental imperative; it is an economic one.","Across Asia-Pacific, more than 350 million people have limited access to electricity, while 150 million have none at all. Southeast Asia’s (SEA) power needs will more than double by 2050 compared to 2022, while global electricity use from data centers is expected to exceed twice the current levels by 2030.

The convergence of electrification, industrialization and digitalization means Asia faces a potential energy crisis: how to expand access while simultaneously decarbonizing. The region cannot meet this challenge through government action alone. While the private sector has both the capital and the capacity to accelerate solutions, it must work hand-in-hand with policymakers.

Anderson Tanoto, Managing Director at RGE, with global operations in the bio-based resources and energy sectors, explains: “No single country, company or institution can deliver the energy transition on its own. The private sector brings innovation, capital and speed; governments provide vision and enabling frameworks. Together, we can build an energy system that is sustainable, inclusive and built to last.”

Partnerships That Scale Impact

Energy transition requires collaboration that crosses industries and borders. RGE’s joint venture with TotalEnergies, Singa Renewables, shows what is possible. Supported by the governments of Indonesia and Singapore, the partnership is developing a utility-scale solar and battery energy storage system in Riau, Indonesia.

When operational, the project will supply green electricity to both Indonesia and Singapore while stimulating investments, creating skilled jobs and strengthening regional energy security. The collaboration marries RGE’s deep local roots with TotalEnergies’ global expertise in utility-scale renewables.

Singapore’s Energy Market Authority has already granted Singa Renewables a conditional license for up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar energy from Indonesia, a step aligned with Singapore’s target of 6 GW of low-carbon imports by 2035. Building on this, RGE and TotalEnergies signed an agreement with Singapore Energy Interconnections to co-develop a subsea interconnector, a vital step toward the ASEAN Power Grid, which aims to strengthen cross-border electricity trade and accelerate an equitable transition.

Innovation Beyond Electricity

The transition extends beyond power generation. RGE is advancing a waste-to-value strategy by transforming waste and residues from its agribusiness Apical’s global supply chain into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through Apical, it has partnered with Spain’s Moeve to build Southern Europe’s largest SAF plant. Scheduled to be operational in 2026, the facility will produce 500,000 tonnes of SAF annually, reducing carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

In parallel, RGE is investing in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transition fuel. Together with Canada’s Enbridge Inc., it is developing Woodfibre LNG, the world’s first net zero LNG export facility, in British Columbia.

Tanoto notes: “The toughest sectors to decarbonize demand innovation and collaboration on multiple fronts—and the private sector can scale and share expertise across regions.”

Unlocking SEA’s Renewable Potential

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates SEA’s renewable potential to be 40 to 50 times greater than its current electricity generation. But scale requires more than ambition. Derisking large-scale projects is critical to attracting capital and accelerating deployment.

Governments hold the keys by setting clear, consistent policies that endure beyond political cycles, establishing supportive regulations and cross-border agreements, and designing mandates and targeted subsidies to overcome first-mover risks.

Private players, meanwhile, must manage risks within their control: access to land, building enabling infrastructure, proving technical feasibility, and ensuring benefits flow equitably across markets. Shared value is essential for regional buy-in.

From Ambition to Action

Asia’s energy transition is not just an environmental imperative; it is an economic one. Reliable, low-carbon energy underpins growth, competitiveness and social inclusion.

RGE’s experience shows that commercial viability and long-term impact can go hand in hand. With scale, innovation and cross-border collaboration, the private sector can unlock the capital and expertise to complement government leadership.

Says Tanoto: “Energy is the foundation of progress. If Asia can expand access while decarbonizing, we won’t just meet demand. We will define how economies can grow sustainably, inclusively and competitively for generations to come.”",https://forbesasiacustom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RGE-Oct-2025-Image-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-10-09 22:57:12.759626

This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.
Space is limited in government conservation programs, however, and farmers must prove that they aren’t already engaging in climate-smart practices to obtain credits.
This approach could subsequently be broadened to reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices for crops to supply food and feed markets as well.
Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.","A team of agricultural economists, environmental scientists and policy experts envisions a path toward a carbon-neutral agricultural future by expanding the reach of policies designed to promote low-carbon biofuels for transportation and aviation. In a new paper in the journal Science, the researchers propose policies that would reward farmers for adopting “climate-smart” practices when growing biofuel crops and remove the hurdles that currently thwart such efforts.

Climate-smart practices include techniques that build soil carbon, like cover-cropping, not tilling fields after harvest and adding biochar or finely ground silicate rock to soils; and those that reduce the carbon footprint of crop production, like optimizing the timing of fertilizer application, electrifying farm vehicles and improving crop genetics.

Studies show that, if adopted globally, “climate-smart” farming practices could reduce carbon emissions by 4-8 billion tonnes per year, the researchers wrote. To put that in perspective, in 2024, global carbon dioxide emissions reached an all-time high of about 40 billion tonnes.

“Biofuel markets can be a pathway to decarbonize agriculture as a whole,” said Madhu Khanna, a professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and lead author of the new report. Khanna is the director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and a researcher in the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, at the U. of I.

“Currently, our biofuel policies don’t reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices,” Khanna said. “For example, they treat all corn grown for the corn-ethanol market the same, whether or not the farmers adopt those types of practices. By accounting for differences in practices implemented at the farm level and paying a premium for corn grown with climate-smart practices for corn ethanol, biofuel policies can incentivize adoption of these practices.”

Biofuel markets have already established mechanisms for accounting for the carbon-intensity of different feedstock types and have well-developed channels for transferring payments from energy markets to biofuel producers, the researchers report. This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.

“For example, the ‘40B’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit of 2023-2024 was designed to differentiate the credit based on the climate-smart practices adopted while producing the crop,” Khanna said. “The lower the carbon intensity, the higher the tax credit paid for sustainable aviation fuels and for the crop used to produce it.”

At present, however, the channels for crediting farmers for soil-carbon sequestration or other climate-friendly practices on the farm are segregated from the markets that provide credits for low-carbon biofuels, Khanna said. To be compensated for their sustainability efforts in growing the crops, farmers must either enroll in a conservation program or sell carbon credits to one of several companies specializing in agricultural carbon offsets. Space is limited in government conservation programs, however, and farmers must prove that they aren’t already engaging in climate-smart practices to obtain credits. This requires a lot of extra effort on the farmer’s part.

“It also means that early adopters get penalized,” Khanna said

Khanna and her colleagues propose an approach for merging the biofuel feedstock market and climate-offset market into a single channel to reward farmers and others in the biofuel supply chain who use practices that lower the carbon-intensity of their operations. This approach could subsequently be broadened to reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices for crops to supply food and feed markets as well.

Like existing policies, any new approach would require verification that farmers are actually implementing the practices they’ve pledged to follow.

“Emerging digital technologies and modeling advances can document farming practices and accurately calculate their carbon intensity. This can simplify and scale this process,” said Bruno Basso, a co-author of the study and an expert in modeling and digital agriculture at Michigan State University. Certification programs could allow independent verification that feedstocks were sustainably produced.

Calculating the changes in the amount of carbon sequestered in crop soils precisely each year is a more daunting task, the authors wrote. But “using multiple process-based ecosystem models can reduce the uncertainty in these estimates and avoid the need for labor-intensive soil sampling procedures,” Basso added.

Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.

“If they do it one year and not the next, they’ll sequester the carbon and then, perhaps, release it back to the atmosphere the following year,” she said. “But we can design incentives for longer-term soil-carbon sequestration by having farmers sign longer-term contracts. This would relate the size of the payments to how long the farmer agrees to keep that carbon in the ground.”

Khanna acknowledges that the carbon benefits from existing biofuels are controversial. Some critics argue that devoting farmland to the production of plant-based fuels takes up land that can be used for food crops and can contribute to the conversion of forests to cropland in other parts of the world, erasing its sustainability gains.

But current approaches could be under- or overestimating the carbon benefits of biofuels by disregarding the carbon effects of crop management practices implemented on the farm producing the crop for the biofuel market.

“By developing a market for agricultural products that accounts for all the direct and indirect carbon emission effects from the farm to the consumer, we can better address these concerns,” she said. “The main premise of our proposal is that we need to have a full and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from the beginning to the end of any product’s life cycle. And right now, the way that biofuel policies are designed, they treat crop producers supplying crop for a biofuel as all being the same.”

An overview of SAF

Definition and characteristics: SAF is a class of aviation fuels derived from renewable or waste sources that can replace or supplement conventional petroleum-based jet fuel. To be classified as “sustainable,” these fuels must demonstrate a significant reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to fossil jet fuel. Key sustainability criteria also include responsible feedstock sourcing, land use considerations, and avoidance of negative impacts on food security or biodiversity.

Feedstocks and production pathways: The main SAF production pathways in the U.S. include hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) using waste oils and fats; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, or forestry byproducts; and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes using ethanol or isobutanol as intermediates. The U.S. is a leader in HEFA production, reflecting a mature supply chain for waste lipids and established refining expertise.

Regulatory and technical standards: U.S. SAF must comply with ASTM D7566, which specifies criteria for fuel quality, safety, and blending limits with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel. The Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. EPA, and U.S. Department of Energy provide regulatory oversight, while the Renewable Fuel Standard and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standards (e.g., California) further incentivize SAF production and use.

Key drivers for SAF adoption

Regulatory incentives and mandates: The policy environment in the U.S. is a primary driver of SAF growth. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a blender’s tax credit for SAF, offering up to $1.75 per gallon for fuels achieving at least a 50% lifecycle GHG reduction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduced and capped this tax credit at $1 per gallon, but extended it through Dec. 31, 2029. The RFS provides renewable identification numbers (RINs) for renewable jet fuel, creating a secondary revenue stream for producers. California’s LCFS offers additional credits based on carbon intensity, further improving project economics for SAF producers in or supplying to California.

Internationally, the International Civil Aviation Organization has implemented the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, mandating emissions monitoring and offsetting for international flights. While not directly enforceable in the U.S., CORSIA shapes market expectations and is influencing airlines’ procurement strategies.

Economic and industry commitments: Major U.S. airlines have made public commitments to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, with interim targets for SAF adoption. These commitments are translating into long-term offtake agreements and direct investments in SAF projects. Corporate buyers (e.g., tech companies with significant travel emissions) are participating in voluntary markets for Scope 1 and 3 environmental attributes to decarbonize their travel footprints, even when physical SAF supply is not locally available.

Market and consumer pressures: Aviation customers and investors are increasingly demanding transparency and progress on carbon reduction. SAF is a visible, reportable way for airlines to demonstrate climate leadership, which in turn drives demand for scalable, bankable SAF projects.

Financing trends for SAF projects

Investment models

SAF projects require large upfront capital expenditures and face unique risks compared to conventional refining. As a result, a variety of financing models are emerging in the U.S.:

Project finance: Larger, commercial-scale facilities often use non-recourse or limited-recourse project finance, where lenders rely on project cash flows and contracts (especially long-term offtake agreements) for repayment. Lenders scrutinize feedstock contracts, technology risk and offtake terms.

Corporate finance: Some established biofuel producers with strong balance sheets may finance SAF projects internally or through corporate debt.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs): Federal and state grants, loan guarantees (e.g., the U.S. DOE’s Loan Programs Office), and tax incentives are blended with private equity and debt, reducing risk and catalyzing investment.

Venture capital and private dquity: Early-stage SAF technology developers attract venture funding, though investors typically seek clear commercialization pathways and strong intellectual property protections.

Green bonds and ESG investments

Institutional investors are increasingly using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to guide capital allocation. Green bonds and sustainability-linked loans are being deployed for SAF projects, with proceeds earmarked for projects that meet third-party sustainability standards. For example, an airport authority or airline may issue a green bond to finance SAF infrastructure, reporting annually on environmental outcomes.

Risk allocation and mitigation

Key risks in SAF project finance include:

Feedstock supply and price risk: Long-term, fixed-price feedstock contracts are rare; supply can be affected by weather, competing demand, or regulatory changes.

Technology risk: Novel conversion technologies may not scale as projected, leading to cost overruns or underperformance.

Regulatory risk: Project economics depend on the continued availability of tax credits, RINs and LCFS incentives, all of which are subject to policy change.

To mitigate these risks, project sponsors pursue diversified feedstock supply, insurance products, conservative financial modeling, and strong contractual protections.

Protective risk policies

Recent developments in risk mitigation for SAF project financing have seen the emergence of innovative insurance products and policy structures designed to address the unique risks faced by project developers, lenders, and investors. These protective risk policies are increasingly critical to wrap technology risk, protect revenue streams, provide floors on offtake and collars on feedstock agreements in an evolving regulatory and market landscape.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Mc_Shane_Patrick_headshot2_41e654c739.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 19:56:20.122108

This initiative aims to position the industrial-port zone as a European hub for hydrogen and e-SAF production, supporting France’s and Europe’s decarbonisation ambitions.

75 000 tpy of e-SAF will be produced from green hydrogen produced by 300 MW water electrolysers, and from captured CO2, with first production expected in 2030. This project exemplifies a significant step towards reindustrialising France in line with Europe’s ambition for sustainable aviation.

A key aspect of this project is the potential of methanol-to-jet fuel synthesis pathway, which offers a promising route for decarbonising aviation. Methanol, produced from green hydrogen and captured carbon, will be converted into high-quality jet fuel, providing a scalable solution that can be used without modifying aircraft.

Aligned with European objectives to incorporate 10% e-SAF into aviation fuels by 2040, as outlined in the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, this project underscores France and Europe’s commitment to a cleaner, more competitive aviation sector.

A collaboration built on strength and innovation

Following early-stage engineering studies, the project demonstrates Rely’s strong position in integrating electrolysis and gas-to-liquid technologies. Rely brings a strong track record and foundation of technological excellence and project execution capability. Studies will also integrate technological providers for CO2 to methanol and methanol-to-jet technological bricks. The studies conducted will pave and accelerate the way for a potential FEED study.

H4 Marseille Fos’s connection to the European pipeline network makes it an ideal location to serve southern and eastern France, as well as the Mediterranean basin and airports in the rest of Europe. H4 Marseille Fos is strongly supported at regional level as a levy for the decarbonisation of local industry.

Such collaboration between Rely and H4 Marseille Fos, through its parent companies H2V and Hy2gen, is envisioned to support a sustainable and competitive aviation fuel supply chain, leveraging partnerships as catalysts for the development of green hydrogen and its derivatives. Supported by Région Sud, Marseille Provence Airport, and Vinci Airports, the initiative exemplifies a collaborative ecosystem approach to innovation and sustainability in aviation.

Damien Eyriès, CEO of Rely, stated: “This project marks a strategic milestone for Rely, reinforcing our position as a leading expert in e-SAF and hydrogen solutions and showcasing our innovative efforts to deliver and de-risk the energy transition in Europe. Leveraging our engineering expertise and our standardisation approach, we are committed to advancing this landmark project towards next development stages, therefore with the aim of accelerating its final investment decision (FID).”

Alexis Martinez, H4 Marseille Fos, commented: “This agreement is materialising the structured and robust process of project development implemented by H4 Marseille Fos with major technical players of the sector. Appointing Rely to lead the technical feasibility study of our iconic project marks an important milestone in our development. Their recognised expertise will help us secure the technical choices and move forward with confidence toward the implementation of this strategic project.”",https://d3vavkuuuw54vu.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/france-02.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:57:54.667889

A team led by a venture spun off from Oxford spun and heavy weights in aircraft manufacturing and green financiers made a notable announcement (below) that they were infusing £20.75 MILLION ($28 MILLION) for sustainable aviation fuel development. The SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT, THE PROMISING TECHNOLOGY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INVESTORS make this a significant milestone in the drive to 2050.

The goal of Net Zero Carbon emissions by 2050 is one of , if not the, greatest challenge for aviation. Billions have been committed by OEMs, major capital venture companies, foundations, universities, NGOs and countries. Here is a short list of blogs focused on the players, the variety of energy sources, exploring different chemical options to convert raw materials into suitable fuels, the environmental consequences of harvesting the feedstocks for SAF,the distribution for these new sources and the infrastructure needed, the capacity of CO reduction through cleaner engines, similar analyses of fuselages’ impact on emissions and even operational tactics’ which may be greener:

These provide some context to the 2050 goal campaign, so many different directions and with so little apparent coordination )competition better?). In this universe SAF is but one option and it is not without possible problems and doubters.

SO WHY TOUTING THIS OXFORD PRESS RELEASE AS SIGNIFICANT?

An excellent assessment of SAF has been published by ICCTO20, Why and how to bring down the cost of SAF. The OXCCU “solution” seems to meet the ICCTO20 identified impediments-

COMPARATIVE PRICE-“European Union Aviation Safety Agency estimated that the average production cost of SAF in 2024 ranged from €1,461 per tonne (for biofuels) to €7,695 per tonne (for e-fuels). We calculate that this is a cost premium of 2.1–10.6x compared with fossil jet fuel by converting fossil jet production costs from the International Energy Agency, reported in U.S. dollars per liter, into equivalent units. While e-fuel costs should come down when they arrive on the market around 2030, they are expected to remain far above the current price of fossil jet fuel.”

The Oxford production technology looks to be a cost effective method for refining

RISK OF INVESTMENT—“It takes up to 5 years for SAF projects to reach final investment decision—a critical stage during project development that indicates whether projects are ready to move forward to construction—and many projects fail before this is achieved. Earlier this year, consulting group BCG found that fewer than 30% of SAF projects globally have reached final investment decision. Often projects come apart due to technology “valleys of death” during the transition between the demonstration and commercialization stages. This can be the result of poor project financing, mismanagement, or unforeseen technical barriers. SAF projects require significant funding and investor backing, particularly when constructing first-of-a-kind (FOAK) facilities.

If funding support fluctuates (as it has with the recently revised 45Z tax credits in the United States), if producers cannot secure long-term offtake agreements, or if governments and other investors do not provide sufficient loan support, SAF projects may fail before final investment decision.

OXCCU has attracted an uber impressive investment team which has a gravitas by including

a consortium of airlines, likely excellent judges of the prices and the practical implementation issues;

a major OEM that knows how its powerplants and systems emit carbon plus what their machinery ingests a range of potential fuels

six financial institutions that already participate in the green energy sector and thus have insights into OXCCU’s competitors

As noted green investor, celebrated baseball player and manager, Yogi Berra[1] once opined that…

As good as the OXCCU prospects appear to be, innovation, technology, market prices and a whole host of “unknown/unknowns” may not reward the BLUES’s green solution.

Airlines and Safran Back New SAF Production Process

A Series B funding round raised $28 million for the Oxford University start-up

UK start-up OXCCU is preparing to start demonstrating its new SAF production process in a larger plant at Oxford Airport.

September 30, 2025

International Airlines Group and aircraft engines and systems group Safran are among the main investors in the Series B funding round that raised £20.75 million ($28 million) for sustainable aviation fuel innovator OXCCU. The capital will support development of the UK start-up’s OX2 fuel manufacturing demonstration plant located at Oxford Airport, which is expected to be fully operational in 2026.

OXCCU is developing a process to support mass production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by converting biogenic waste carbon and hydrogen by the end of the 2020s. The company, which was founded by Oxford University chemical engineers in 2021, is already producing small quantities of its SAF blend in the smaller OX1 demonstration plant.

In addition to the IAGi Ventures arm of International Airlines Group (parent company of British Airways and Iberia) and Safran Corporate Ventures, the latest funding round was also backed by new investors Orlen VC, Hostplus, and TCVC. The oversubscribed round was supported by existing backers including Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, and Braavos Capital.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, OXCCU’s CEO. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

Simplified, Lower-cost SAF Production

According to OXCCU, its approach simplifies SAF production by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction.

The company claims that this process reduces capital and operating costs, as well as the carbon intensity of the fuel. The catalyst can be applied with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen input gas compositions, which is expected to deliver the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

OXCCU says its catalyst will produce sustainable aviation fuel in a simpler and lower-cost process.

“We recognize the need for the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably,” commented Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group sustainability director. “IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU, which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”",https://jdasolutions.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/green-engine-saf.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:58:00.454792

San Diego County Regional Airport Authority celebrated the official opening of Phase 1A of the new Terminal 1 (New T1) at San Diego International Airport (SAN) with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The event brought together executives from the Airport Authority, partner airlines, and the Turner-Flatiron joint-venture construction team, marking a major milestone in the airport’s history.

The New T1 replaces the 58-year-old Terminal 1 with a modern facility designed to enhance the passenger experience and meet the growing travel demands of the San Diego region. With its thoughtful design and expanded amenities, the terminal reflects the Airport Authority’s commitment to efficiency, comfort, and sustainability. Turner-Flatiron served as the delivery team, with Gensler as lead architect.

“On behalf of our partnering agencies, stakeholders and all the employees and tenants at San Diego International Airport, we are truly proud to open the new Terminal 1 and share all that it offers with San Diego and the world,” said Kimberly Becker, President and CEO, San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “The existing Terminal 1 has served our community for more than five decades and today we are ushering in a new era. The New T1 provides the comfort, convenience, and efficiency travellers expect while reflecting the spirit of San Diego.”

“We are thrilled to commemorate this historic day and celebrate the tremendous effort and planning that went into making this day possible,” said Gil Cabrera, Airport Authority Board Chair. “I am proud of the Airport Authority team and their unwavering commitment to bring San Diego a new Terminal 1. The airport is often the first and last impression we get to make as a city, and the New T1 is something San Diegans will be proud of now and for generations to come.”

In the pursuit of net-zero by 2050, the aviation industry demands “fundamental innovation” in aircraft design. A partnership between aircraft giant Airbus and tech leader Toshiba is leading the charge.

According to the companies, they’ve developed a breakthrough superconducting motor designed for hydrogen-powered flight.

The Future of Hydrogen-Powered Transportation

Toshiba unveiled the superconducting motor in 2022, showcasing a potential solution to the need for high power with minimal weight. According to Fumitoshi Mizutani, who leads the motor development project at Toshiba, the initial prototype demonstrated remarkable efficiency.

In 2022, we succeeded in developing a prototype superconducting motor that is both lightweight and compact, but still capable of delivering high output of 2 megawatts,” Mizutani said. “It is one-tenth the weight of conventional products with the same output.”

The prototype’s compact size and favorable output drew the attention of Airbus. The company is developing zero-emission, hydrogen-powered aircraft that could utilize a superconducting motor.

According to engineers, the motor’s technology, specifically the electric method where hydrogen fuel cells generate power, is an ideal match for hydrogen propulsion. Superconductivity is the property of certain materials to achieve zero electrical resistance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures. They emphasize its ability to work in tandem with hydrogen storage.

If engineers want to use hydrogen as fuel, it must be liquified and stored at –253∘C.

Toshiba leaders consider themselves pioneers because the company has put over 50 years of research into this field. However, hydrogen’s availability remains a barrier. Despite the hurdles, they expect the superconducting motor to boost fuel efficiency and flight range. Additionally, it holds promising applications beyond aviation into shipping and space development.

Shibata and Mizutani said, “As engineers, there’s something truly romantic and exciting about developing next-generation aircraft.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/superconduction-robot.png,N,,2025-10-09 11:58:11.226561

""The positive response to our programs confirms that the aviation industry is not only ready but eager to lead in sustainability.","CLEVELAND, Oct. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- 4AIR, the global leader in business aviation sustainability, announced today that it has helped aircraft owners, operators, and passengers offset or reduce more than 6.2 million metric tons of CO2 through the use of verified carbon offsets and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) since launching in November 2020. SAF is a ""drop-in"" fuel that meets all the same technical and safety requirements as fossil-based jet fuel but comes from a more sustainable source.

In the five years since its inception, 4AIR's programs have:

Facilitated more than 2 million carbon neutral or higher flight hours, reducing the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted during flight. To put this into perspective, this is more flight hours than the annual amount flown by the four largest private aviation operators combined.

Documented more than 20.2 million blended gallons of SAF — which has reduced jet fuel emissions in its lifecycle by more than 43,000 metric tons of Co2.

Reduced or offset more than 6 million metric tons of CO2 through carbon offsets and SAF.

Contributed more than $250,000 to aviation sustainability research through its Aviation Climate Fund.

Implemented the first live trials for contrail mitigation into business aviation

""Our goal with launching 4AIR was to make sustainability accessible, and this success shows that there is a desire by business aviation to decarbonize, if the right tools are put in place. But we must keep pushing to drive broader industry adoption and achieve even higher levels of sustainability,"" said 4AIR President Kennedy Ricci.

In addition to its impactful efforts on the offset front, 4AIR has been actively building out its offerings to better serve the aviation industry across the board. This includes the recent expansion of its comprehensive regulatory compliance program. With this extension, 4AIR now supports more than 25 regulatory schemes worldwide — ensuring aviation operators are in full compliance amid a rapidly changing regulatory landscape.

To further amplify its mission of educating the world on sustainability, since its 2020 launch, the 4AIR team has attended over 250 events — speaking at more than 100 of those — a testament to their dedication to empowering audiences worldwide to engage in meaningful sustainability initiatives.

""The positive response to our programs confirms that the aviation industry is not only ready but eager to lead in sustainability.

Building a domestic carbon removals market

Air New Zealand has become one of the first major corporates to invest in a new wave of homegrown, internationally verified carbon removals, committing to purchase 8,000 tonnes by 2030 through its partnership with My Native Forest.

The initiative aims to catalyse a robust voluntary carbon market in New Zealand by backing native forest regeneration verified to international standards — a step that could redefine how the country’s private sector contributes to climate targets and biodiversity goals.

My Native Forest provides a digital platform for investing in the restoration of indigenous ecosystems across Aotearoa in exchange for verified carbon removals. Unlike conventional avoidance credits, which prevent emissions elsewhere, removal credits represent carbon physically captured and stored by newly established forests.

Long-term climate strategy for hard-to-abate aviation

Kiri Hannifin, Air New Zealand’s Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer, said the decision reflects the airline’s commitment to begin climate action “in its own backyard” while preparing for a carbon market expected to mature later this decade.

“Native forest planting takes time, so it’s important to secure future supply now,” Hannifin said. “As New Zealand’s national carrier, the co-benefits for biodiversity and pest control here at home make this agreement even more powerful.”

She noted that aviation remains among the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. “Scaling sustainable aviation fuel, optimising our fleet, and developing alternative propulsion technologies are complex, expensive, and rely on multiple external factors. High-integrity carbon removals will play a significant role in reaching net zero by 2050 — and New Zealand is uniquely positioned with its land, ecosystems, and international reputation to supply them,” she added.

The airline’s purchase will be delivered in phases — 500 tonnes in 2028, 2,500 in 2029, and 5,000 in 2030 — with each verified credit representing one tonne of carbon removed. All credits will be issued via a global registry under recognised international verification frameworks.

Carbon finance for biodiversity and local resilience

Mitchell McLaughlin, co-founder of My Native Forest, said Air New Zealand’s early investment demonstrates the power of carbon finance to fund nature-based restoration at scale. Land parcels for the programme are being identified across Canterbury, Nelson, Marlborough, Tairāwhiti Gisborne, Waikato, Auckland, and Northland.

“Air New Zealand will provide capital in return for carbon removals that might otherwise have flowed offshore. Instead, it will stay here, directly funding native forest restoration,” McLaughlin said. “This partnership shows that planting native trees is no longer just a goodwill gesture — it’s a commercially viable pathway for landowners.”

He added that the benefits reach far beyond carbon accounting. “We’re creating income streams that reward integrity while restoring biodiversity, protecting waterways, and strengthening rural economies. Every tonne of carbon removed supports nurseries, contractors, pest-control operations, and local communities across Aotearoa.”

Strengthening credibility in the global carbon market

New Zealand’s voluntary carbon market has faced challenges in establishing verification systems that align with international standards, a key barrier to attracting institutional buyers. My Native Forest’s approach — combining digital monitoring tools, global registry issuance, and local ecological oversight — is designed to overcome that gap.

The move also positions New Zealand to play a larger role in global carbon markets as corporate demand for removals accelerates. Removal credits have gained traction among multinational buyers seeking to align with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidance and aviation’s global net-zero roadmap under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA scheme.

Hannifin said securing verified domestic supply early ensures Air New Zealand can meet future compliance and voluntary offset needs without relying solely on overseas projects. “Starting now helps ensure the market will be ready when we really need it,” she said.

Expanding local partnerships

Air New Zealand is in the final stages of negotiating a second contract with another New Zealand-based supplier of internationally verified, nature-based removals, expected to be finalised by the end of the year. Together, these partnerships aim to demonstrate how domestic, high-integrity removals can compete with — and complement — global supply options.

For investors and corporate sustainability leaders, the deal offers a case study in using carbon finance to drive local climate action while meeting international reporting and verification requirements.

By directing capital into native forest restoration rather than overseas offset schemes, Air New Zealand is testing a model that could help bridge the gap between national climate priorities and global market credibility — a space increasingly critical for hard-to-abate sectors worldwide.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Air-New-Zealand-invests-in-New-Zealand-nature-through-first-verified-carbon-removals.webp,N,,2025-10-09 12:57:53.233190

Instead, it describes microalgae as a biofuel feedstock solution as “…abundant, more evenly distributed, and scalable”.
As innovation continues to bring these associated costs down, the use of microalgae to ease supply bottlenecks for biofuel feedstocks will remain a medium-to-long-term conversation.
In the long-term however, Brambilla’s briefing concludes: “Microalgae, with its scalability, CO₂ absorption and high yields, represents the strongest candidate for tomorrow’s feedstock, with municipal solid waste and lignocellulosic biomass providing complementary roles.” ""Microalgae: the biofuel feedstock of the future "" was originally created and published by Power Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.","Biofuel has been touted as the cornerstone of a decarbonised future, but the complex supply chains and finite availability of waste lipids – historically the favoured feedstock – means that the sector faces an impending bottleneck.

As a result, biofuel producers are looking for new biomass feedstocks – and carbon dioxide (CO₂)-absorbing microalgae look to be the most sustainable, scalable solution in the long-term, according to GlobalData’s recent Next-Generation Fuels: Market Outlook, Trends and Opportunities report.

GlobalData is the parent company of Offshore Technology.

The waste lipid problem

Alternative fuels are a growing sector, spurred by the need to curb emissions associated with heavy transport industries such as aviation and maritime. These alternative fuels include sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, which GlobalData forecasts will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% between 2025 and 2030, with global capacity expected to double by 2030.

The recent rapid growth of alternative fuels has been powered by waste lipids, primarily animal fats and used cooking oil (UCO). By 2030, GlobalData expects that 5.6 billion gallons per year of animal fats will be used, with UCO utilised in the highest number of plants, at 65.

The popularity of waste lipids is considered in a recent analyst briefing written by GlobalData energy transition analyst Clarice Brambilla, who spoke to Offshore Technology to expand on her report.

“Animal fats and UCO have become the go-to feedstocks because they are well-known, abundant, and supported by robust collection networks built for biodiesel and renewable diesel production,” she said. “From a technical standpoint, they contain a high proportion of easily convertible lipids, which simplifies processing and reduces capital intensity compared to lignocellulosic or waste-based alternatives.”

Government policy has promoted the use of waste lipids as a biomass feedstock, putting support in place to boost the developing sector and avoid the ‘food versus fuel’ debate associated with crop-based biofuels. Instead of threatening food security, waste lipids from UCO and animal fats align with policymakers’ push for circular economy principles. As a result, frameworks such as the EU RED III double-counting mechanism and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard have emerged, allowing UCO and animal fats to receive 'double counting' credit and low carbon-intensity scores.

However, little can be done about the fact that waste lipids are finitely available and that the biofuel sector is going to hit a supply problem. The International Energy Agency doesn’t expect cooking oil supply yo ever exceed 20 million tonnes annually.

Without an alternative feedstock, waste lipids threaten to stunt the biofuel sector’s growth.

The microalgae answer

Solving this bottleneck is crucial to supporting the growth of alternative fuels. Brambilla’s briefing points to a new solution, suggesting that “microalgae stand out as the most promising option”.

Microalgae are defined as “microscopic single-celled photosynthetic microbes that can exist individually or in colonies, with sizes ranging from 1 to 10μm [micrometres]”. They differ from macroalgae not only because they are smaller but because they lack physical structures such as lamina, holdfast and haptera.

As a biofuel feedstock, microalgae can be cultivated in controlled ponds or photobioreactors, which can be placed on non-arable land. The efficient use of land gives microalgae an advantage over other biomass feedstocks such as non-edible oils and forest residue, which are land-intensive and take away from potential agricultural space.

Critics of other biomass feedstocks such as palm, soybean and vegetable oils have pointed to negative impacts on food security and water availability. However, microalgae biorefineries do not compete with food markets, making sustainable scaling possible.

The briefing explains that “unlike waste lipids, algae are not constrained by food systems, land availability, or fragmented supply chains”. Instead, it describes microalgae as a biofuel feedstock solution as “…abundant, more evenly distributed, and scalable”.

Microalgae biorefineries can be located conveniently for producers to optimise supply chains and reduce transport costs. In Chiclana, Spain, the EU-funded All-gas project uses municipal wastewater to grow microalgae cultures. Wastewater nutrients, residual biomass energy and CO₂ are used as biofuel inputs, utilising the full production chain of algae to biofuels. The project is designed to demonstrate the sustainable large-scale production of biofuels, which can be co-located near industrial or urban hubs.

Elsewhere, the FUELGAE project is targeting the production of advanced biofuels for emissions-heavy transport sectors. With €5m ($5.8m) in EU funding, the project is piloting integrated algae cultivation at a steel plant in Romania and a 2G ethanol facility in Spain. The briefing considers the project, noting: “While these efforts highlight the technical feasibility of algae as a feedstock, high production costs – driven by cultivation infrastructure, energy intensive harvesting and refining processes – continue to pose hurdles, underscoring the importance of sustained government support.”

Early days: microalgae's obstacles

With the technology still in research, development and pilot stages, Brambilla told Offshore Technology: “Significant scaling of algae-derived fuels is unlikely before the early-to-mid 2030s, and more realistically toward 2035–40, when production costs and conversion efficiencies are expected to improve. Today, algae fuel remains in the pilot and early demonstration phase, with high cultivation costs limiting commercial rollout.”

Indeed, the biggest obstacle to scalability is the expense associated with cultivating, harvesting and refining the microalgae. Investors need to overcome operational costs including the development and installation of specialised infrastructure, and costs associated with energy-intensive harvesting and drying techniques (such as centrifugation, filtration and flocculation for harvesting and dewatering for drying).

Optimising cultivation will maximise the lipid accumulation, so producers must also maintain carefully controlled environmental conditions. Microalgae require adequate light, CO₂ supply and a temperature of between 15°C and 30°C, all factors that are energy-intensive and therefore expensive to control.

As innovation continues to bring these associated costs down, the use of microalgae to ease supply bottlenecks for biofuel feedstocks will remain a medium-to-long-term conversation. For now, waste oils and animal fats will remain the main feedstocks of the biogas sector, expected to sustain renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel until 2030.

In the long-term however, Brambilla’s briefing concludes: “Microalgae, with its scalability, CO₂ absorption and high yields, represents the strongest candidate for tomorrow’s feedstock, with municipal solid waste and lignocellulosic biomass providing complementary roles.”

Given the rising share of renewable power, global power grid systems need to be upgraded as disturbances from weather events require greater grid stability.
China’s push to meet both domestic and global demand for renewable energy technology to achieve carbon neutrality has led to massive overcapacity.","China can decarbonise the world – but even that won’t fix its overcapacity problem

Alicia Gª Herrero (Natixis) | China is crucial role to the world’s green transition for two contrasting reasons: it is the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter – over 30 percent of the global total – and it is the world’s largest producer of green technology. China is vital especially for renewable energy products, manufacturing 92 percent of the world’s solar modules and 82 percent of wind turbines as of 2024. The fact that 90 percent of global emissions come from energy consumption underscores the importance of China’s dominant market share.

China’s leadership said in 2020 that it would achieve an emissions peak by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Although these goals have not been formally adopted in law, China has published a series of regulations to pave the way, including the Action Plan for Carbon Emission Peaking Before 2030 (NDRC, 2021) and the Energy Law of China. As a crucial part of its decarbonisation campaign, China aims to raise the share of energy consumption generated from non-fossil fuel sources to 20 percent by 2025, 25 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2060. Solar and wind power will meet the bulk of this increased demand. This share stood at 19.8 percent in 2024, only a nudge away from the 2025 target.

To meet its goals, China faces a steep curve for growth of non-fossil fuel energy consumption after 2030. With the world’s heavy reliance on China’s green technology exports, the question arises as to whether China can produce enough renewable technology to facilitate not only its own demands, but also the rest of world’s requirements for net-zero emissions. In the following sections, we provide estimates to answer this question.

Calculating the required installed capacity

We calculated the amount of renewable power generation needed to meet the global renewable energy demand forecast in the International Energy Agency’s NZE 2050 scenario (IEA, 2023), which makes projections based on the premise of reaching global net-zero emissions by 2050. We then estimated the installed capacity of solar and wind power that would be required by 2050, assuming the same utilisation hours per year as the average for 2020-2024.

Our projections show that despite being behind schedule, the stage reached in global installation of renewable power is not too far from the trajectory for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This means the growth upside for global renewable energy demand may be limited. Meanwhile, the regional breakdown shows a great imbalance: China is surpassing the required rate of installation, while the rest of world is moving too slowly. It thus seems straightforward for China to fulfil its own renewable energy requirements in order to achieve net-zero emissions.

Even in the case of increased global demand under NZE 2050, China will still be able to supply the world’s installation needs to the same degree as it is doing now. In 2024, China supplied 91 percent of the solar modules and 39 percent of wind turbines installed outside China. Assuming China maintains production at that level, and that China exports all products beyond what is needed to meet domestic demand, it will be able to provide approximately four-fifths of solar equipment and more than half of the wind turbines needed for the rest of world.

For wind, there seems to be clear scope for China to contribute more than it has so far. For solar, it seems China’s current production is not enough to cover the world’s future demand. However, considering China’s meteoric production capacity rise, there is no doubt that China will be able to meet global demand easily, without further expansion. Therefore, China can already produce enough renewable products for the world’s energy transition, even in the most aggressive scenario. In fact, China faces overcapacity because global demand remains far below the NZE 2050 level.

Removing green-tech manufacturing subsidies deals a blow to China’s economy

Chinese overcapacity in solar products has grown since 2023 as export prices have fallen while export volumes have continued to rise (García-Herrero and Xu, 2025). As external demand has subsided due to delayed installation and protectionism against Chinese green technology, Chinese manufacturers have turned to the domestic market, with irrational business practices, such as offering below-cost prices for orders. Installation has consequently surged, greatly exceeding actual energy needs.

Consequently, the profitability of Chinese solar manufacturers has plummeted, with a 200 percent fall in their operating income from 2022 to 2024. Given this, many have trimmed capital expenditure by 40 percent, on average.

In addition, China in February 2025 repealed the fixed feed-in tariff for renewable power, meaning newly built on-grid renewable projects since 1 June 2025 have to face market-determined prices. This triggered massive frontloading in the first half of 2025. After the cut-off date, installation declined rapidly and is expected to continue to decline.

With worsening financial performance, the ending of price support and frontloaded installation, China’s enthusiasm for renewables should cool in the remainder of 2025 and beyond. Structural overcapacity will decline gradually as the market consolidates through mergers and acquisitions.

Silver lining: spurring growth through grid investment

Although installation of renewable energy generation capacity in China has increased, it hasn’t been utilised effectively, because of the unstable nature of renewable power and, more importantly, the lack of infrastructure for renewable projects.

From 2020 to 2024, China installed an unprecedented 900 GW of renewable capacity, yet failed to reduce energy and carbon intensity by 13.5 percent and 18 percent, as called for in the government’s 14th Five Year Plan. In addition to the structural slowdown in the Chinese economy, China’s continued reliance on electricity from fossil fuels could be a major reason. Despite the higher share of renewable power in installed capacity, the share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources remains low, leaving the bulk of the power load to fossil fuels.

The root cause of this is the widespread underutilisation of installed renewable power capacity and increased curtailment, due to China’s underinvestment in the power grid. Since the dual carbon targets were announced in 2020, investment in power generation has surged while investment in the power grid has remained largely the same. The lagging investment in the power grid has put a cap on renewable power consumption as projects sit on a waiting list to connect to the grid (IEA, 2024).

The lack of grid capacity is especially apparent in inter-regional transmission, power dispatching and power load management, which creates further blocks to renewable power consumption. In some of China’s western provinces, where the largest renewable projects are located, the curtailment rate can reach over 30 percent because of insufficient grid capacity. Moreover, although China’s energy storage projects have picked up in the past two years, the total storage capacity remains minimal compared to the stock of renewables, meaning less flexibility in responding to demand fluctuations.

Conclusions: overcoming overcapacity and spurring the economy

China needs to increase its investment in power infrastructure to reduce renewable curtailment and curb its reliance on carbon-intensive power sources. This would create new growth momentum to counter the retreat of capital expenditure in renewable equipment manufacturing and renewable project construction.

First, China needs to ramp up investment in its national power grid to increase power transmission capacity. This has started already, with power grid investment increasing to 608 billion renminbi in 2024 from 528 billion renminbi in 2023 and continuing to grow by 12 percent year-on-year in the first seven months of 2025. With power demand projected to grow by 50 percent by 2050 and the need for improved west-to-east power transmission, China may need to double investment in its power grid by 2030 to fill the gap.

Second, China needs to set more ambitious targets for energy storage capacity to support the functioning of the power grid. With integrated or standalone storage solutions, renewable projects can better navigate the volatility of power demand. Energy storage allows the freedom to time power sales for maximum profit and can also serve as a stabiliser when the power grid faces overload or underload.

Finally, global demand for power infrastructure is rising. Given the rising share of renewable power, global power grid systems need to be upgraded as disturbances from weather events require greater grid stability. This will continue to boost China’s exports of electrical equipment, supporting the economy.

Beyond the fact that investing in power infrastructure will keep China’s green-growth engine running, there is the additional geopolitical advantage of shifting international attention away from China’s overcapacity in renewables and subsequent dumping of subsidised green technology on the global market. Power infrastructure may even replace renewable equipment as a new source of trade revenue, as it is less sensitive and thus less likely to be a target of sanctions.

China’s push to meet both domestic and global demand for renewable energy technology to achieve carbon neutrality has led to massive overcapacity. By pivoting investment from renewable energy capacity to power-grid upgrades and equipment, China can shore up an otherwise underwhelming domestic economy, keep on track for its net-zero.",https://thecorner.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/logotipo-the-corner-eu-1200-453.png,N,,2025-10-09 08:56:33.191566

Revenue Environment and Outlook

""Delta generated record September quarter revenue of $15.2 billion, up 4.1 percent year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our diverse, high margin revenue streams and improving Domestic fundamentals. Over the last 6 weeks, sales trends have accelerated across all geographies and in every advance purchase window, positioning Delta to finish the year with momentum. For the December quarter, we expect total revenue growth of 2 percent to 4 percent over last year's record performance, with healthy sequential unit revenue improvement driven by continued Domestic strength and meaningful improvement in Transatlantic unit revenue,"" said Glen Hauenstein, Delta's president.

Record September quarter revenue reflecting the strength of Delta's brand: September quarter total revenue increased 4.1 percent over prior year to a record $15.2 billion, led by premium, corporate and loyalty. Adjusted total unit revenue (TRASM) growth improved 3.5 points sequentially, with the September quarter up 0.3 percent over prior year. Consistent with previous disclosures, year-over-year comparisons for the September quarter benefitted from lapping last year's CrowdStrike-caused outage, including 2.6 points on total revenue growth and 1.1 points on total unit revenue growth. The December quarter outlook for revenue growth of 2 percent to 4 percent reflects healthy sequential improvement in underlying revenue and unit revenue trends.

Diverse, high-margin revenue streams leading growth: Delta's diversified revenue base contributed 60 percent of total revenue in the third quarter and grew double-digits year-over-year. Premium revenue grew 9 percent compared to the September quarter of 2024, with improvement across all products. Loyalty revenue increased 9 percent year-over-year as SkyMiles members continue to deepen engagement beyond flight. American Express remuneration of $2 billion grew 12 percent over prior year, driven by double-digit co-brand spend growth.

Improving Domestic revenue environment: Domestic passenger revenue grew 5 percent year-over-year, supported by an acceleration in corporate sales, continued strength in premium cabins and an inflection in main cabin unit revenue growth. Domestic unit revenue grew 2 percent over prior year during the quarter and is expected to remain positive in the December quarter.

Corporate sales* rebounding with sequential improvement across all sectors: Corporate sales were up 8 percent over prior year in the third quarter. Recent corporate survey results indicate that roughly 90 percent of companies expect their travel volume to increase or remain steady in 2026, 5 points higher than last year's survey at this time.

Cost Performance and Outlook

""Our teams continue to deliver for our customers, achieving operational performance that has led the industry. Non-fuel unit cost growth was approximately flat compared to prior year, bringing year-to-date non-fuel unit cost growth to less than 2 percent, consistent with our low-single digit guidance at the start of the year even as we reduced capacity post summer to align to demand,"" said Dan Janki, Delta's chief financial officer.

September Quarter 2025 Cost Performance

Operating expense of $15.0 billion and adjusted operating expense of $13.5 billion

Adjusted non-fuel costs of $10.6 billion

Non-fuel CASM was 13.35¢, an increase of 0.3 percent year-over-year

Additional information concerning risks and uncertainties that could cause differences between actual results and forward-looking statements is contained in our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 and other filings filed with the SEC from time to time. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which represent our views only as of the date of this press release, and which we undertake no obligation to update except to the extent required by law.

Note A: The following tables show reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. The reasons Delta uses these measures are described below. Reconciliations may not calculate exactly due to rounding.

Delta sometimes uses information (""non-GAAP financial measures"") that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP""). Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The tables below show reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

Forward Looking Projections. Delta is not able to reconcile forward looking non-GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort because the adjusting items such as those used in the reconciliations below will not be known until the end of the period and could be significant.

Adjustments. These reconciliations include certain adjustments to GAAP measures that are made to provide comparability between the reported periods, if applicable, and for the reasons indicated below:

Third-party refinery sales. Refinery sales to third parties, and related expenses, are not related to our airline segment. Excluding these sales therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.

MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges. Mark-to-market (""MTM"") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period, and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period.

MTM adjustments on investments. Unrealized gains/losses result from our equity investments that are accounted for at fair value in non-operating expense. The gains/losses are driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in certain companies, particularly those without publicly-traded shares. Adjusting for these gains/losses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.

Loss on extinguishment of debt. This adjustment relates to early termination of a portion of our debt. Adjusting for these losses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.

Realized gain on sale of investments. This adjustment relates to gains on the sale of investments generated in adjusted results that had previously been included in GAAP results. During the September 2024 quarter, we sold a portion of our investment in CLEAR. Adjusting for this gain allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.

Operating Cash Flow, adjusted. We present operating cash flow, adjusted because management believes adjusting for the following item provides a more meaningful measure for investors:

Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities. We adjust for these items, which were primarily funded by cash restricted for airport construction, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's operating cash flow that is core to our operations in the periods shown.

Adjusted Non-Fuel Cost and Non-Fuel Unit Cost or Cost per Available Seat Mile, (""CASM-Ex"")

We adjust operating expense and CASM for certain items described above, as well as the following items and reasons described below:

Aircraft fuel and related taxes. The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.

Profit sharing. We adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.

Adjusted Debt to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (""EBITDAR""). We present adjusted debt to EBITDAR (""gross leverage"") because management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company's overall debt profile. Adjusted debt includes total operating lease liabilities (including fleet, ground and other) and sale-leaseback financing liabilities. We calculate EBITDAR by adding depreciation and amortization to operating income, adjusted and adjusting for the fixed portion of operating lease expense.

Adjusted Net Debt. We use adjusted gross debt, including fleet operating lease liabilities (comprised of aircraft and engine leases and regional aircraft leases embedded within our capacity purchase agreements) and unfunded pension liabilities (if applicable), in addition to adjusted debt and finance leases, to present estimated financial obligations. We reduce adjusted total debt by cash, cash equivalents, and LGA restricted cash, resulting in adjusted net debt, to present the amount of assets needed to satisfy the debt. Management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company's overall debt profile.

Gross Capital Expenditures. We adjust capital expenditures for the following item to determine gross capital expenditures for the reason described below:

Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in capital expenditures. We adjust for these items because management believes investors should be informed that a portion of these capital expenditures from airport construction projects are either funded with restricted cash specific to these projects or reimbursed by a third party.

Free Cash Flow. We present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Free cash flow is also used internally as a component of our incentive compensation programs. Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities and net cash from investing activities, adjusted for (i) pension plan contributions, (ii) net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and (iii) net redemptions of short-term investments. These adjustments are made for the following reasons:

Pension plan contributions. Cash flows related to pension funding are included in our GAAP operating activities. We adjust to exclude these contributions to allow investors to understand the cash flows related to our core operations.

Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities and capital expenditures. We have adjusted for these items, which were primarily funded by cash restricted for airport construction, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow and capital expenditures that are core to our operations in the periods shown.

Net redemptions of short-term investments. Net redemptions of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow generated by our operations.

The team produced and characterized the SAF, along with two other commercially available fuels before collecting emissions and particulate data to support the aviation industry’s emissions goals.

First, chemical engineers refined electrofuels, or e-fuels, manufactured with hydrogen produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide.

Then through a series of hydroprocessing reactions over several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They produced a small batch – about a barrel of fuel.

SwRI’s fuels and lubricants specialists then tested and characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI’s propulsion and energy specialists then used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time and risks for our clients.”

“Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,” said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI’s Mechanical Engineering Division. “With this project we’re gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.”",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Low-Res_advancing-sustainable-aviation-fuels-research-18-Full-size-RGB-JPG-1.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-09 06:58:31.413862

It was found that social awareness of any CCU/S technology is low, and acceptance of CCU/S depends on the high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and diversity with regard to each unique project’s specifics.
Mechanisms to mitigate the high energy costs faced by industry, while still maintaining climate ambition, will be essential to ensure the operational feasibility of carbon capture.","Learnings from the multidisciplinary ConsenCUS innovation project and how it enables a sustainable future.

Emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere need to be avoided to prevent dramatic climate change. In fact, Europe leads the way by targeting net-zero emissions and, thus, full climate neutrality by 2050. Capturing CO2 from industrial processes (or air) and subsequent utilisation or storage of this gas (CCU/S) is necessary to reach those targets. However, CCU/S comes at a steep energetic cost itself, so this process should not only be accelerated in terms of deployment, but also be made more sustainable to reach net-zero industrial emissions.

The ConsenCUS project

Since 2021, a consortium of 19 industrial and academic partners has been working on ground-breaking innovations that all aim to make CCUS compatible with a net-zero world. The core strategy revolves around using electricity for the capture and conversion processes, which is much easier to decarbonise than the heat-powered solutions on the market. In a nutshell, the ConsenCUS project aimed to achieve its acronym: CarbOn Neutral cluSters through Electricity-based iNnovations in Capture, Utilisation and Storage. Now, the project is in its final months. It has demonstrated the technical feasibility of the solutions with a three-stage pilot campaign and its economic, environmental, and societal impact potential if the innovations are implemented at full scale through multidisciplinary analyses.

Carbon capture and utilisation demonstrated

The ConsenCUS carbon capture technology uses the natural equilibrium between CO2 and water: at high pH, a potassium hydroxide solution absorbs the CO2 directly from factory exhaust fumes passing through an absorption column. In a separate regeneration module, the pH is lowered using electrochemically active membrane stacks, which bubble out the CO2 and recycle the solvent for the absorption process.

The central challenge in the project was to bring this concept, not demonstrated for carbon capture before, from the lab scale to a real industrial environment. After careful design and construction, the demonstration modules proved capable of dealing with starkly different flue gas compositions at the sites of a cement production plant in Aalborg (Denmark), a refinery near Ploiesti (Romania), and a magnesite production plant in Yerakini (Greece). The main challenges that were addressed: reaching low energy consumption and high CO2 capture efficiency, so that the technology can compete with benchmark technology when applied at full scale.

The captured CO2 was used to feed the adjacent CO2 utilisation module, where the CO2 was pressurised and converted into potassium formate, also using electricity. This biodegradable product is a preservative with an associated billion-dollar market, but can also be used to produce formic acid or in protein or fuel production to further increase its value. Even at this pilot scale, this process was found to be less energy-intensive than the conventional fossil route to produce potassium formate and formic acid, with the potential for full sustainability when renewable electricity is used.

As shown in the picture, the capture process consists of:

2. Solvent regeneration and CO2 separation module; and

3. CO2 utilisation module deployed to convert CO2 into useful chemical building blocks.

Net zero industry needs safe CO2 pipelines and storage

Even with carbon capture and utilisation technology fully developed and decarbonised, CO2 would need to be moved to the optimal location for conversion or storage to achieve net-zero industries. The ConsenCUS project results contribute to three important prerequisites:

Safety assessment of permanent underground CO2 storage locations (e.g., Stenlille, Denmark) and the gas quality and geological characteristics of temporary underground CO2 storage during multiple on- and offloading sequences, which may be relevant in the future.

Risk assessment on CO2 pipeline transport, specifically with regard to rupture in varying weather conditions.

A mathematical model for optimisation of the logistics of CO2 between emitters and users or storage locations, applied to case studies of sustainable aviation fuel production and Southeast Europe as a net-zero industrial cluster.

People and planet

ConsenCUS field research through online and town hall meetings, visits to schools and community centres provided insight into the level of awareness and acceptance of CCU/S among the general public. It was found that social awareness of any CCU/S technology is low, and acceptance of CCU/S depends on the high levels of complexity, uncertainty, and diversity with regard to each unique project’s specifics. Community members still preferred to have early and highly transparent engagement, even for pilot projects such as ConsenCUS. Honest communication on technology benefits and disclosure of risks was found to be a desirable strategy, but enabling community members with the means to participate (time or financial compensation) is necessary for this. Without this, the identified challenges of engagement fatigue, token engagements, and unequal partnerships are difficult to overcome.

Local acceptance is, perhaps unsurprisingly, connected to local environmental concerns. Water consumption worried community members in Greece, where alternative CO2 mitigation projects such as forestation were therefore seen more positively. While the ConsenCUS capture and conversion technologies decarbonise CCU by enabling renewable energy usage, it is important for the environmental performance as well as the social acceptance that other strains on the planet’s resources are known and taken into account. Full life cycle analysis of environmental strains and a dynamic life cycle cost analysis demonstrate the benefits and potential economic value of the ConsenCUS solutions, although the carbon footprint and price of the electricity that is being used are critical in these two aspects.

Industrial carbon management in the EU

Based on early project results, the consortium advocated for CCU/S development and deployment to be accelerated, and the consideration of the (carbon) footprint of CO2 emission mitigation strategies in planning for a net-zero future. With the Net Zero Industry Act and the Clean Industrial Deal and Industrial Carbon Management strategy of the EU now in place, the support for CCU/S has seen a major uptick over the course of the four-year project. To achieve the goals the Union has set for itself, we have further recommendations on how to maximise the impact of innovation within the EU member states.

Five recommendations for the EU’s industrial carbon management (ICM) policy

1. Support for ICM technologies should enable both next-generation technologies and the deployment of existing mature technologies.

2. The EU’s research and innovation (R&I) frameworks must acknowledge the importance of demonstrating, not just developing, innovative ICM technologies. This means fostering ‘learning-by-doing’, providing resource flexibility, and aligning project success indicators with the long timelines for demonstrating new technologies in real operational conditions.

3. Mechanisms to mitigate the high energy costs faced by industry, while still maintaining climate ambition, will be essential to ensure the operational feasibility of carbon capture.

4. Support for ICM demonstration and deployment must acknowledge the trade-offs between technology characteristics such as cost, environmental footprint, capture efficiency, energy consumption, scalability potential, and others.

5. To improve the EU’s competitiveness in ICM, R&I frameworks must be relatively unbureaucratic and allow flexibility for project consortia to recruit expertise with minimal administrative constraints, supported by appropriate human and knowledge resources from EU agencies.

As the ConsenCUS project is ending in 2025, the consortium is confident that CCU/S has improved its position as a viable and necessary strategy to prevent global climate change, while maintaining European industrial competitiveness and relevance. Scaling up the electrochemical CO2 capture and utilisation technology to full commercial scale, in collaboration with local communities and governments to optimise its logistics and place in the energy system, fits well in the net-zero future of Europe.

Thailand’s energy giant Bangchak Corporation will allocate part of its USD 30 million budget to develop e-fuel technology, aiming to reduce transportation carbon emissions. Executives from the Thai company recently visited ENEOS Corporation’s prototype e-fuel plant in Yokohama, Japan, as Bangchak actively seeks potential partners for future collaboration.

A major player in biofuels, Bangchak has begun producing Bio-VLSFO, a marine fuel blend containing 24% UCOME (Used Cooking Oil Methyl Ester) and marketed as B24. The first delivery was completed in February 2025. Aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, the company also inaugurated its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production unit in April, with an initial capacity of 1 million liters per day, converting fatty acids and vegetable oils into neat SAF.

Bangchak develops e-fuel to replace conventional fuels

Currently, Bangchak is looking beyond biofuels to synthetic e-fuels. E-fuel production involves extracting hydrogen through electrolysis powered by renewable energy, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then combined with captured CO₂ to produce synthetic hydrocarbons. After refining, these can be turned into e-gasoline, e-diesel, e-kerosene, e-methanol, and other variants that serve as drop-in substitutes for conventional fuels and can be blended in any ratio.

How e-fuels are made: turning renewable power and captured CO₂ into carbon-neutral fuels. (Illustration: eFuel Alliance)

The use of e-fuels is considered carbon-neutral, as they emit only as much CO₂ during combustion as was previously captured in their production. E-fuels also help overcome the challenges of storing and transporting renewable energy, since they can be shipped at room temperature and pressure.

Although e-fuels remain costly to produce, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that the price of e-kerosene could fall significantly by 2030, enabling it to compete with biomass-based SAF. Currently, global aviation fuel demand is still dominated by conventional jet kerosene, while SAF represents less than 0.1% of total consumption. Nevertheless, manufacturers and airlines are increasingly testing flights powered entirely by SAF.

Thailand’s e-fuels market to reach USD 250 billion by 2050

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimates that e-fuels could supply 3 to 17% of global aviation fuel by 2035, rising to as much as 55% by 2050 if technology and policy continue to advance. In Thailand, the e-fuel market is projected to reach USD 250 billion by 2050, reflecting an average annual growth rate of around 20% from 2024.

To advance its e-fuel research and development, Bangchak is drawing on the experience of Japan’s ENEOS Corporation, which currently produces one barrel (159 liters) of e-fuel per day and plans to scale up to 10,000 barrels daily by 2040. ENEOS is also testing its new fuel on buses for the Osaka Expo 2025.

""We do not want to do R&D from scratch but prefer to join hands with energy firms to speed up work in this field,"" said Chaiwat Kovavisarach, chief executive and president of Bangchak.

Bangchak plans to establish its own research center to support the development of e-fuel projects. The company will allocate part of its USD 30 million budget for the construction and aims to seek additional funding from Thailand’s Office of National Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation to help implement the project.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/meta/1760000030518814443.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 06:59:03.631783

Maritime energy demand forecast

DNV forecasts the maritime sector will cut its CO2 emissions by 77% by 2050. While not fully ‘net-zero by or around 2050’, as per the goal of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime looks set to decarbonize faster than all other transport subsectors. This abatement arises from a levelling off in demand for maritime transport from the 2030s, more efficient shipping, and a transition to low-GHG fuels and onboard CCS driven by the IMO’ s Net-Zero Framework (NZF), approved in April 2025 (IMO, 2025).

According to the report, efficiency measures like slow steaming, AI routing and wind-assisted propulsion will drive decarbonization. Fuel diversification is also underway, LNG is already in use; biofuels will reach 4% market share by 2030, followed by e-methanol (2037) and ammonia (2039).

Onboard carbon capture is expected to handle 4% of fossil fuel emissions by 2042. Nuclear propulsion may gain traction in the 2050s. Full details are available in DNV’s Maritime Forecast reports.

Plateauing demand for shipping

Total demand for maritime transport in tonne-miles will grow by 10% by 2030, but will then plateau before slowly declining back to today’s levels (Figure 2.11). This decoupling from global GDP, which is set to double by 2060, separates the maritime sector from all other transport subsectors. There are multiple contributing factors to this effect.

Ships mainly transport physical goods, not passengers or services. Future growth of the global economy will steadily become more service oriented: the economy will grow more than the production and shipping of goods (UNCTAD, 2024).

Additionally, some production will be home-shored and some supply chains will become more localized, reducing the need for shipping of produced goods. This is being done to increase self-sufficiency and cut costs from more expensive fuels. On the other hand, recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine have disrupted trade patterns, leading to increased shipping distances, for example, for Russian oil.

Breaking it down into the separate shipping segments, today, fossil cargo makes up one third of shipped goods. The transition to renewables will reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels, and thereby the need to ship them, starting in 2030.

However, the share of seaborne natural gas will temporarily increase significantly due to energy security and supply-demand patterns. Gas trade will almost double from today to 2040, before starting to decline.

In contrast, container shipping will continue to grow, thanks to increased containerization and a growing economy. Non-coal bulk and other cargo will also grow, albeit to a lesser extent. The sum of non-fossil shipping will plateau in the 2050s, up about 25% from today.

SMR technology is often promoted as the next generation of nuclear power

Small modular reactors (SMRs) used for direct propulsion on ships potentially offer a long-term energy solution compared with costly biofuels and e-fuels. However, significant technological, commercial, and regulatory challenges mean that nuclear in shipping only scales from 2045 in the forecast, though it accounts for 10% of the maritime fuel mix by 2060.

Future fuels for hard-to-electrify sectors

Sectors like aviation, maritime shipping, and long-haul trucking require energy dense fuels for long-distance travel. Fossil fuels provide a level of energy density that current and expected battery technologies cannot match.

Alternative liquid and gaseous fuels will emerge: Biofuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), will grow in the near term and are expected to constitute around 25% of the maritime and aviation fuel mix by 2060.

In the long term, hydrogen and its derivatives, like ammonia, will be critical. They are projected to power 10% to 35% of hard to electrify sectors such as aviation and maritime by 2060. The concept of onboard carbon capture is also being explored in shipping, and is forecast to capture 100 Mt of CO2 annually by 2060.

Hydrogen demand

Renewable and low-carbon hydrogen derivatives will be central to decarbonizing international shipping. EU measures are already reshaping the sector: the Emissions Trading System (ETS) has applied to large ships since January 2024, with full allowance surrender from 2027, and FuelEU Maritime introduces penalties for not meeting well-to-wake GHG requirements from January 2025.

Globally, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) updated GHG Strategy — reinforced in 2025 with new emissions caps and carbon pricing plans — is adding further pressure to adopt zero- or near-zero- GHG fuels and technologies. These policies are boosting demand for hydrogen derivatives, but large-scale uptake will hinge on lower production costs, robust lifecycle emissions verification, and expanded port infrastructure.

Electrification will remain limited to shore power at berth and short-range operations such as ferries. This leaves hydrogen-based fuels — notably ammonia and e-fuels — as the dominant zero-emission options by 2060. DNV projects e-fuels, mainly e-methanol, to account for 100 PJ (1% of the fuel mix) by 2030, 800 PJ (6%) by 2040, and 1,500 PJ (14%) by 2060.

Ammonia, while costlier to produce, can use much of the existing infrastructure and benefits from relatively simple CO2 capture when made from natural gas. This makes low-carbon ammonia the leading candidate in our long-term forecast, surpassing e-methanol in the overall fuel mix, at 21% and 14% respectively.

DNV expects toxicity concerns will be resolved, enabling large-scale trade from low-cost production regions to global bunkering hubs. Furthermore, DNV forecasts uptake at 10 PJ (0.1%) by 2030, 700 PJ (5%) by 2040, and 2,300 PJ (21%) by 2060, with faster growth in later decades as biogenic CO2 for e-methanol becomes harder to source.

While significant, these volumes fall short of the IMO’s decarbonization pathway. Although ammonia combustion is carbon-free, it produces nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions which contributes to air pollution and causes significant environmental and health impacts. However, this can be effectively mitigated through advanced engine and emissions-control technologies.

The turning point for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has arrived

Capture and storage capacity expected to quadruple by 2030. After 2030, growth in hard-to-decarbonize sectors will accelerate, with CCS deployment in manufacturing rising nearly ten-fold and making up about 25% of all captured emissions by mid-century.

CCS will grow to capture 6% of global CO2 emissions in 2050, falling significantly short of what is required for any net-zero outcome. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will capture 610 MtCO2 in 2050 — 38% of total captured emissions.

Bioenergy’s rise

Biofuel is already used in maritime transport by blending biofuels with fossil. Its use will grow steadily from a very low volume to reach a 5% share in 2030. By 2060 bioenergy will be the biggest non-fossil energy source in the sector, supplying 26% (3 EJ/yr) of total maritime demand. At this level, it surpasses the remaining use of fossil fuels (25%).

Net-zero emissions in our forecast is only achieved towards the end of this century, and the accumulation of emissions until then takes us beyond 2°C of warming by 2100. Science has shown beyond any doubt that humanity will then be experiencing, to its great cost, how critical each tenth of a degree of global warming is to our planet and society.

The John Cockerill and Technip Energies joint venture (JV) will assist with plant definition studies, technical feasibility, and support for permitting for the H4 Marseille Fos project.

“Leveraging our engineering expertise and our standardisation approach, we are committed to advancing this landmark project towards the next development stages, and its final investment decision (FID),” explained Rely’s CEO Damien Eyriés.

While it’s currently in the pre-front-end engineering and design (FEED) phase, the developers plan to utilise 300MW of electrolysers to produce green hydrogen in the future. Up to 75,000 tonnes of e-SAF will be produced once operational in 2030.

A methanol-to-jet (MTJ) fuel production pathway will ensure captured CO2 and green hydrogen are turned into a drop-in jet fuel low-carbon substitute. Therefore, other technology suppliers could be contracted, such as electrolyser providers.

The initiative is backed by the regional government Région Sud, with additional support from Marseille Provence Airport and Vinci Airports, which are aligning with EU decarbonisation goals.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, airlines must incorporate 10% e-SAF into aviation fuels by 2040.

However, while e-SAF is positioned as a practical replacement for jet fuel and a key offtake market for green hydrogen, critics have warned it cannot approach cost parity with fossil-based aviation fuel without significant subsidies.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/1759945440451.jpeg",N,,2025-10-09 04:56:17.937653

“The great news is that our industry is very resilient.

“Also, people can manage their budgets…a lot of the market now offers direct debit options where you can spread the cost.

“The great news is that our industry is very resilient. It’s a great place to be – holidays – because people want to book travel,” said Neil Swanson, Tui UK & Ireland managing director.

However, he noted: “People are waiting a bit later [to book]. It is a bit more uncertain, so they are waiting later.”

He told a Travel Weekly webcast the market is “very competitive” with “big capacity increases” alongside financial uncertainty ahead of the Budget at the end of November.

“The prices might come down in that period. There is a lot about how you hold your nerve on prices,” he said during the webcast at Abta’s Travel Convention in Majorca.

“Ultimately, people need to sell, need to fill the beds. Ideally, we want that happening earlier, but people will book when they’re ready to book. We can encourage them all we want to,” he said.

He noted rising business costs over the past year, with elements such as national insurance, minimum wage and SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] but commented: “I’m hopeful that we won’t see anything happening there [in the Budget].

“I still believe, underlying it all, that it will take a lot for people to give up their travel – maybe they’ll modify and go for shorter lengths or different board basis but, ultimately, they will still want to do it.”

He described Tui’s capacity increase of 2% as “modest”, adding: “I think we can do that.”

“The key piece at our disposal is around the quality of the product, and if you know that’s what you want, then you’ve got a better chance of getting what you want early,” he said.

“Also, people can manage their budgets…a lot of the market now offers direct debit options where you can spread the cost.

“But, ultimately, if someone doesn’t want to book until January, the chances of getting them to book in the previous August are tough.”

However, he continued: “The summer holiday peak is still massive. The January booking peak, I can promise you, will still be absolutely massive.

“That’s part of the tradition of ‘you’re finished with Christmas then I want to book a holiday’ and long may that continue.”

• Swanson also commented on a protest during the convention with animal rights campaigners urging the Tui group to stop selling tickets for marine parks.

“It is an incredibly sensitive issue, and I understand that it is very important to a lot of people,” he said.

“Everyone has got the right to say what they are thinking about and…we do take it seriously.

“We only work with marine parks who we audit regularly. They need to adhere to global welfare guidance for animals…and if they don’t, then we don’t work with them.

Although the company has provided few specifics, our understanding is that the refinery’s hydrocracker, which is used to convert gas oils into higher-value products, including jet fuel and distillates, was the main unit impacted. (News reports indicated that several units at the refinery were shut after the fire, including the catalytic reformer and fluid catalytic cracker, but did not note any damage to them.)

Chevron said in the days following the fire that it would be making operational adjustments to meet fuel demand and indicated on October 7 that the refinery “continues to operate and create transportation fuels, although at diminished rates.” With a capacity of 291 Mb/d, El Segundo is the second-biggest refinery in California and produces about 40% of the jet fuel and 20% of the motor vehicle fuels consumed in Southern California.

Largest greenfield airport

The Navi Mumbai International Airport is India's largest Greenfield airport project, developed under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). As the second international airport for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, NMIA will work in tandem with Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) to ease congestion and elevate Mumbai into the league of global multi-airport systems. The airport, designed to be among the most efficient in the world with 1160 Ha area, will eventually handle 90 million passengers annually (MPPA) and 3.25 million metric tonnes of cargo.

Among its unique offerings is an Automated People Mover (APM), a transit system planned to connect all four passenger terminals for smooth inter-terminal transfers, as well as a landside APM linking the city-side infrastructure.

In line with sustainable practices, the airport will feature dedicated storage for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), solar power generation of approximately 47 MW, and EV bus services for public connectivity across the city. NMIA will also be the first airport in the country to be connected by Water Taxi.

In Q3 of this year, many shared that they are “writing off” 2025, delaying capital projects, and looking to 2026 for clarified policies and stronger markets. Firms making lumber, panels, pellets, paper products and whole log chips reported operating at 50%-60% in multiple regions.

Given market sentiment and operating rates, in addition to recent mill closures and curtailments, how has demand for wood fiber changed recently and over the past 10 years?

Changes in Pulp and Paper Capacity

According to data from Forisk’s North American Mill Database and analysis led by Amanda Lang, total capacity of the wood-using U.S. pulp and paper sector declined 18% in the past 10 years. This decline is specific to wood-using mills, excluding facilities that rely exclusively on recycled fiber, but the sector reported drops in all end uses, with reductions in printing and writing capacity falling 49%. This represented over half of the lost capacity nationwide. Newsprint, household/sanitary, and market pulp segments also had notable declines, each representing 10%-16% of the lost capacity.

Regionally, capacity reductions in the U.S. South accounted for most of the volume lost (64%), with the U.S. West and North each representing 18%. The West experienced the largest and most severe drop in capacity for a given region, with pulp and paper mill closures and reductions decreasing capacity by 26%.

Use of Recycle Fiber Increases

Pulp producers have a variety of feedstocks to choose from, including Old Corrugated Containers from recycling markets, roundwood pulp logs and residual wood chips produced in lumber manufacturing. The data indicates that pulp mills and paper mills in the U.S. increased consumption of recycled fiber even as they reduced production. According to AF&PA, pulp mills and paper mills in the U.S. increased recycled fiber consumption from 38% in 2015 to 48% of their fiber mix in 2024 (Figure 1).

Paper and paperboard production declined 14%, with declines coming from paper products made with virgin fiber (wood). Recycled feedstock consumption rose from 7,766 thousand short tons in Q3 2015 to 8,221 thousand short tons in Q4 2024, an increase of 6%. Paper and board made from virgin fiber declined 27% from 12,413 thousand short tons in Q3 2015 to 9,055 thousand short tons in Q4 2024.

Wood Feedstock Price Trends

Raw material prices are reported per ton of pulp produced, reflecting the inputs required: pulp mills typically need about 3.5 tons of wood to produce one ton of pulp, compared with just over 1 ton of OCC for each ton of pulp. According to the Wood Fiber Review, over the past eight years, wood costs for roundwood and chips have been relatively stable. OCC has been more volatile, swinging from $180 per ton of pulp produced to $27 per ton.

Pulp and paper companies have invested in mill capacity to use OCC and recycled materials to take advantage of lower costs. Companies in the U.S. converted wood-using mills to 100% recycled mills and built new greenfield mills to buy recycled feedstocks. New builds and conversions to 100% recycled mills added 3.6 million tons of pulp and paper capacity since 2017, about 5% of current pulping capacity in the U.S. Other investments added recycled production lines to wood-using mills. This happened during a time when several wood-using pulp mills closed.

Despite ambitious net-zero pledges, the aviation industry is expanding faster than it is decarbonising. With sustainable aviation fuels still scarce, carbon trading under scrutiny, and global cooperation faltering, both politicians and passengers are largely abandoning efforts to make flying greener.

Key takeaways

Airport expansion outpaces climate targets: Governments in the UK and across Europe are approving new runways and airport projects, prioritising economic growth despite aviation’s rising share of national emissions.

Technological solutions lag decades behind: Hydrogen-powered planes remain distant, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is costly, limited in supply, and far from meeting the scale regulators demand.

Offset schemes face credibility issues: The ICAO-backed Corsia system relies heavily on questionable carbon credits — such as those tied to Guyana’s deforestation projects — undermining confidence in aviation’s offsetting claims.

Global taxation efforts have collapsed: Political resistance, led by the U.S. under Donald Trump, has derailed EU ambitions to impose carbon taxes on long-haul flights, leaving aviation fuel largely untaxed worldwide.

Airlines push for “growth with guilt”: Carriers argue that flying brings economic and social value, yet current measures allow emissions to rise through traffic growth even as cleaner fuels are introduced.

New ideas shift focus to behavior and flight paths: Researchers are testing AI-assisted contrail avoidance to cut warming, while governments consider levies on frequent flyers and private jets to target aviation’s biggest polluters.

Climate justice concerns grow: Activists warn that without structural change, aviation will remain a symbol of inequality — where a small share of frequent travelers drives most emissions while others bear the climate cost.

Hotels face new sustainability scrutiny: As aviation’s footprint grows, more pressure may fall on hotels to demonstrate measurable environmental responsibility, from energy use to supply chains, to offset the sector’s wider carbon imbalance.",https://www.hospitality.today/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-09 02:56:58.251626

With the joint research with Airbus, I really hope we can speed up the real-world application of hydrogen aircraft development, if only by a little.","As the aviation industry works toward the ambitious goal of net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, the shift to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum. However, truly effective reductions in the environmental impacts of aviation require innovation that goes beyond fuel to embrace the entire aircraft system. Key to this is the superconducting motor that Toshiba has developed for next-generation aircraft and other large mobility applications; a motor that is smaller and lighter than conventional motors and that achieves high output—offering a breakthrough that could change the future of flight.

Among the first to recognize the potential of this motor was Airbus, the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer, which is working to develop a hydrogen-powered aircraft with zero CO₂ emissions. Airbus took particular interest in Toshiba’s first prototype superconducting motor, unveiled in 2022. Then in 2024, the two companies announced a joint research initiative to explore the use of superconducting motor technology for next-generation hydrogen aircraft. With these two companies joining forces, how might the future of aviation be transformed?

Superconducting motors are perfect for hydrogen aircraft

In October 2024, at the Japan International Aerospace Expo 2024, Airbus and Toshiba announced that they would conduct joint research on superconducting motor technology. Airbus has long been working on the development of hydrogen aircraft—seen as a promising solution for zero-CO₂ aviation—and Toshiba’s superconducting technology caught its attention.

Fumitoshi Mizutani, who leads the superconducting motor development project at Toshiba, explains the key features of the technology: “In 2022, we succeeded in developing a prototype superconducting motor that is both lightweight and compact, but still capable of delivering high output of 2 megawatts. It is one-tenth the weight of conventional products with the same output. These features of Toshiba’s unique technology aligned closely with Airbus’s ideal specifications for hydrogen aircraft, which led to our collaborative research.”

There are two ways to use hydrogen as a source of propulsion for aircraft. The first is to burn hydrogen in gas turbine engines, essentially replacing the fossil fuels used in today’s jet aircraft with hydrogen. The second approach uses fuel cells to convert hydrogen into electricity that powers the plane’s engine. Toshiba’s superconducting motor technology is expected to play a central role in enabling this second, electric propulsion method.

All considerations about installing engines on jet aircraft must confront a fundamental trade-off: achieving high output while keeping weight to a minimum. In this respect, superconducting motors are an ideal solution. What’s more, they offer an unexpected advantage. Hydrogen, which is a gas at room temperature, must be stored as a liquid at the extremely low temperature of -253°C in order to be used as aircraft fuel.

That requirement fits well with superconductivity technology, the phenomenon whereby metals and alloys exhibit zero electrical resistance and perform at their best when cooled to extremely low, cryogenic temperatures. That is achieved at ground level by using liquid helium (liquid at minus 269°C) and liquid nitrogen (minus 196°C).

Using liquified hydrogen on board an aircraft both as fuel and to cool the superconducting motor realizes maximum efficiency in the limiting conditions of being in the air. It is a situation where the characteristics of superconductivity and the restrictive conditions of using it in a hydrogen aircraft produce a perfect match.

Kyohei Shibata of Toshiba’s New Business Development Department, which works in tandem with Toshiba’s R&D teams, recalls the early work on the motor. “We developed the superconducting motor by bringing together engineers working in related fields at our Keihin Operations, where we develop and manufacture generators for power plants. We have been researching superconductivity for over 50 years, since its early days around 1970. We have leveraged that knowledge to build up a track record in industrial superconducting equipment, and that gives us strengths other companies do not have.”

Superconductivity is a technology with a lot of promise. If adopted in aircraft, it is expected to boost fuel efficiency and extend flight range. It also has the potential for future expansion and application in other areas, including the shipping and space industries—marking the next stage in its evolution.

Dreaming beyond aircraft, into space

The introduction of hydrogen aircraft is widely anticipated as a way to achieve carbon neutrality. Looking back on the work to develop the prototype, Mizutani is enthusiastic about the prospects for social implementation of hydrogen-powered aircraft with superconducting motors. “I was really happy when we finally completed the first prototype and it started rotating, back in 2022. With the joint research with Airbus, I really hope we can speed up the real-world application of hydrogen aircraft development, if only by a little. My dream is to one day fly in a hydrogen aircraft powered by a superconducting motor that I developed.”

But the truth is that most aircraft still fly on jet fuel, and there are barriers to the motor’s introduction—it will be difficult without changes in the overall structure of the economy. Shibata says that Toshiba hopes to play a part in that transformation. “Hydrogen’s availability is still limited, and there are issues connected to transportation and storage. This may not be something we can achieve right away, but if we can make hydrogen aircraft a reality, it will give us a powerful tool for achieving carbon neutrality, so I think it is a project to realize a dream.”

Beyond that, the superconducting motor might well prove to be a dream solution in other areas, as Mizutani explains: “We first of all want to use it in aircraft, but going beyond that we also want to make it technology that can be brought into ships and even, eventually, into space development.”

The evolution of technology will greatly change the shape of future mobility. Toshiba’s superconducting motors are in the vanguard of this trend, the key to paving the way to a sustainable future for the aviation industry. Toshiba’s R&D team is looking forward to changing what we take for granted in mobility, and Shibata is enthusiastic for the future.

“The spirit we bring to this development work is that we are the pioneers paving the way. We do not stop to search for the right answer, but act on the belief that we are choosing the best path to the future we want to see.”",https://www.toshiba-clip.com/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/img_251009_1.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 02:57:18.478223

Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Modi described NMIA as a ""glimpse of Viksit Bharat"", or developed India, that will help make the Mumbai region Asia's biggest connectivity hub.

The first phase of NMIA has been built at a cost of Rs 19,650 crore and is set to be operational in December, reported PTI. Spread across 1,160 hectares, the airport will have one terminal and one runway in the first phase with an annual passenger handling capacity of 20 million. This is the second airport in Mumbai region.

""The long wait of Mumbai is over as the city has now got its second airport, which will also help Maharashtra's farmers get connected with supermarkets in Europe and the US,"" Modi said after inaugurating the aviation project.

The airport will play a significant role in making the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Asia' biggest connectivity hub, the PM declared.

NMIA is set to significantly boost India's aviation capacity and ease the heavy traffic burden on Mumbai's existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

""This is a project that has a glimpse of Viksit Bharat (developed India). The airport will attract fresh investments and create new job opportunities, the PM noted.

Modi also highlighted the growth of the country's aviation sector and pointed out how it has evolved and expanded under his leadership since 2014.

India, which is the world's third largest domestic aviation market, had just 74 airports in 2014, but their number has gone up to more than 160 in the last 11 years, the Prime Minister said, suggesting his government's focus on the key sector. According to him, lakhs of people have taken to the skies with the government's regional air connectivity scheme UDAN.

Highlighting that Indian airlines have placed orders for more than 1,000 new aircraft, Modi said the target is to make the country a global MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) hub.

Speaking on the occasion, Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu said NMIA will help create around two lakh job opportunities and make Mumbai the country's aviation capital.

Maharashtra Governor Acharya Devvrat, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, his deputies Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani and Minister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol also attended the ceremony.

NMIA received the aerodrome licence from the regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30.

First airport connected by water taxi

According to a release from the Prime Minister's Office, NMIA will be the first airport in the country to be connected by water taxi.The entire project is being developed in multiple phases by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd (NMIAL), a company in which the Adani Group has a 74 per cent stake with the remaining 26 per cent held by the Maharashtra government's town planning and development agency CIDCO.

NMIA, upon completion of all phases, will have four terminals with a capacity of 90 million passengers per annum and a cargo capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes, making it one of the largest aviation hubs in Asia.

The airport will have an Automated People Mover (APM), a transit system planned to connect all four passenger terminals, landside APM linking the city-side infrastructure and a dedicated storage for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), among others, the statement had said.

NMIA will be named after politician and social activist late DB Patil, who is widely hailed for his work that ensured project-affected persons in the region received rightful compensation.

That’s why we’re proud to announce a new agreement with Twelve, a pioneer in carbon transformation technology, to procure power-to-liquid sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This collaboration builds on our commitments through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the First Movers Coalition (FMC), as well as through our membership with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA).

Why SAF, why now

Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. SAF—particularly power-to-liquid (PtL) fuel—offers one of the most promising pathways to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil jet fuel. Yet adoption has been slowed by limited supply and high costs.

Our agreement with Twelve addresses both challenges. Autodesk is securing SAF certificates well in advance, avoiding exposure to the spot market while at the same time seeding climate innovation to scale. The SAF certificates will be sold to airlines and operators set to receive physical deliveries once production begins.

Together, these efforts reflect a holistic model of collaboration—providing not just capital, but tools, expertise and storytelling power.

Building the market

Twelve’s PtL SAF is competitively priced in today’s challenging SAF environment. This reflects the reality of scaling new climate technologies: up-front costs are often higher, but long-term reductions depend on the willingness of early investors.

Like other forward offtake agreements (for example, the Frontier advance market commitment for carbon removal), the structure of our deal provides downside protection against short-term price volatility, with payments weighted toward the end of the decade. For Autodesk, this isn’t just about buying fuel—it’s about helping to bend the cost curve for the entire industry.

Strong foundations

This new agreement marks a new chapter in Autodesk and Twelve’s history.

Philanthropic support: Since 2017, Twelve has received in-kind support as a portfolio company of Autodesk Foundation partners Prime Coalition and MCJ Collective.

Software donations: Twelve has leveraged Autodesk design tools since 2019 to develop their facilities.

Pro bono consulting: Autodesk’s Media & Entertainment industry consultants are currently producing a visualization video to help Twelve showcase its breakthrough technology.

Looking ahead

By securing high-quality SAF with Twelve, Autodesk is reinforcing our corporate impact strategy, supporting our customers and investors who care deeply about climate impact, and aligning with our go-to-market vision for enabling low-carbon innovation.

We know that no one company can solve the climate crisis alone. By leaning into our climate commitments—and collaborating across industries—we can help scale the critical solutions the world needs most.

The new commodity swap agreement with Wells Fargo supports financial risk management for the company’s push into renewables, but it does not materially change the short-term importance of executing the upcoming Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project or address the ongoing risk of higher maintenance linked to older refinery assets.

The strategic partnership with Mitsubishi and ENEOS, forming Hawaii Renewables for large-scale renewable fuel production, stands out as highly relevant and ties directly into the current momentum around the SAF project. This collaboration is a core catalyst, as it supports Par Pacific’s position in renewable energy and underpins its earnings growth ambitions, particularly as regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs increase across traditional refining.

However, on the other hand, investors should be aware that persistent reliance on older refinery assets could expose the company to...

Par Pacific Holdings' outlook anticipates $6.3 billion in revenue and $397.9 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on a projected annual revenue decline of 6.1% and a $417 million increase in earnings from the current -$19.1 million.

, a 4% downside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Three members of the Simply Wall St Community place Par Pacific’s fair value between US$35.50 and US$93.79 per share. With such different views, especially as the company prepares for its SAF project and renewables shift, you can see how broad the debate is about its future profitability and business risks.

That's why we're proud to announce a new agreement with Twelve, a pioneer in carbon transformation technology, to procure power-to-liquid sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This collaboration builds on our commitments through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the First Movers Coalition (FMC), as well as through our membership with the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA).

Why SAF, why now

Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. SAF-particularly power-to-liquid (PtL) fuel-offers one of the most promising pathways to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil jet fuel. Yet adoption has been slowed by limited supply and high costs.

Our agreement with Twelve addresses both challenges. Autodesk is securing SAF certificates well in advance, avoiding exposure to the spot market while at the same time seeding climate innovation to scale. The SAF certificates will be sold to airlines and operators set to receive physical deliveries once production begins.

Together, these efforts reflect a holistic model of collaboration-providing not just capital, but tools, expertise and storytelling power.

Building the market

Twelve's PtL SAF is competitively priced in today's challenging SAF environment. This reflects the reality of scaling new climate technologies: up-front costs are often higher, but long-term reductions depend on the willingness of early investors.

Like other forward offtake agreements (for example, the Frontier advance market commitment for carbon removal), the structure of our deal provides downside protection against short-term price volatility, with payments weighted toward the end of the decade. For Autodesk, this isn't just about buying fuel-it's about helping to bend the cost curve for the entire industry.

Strong foundations

This new agreement marks a new chapter in Autodesk and Twelve's history.

Philanthropic support: Since 2017, Twelve has received in-kind support as a portfolio company of Autodesk Foundation partners Prime Coalition and MCJ Collective.

Software donations: Twelve has leveraged Autodesk design tools since 2019 to develop their facilities.

Pro bono consulting: Autodesk's Media & Entertainment industry consultants are currently producing a visualization video to help Twelve showcase its breakthrough technology.

Looking ahead

By securing high-quality SAF with Twelve, Autodesk is reinforcing our corporate impact strategy, supporting our customers and investors who care deeply about climate impact, and aligning with our go-to-market vision for enabling low-carbon innovation.

We know that no one company can solve the climate crisis alone. By leaning into our climate commitments-and collaborating across industries-we can help scale the critical solutions the world needs most.

The global race for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been hard and long but might be on the threshold of a major breakthrough thanks to work by Oregon State University (OSU) in the United States.

One of its clean fuel teams is drawing international attention for breakthrough research that could help transform forestry residues and agricultural waste.

OSU’s College of Forestry is leading catalytic research in Oregon’s Clean Fuel Initiative, a multimillion-dollar program funded by the State of Oregon to develop low-carbon fuels from local biomass.

Leading the team is Dr. Alhassan Ibrahim, a Postdoctoral Scholar at OSU, whose work has already demonstrated measurable efficiency gains, making crude bio-oils cleaner and more stable for use as jet fuel.

According to experts, while raw bio-oil from forest waste is like a dirty soup that clogs machines, the research being undertaken will develop catalytic chemical helpers that clean and stabilize this oil so it can become renewable jet fuel.

With Ghana and other developing countries looking to other more sustainable and climate-friendly forms of energy, such catalytic innovations promise a low-carbon future for aviation and beyond.

“Dr. Ibrahim’s work is a game-changer for sustainable fuels,” said Prof. Gerald Presley, one of his project leaders at OSU. “He is helping Oregon lead the way in turning forest waste into renewable energy.”

The Clean Fuel Initiative is a collaborative program supported by the Oregon State Legislature (HB 3409, 2023 session), OSU College of Forestry, Oregon Department of Forestry, and Oregon Department of Environmental Quality.

Its mission is to develop renewable, low-carbon fuels from regional biomass resources to meet state and national decarbonization goals.

Dr. Ibrahim’s findings have been published in respected journals such as Catalysts and Energies, and have already been independently cited by research teams worldwide.

His contributions were recognized with the Outstanding Ph.D. Student Award at Mississippi State University. Back home in Ghana, his works have been featured across a number of public and private news portals.

Beyond research, Dr. Ibrahim was selected to judge presentations at the 2025 FPS-SWST International Conference, a role typically reserved for senior experts further evidence of his professional standing.

Dr. Ibrahim’s future plans include scaling catalyst testing to pilot plants and working with U.S. industry partners to accelerate SAF commercialization.",https://i0.wp.com/www.gbcghanaonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clean-Fuel.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:56:36.648297

It has proposed a fuel-exempt model. A consultation on the proposals ended on 19 August. The Commission is currently conducting a review before presenting a final draft to its technical, with the aim of adopting the proposals under an implementing decision in autumn 2025. It is currently unclear the extent of any changes to the SUPD proposals resulting from the consultation

The lack of clarity over the EU’s approach had delayed some investment decisions in 2024 and H1 2025.

Nevertheless, while this goes some way to clarifying one of the key regulatory uncertainties facing the market, there remain areas of legislative doubt that continue to negatively impact demand and investment decisions. These include:

Definitions of waste and recycling under Directive 2008/98/EC - also known as the Waste Framework Directive – which forms the basis of the majority of EU recycling legislation definitions

The End-of-life Vehicles Regulation (ELVR) and whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards proposed targets, and what those proposed targets will be

Whether chemical recycling will be able to count towards Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) targets

This was underscored on Aug. 5 by OMV, whose CEO told ICIS that it needs a more secure regulatory environment before it is willing to risk further investment in scaling up its chemical recycling facilities.

With Europe the first region to detail its approach to mass-balance accounting, there are also concerns over the impact of a fuel-exempt approach on cost-competitiveness with other regions – should they adopt more lenient mass-balance accounting practices such as free-allocation – along with the negative impact on profitability domestically compared with a free-allocation approach.

Legislation surrounding renewable fuels, meanwhile, enjoys greater clarity, and targets under legislation such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) III and the Fit for 55 package are encouraging the use of pyrolysis oil as fuel (under the Fit for 55 package fuel derived from plastic waste can count towards targets such as those for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) provided it meets certain criteria such

as demonstrating emissions reduction).

This continues to encourage tyre-based pyrolysis oil producers to separate out bio-attributed content and polymer content in pyrolysis oil production, with bio-attributed content attracting premiums compared with polymer-derived tyre-based pyrolysis oil. This is a trend expected to continue in H2 2025 and further in to the mid term.

The wider investment climate remains challenging, particularly given the consolidation of cracker volumes in Europe. Nevertheless, despite both regulatory and macroeconomic uncertainty, investment into pyrolysis oil continues, and brand owners still see pyrolysis oil as a key solution for mass-scale food-contact recycled packaging.

Prices have proved resilient so far in 2025 to the wider macroeconomic malaise afflicting the European chemical sector – particularly for plastic-derived grades - which is at least in part due to structural shortages.

Pyrolysis is expected to be the world's largest chemical recycling technology by capacity. Europe has a current plastic-derived pyrolysis oil installed input capacity of approximately 150,000 tonnes/year, according to the ICIS Recycling Supply Tracker - Chemical. There is an additional pyrolysis oil capacity of more than 300,000 tonnes/year under construction or undergoing commissioning.

A number of pyrolysis oil plant start-ups have faced delays in 2023-2025 as a result of:

Access to suitable quality waste

Challenges managing the variability of feedstock properties

Delays in environmental permits

Longer than expected commissioning phases for process optimization

Negative macroeconomic conditions creating financing challenges and changing cost structures

This has created a challenge for upstream recycled agglomerate players. Many waste managers have added agglomeration capacity in recent years with a view to serving the burgeoning pyrolysis oil market.

Nevertheless, plant start-up delays has meant the while agglomeration capacity has come onstream, the pyrolysis oil capacity this feedstock was intended to serve has not. This has meant a reduction in investment in agglomeration, and some lines being idled.

There are concerns that this could create challenges for the pyrolysis oil industry as it grows, with access to sufficient high quality waste continuing to be seen as one of the core potential barriers to market scale.",https://s3-prod.sustainableplastics.com/styles/1200x630/s3/1580124237511.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 17:57:20.084034

The carbon dioxide will be sent to a carbon sequestration site in Wyoming.
Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) can reduce an ethanol plant's carbon intensity score by roughly 33 points.
David Miller, chief economist at Decision Innovation Solutions, said his modeling looked at CCS with the 45Z tax credit adding about 48 cents per gallon for Iowa ethanol plants.
Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law last March that bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipeline projects.","OMAHA (DTN) -- Iowa biofuel and farm leaders are warning that the state could lose its long-held competitive edge in ethanol production without access to infrastructure to capture carbon dioxide and ship it to a sequestration site.

That lack of carbon-capture infrastructure in Iowa -- the country's largest ethanol-producing state -- also adds greater risks to a weakened farm economy.

IOWA LOSES GROUND ON CARBON CAPTURE

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA), said Iowa ethanol producers are now losing ground as Nebraska's Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline begins operations.

""Carbon capture and sequestration is real -- it's happening to our east, west and north, and it has enormous economic consequences for Iowa,"" Shaw said during a Wednesday press call. ""Since 2000, Iowa has worn the crown as the world's best place to turn corn into ethanol. Last week, we got knocked off.""

The $1.5 billion Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline -- a converted natural gas pipeline -- went live last week. Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland (MAAPW) started carbon capture at its ethanol plant in Madrid, Nebraska, on the western edge of the state, using the Tallgrass pipeline. The carbon dioxide will be sent to a carbon sequestration site in Wyoming. MAAPW became the first ethanol plant to use the Tallgrass pipeline, which is expected to connect at least 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska.

That opens up MAAPW to not only sell ethanol with a lower carbon intensity into states such as California but also to tap into the federal 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

ECONOMIC STAKES FOR FARMERS AND PLANTS

Shaw said the issue is not a competition between Nebraska and Iowa, noting that ethanol plants in North Dakota and Illinois are also sinking carbon in the ground. But the competitive gap will have real financial consequences.

""Quite frankly, I'm jealous. They got it done first, and that is, for the plants that are hooked up there and doing that, it's a great advantage.""

Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) can reduce an ethanol plant's carbon intensity score by roughly 33 points. The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit could add about 66 cents a gallon in value to ethanol. Given that a bushel of corn produces roughly three gallons of ethanol, that's the potential of $1.98 a bushel in added value.

If Iowa's ethanol plants were sequestering carbon, that would translate into more than $3 billion in added value to the state's ethanol production each year, Shaw said.

""There are very real economic consequences from that,"" he said.

David Miller, chief economist at Decision Innovation Solutions, said his modeling looked at CCS with the 45Z tax credit adding about 48 cents per gallon for Iowa ethanol plants. It would also open the door for another 10 points in lower carbon intensity scores through farm-level conservation practices. That would generate about $2.1 billion per year for Iowa plants. ""But unless a plant is under a 50 CI score, those opportunities don't exist.""

FARM ECONOMY IS ALREADY UNDER STRESS

The consequences are felt by corn farmers whose financial struggles continue to gain attention.

""Right now, the Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,"" said Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association. ""Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.""

Kuiper noted that agricultural lenders are paying close attention to farmers' balance sheets and liquidity. ""There are some folks that potentially could be having to liquidate some land or equipment ... at the end of the year, and this affects the whole state.""

PIPELINE POLITICS DIVIDE IOWA

Corn may be king in Iowa, but carbon pipelines have become a politically charged issue across the state. Just this past weekend, Republican candidates running for governor spoke at an event in a rural county that included state lawmakers who have been actively opposing the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project, the Iowa Capital Dispatch reported. Republicans in Iowa have been split on the issue. Gov. Kim Reynolds in June vetoed a bill that would have limited the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines.

Summit's plans have been to build a pipeline across Iowa that would also extend across South Dakota to reach a sequestration site in North Dakota. That has become increasingly more complicated because South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law last March that bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipeline projects.

Nebraska, by contrast, has no regulatory commission overseeing carbon pipelines.

Despite the rural resistance in some areas and debate over landowner rights, Kuiper said landowners already must deal with natural gas and oil pipelines along with other infrastructure. Kuiper defended the safety and compensation structure of carbon pipelines. ""A carbon pipeline doesn't scare me as much as a 36-inch natural-gas line,"" he said. Kuiper added, ""Farmers who allow these projects are compensated very well, and it strengthens their financial position.""

NEBRASKA POISED FOR EXPANSION

Seth Harder, CEO of Husker Ag in Plainview, Nebraska, and Lincolnway Energy in Nevada, Iowa, said carbon sequestration adds about $60 million a year in income to a typical 100-million-gallon ethanol plant. The ethanol industry in Nebraska sees the potential to grow right now.

""We see the opportunity for things to, maybe not really an opportunity but a paradigm shift, if you will, as Nebraska sees this influx of funds. We hear plants are talking about not only expanding but doubling (capacity).""

Harder also spotlighted California Gov. Gavin Newsom signing E15 legislation last month, creating a potential 700 million gallons more in domestic ethanol sales.

Shaw also emphasized the need to press Congress to pass legislation to permanently allow year-round E15 nationwide.

The overall message, Shaw said, is that Iowa's ethanol plants need the ability to do CCS, but he's concerned about the increasing push to take away that option.

""There are economic realities if Iowa is permanently shut out of the CCS ability.""

Miller also said CCS in Nebraska opens the door for that state to move forward on producing sustainable aviation fuel as well.

""For the Nebraska plants on the pipeline, that door has now been open,"" Miller said. He added, ""We think Nebraska is going to move forward and be a mover on ethanol-to-jet.""

No longer is the act of traveling limited to simply reaching a destination. Technological progress, evolving cultural expectations, and heightened environmental awareness are drastically altering how people experience their journeys. The travel industry is stepping up to meet these challenges by embracing innovative solutions designed to provide travelers with more sustainable, personalized, and unique travel options. With these changes, the focus is no longer just on where people travel, but how they engage with the world. As emerging trends such as sustainable aviation, artificial intelligence (AI), and eco-conscious tourism take shape, travelers can expect experiences that redefine how they interact with the world around them. This article explores the key trends influencing the global travel industry and their impact on travelers worldwide.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Leading the Charge for Greener Travel

As global concerns about climate change grow, the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to address its environmental impact. One of the promising solutions that has emerged is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional jet fuel, which relies on fossil fuels, SAF is produced from renewable sources such as algae, waste oils, and crops. This fuel has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon emissions associated with air travel, making it a key player in the quest for more eco-friendly aviation. Although the cost of SAF remains a significant barrier, the growing adoption of this fuel suggests that it could eventually become the norm in air travel. As more airlines incorporate SAF into their operations and its cost decreases, passengers may begin considering the environmental impact of their travel choices, leading to increased demand for greener airlines. This shift could drastically reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry and help the world move closer to more sustainable travel.

Impact: The integration of SAF could drastically lower the carbon emissions from aviation, making air travel more environmentally sustainable and driving a global shift toward greener travel options.

Contactless Travel: Revolutionizing Efficiency and Speed

The rise of contactless technology has significantly transformed the travel experience. Digital boarding passes, mobile check-ins, and keyless hotel rooms are no longer luxuries but are now the standard for most travelers. These touchless systems make traveling faster and more efficient, reducing wait times and eliminating the need for physical documents. As airports and hotels adopt these technologies, travelers can enjoy smoother, more seamless experiences without the need for direct human interaction. However, this shift toward contactless travel has led to concerns about the loss of human connection. Some travelers miss the personal touch of interacting with hotel staff or checking in with physical tickets. Despite these concerns, the shift toward digitalization in travel is likely to continue, as the convenience and efficiency provided by these systems are too significant to ignore.

Impact: While contactless technology simplifies the travel process and reduces wait times, it risks making the experience less personal, changing the dynamic of how travelers interact with the world.

AI-Powered Personalization: Creating Tailored Travel Experiences

Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way travelers plan and experience their journeys. Through advanced algorithms, AI can offer highly personalized travel suggestions based on individual preferences. AI-driven tools now enable travelers to receive recommendations for destinations, hotels, and activities, as well as real-time itinerary adjustments. Chatbots and other AI-powered services are increasingly common, helping travelers to manage their bookings and provide instant recommendations during their trip. While these personalized services enhance convenience, they also raise questions about the role of spontaneity in travel.

Taking public comments We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel.","We are embarking on a new statewide study to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts surrounding the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel—including measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Our broad statewide studies, also called programmatic environmental impact statements, are required by state law. In June, we released three studies evaluating utility-scale onshore wind and solar energy projects, and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.

As part of the scoping process, we are seeking input from interested parties, including the public, regarding the range of actions and impacts we should study.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

To help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to power aircraft engines. The fuel is derived from low-carbon sources such as biomass, organic waste and clean synthetic feedstocks using a wide range of production methods and technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.

Scoping our study to be impactful and efficient

While these fuel projects are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the state economy, they can still have negative environmental impacts that need to be considered—including ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate those impacts.

Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from a variety of renewable resources and transported using various distribution methods, our study will not be able to evaluate every possible option. This means your input is critical. It will help us determine where to focus our analysis to develop the most useful, timely report that will support the future development of sustainable aviation fuel projects in Washington.

The study will evaluate the potential impacts on natural and built resources at a broad level. Developers and agencies can use the findings to help avoid and reduce impacts through siting and design choices. It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.

Taking public comments

We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel. In October, we will hold two virtual meetings where interested parties can make public comments:

All the comments we receive will be valued equally. They help us determine our approach to the programmatic impact statement, or study. Comments addressing specific pathways, impacts or issues are the most useful. We have prepared a fact sheet about providing effective public comments.

While Airbus produced 58 A320neos per month in July 2025, Boeing was producing only 38 737 MAX units, highlighting the disparity.
Beyond commercial aircraft, the performance of Airbus's Defence and Space and Helicopters divisions will be important for overall financial health.","Toulouse, France – Airbus (EPA: AIR) has reported a robust performance in the first nine months of 2025, delivering 507 commercial aircraft and affirming its dominant position in the global aviation market. This significant milestone was underscored by a record-breaking September, where the European aerospace giant handed over 73 jets, indicating a notable improvement in crucial engine supply chains. The strong delivery figures place Airbus firmly on track to achieve its ambitious full-year target of approximately 820 aircraft, further widening its lead over rival Boeing (NYSE: BA).

The 507 deliveries from January to September mark an increase from the 497 aircraft delivered during the same period in 2024, demonstrating a consistent upward trajectory despite ongoing industry challenges. This impressive output comes as Airbus continues to navigate a complex operating environment, particularly concerning engine delivery delays from key suppliers like CFM International (a joint venture of GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) and Safran (EPA: SAF)) and Pratt & Whitney (a division of RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX)). However, the recent surge in deliveries, coupled with a reported decrease in ""gliders"" – fully assembled aircraft awaiting engines – suggests that these supply bottlenecks are easing.

Detailed Coverage: Airbus's Resilient Ascent Amidst Headwinds

Airbus's provisional 507 commercial aircraft deliveries in the first nine months of 2025 represent a 2% increase from the 497 deliveries in the same period of 2024. This cumulative figure turned positive in September 2025, surpassing the equivalent total for 2024 for the first time. September itself was a record-breaking month for Airbus, with approximately 73 jets delivered, up from 50 deliveries in September 2024 and exceeding earlier analyst forecasts. This strong performance signals Airbus's improved capacity to meet its full-year delivery target of around 820 commercial aircraft across all models by year-end.

Despite this impressive output, Airbus continues to grapple with significant supply chain issues, particularly concerning engine availability. Both CFM International and Pratt & Whitney have faced difficulties in ramping up output due to lingering labor shortages, production difficulties, and component availability issues. Pratt & Whitney's GTF (geared turbofan) engines, especially for the A320neo family, have experienced complications stemming from a metal powder defect, leading to a large-scale recall and the grounding of hundreds of aircraft. CFM International has also encountered production difficulties, contributing to shortages that persisted into 2025. These engine bottlenecks have significantly constrained Airbus's ability to accelerate production, despite robust demand for its aircraft.

Earlier in 2025, Airbus faced a growing backlog of ""gliders"" – fully assembled aircraft awaiting engine installation – with reports indicating up to 60 units parked outside its factories by July, absorbing approximately €1 billion in inventory costs. However, recent indications suggest that the ""glider"" issue has started to ease, with the number reportedly dropping from its peak. This improvement, coupled with the strong September delivery numbers, is crucial for Airbus to meet its delivery targets and reduce financial strain from incomplete aircraft. Airlines, in some cases, have even accepted ""glider"" deliveries due to the scarcity of delivery slots, underscoring the immense value of a confirmed production slot in a sold-out market.

A historic milestone was reached on October 7, 2025, when the Airbus A320 family officially surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the world's most delivered commercial jet. This achievement was sealed with the delivery of an A320neo to Saudi carrier flyadeal, pushing the total number of A320 family deliveries to 12,260 aircraft since its entry into service in 1988. This compares to Boeing's 737 series, which had approximately 12,259 units delivered. This marks the first time since 1968 that Boeing has been dethroned in the single-aisle market, a testament to the A320's consistent innovation, fuel efficiency, and versatility.

Market Ripple Effects: Winners and Losers in the Aerospace Duopoly

Airbus's sustained strong delivery performance presents a considerable challenge to its primary competitor, Boeing (NYSE: BA), primarily impacting its market share and financial standing. Airbus has delivered more aircraft than Boeing for five consecutive years, a trend that intensified in 2024, where Airbus delivered 766 commercial aircraft, more than double Boeing's 348 deliveries. This disparity has led to Boeing reporting losses since 2019 and a significant drop in its stock performance. Boeing is under immense pressure to recover from production challenges and quality issues, forcing it to cede market share, particularly in single-aisle aircraft where Airbus now holds a dominant lead.

The two primary engine suppliers for commercial aircraft, CFM International (a joint venture between GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) and Safran (EPA: SAF)) and Pratt & Whitney (a division of RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX)), experience varying impacts from Airbus's success. CFM International, whose LEAP-1A engine powers a significant portion of the A320neo family, directly benefits from Airbus's high delivery volumes, driving revenue and profitability for its parent companies. CFM continues to lead in the narrowbody market, with its LEAP series powering 72% of active narrowbody fleets overall.

Conversely, Pratt & Whitney, while also benefiting from Airbus's high delivery volumes for its GTF engines, has faced significant financial impacts due to reliability issues. The 2023 requirement for accelerated inspections on 600-700 PW1100G engines resulted in an estimated gross financial implication of $6-7 billion for RTX, with a $3 billion pre-tax operating profit charge. Pratt & Whitney is focused on resolving these reliability issues to maintain its market share and reputation, especially as its GTF engine is also used on the Airbus A220.

Airline customers are directly affected by these dynamics. Airlines with significant existing Airbus fleets or those ordering new Airbus aircraft stand to ""win"" from fleet commonality, reduced training costs, and the A320neo's fuel efficiency. In an environment where Boeing has faced significant production delays, Airbus's more consistent delivery schedule offers a reliable path for airlines to update their fleets with fuel-efficient aircraft. Conversely, airlines heavily reliant on Boeing, or those facing delays in receiving their ordered aircraft, might experience disadvantages, forced to fly older, less fuel-efficient planes for longer periods, increasing operational costs.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Aerospace Landscape

Airbus's strong market position and delivery performance underscore a significant shift in the aerospace duopoly, driven by prevailing industry trends. The sustained demand for more fuel-efficient aircraft, fueled by environmental concerns and rising fuel costs, has been expertly leveraged by Airbus with its A320neo family. This family offers 15-20% less fuel burn, aligning with airlines' pursuit of lower operating expenses and the industry's decarbonization goals. The A320 family's historic achievement of surpassing the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered jetliner in history further solidifies Airbus's dominance in the crucial single-aisle market, which forms the backbone of most airline fleets.

The ripple effects extend profoundly to its main competitor, Boeing. Boeing's recent challenges, including the 737 MAX groundings, ongoing safety and certification issues, and production bottlenecks, have directly contributed to Airbus's market share gains. While Airbus produced 58 A320neos per month in July 2025, Boeing was producing only 38 737 MAX units, highlighting the disparity. This situation has compelled Boeing to focus on recovery and quality, impacting its own market standing and pushing both giants to navigate complex supply chain and regulatory landscapes.

The competition between Airbus and Boeing also carries significant regulatory and policy implications, primarily manifested in long-running trade disputes. The US and EU have been engaged in the world's longest-running trade dispute at the WTO concerning alleged illegal government subsidies to both manufacturers. While tariffs were suspended in 2021, the underlying issue of state support remains a contentious geopolitical dimension of the duopoly, highlighting how governments actively support their national champions. The effective duopoly itself, accounting for 99% of global large aircraft orders, raises questions about market concentration and potential antitrust enforcement.

Historically, the current duopoly emerged from industry consolidation, with Airbus formed to challenge American dominance after mergers. The duopoly has maintained its strength by absorbing or partnering with smaller competitors, as seen with Airbus's acquisition of a majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries program (now the Airbus A220). The competition also echoes past product line rivalries, such as the Boeing 747 versus the Airbus A380, demonstrating that even within a duopoly, misjudging market needs and cost-effectiveness can have significant consequences. Boeing's current struggles with the 737 MAX similarly illustrate the high stakes of product development and safety in such an environment.

What Comes Next: Navigating Growth and Transformation

Airbus is strategically positioned for future growth, leveraging its strong delivery performance and substantial order backlog. The company aims to increase the production of its A320 family aircraft to 75 per month by 2027, up from an unofficial rate of around 52 per month in late 2024. To achieve this, Airbus is expanding its global production footprint by opening new final assembly lines (FALs) in Mobile, Alabama, and Tianjin, China, both scheduled for October 2025. These expansions are expected to contribute significantly to its global output, with U.S. and China production capacity each accounting for 20% by 2026.

In the short term, Airbus will capitalize on its current market leadership and a robust order backlog, which for the A320 family alone exceeds 7,000 jets, representing over 12 years of production. The ongoing recovery in air travel further fuels demand for new aircraft. However, significant short-term challenges persist, primarily supply chain disruptions affecting critical components like engines, semiconductors, and wiring harnesses. These issues have forced Airbus to revise production targets and have resulted in a backlog of completed airframes awaiting missing parts, with delivery delays expected to persist for at least three years.

Long-term possibilities for Airbus are largely shaped by decarbonization efforts and technological innovation. Airbus aims to bring the world's first zero-emission commercial aircraft to market by 2035, investing over €2 billion per year in cleaner technologies such as hybrid-electric engines and hydrogen propulsion. The company is actively pursuing 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) compatibility for its entire range of commercial airliners before 2030. These ambitions open up new markets and position Airbus as a leader in sustainable aviation. However, long-term challenges include the significant R&D investment required, the development of necessary infrastructure for new fuels, and managing the complex transition to a decarbonized aerospace sector.

Airbus's strategic pivots are centered on resilience, innovation, sustainability, and scale. This involves strengthening supply chain resilience through diversification and deeper collaborations with suppliers, addressing workforce development, and continuing heavy investment in next-generation aircraft and sustainable technologies. The company's ambition to replace the A320 with an open-fan propulsion jet by 2035 demonstrates a radical commitment to innovation for emissions reduction. While Boeing is expected to recover its shipment volume and regain some market share (projected around 40% in 2025), Airbus is anticipated to continue its strong delivery performance, with competition intensifying around the introduction of next-generation, more sustainable aircraft.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Sustained Leadership in a Transforming Market

Airbus's robust delivery performance in the first nine months of 2025, culminating in over 500 jet deliveries and a record-breaking September, solidifies its position as the undisputed market leader in commercial aviation. The key takeaway is Airbus's operational resilience and strategic foresight in navigating a complex global environment marked by persistent supply chain challenges. The A320 family's historic milestone of surpassing the Boeing 737 in total deliveries underscores the enduring success of Airbus's narrowbody strategy and its focus on fuel efficiency.

Moving forward, the aerospace market is poised for sustained growth, driven by increasing air travel demand and an urgent need for fleet modernization. Airbus is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on this, thanks to its substantial order backlog and aggressive production ramp-up plans. The company's strategic expansion of its global production footprint, with new Final Assembly Lines in the US and China, is crucial for meeting demand, building resilience, and mitigating geopolitical risks. This globalized approach enhances flexibility and shortens delivery times for customers, further solidifying Airbus's long-term impact on air travel.

The lasting impact of Airbus's current trajectory is the reshaping of the aerospace duopoly. While Boeing (NYSE: BA) faces continued pressure from production delays and quality control issues, Airbus's consistent performance and innovative strides in sustainable aviation are widening the competitive gap. This leadership not only affects market share but also drives the entire industry towards decarbonization through significant investments in hybrid-electric, hydrogen, and SAF-compatible aircraft.

Investors should closely monitor Airbus's ability to meet its ambitious 2025 delivery target of around 820 commercial aircraft, as this will be a key indicator of its success in mitigating ongoing supply chain bottlenecks, particularly engine deliveries. Progress on the production ramp-up for all aircraft families, especially the A350, and the profitability of these efforts will also be critical. Beyond commercial aircraft, the performance of Airbus's Defence and Space and Helicopters divisions will be important for overall financial health. The upcoming financial reports will provide further insights into the company's operational achievements and strategic direction in the months to come.

But the market must overcome some of its previous challenges to produce sufficient volumes to entice potential new users.

Historically, we have referred to heat-treated biomass products as black pellets, because of their darker color compared to white wood pellets. However, there is a need to use broader terminology to encompass producers that instead produce biomass briquettes or supply it in undensified form.

The market can be divided into two distinct sectors. Biocoal refers to a coal-like product that can be used for heat and power generation. It is usually produced via torrefaction or steam treatment, but in some cases, hydrothermal carbonization may be used. Biocarbon refers to a product which can be used as a reductant in metals production. It must have a high fixed carbon content, meaning it can only be produced by the higher temperature pyrolysis process. Pyrolysis can also be used to produce biochar, a product used for carbon sequestration, soil enhancement and carbon credits, but biocarbon has additional properties such as mechanical strength, which means it can be used for metals production.

For over 15 years, project developers have advanced the technologies needed to improve the properties of raw biomass. However, there have been many technical and commercial obstacles along the way.

Production Projects

In recent years, emerging interest from heavy industries, driven by corporate decarbonization efforts, has rejuvenated the market and led to the start-up of commercial-scale production. Hawkins Wright’s latest multiclient report, “The Biocarbon and Biocoal Market,” identifies the existing capacity today and the pipeline of planned projects, including company profiles. We have identified around 2 million metric tons (mt) of annual production capacity existing today, but we estimate actual production in 2024 was less than 300,000 mt.

In the biocoal space, most production is in smaller-scale pilot or demonstration plants. But Arbaflame is one of the old-timers. It has been producing steam-treated pellets for over 20 years in Norway. 2025 saw the arrival of the first commercial volumes from Idemitsu in Vietnam, TTCL in Thailand and Joensuu Biocoal in Finland. TSI also started up a 15,000-mt plant in the U.S.

Meanwhile in France, the new owners of the FICAP steam-treated biocoal mill, Pearl Capital, plans to restart production this fall. Perpetual Next has also started work on installing new reactors at its Estonia torrefaction plant.

Large-scale production of biocarbon is slightly behind progress in the biocoal market. Market leader Aymium will soon start up its large-scale North American biocarbon facilities, although it has been operating a 75,000-mt mill in Michigan since 2012. There are also some promising smaller-scale plants due online soon in Norway, the U.S., Canada and Sweden. Meanwhile, Airex Energy started operating its 30,000-mt plant in Quebec in early 2025, mainly to produce biochar, but additional volumes could be used for testing by metals producers.

Demand Opportunities

Demand side developments have been slower than many had expected, but there is still growing interest. Around 15 years ago, the then-emerging technology known as black pellets was originally developed as a drop-in replacement for coal in power and heat plants in Europe. But, ultimately, large-scale demand did not materialize in the region, with white wood pellets instead taking precedent. Since then, most European countries have ended the use of coal for power, so opportunities there are more limited, aside from perhaps for district heating and power in Poland and Germany.

But there is growing interest elsewhere. In Japan, there could be opportunities to cofire biocoal at coal power plants to meet energy efficiency targets. The Indian government has introduced cofiring mandates for coal power plants, with specific mention of using torrefied biomass. There are also coal power plant conversions under consideration in Canada and New Zealand. In addition, there is growing attention from heavy industry users looking to replace their coal use for heat, power and steam production with a renewable alternative.

A much newer market is the use of biocoal as a feedstock for gasification, producing syngas for a variety of end-uses, including via Fischer-Tropsch for sustainable aviation fuel, synthetic natural gas and hydrogen production.

Meanwhile, biocarbon has a unique opportunity to help defossilize the metals industry. For a lot of metals production, including steel, a carbon reductant is a crucial element of the production process. Therefore, if the sector is to defossilize, it must find a renewable carbon alternative—biocarbon. If biocarbon is used to defossilize just a small proportion of global metals production, the demand volumes could be huge. The World Steel Association estimates steel production uses around 1 billion mt of metallurgical coal annually.

Barriers and Challenges

Although 2025 has brought some exciting announcements in the biocarbon and biocoal space, progress has not been as smooth or as quick as many had hoped. The economics of biocoal and biocarbon versus fossil fuels are still a problem. In 2022, the energy crisis and higher carbon prices in Europe drove a renewed interest from heavy industry. However, since then, calmer energy markets have dampened that interest. Currently, the technology, energy and feedstock costs typically render biocoal and biocarbon uncompetitive with fossil fuels, without some additional incentive. Higher carbon prices in the future would change that.

For some potential users, a major barrier has also been the lack of large volumes available. This is especially a problem for steel producers. Even those looking for what they would deem test volumes, the requirements are beyond what any single producer can supply just yet. And of course, producing biocoal, and even more so biocarbon, comes with its own technical challenges. Even though I have mentioned several new start-ups this year, I do not think any could claim the start-up was straight forward and exactly as expected.

Other challenges the sector will need to overcome if it is really to move to a commoditized product include logistical challenges, quality consistency and standardization.

In order to help facilitate the development of this emerging market, and the defossilization of heavy industry with all types of solid biomass, Hawkins Wright will hold its third annual heavy industry-focused biomass conference. The European Biocarbon Summit will be held Dec. 9-10 in Amsterdam.

The Evolving Green Energy Market with IDTechEx

The renewable energy sector is becoming increasingly enriched with the developments of clean, green, and natural power sources, with hydrogen and solar being two of the biggest technology names rising within the industry. IDTechEx's portfolios of Hydrogen and Energy & Decarbonization Research Reports explore the growing markets that are expected to reshape the future of energy in line with global decarbonization targets.

Harnessing sun and wind energy for renewable charging within the transport sector

The transport industry is a large adopter of clean energy technologies, largely due to the expectations of lowering carbon footprints and the desire to realize sustainability targets. Solar canopy charging, hydrogen generator charging, and airborne wind energy charging are all avenues explored by IDTechEx as a means of powering electric vehicles away from grid access. IDTechEx's report, ""Off-Grid Charging For Electric Vehicles 2024-2034: Technologies, Benchmarking, Players and Forecasts"", covers different off-grid EV charging methods, and provides forecasts for their uptake over the next ten years.

Solar canopy charging carports that are completely independent from the grid could see cars charging simply from being parked underneath solar panels and plugged into a charging outlet. Labelled as the fastest growing source of renewable energy by IDTechEx, solar power can provide cheaper means of generating energy, especially when compared to fossil fuel projects.

'Top-up charging', where drivers can recharge little and often, may suit electric vehicles better, as they never have to worry about running too low and struggling to source power. Issues surrounding energy storage and intermittency may arise with solar canopy chargers, which without grid stability, may prove difficult to abate. However, when used mostly as a charge boost, solar canopy charging offers an environmentally friendly and smart way to keep vehicles energized.

Wind power, though also a promising means of renewable energy, is currently too expensive and large to feasibly use for electric vehicle charging, according to IDTechEx. However, airborne wind energy (AWE) could be a loophole, which sees a tether-based device being able to harness power from high-altitude winds, while incurring less material costs. AWE can also provide more consistency when compared to solar, given its ability to work even in the dark, and increasing the surface area of the device could increase power generation without affecting the ground footprint.

Hydrogen for land and sky transportation

Hydrogen could provide a means of charging up battery electric vehicles, as opposed to fuel-cell electric vehicles, by having external fuel cells produce electricity from outside of the vehicle. Hydrogen chargers could have an integrated battery, but also rely on stored, compressed hydrogen as energy storage. While this could provide a solution to off-grid or temporary power situations, IDTechEx states that the costs of hydrogen charging, especially when using green hydrogen to maximize sustainability, would be very high. However, as renewable energy costs decrease as they become more widely available, hydrogen charging could see a noticeable uptake.

Hydrogen planes could be a new means of travel in the future, with the only emission produced in-flight being water vapour, and would be a great development for the environment and reducing the carbon footprint of air travel. Liquid hydrogen fuel cell planes could have between 30 and 40% of the range of a jet fuel plane, which could mean a travel range of several thousand kilometers is possible. This would be ideal for shorter journeys of under 2,000km, which is where over 50% of travel demand lies by seats, according to IDTechEx. The report, ""Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts"", covers different ways to decarbonize the air travel sector, including the introduction of battery-powered planes and the implementation of sustainable aviation fuel.

The creation of green hydrogen with electrolysis

With the expansion of hydrogen applications in line with increasing decarbonization efforts, green hydrogen in particular is drawing attention as being the most environmentally beneficial in its use. Green hydrogen is produced with water electrolysis, with many different electrolyzer types on the market, each with their own benefits.

Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers, for example, can offer more compact system designs and much smaller footprints when compared with alkaline systems. PEMELs high power densities are as a result of their solid proton exchange membrane, and they are a popular commercial option for producing green hydrogen with advancing technologies being developed. Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrolyzers operate at the lowest voltage range and therefore can be considered one of the most efficient technologies. This is possible as a result of leveraging high temperatures and enabling favorable thermodynamics, according to IDTechEx. More types of electrolyzers used to produce green hydrogen, and their best suited applications, are covered in detail in IDTechEx's report, ""Materials for Green Hydrogen Production 2026-2036: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"".

Turning hydrogen into electricity

Fuel cells operate with the input of hydrogen fuel and an oxygen source which undergo a chemical reaction that results in the generation of electricity to power an external load, alongside water and heat. Stationary fuel cells refer to this process occurring in a fixed place, either permanently or semi-permanently, and are usually operating within a fuel cell stack as part of a larger system.

Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are more favoured within stationary applications including industrial power and commercial operations, for continuous generation. Other types such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are more desired within mobile applications such as in the transport sector and are also becoming contenders for back-up power generation in the replacement of diesel generators.

The implementation of fuel cells as a means of providing large scale renewable energy could provide relief for continuous, always-on applications such as data centers. The sustainability promises that this means of generating electricity can fulfil, especially with the growing use of green hydrogen into the future, will also contribute to worldwide decarbonization efforts within the energy sector. IDTechEx's report, ""Stationary Fuel Cell Markets 2025-2035: Technologies, Players & Forecasts"", covers a multitude of fuel cell types, and their best suited applications, along with emerging trends and drawbacks to consider.

Using internal research funding, a multidisciplinary team produced and characterized the SAF, along with two other commercially available fuels, before collecting emissions and particulate data to support the aviation industry’s emissions goals.

“Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,” said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI’s Mechanical Engineering Division. “With this project we’re gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.”

Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum that burns inside a jet engine. Fueling jets with SAF could help reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide air travel accounts for 2% of all carbon emissions, and 12% of all carbon emissions from transportation. The team tackled three focus areas — production, characterization and testing.

First, chemical engineers refined electrofuels, or e-fuels, manufactured with hydrogen that’s produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The team then processed that into an in-house SAF meeting aviation fuels standards. Then SwRI’s fuels and lubricants specialists characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI's propulsion and energy specialists used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

Through a series of hydroprocessing reactions over several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They engineered a small batch — about one barrel of fuel — to characterize and test fuels prior to commercialization.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time and risks for our clients.”

“We are excited to offer multidisciplinary solutions across all stages of the SAF development cycle,” said SwRI’s Executive Vice President Walt Downing. “This integrated project paired chemical and mechanical engineers with fluids and emissions experts to address several technical challenges.”

Di Sabatino will present at the Sustainable Aviation Futures Congress in Houston, October 14-16.

European Energy adds bio-methanol made with e-SMR to its green fuel portfolio

The production process will decrease production costs while lowering the carbon intensity of methanol

The addition of e-SMR-based bio-methanol will broaden European Energy’s green methanol portfolio

The e-SMR technology can also be deployed in conventional methanol production, reducing CO₂ emissions from natural-gas-based methanol

First commercial 10-MW unit planned for 2026 following more than 80,000 hours of prototype testing

European Energy will begin integrating the next generation of bio-methanol into its portfolio of green fuels.

The bio-methanol will be produced through an innovative technology known as electrified steam methane reforming (e-SMR), where renewable electricity is used to process biogas or biomethane into synthesis gas, which is then converted into green methanol using European Energy’s proprietary methanol technology.

The e-SMR technology is not a replacement but a complementary addition to European Energy’s green fuel offering. By advancing green hydrogen, e-methanol, and bio-methanol in parallel, European Energy ensures greater flexibility across markets. Together, the three products form a diversified technology platform that accelerates the transition from fossil fuels to scalable, carbon-neutral fuels.

The technology has been developed by SYPOX, a spin-off from the Technical University of Munich, with which European Energy is now cooperating. Following over 80,000 test hours and successful demonstrations under real-life conditions at biogas plants in Germany, the first 10-MW commercial e-SMR unit is scheduled for delivery in 2026.

“With SYPOX’s e-SMR technology, we can reduce the production costs of green methanol while lowering its carbon intensity – enabling the shipping and chemical sectors to decarbonize faster,” says Emil Vikjær-Andresen, Executive Vice President and Head of Power-to-X at European Energy.

“By adding bio-methanol made with e-SMR technology, we strengthen our ability to deliver competitive green fuels across different regulatory and market conditions. This is not a pivot but a complementary pathway that expands the technology solutions needed to scale green methanol globally.”

European Energy began green fuel production at its Kassø e-methanol facility in May 2025, making it the world’s first large-scale commercial e-methanol facility, with a potential production capacity of 42,000 tpy of e-methanol.

“European Energy brings unique expertise as a frontrunner in scaling green methanol production, and their commitment is a strong validation of our technology. Together, we can accelerate the industrial deployment of e-SMR and make green methanol a competitive global fuel,” says Gianluca Pauletto, CEO of SYPOX.

“Our e-SMR systems have undergone more than 80,000 hours of successful testing, including a pilot and demo installation in the field, providing both efficiency and stability. With European Energy, we can now take the next step into commercial-scale deployment, optimizing the technology for large production units and further reducing the carbon footprint of methanol synthesis.”

Methanol plays a central role in the global energy and chemical economy, serving as a fuel for the shipping sector, a feedstock for the chemical industry, and potentially also as a fuel for aviation. Today, most methanol is produced from fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, making the transition to green alternatives essential for meeting climate targets and reducing emissions.

The global methanol market exceeds 100 MM tonnes today and is projected to reach 500 MM tonnes by 2050. With growing demand from shipping, chemicals, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, e-SMR provides a practical next step for scaling green fuels to meet climate and compliance goals.

Organised by Eva International Media, the event will take place at Copenhagen Airport, bringing cargo, ground handling and passenger operations under one roof.
“The goal is to demystify the technology and focus on what works.” A Centenary setting Hosting ACHL 2025 at Copenhagen Airport gives the event a ready-made talking point.
“Copenhagen Airport is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2025, which is already a milestone worth raising a glass to,” Raja notes.
“ That mix of history and innovation makes Copenhagen the perfect place to host ACHL,” she explained.","The Air Cargo Handling and Logistics (ACHL) Conference returns on 14th October with a format that combines six events into a single, multi-track gathering. Organised by Eva International Media, the event will take place at Copenhagen Airport, bringing cargo, ground handling and passenger operations under one roof.

“The thinking was refreshingly simple: listen to the industry,” Parveen Raja, Publisher of Eva International Media, said. “Time and again, we were told there are too many events competing for the same diaries and travel budgets. So, the solution was clear — why not bring them together under one roof?

“These areas don’t function in isolation — they have natural synergies,” she explains. “By merging six events into one platform, we save people time, reduce travel demands, and create deeper opportunities for learning and networking.”

From buzzwords to bottom line

This year’s theme — ‘Enhance Safety, Embrace Digital, Drive Value’ — reflects what Raja calls “the three non-negotiables of aviation today and tomorrow.” “Safety remains the foundation of everything we do,” she says. “That doesn’t change, especially as ne

w technologies, aircraft types, and operating models emerge. Digitisation is no longer just a buzzword; it’s transforming how we handle passengers, cargo, and compliance.” But digital progress, she stresses, must serve a clear purpose: “Everything must deliver value for airlines, handlers, airports, and ultimately the passenger. By addressing these priorities head on, we’re helping the industry stay focused on what truly matters — building trusted, efficient, and future-ready aviation services.”

Delegates can expect sessions on AI, IoT, and blockchain — though Raja is keen to keep discussions grounded in application rather than hype. “We bring experts, innovators, and early adopters together to share real examples and lessons learned,” she says. “The goal is to demystify the technology and focus on what works.”

A Centenary setting

Hosting ACHL 2025 at Copenhagen Airport gives the event a ready-made talking point. “Copenhagen Airport is celebrating its 100th anniversary in 2025, which is already a milestone worth raising a glass to,” Raja notes. “Beyond that, CPH is one of Europe’s fastest-growing hubs, with passenger numbers on the rise and a globally recognised role as a pharmaceutical logistics hub. “

That mix of history and innovation makes Copenhagen the perfect place to host ACHL,” she explained. “It’s a setting where we can both honour history and shape the next century of aviation together.”

Collaboration that counts

Cooperation remains the event’s core purpose. “We take collaboration very seriously, which is exactly why we’ve put everyone under one roof,” Raja explained. “By breaking down silos and creating shared forums for airlines, handlers, regulators, and tech innovators, ACHL creates an environment where the conversations that really matter can take shape.”

Sustainability will also be prominent throughout the programme. “It’s no longer confined to the CSR sections of annual reports — it’s business critical,” she continued. “Delegates will hear perspectives on everything from green logistics strategies to the real-world scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and ambitious decarbonisation roadmaps.”

With these discussions, the event hopes to encourage delegates to move from intent to implementation: “We want to shift the conversation from why to how — practical solutions, innovative technologies, and collaborative models that genuinely help aviation walk the sustainability talk.”

Networking with a Nordic flair

ACHL has built a reputation for lively networking, something the organisers are looking to maintain in 2025. “Networking is the heartbeat of ACHL, and this year we’re turning up the volume,” Raja outlined. The programme includes a welcome reception on 14th October and an evening at Copenhagen’s Circus Building — a venue more often associated with entertainment than trade shows.

Adding a personal touch, the Women in Air Cargo Awards, championed by Brigitte Gledhill, will highlight professionals shaping the sector’s future. “Expect conversations that matter, connections that last, and backdrops so memorable you’ll be glad you brought a camera as well as your business cards,” she highlighted.

When asked what he hopes attendees will take away, Raja was clear: “Professionally, I hope they leave feeling better connected and better equipped to tackle the big challenges in aviation today. Personally, I hope they leave with new friendships, great memories, and maybe a story or two from the Circus Building that they’ll still be laughing about next year.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0138-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 12:59:17.629235

A multidisciplinary team produced and characterized the SAF, along with two other commercially available fuels, before collecting emissions and particulate data to support the aviation industry's emissions goals.

""Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,"" said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI's Mechanical Engineering Division. ""With this project we're gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.""

Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum that burns inside a jet engine. Fueling jets with SAF could help reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide air travel accounts for 2% of all carbon emissions, and 12% of all carbon emissions from transportation. The team tackled three focus areas—production, characterization and testing.

First, chemical engineers refined electrofuels, or e-fuels, manufactured with hydrogen that's produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The team then processed that into an in-house SAF meeting aviation fuels standards. Then SwRI's fuels and lubricants specialists characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI's propulsion and energy specialists used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

Through a series of hydroprocessing reactions over several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They engineered a small batch—about one barrel of fuel—to characterize and test fuels prior to commercialization.

""All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,"" Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI's Chemical Engineering Department said. ""By creating, characterizing and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time and risks for our clients.""

""We are excited to offer multidisciplinary solutions across all stages of the SAF development cycle,"" said SwRI's Executive Vice President Walt Downing.

OXCCU announced the funding on September 29th. The spin-out company is positioned as a leading climate tech innovator in the UK, tackling aviation emissions, with its latest funding round being oversubscribed.

Funding and Investment

The most recent round of funding includes new investors such as Orlen VC, Safron Corporate Ventures, and International Airlines Group (IAG). Existing investors include Clean Energy Ventures and the University of Oxford.

Investor demand exceeded available shares in the latest funding round, indicating strong investor confidence. The funding amount will accelerate commercialisation efforts and advance the next phase of technology scale-up. OX2, the next demonstration plant, will be fully operational by 2026.

Technology and Innovation

OXCCU employs a one-step process to produce sustainable aviation fuel. It involves an iron-based catalyst enabling the synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction. The process eliminates the need for steps such as water gas shift or e-methanol, reducing operating costs.

The SAF mandate in the UK and the RefuelEU Aviation initiative in the EU set clear targets for airlines to increase the use of sustainable fuels in their operations. However, this may be a challenge as conventional fuel is still significantly cheaper.

OXCCU has mentioned that although their process has reduced costs, high production costs remain a barrier. By developing the one-step process, however, OXCCU is attempting to provide a cost-saving alternative to the current SAF production methods.

Benefits of growth

The investment will inevitably help the UK meet its SAF mandate by producing more sustainable fuel. It is also one of many UK-based SAF plants, making the country a leading player in the market. Creating new SAF plants will create green jobs and increase aviation fuel exports.

Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU:

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving.”

Johnathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Director at IAG, said:

Underlying operating expenses in oil and gas exploration and production could exceed the previous quarter by up to $500 million, Shell said.
Trading Improvement The improved trading outlook follows a period of relative stability in oil prices.
That echoes Exxon Mobil Corp.’s update on Monday, which projected a $300 million to $700 million profit boost from stronger fuel-making margins.","Shell Plc said the performance of its oil and gas trading operation recovered in the third quarter, after struggling with geopolitical volatility in the previous period.

The division’s performance was significantly higher for gas and higher for oil in the quarter, the company said Tuesday in a statement ahead of earnings results later this month.

It’s a bounce back for a business that’s often one of the energy giant’s biggest profit boosters. Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan had linked unusually poor trading results in the second quarter to market swings driven by geopolitics rather than supply-demand fundamentals, leading Shell to dial back risk.

Shell’s shares rose as much as 2.3% in London on Tuesday, the most in two months. The stock’s 12% gain this year is now the best performance among the largest oil and gas companies.

“We see this as a strong update from the company,” RBC analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note on Tuesday. He highlighted “better trading” performance in the July-September period following the “disappointing” trading result in the previous quarter.

Borkhataria also noted Shell’s increased LNG liquefaction volumes rising to between 7 million and 7.4 million metric tons, up from 6.7 million in the prior quarter. Shell’s oil and gas output climbed to as much as the equivalent of 1.89 million barrels a day, within previous guidance range.

Underlying operating expenses in oil and gas exploration and production could exceed the previous quarter by up to $500 million, Shell said.

Trading Improvement

The improved trading outlook follows a period of relative stability in oil prices. Brent crude futures traded mostly within a narrow band between $65 and $70 a barrel in the third quarter, giving traders more predictable spreads to exploit. Average prices in the quarter were up by more than $2.

While the third quarter was not without volatility, the preceding period saw a short-lived war in the Middle East — the world’s oil heartland — and wide ranging announcements of tariffs by US President Donald Trump’s administration.

Shell is among the first so-called supermajors to update investors guidance on quarterly results, giving a little more visibility for how the sector at large fared.

Its peers also struggled with volatility in the second quarter. And while Shell’s update suggests an improvement for energy trading, the International Energy Agency says the oil market is on the cusp of oversupply that might pressure prices. TotalEnergies SE announced a reduction in share buybacks last month with an expectation of Brent crude trading in a lower range.

Refining margins also improved for Shell. That echoes Exxon Mobil Corp.’s update on Monday, which projected a $300 million to $700 million profit boost from stronger fuel-making margins.

Chemicals Woes

Not all divisions are rebounding. Shell’s chemicals unit is expected to lose money in the third quarter.

The chemicals unit has been a drag on Shell’s performance for some time, and the company has said it’s exploring partnerships in the US and selective closures in Europe. Sawan in July pledged to turn around the chemicals business, which he said has been suffering from one of the most protracted industrywide slumps in a long time.

Major chemical producers have announced closures or have idled capacity in Europe, including Dow Inc. and Exxon, partly as high energy costs in the region make it less competitive. Shell completed the sale of its Singapore chemicals plant earlier this year.

Biofuels Writedown

Shell also took $600 million in new impairments tied to the suspension of its biofuels plant in Rotterdam, bringing total writedowns at the site to roughly $1.4 billion. The project, which was put on hold last year pending a cost review, would have been one of Europe’s biggest plants for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Shell has been shedding low-carbon businesses to boost profitability.

Rival BP Plc is also forgoing construction of a biofuels plant in the Netherlands to focus on oil and gas production.

Sawan has spent the past two years seeking to cut costs, improve reliability and shed underperforming assets in an effort to close a valuation gap with Shell’s US rivals.

Using internal research funding, a multidisciplinary team produced and characterized the SAF, along with two other commercially available fuels, before collecting emissions and particulate data to support the aviation industry’s emissions goals.

“Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,” said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI’s Mechanical Engineering Division. “With this project we’re gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.”

Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum that burns inside a jet engine. Fueling jets with SAF could help reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide air travel accounts for 2% of all carbon emissions, and 12% of all carbon emissions from transportation. The team tackled three focus areas — production, characterization and testing.

First, chemical engineers refined electrofuels, or e-fuels, manufactured with hydrogen that’s produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The team then processed that into an in-house SAF meeting aviation fuels standards. Then SwRI’s fuels and lubricants specialists characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI's propulsion and energy specialists used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

Through a series of hydroprocessing reactions over several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They engineered a small batch — about one barrel of fuel — to characterize and test fuels prior to commercialization.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time and risks for our clients.”

“We are excited to offer multidisciplinary solutions across all stages of the SAF development cycle,” said SwRI’s Executive Vice President Walt Downing. “This integrated project paired chemical and mechanical engineers with fluids and emissions experts to address several technical challenges.”

Di Sabatino will present at the Sustainable Aviation Futures Congress in Houston, October 14-16.

Liquid biofuels feature heavily in the climate plans of many countries, as governments prioritise domestic energy security amid geopolitical challenges, while looking to meet their climate targets and bolster farm incomes.

Despite a rapid shift towards electrified transportation, biofuels continue to play a leading role in efforts to reduce road-transport emissions, as they work well with many existing car engines.

At the same time, biofuels are expected to play an important role in decarbonising sectors where emissions are particularly challenging to mitigate, such as shipping, trucking and aviation.

Heated debates continue around using food sources as fuel in the face of record hunger levels, given competing demands for land and crops.

Despite these arguments, biofuels are seeing heightened demand bolstered by a strong policy push, particularly in developing countries.

They are expected to feature heavily on the COP30 agenda this year as a key feature of the host Brazil’s “bioeconomy”.

Below, Carbon Brief unpacks what biofuels are, their key benefits and criticisms, plus how they are being used to meet climate targets.

What are biofuels?

Bioenergy refers to all energy derived from biomass, a term used to describe non-fossil material from biological sources. Biofuels, in turn, are liquid fuels that are produced from biomass.

These sources are wide-ranging, but commonly include food crops, vegetable oils, animal fats, algae and municipal or agricultural waste, along with synthetic derivatives from these products.

Glossary

Biomass

Non-fossil material of biological origin

Biofuel

Fuels produced directly or indirectly from biomass

Feedstock

Types of biomass used as sources for biofuels, such as crops, grasses, agricultural and forestry residues, wastes and microbial biomass

Bioenergy

All energy derived from biofuels

Bioethanol

A biofuel used as a petrol substitute, produced from the fermentation of biomass from plants like corn, sugarcane and wheat

Biodiesel

A biofuel used as a diesel substitute, derived from vegetable oils or animal fats through a process called transesterification

The different types of biomass are referred to as “feedstocks”. They are converted to fuel through one or more processes, such as fermentation or treating them with high temperatures or hydrogen.

Biofuels are frequently blended with petroleum products in an effort to reduce emissions and reliance on fossil-fuel imports.

Experiments to test whether vegetable oils could run in combustion engines began in the early 1900s. In a 1912 paper, Rudolf Diesel – the inventor of the diesel engine – presciently noted that these oils “make it certain that motorpower can still be produced from the heat of the sun…even when all our natural stores of solid and liquid fuels are exhausted”.

An extract from Rudolf Diesel’s 1912 paper, published in the Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, outlining the importance biofuels could assume in the future. Credit: Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (1912)

Biofuels are divided into four “generations”, based on the technologies and feedstocks used to synthesise them.

First-generation biofuels

The first – and earliest – generation of biofuels comes from edible crops, such as corn, sugarcane, soya bean and oil palm. Large-scale commercial production of these fuels began in the 1970s in Brazil and the US from sugarcane and corn, respectively.

Bioethanol, for instance, is drawn from the fermentation of sugars in corn, sugarcane and rice. Biodiesel is derived from vegetable oils – such as palm, canola or soya bean oil – or animal fats, through a process called transesterification, which makes them less viscous and more suitable as fuels.

Because they are derived directly from food crops, experts and campaigners have expressed concerns over the impacts of first-generation biofuels on forests, food security and the environment, as well as indirect land-use change impacts. (See: What are some of the main criticisms of biofuels?)

Several studies have found that the land-use emissions of first-generation biofuels are severely underestimated, but other experts tell Carbon Brief that this depends on how and where the crops are grown, processed and transported.

According to Dr Angelo Gurgel, principal research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy, the “big image that biofuels are bad” is not always accurate. Gurgel explains:

“Some biofuels can be better than others, varying from place to place and feedstock to feedstock. It depends on where you produce them, how much farmers can increase yields, how effectively a country’s regulations help avoid land-use change and how closely it is connected to international markets.

“Some options may be very, very good in terms of reducing emissions and other options probably will be very bad.”

Second-generation biofuels

Second-generation biofuels are extracted from biomass that is not meant for human consumption.

Feedstocks for these biofuels are incredibly varied. They include agricultural waste, such as straw and corn stalks, grasses, forest residues left over from wood processing, used vegetable oil and solid waste. They can also be made from energy crops grown specifically to serve as biofuels, such as jatropha, switchgrass or pongamia.

Derived from “waste” or grown on “marginal” land, second-generation biofuels were developed in the early 2000s. These fuels aimed to overcome the food security and land-use issues tied to their predecessors, while increasing the amount of fuel drawn out from biomass, compared to first-generation feedstocks.

These feedstocks are either heated to yield oil or “syngas” and then cooled, or treated with enzymes, microorganisms or other chemicals to break down the tough cellulose walls of plants. They can be challenging to process and present significant logistical and land-use challenges.

Third-generation biofuels

Third-generation biofuels are primarily derived from aquatic organic material, particularly algae and seaweed. While the US Department of Energy began its aquatic species programme in 1978 to research the production of biodiesel from algae, algal biofuel research saw a “sudden surge” in the 1990s and “became the darling” of renewable energy innovation in the early 21st century, says Mongabay.

Because algae grows faster than terrestrial plants, is high in lipid (fatty organic) content and does not compete with terrestrial crops for land use, many scientists and industry professionals consider third-generation biofuels an improvement over their predecessors.

However, high energy, water and nutrient needs, high production costs and technical challenges are key obstacles to the large-scale production of algae-based biofuels. Since the early 2010s, many companies, including Shell, Chevron, BP and ExxonMobil, have abandoned or cut funding to their algal biofuel development programmes.

Fourth-generation biofuels

Genetically modified algae, bacteria and yeast engineered for higher yields serve as the feedstock for fourth-generation biofuels. These fuels have been developed more recently – from the early 2010s onwards – and are an area of ongoing research and development.

Some of these organisms are engineered to directly or artificially photosynthesise solar energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) into fuel; these are called solar biofuels.

Others – called electrofuels, synthetic fuels or e-fuels – are produced when CO2 captured from biomass is combined with hydrogen and converted into hydrocarbons through other processes, typically using electricity generated from renewable sources.

Fourth-generation biofuels are technology- and CO2-intensive and expensive to produce. They also run up against public perception and legal limitations on genetically modified organisms, as well as concerns around biosafety and health.

What are the most common biofuels being used today?

Bioethanol is the most commonly used liquid biofuel in the world, followed by biodiesel.

In 2024, global liquid biofuel production increased by 8% year-on-year, with the US (37%) and Brazil (22%) accounting for the largest overall share of production, according to the 2025 Statistical Review of World Energy from the Energy Institute.

Other countries that saw a notable increase in production between 2023-24 were Sweden (62%), Canada (39%), China (30%), India (26%) and Argentina (24%).

Bioethanol is the most commonly used biofuel in the world, with a consumption rate of 1.1m barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, according to the report. This is closely followed by biodiesel, at 1m barrels of oil equivalent per day.

In 2024, the US, Brazil and the EU accounted for nearly three-quarters of all biofuels consumed globally. However, while India’s biofuel demand grew by 38%, demand for biofuels in the EU fell by 11% in 2024, according to the review, echoing outlooks that show that middle-income countries are driving biofuel growth.

The chart below shows how biofuel production and consumption have changed since 2000, and how they are projected to change through 2034.

What are the main arguments for biofuels?

From lowered oil imports and emissions through to boosting farm livelihoods, countries that have boosted biofuels programmes cite several benefits in biofuels’ favour.

‘Renewable’ energy and lowered emissions

Biofuels are often described as “renewable” fuels, since crops can be grown over and over again.

In order to achieve this, crops for biofuels must be continuously replanted and harvested to meet energy demand. Growing crops – particularly in the monoculture plantations typically used for growing feedstocks – can require high use of fossil fuels, in the form of machinery and fertiliser. Furthermore, in the case of wood as a feedstock, regrowth can take decades.

While some biofuels offer significant emissions reductions, others, such as palm biodiesel, generate similar or sometimes higher emissions as fossil fuels when burned. However, ancillary emissions for biofuels are much smaller than for oil and gas operations.

One of the main cited benefits of biofuels is that plants capture CO2 from the atmosphere as they grow, potentially serving to mitigate emissions. However, several lifecycle-assessment studies have questioned just how much plants can offset emissions. These studies come up with varying estimates based on feedstock types, geography, production routes and methodology.

This divergence is echoed in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), which points to “contrasting conclusions” even when similar bioenergy systems and conditions are analysed.

Per the report, there is “medium agreement” on the emissions-reduction potential of second-generation biofuels derived from wastes and residues by 2050.

At the same time, the IPCC adds that “technical land availability does not imply that dedicated biomass production for bioenergy…is the most effective use of this land for mitigation”.

It also warns that larger-scale biofuel use “generally translates into higher risk for negative outcomes for greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, food security and a range of other sustainability criteria”.

Along with the IPCC, many other groups and experts – including the UK’s Climate Change Commission – have called for a “biomass hierarchy”, pointing to a limited amount of sustainable bioenergy resources available and how best to prioritise their use.

Use in hard-to-abate sectors

In many countries, such as the US and UK, biofuels are part of a standard grade of diesel and petrol (gasoline) available at most fuel pumps.

Biofuels have also been the leading measure for decarbonising road transport in emerging economies, where electric vehicle systems were not as developed as in many western nations.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), most new biofuel demand is coming from these countries, including Brazil, India and Indonesia.

Biofuels are also one of the key options being explored to decarbonise the emissions-heavy, but “hard-to-abate”, sectors of aviation and shipping.

The AR6 report notes that the “faster-than-anticipated adoption of electromobility” has “partially shifted the debate” from using biofuels primarily in land transport towards using them in shipping and aviation.

At the same time, experts question how this can be done sustainably, given the limited availability of advanced biofuels and the rising demand for them.

Government reports – such as those released by the EU Commission – recognise that, in some circumstances, so-called sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) could produce just as many emissions as fossil fuels when burned in order to power planes.

However, SAFs do generally – although not always – have a lower overall “lifecycle” carbon footprint than petroleum-based jet fuel. This is due to the CO2 absorbed when growing plants for biofuels, or emissions that are avoided by diverting waste products to be used as fuels.

Unlike the road sector, where “electrification is mature…aviation and shipping cannot be electrified so easily”, says Cian Delaney, fuels policy officer at the Brussels-based advocacy group Transport & Environment (T&E).

According to a 2025 T&E briefing, the 2030 demand for biofuels from global shipping alone could require an area the “size of Germany”. Delaney tells Carbon Brief:

“In aviation in particular, where you still need some space to transition, you still need a certain amount of biofuels. But these biofuels should be advanced and waste biofuels derived from true waste and residues, and they are available in truly limited amounts, which is why, in parallel, we need to upscale the production of e-fuels [synthetic fuels derived from green hydrogen] for aviation.”

In February this year, more than 65 environmental organisations from countries including the US, Indonesia and the Netherlands wrote to the International Maritime Organization, urging its 176 member states to “exclude biofuels from the industry’s energy mix”.

The organisations cited the “devastating impacts on climate, communities, forests and other ecosystems” from biofuels, cautioning that fuels such as virgin palm oil are often “fraud[ulently]” mislabelled as used cooking oil – a key feedstock for SAF.

Meanwhile, the AR6 report has “medium confidence” that heavy-duty trucks can be decarbonised through a combination of batteries and hydrogen or biofuels. And despite growing interest in the use of biofuels for aviation, it says, “demand and production volumes remain negligible compared to conventional fossil aviation fuels”.

Energy security and reducing import dependence

In many countries, such as India and Indonesia, biofuels are seen as a part of a suite of measures to increase energy security and lessen dependence on fossil-fuel imports from other countries. This imperative received increasing emphasis after the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war on Ukraine.

In developing countries, the “main motivation” behind biofuel policy is to find an alternative to excessive dependence on imported fossil fuels that are a “major drain” on foreign exchanges and subject to volatility and price shocks, says Prof Nandula Raghuram, professor of biotechnology at the Guru Gobind Singh University in New Delhi.

Raghuram, who formerly chaired the International Nitrogen Initiative, tells Carbon Brief that, in order for developing countries to “earn those precious dollars to finance our petroleum imports”, they have to export “valuable primary commodities”, such as grain and vegetables, at the cost of nutritional self-reliance. He adds:

“And so we have to see the biofuel approach as not so much a proactive strategy, but as a sort of reactive strategy to use whatever domestic capacity we have to produce whatever domestic fuel, including biofuels, to reduce that much burden on the exchequer for imports.”

Boost to agriculture

Many governments also see biofuels as an alternative income stream for farmers and a means to revitalise rural economies.

An increasing demand for biofuels could, for example, offer farmers higher returns on their crops, attract industry and services to agrarian areas and help diversify farm incomes.

In 2023, a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated that the liquid biofuel industry employed approximately 2.8 million people worldwide.

The bulk of these jobs were in Latin America and Asia, where farming is more labour-intensive and relies on informal and seasonal employment. Brazil’s biofuel sector alone employed nearly one million people in 2023, according to the report.

Meanwhile, North America and Europe accounted for only 12% and 6% of biofuel jobs in 2023, respectively, according to the report.

The chart below shows the number of jobs in the biofuel sector in the top 10 biofuel-producing countries.

Delaney points out that biofuel-related jobs account for less than 1% of all jobs in the EU, adding that the “most-consumed biofuel feedstocks” in the bloc are vegetable oils that are imported from countries such as Brazil and Indonesia. (See: How are countries using biofuels to meet their climate targets?)

He tells Carbon Brief:

“Despite strong biofuels mandates in the EU, the sector didn’t create as many jobs in the end for EU farmers, but, instead, benefited the big fuel suppliers and industry players.”

What are some of the main criticisms of biofuels?

Despite their widespread use and increasing adoption, experts recognise that biofuels “may also carry significant risks” and cause impacts that can undermine their sustainability, if not managed carefully.

Production emissions, land-use change and deforestation

The different chemical processes involved in making biofuels require varying amounts of energy and, therefore, the associated emissions depend on how “clean” a producer country’s energy mix is.

At the same time, growing biofuel crops often relies on emissions-intensive fertilisers and pesticides to keep yields high and consistent. (See Carbon Brief’s detailed explainer on what the world’s reliance on fertilisers means for climate change.)

Biofuel production processes, such as fermentation, also release CO2 and other greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide.

MIT’s Gurgel tells Carbon Brief that it is “relatively straightforward” to measure these direct emissions from biofuel production.

However, given how different countries account for deforestation, tracking direct land-use change emissions related to biofuel production is slightly more challenging – although still possible, Gurgel says. These emissions can come from clearing forests or converting other land specifically for growing energy crops.

For example, in many tropical forest countries, native rainforests and peatland have been cleared to grow oil palm for biodiesel or sugarcane for bioethanol.

According to one 2011 study by the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF), it could take more than 200 years to reverse the carbon emissions caused by clearing peatland to grow palm oil.

Gurgel tells Carbon Brief:

“What is really very hard – I would say impossible – to measure are the indirect impacts of biofuels on land.”

Indirect land-use change occurs when a piece of land used to grow food crops is used instead for biofuels. This can, in turn, require deforestation somewhere else to produce the same amount of crops for food as the original piece of land.

Indirect land-use change can mean a loss of natural ecosystems, with “significant implications for greenhouse gas emissions and land degradation”, according to a 2024 review paper.

Gurgel explains:

“If you provoke a chain of reactions in the market, that can lead to expansion of cropland in another region of the world and then this can push the agricultural frontier further and cause some deforestation…It’s quite hard to know exactly what’s going to happen and those things are interactions in the market that are impossible to measure.”

The “best that scientists can do” to determine if such a “biofuel shock” could indeed cause land-use change in a forest or grassland elsewhere “is try to project those emissions using models, or do very careful statistical work that will never be complete”, he adds.

Delaney, from Transport and Environment, contends that there is enough scientific research to “show that indirect land-use change is real” and to quantify the expansion of “certain food and feedstocks into high-carbon stock” areas, such as forests.

While this is “not easy” to do, he points to the European Commission’s indirect land-use change directive, the accompanying methodology and its scientific teams who study agricultural expansion rates. Delaney continues:

“What we all agree with at this point is that indirect land-use change exists, that it’s a problem, that certain feedstocks like palm and soya are particularly problematic from this perspective and that it is an issue that we need to tackle and capture in the best possible way.

“You cannot just be vague and descriptive without having proper figures behind it – and I think that’s something that at least the EU have tried and that they continue trying to implement. And I hope that, at the global level as well, this will be more recognised.”

Impacts on food, biodiversity and water security

Biofuel-boosting policies have been subjected to intense scrutiny during periods of global food-price spikes in 2008, 2011 and 2013.

Following the spikes, critics attributed increasing biofuel production as a major factor in the near-doubling of cereal prices. Studies have shown that they played a more “modest” role in some of these spikes and a more substantial one in others.

Severalexperts have linked food-price spikes to protests in north Africa and the Middle-East, including the Arab Spring.

In more recent years, the “food vs fuel debate” has come back to the fore since the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022.

This was in part due to the world’s reliance on Ukraine and Russia’s food and energy systems – particularly some of the most food-insecure countries, who had to contend with record-high food prices that peaked in March 2022, but still persist. The war also saw heightened calls for the US and EU to overturn biofuel-boosting policies to free up land to increase domestic food production and bring down food prices.

In developing countries, such as India, the use of cereals and oils to make biofuels while large sections of the population still lack access to adequate nutrition has attracted criticism from experts.

While first-generation biofuels rely on fertilisers to guarantee consistently high yields, second-generation biofuels could directly compete with feed for livestock or their return to soil as nutrients.

According to a 2013 report by the panel of scientists that advises the UN Committee on World Food Security (CFS):

“All crops compete for the same land or water, labour, capital, inputs and investment, and there are no current magic non-food crops that can ensure more harmonious biofuel production on marginal lands.”

This competition, along with clearing forests and other ecosystems for cropland, has consequences not just for emissions, but also for biodiversity, water and nutrients.

According to one 2021 review paper, local species richness and abundance were 37% and 49% lower, respectively, in places where first-generation biofuel crops were being grown than in places with primary vegetation. Additionally, it found that soya, wheat, maize and palm oil had the “worst effects” on local biodiversity, with Asia and central and South America being the most-impacted regions.

Biofuels’ impact on water resources, similarly, is highly crop- and location-specific.

For instance, growing a “thirsty” crop such as sugarcane in Brazil could have minimal impacts on local water resources, due to the region’s abundant rainfall. But in drought-prone India, experts have estimated that a litre of sugarcane ethanol requires more than 2,500 litres of water to produce and relies entirely on irrigation. Research has also found that nearly half of China’s maize crop requires irrigation to grow.

According to agricultural economist Dr Shweta Saini, meeting India’s 2025-26 biofuels target will require 275m tonnes of sugarcane, 6m tonnes of maize and 5.5m tonnes of rice. According to one 2020 study cited by Bloomberg columnist David Fickling, increasing sugarcane production to meet India’s biofuel targets “could consume an additional 348bn cubic metres of water…around twice what is used by every city” in the country.

Prof Raghuram tells Carbon Brief:

“Water resources are drying up everywhere in the country and by incentivising, through policy, a water-guzzling industry like this, we are inviting a sustainability crisis.”

‘Feedstock crunch’

Another concern surrounding biofuels is that there may not be enough supply to go around to meet rising demand. The IEA described the potential shortfall as a “feedstock supply crunch” in a 2022 report.

Fuels derived from the most commonly used waste and residues, in particular, could be approaching supply limits, the IEA warns, as these fuels satisfy both sustainability and feedstock policy objectives in the US and EU.

Consumption of vegetable oil for biofuel production is expected to soar by 46% over 2022-27, the report says. Meanwhile, the world is estimated to “nearly exhaust 100% of supplies” of used cooking oil and animal fats within the decade.

For the world to stay on a net-zero trajectory, “a more than three times production increase” would be required, the report adds. It warns that if the limited availability of second-generation feedstocks continues unchanged, “the potential for biofuels to contribute to global decarbonisation efforts could be undermined”.

The chart below shows the biofuel demand share of global crop production from 2022-27.

How are countries using biofuels to meet their climate targets?

Broadly, biofuel policies are divided into two categories.

Technology “push” policies focus on the research and development of new technologies and include measures such as research funding, pilot plants and government support for commercialising nascent technologies.

Meanwhile, market “pull” policies drive demand for existing and emerging biofuels through measures such as “biofuel blending mandates” – where countries prescribe a certain percentage of biofuel with fossil fuels – and tax breaks for producers and vehicle owners.

US

The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is the world’s largest existing biofuel programme. Its mandates are keenly watched and contested by the country’s farm and petroleum lobbies.

Under RFS, the US Environmental Protection Agency sets out minimum levels of biofuels that must be blended into the US’s transport, heating and jet fuel supplies.

Under the policy, oil refiners can either blend mandated volumes of biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits – called Renewable Identification Numbers (RINS) – from those that do.

While the programme sets out emissions reduction targets, the environmental impacts of cropland expansion and monoculture driven by the policy have been cause for concern by experts.

According to one 2022 study, the RFS programme increased US fertiliser use by 3-8% each year between 2008-16 and caused enough domestic emissions from land-use change that the carbon intensity of corn ethanol was “no less than that of gasoline and likely at least 24% higher”. Additionally, the programme’s impacts on biodiversity have not yet been fully assessed.

In June 2025, the Trump administration announced plans to expand the biofuel mandate to a “record 24.02bn gallons” next year – an 8% increase from its 2025 target – while seeking to discourage imported biofuels.

EU

In the EU, policymakers have promoted biofuels since 2003 to reduce emissions in the transport system. As part of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED), biofuels have been explicitly linked to emissions targets.

Under the current iteration of RED (REDIII) – revised as part of the EU’s Fit for 55 package – EU countries are required to either achieve a share of 29% of renewable energy in transport or to reduce the emissions intensity of transport fuels by 14.5%. Additionally, it sets out a sub-target for “advanced biofuels” of 5.5% and excludes the use of food and feed-based biofuels in aviation and shipping.

In 2015, the European Commission acknowledged that the indirect land-use change emissions of first-generation biofuels could “fully negate” any emission savings by biofuels. The commission capped the use of first-generation biofuels in each member country at 7% of all energy used in transport by 2020, but did not announce plans to phase them out.

As of 2021, nearly 60% of all biofuels used in the EU were still made from food and feed crops, according to analysis by Oxfam. While the latest RED legislation continues to push for the use of advanced and waste biofuels, campaigners warn that a lack of clear definitions could increase the risk of “loopholes” and fraud, exacerbated by increased demand.

T&E’s Delaney tells Carbon Brief:

“You’re putting a lot of pressure on the land – you might require a lot of pesticides and irrigation – and there is not even enough land in Europe for this. How can you make sure true sustainability safeguards are in place so that you’re not actually driving additional demand for land in [biodiverse countries such as] Brazil?”

Brazil

Brazil has the world’s oldest biofuels mandate, dating back to the 1970s, established in a bid to insulate the country from expensive oil imports.

In 2017, Brazil announced a state policy called RenovaBio that set out national carbon intensity reduction targets for transport, decided biofuel mandates and created an open market for biofuel decarbonisation carbon reduction credits called CBIO.

In October 2024, Brazil enacted a “Fuels of the Future” law that replaced RenovaBio, with president Lula declaring that “Brazil will lead the world’s largest energy revolution”. The law aims to boost biofuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use, increasing biodiesel blending mandates by 1% every year starting in 2025 until it reaches 20% by March 2030.

Biofuels now account for 22% of the energy that fuels transport in Brazil and its ethanol market is “second in size only” to the US.

In June this year, Brazil announced that the country was increasing its biofuel blending mandates from 1 August in a bid to make the country “gasoline self-sufficient for the first time in 15 years”, reported Reuters.

Indonesia

As the world’s biggest palm oil producer, Indonesia has continued to raise its biodiesel blending mandates to meet its domestic energy needs.

The country first introduced mandatory biodiesel blending in 2008, at 2.5%. The mandate is currently at 40% in 2025 and, starting next year, could go up to 50% with an eventual goal of 100%.

While Indonesia’s president Prabowo Subianto has stated that implementing 50% blending could save the country $20bn in reduced diesel imports, the move would need an estimated 2.3m hectares of land, including protected forests, resulting in the “country’s largest-ever deforestation project”, according to Mongabay.

It could also compete with palm oil meant for domestic and international food markets, impacting already soaring prices and signalling the “end of cheap palm oil”.

India

India has quickly joined the ranks of major biofuel producers, due to high-level political support, policies and a diversity of feedstocks. In 2023, India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance as one of its key priorities of its G20 presidency.

Biofuel mandates are outlined in the country’s National Policy on Biofuels, first published in 2009 and subsequently amended in 2018 and 2022. In 2022, India achieved its 10% ethanol blending target ahead of schedule and is pursuing a 20% blending target by 2025, as well as a 5% biodiesel blending target by 2030.

India’s rapid biofuel push, however, has been criticised by food security experts as hunger levels rise, for its impact on endemic rainforests and, most recently, by vehicle owners for the impact of blended fuel on car engines.

Prof Raghuram says:

“From a sheer governance angle and sustainability angle, there are a lot of compromises being made to somehow push this whole thing. Even the land available in India is shrinking, as various reforms and dilution of environmental safeguards in the last 10 years have made it relatively easier to convert farm and forest land for non-agricultural purposes.”

China

China developed its first biofuel policies over 20 years ago and is one of the world’s biggest biofuel producers.

In 2017, China announced a new mandate expanding the use of fuel including bioethanol from 11 trial provinces to the entire country by 2020. However, Reuters and South China Morning Post reported that this was suspended in 2020. Only 15 provinces still maintain biofuel mandates, according to the US Department of Agriculture, which notes that a “lack of meaningful support for domestic biofuel consumption while aggressively promoting electric vehicles indicates a strategic choice to pursue transportation decarbonisation through electrification rather than liquid biofuels”.

At the same time, biofuel production in China grew by 30% in 2024, according to the Energy Institute’s Statistical Review.

While most of China’s biofuel production is grain-based, tax incentives for ethanol production have been gradually phased out and alternative biofuels have been incentivised, according to the IEA. China is currently piloting a scheme to increase biodiesel consumption at home, even as it exports biodiesel and used cooking oil to the EU and US.

How could climate change impact biofuel production?

Despite the well-documented impacts of climate change-induced extreme weather on land, agriculture and forests, there is currently little scientific literature examining how continued warming will impact global biofuel production.

One 2020 study found that bioethanol availability globally could drop – by 23% under a “very high emissions scenario” and by 4.3% under a “low emissions” scenario by 2060 – “if climate change risk is not adequately mitigated” and corn continues to be the dominant feedstock.

The study “encourages” changing out corn for switchgrass as a key source of bioethanol.

Another 2021 study examining the viability of China’s planned biofuel targets estimated that energy crop yields in China in the 2050s will decrease significantly compared to the 2010s, due to the impacts of climate change.

It found that climate change is expected to have a “substantial impact” on the land available for biofuel production in the 2050s, under both scenarios used in the study.

Gurgel, from MIT, tells Carbon Brief that it is “very hard to take into account how much climate change will damage bio-energy production” at this point, given the uncertainty of what emissions pathway the world will follow.

While most climate models “do a very good job” at forecasting average temperature change in the future, they do an “average job” at projecting rainfall change, or how many extreme weather events countries will see in the future, he says.

This is important because many biofuel crops, such as sugarcane and palm oil, are water-intensive and thrive in regions with abundant rainfall, but yields may fail in drier parts of the world that could see more drought.

Given this “cascade of uncertainties”, he continues, “we don’t have a clear picture of how bad the future [of agriculture] will be – we just know it will be more challenging than today”.

Delaney, meanwhile, asks whether investing in biofuels, which will be impacted by climate change, is a “good investment” for the long term. He tells Carbon Brief:

“I think these are the questions that we need to ask ourselves when we see – not just in India, but Indonesia, Brazil, everywhere around the world right now – this growing appetite for biofuels. Can we really keep the promises that we made at the end of the day?”",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/biofuels-hero-BM84M8.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:56:24.598559

The aviation industry faces mounting pressure to cut carbon emissions while maintaining safety, performance, and operational efficiency. Alternative aviation fuels have emerged as a key solution, but many existing options come with limitations—whether in blend ratios, energy density, or supply scalability.

Recent advances in fuel technology are shifting that narrative. New fuel formulations offer higher energy density, improved performance, and compatibility with current aircraft, enabling airlines to reduce emissions without sacrificing range or payload. These breakthroughs also support a more resilient and distributed production network, addressing critical supply chain challenges.

As the industry moves towards net-zero goals, the race is on to develop sustainable fuels that can be produced at scale, delivered reliably, and adopted seamlessly. Understanding these innovations is vital to grasp how aviation can balance growth with environmental responsibility in the coming decades.

The facility spans six acres and is intentionally designed as a scalable blueprint for future sites globally. It aims to produce 30,000 gallons of advanced fuels annually by early 2026, with engineering that supports expansion to a 100 million gallon commercial-scale facility. Mukund Karanjikar, CEO and founder of CleanJoule highlighted that “the key aspects are process integration and balance of plant, which once demonstrated, allow known scale-up engineering to take place.”

This approach differs from simply expanding one plant; instead, CleanJoule plans to replicate the CJ1 blueprint across multiple facilities worldwide. “Our goal is a globally-distributed, resilient fuel infrastructure network,” Karanjikar states. The repeatable manufacturing protocols and standardised operational procedures create a solid foundation for scaling without compromising quality or efficiency.

Crucially, this model addresses a persistent challenge in the alternative aviation fuel industry: securing enough supply to meet demand while maintaining consistent fuel quality. By enabling multiple plants in diverse geographies, CleanJoule’s strategy mitigates risks linked to supply chain disruptions and regional feedstock shortages.

Advanced fuel formulations

CleanJoule’s innovation isn’t just about scaling production—it’s also about redefining what sustainable aviation fuel can deliver in terms of performance. Their two formulations, CycloSAF and CycloRP, offer markedly different advantages over traditional SAF.

“CycloSAF is 10 percent more energy dense than typical Jet A or Jet A-1,” Karanjikar notes. “This translates into greater range, higher payload capacity, or improved fuel efficiency.” Unlike many alternative aviation fuels limited to 50 percent blending with conventional jet fuel, CycloSAF is designed to be a 100 percent drop-in replacement. “That means no engine modifications are needed, which makes adoption far easier for airlines,” he adds.

CycloRP, meanwhile, targets aerospace applications, particularly rocket propulsion. “It delivers over four percent improvement in energy density compared to conventional kerosene fuels used in liquid rockets,” Karanjikar says. “It also offers superior ultra-cold flow properties, which is critical for space missions.”

Both fuels are produced from abundant biomass, primarily waste agricultural materials, using CleanJoule’s proprietary manufacturing process. This feedstock flexibility and focus on waste not only reduce carbon emissions but also address concerns over land use and food competition that often accompany biofuel production.

“Our process has been successfully proven on 11 different feedstocks,” Karanjikar points out. “This flexibility allows scaling anywhere, tapping into existing agricultural supply chains without requiring new land dedication.” In the U.S., for example, declining ethanol demand frees up billions of bushels of corn, creating abundant feedstock for alternative aviation fuels production by 2030.

Certification, partnerships and readiness

Reaching market scale depends not only on production but also regulatory certification and partnerships. CleanJoule is nearing the end of the ASTM International D4054 qualification process, a key step for commercial approval.

“All required testing for a 10 percent blend of CycloSAF with Jet A has shown that it meets and even improves upon Jet A’s performance,” Karanjikar reports. “We expect qualification by the end of 2025, which will open the door for commercial use.” The CJ1 commissioning validated the facility’s readiness to produce these fuels at industrial scale, aligning technical and economic viability.

Moreover, CleanJoule has already secured significant offtake agreements. “Our airline investors have signed 90 million gallons of offtake from our next facility, CJ2, which is soon to be commissioned,” Karanjikar reveals.

Collaborations extend beyond commercial aviation, with CleanJoule recently powering a rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) using CycloRP in partnership with Venus Aerospace. “This test demonstrated the versatility of our fuels, proving they can power both conventional and advanced propulsion systems without compromising performance,” he explains. This opens opportunities in defence and spaceflight, broadening the impact of sustainable fuels.

Addressing the industry’s challenges

The broader aviation industry is grappling with tightening regulations and aggressive net-zero commitments. Yet many current alternative aviation fuels options face “blend walls” limiting their use to 50 percent blends and suffer from lower energy densities compared to fossil fuels.

CleanJoule aims to overcome these limitations. “Our fuels are designed not just to be cleaner but better-performing,” Karanjikar emphasises. “This allows airlines to meet climate goals without operational trade-offs.” The company’s distributed manufacturing also supports energy independence and supply chain resilience, vital considerations amid geopolitical and market volatility.

He adds, “We see advanced fuels as one of the most practical and immediate ways to reduce emissions across aerospace—from today’s commercial flights to future space missions.” By offering drop-in solutions that require no engine changes, CleanJoule is lowering barriers for industry-wide adoption.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CJ1-2-2-1080x810.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:56:31.502350

At the 2025 IFSA Global EXPO 2025, a panel tackled how airlines can better manage cabin waste in the near term. Titled The Green Shift: Advancing Environmental Stewardship Onboard, the session highlighted the need to link strong operations with a deep commitment to sustainability.

Moderated by Diana Cawley, CEO of the Aviation Sustainability Forum (ASF), the panel featured Tosin Durotoye, innovation strategist at Delta Air Lines; Matrix de Vries, food and product specialist at KLM; and Chris Kinsella, Chief Commercial Officer of gategroup North America. Together, they shared the belief that better data, more innovative product design, and closer collaborations will ultimately mean reaching sustainability goals will become part of daily catering practices.

ASF Outlines the Reason for Acting Now, Not Later

Diana Cawley opened the session with an important warning, explaining that aviation fleets and passenger numbers are on track to more than double by 2050. Without action, the industry’s share of global CO2 emissions could rise from 3 per cent to almost 20 per cent. “The great news is the sector’s growing,” she said. “But with that, the waste is growing.” She continued that while sustainable aviation fuel will help in the long term, the immediate challenge is cabin waste.

“Total sealed beverage waste is 406,000 tons. We are not doing anything with that at the moment.”

– Diana Cawley, ASF

ASF studies this issue through cabin waste audits, using an IATA-approved method that categorizes all items left on aircraft by type. The results show a clear pattern. “What that roughly gives us is about 63 per cent of the waste being beverage and food,” Cawley said. Other contributors include plastics, paper, glass, and aluminium.

Rising passenger numbers are exacerbating the problem. Between 2024 and 2025, ASF tracked an increase from 4.7 to 5.2 billion passengers, which resulted in a rise from 3.6 to 4.0 million tons of cabin waste. “It is growing and growing unless you do something about this,” she stated.

Cawley advised the aviation industry to focus on four key essentials: understanding different regional regulations, developing the ability to reduce and recycle waste, enhancing the quality of their waste data, and linking financial costs to waste and fuel consumption.

She then pointed to the sheer scale of the opportunity: Airlines deplane about 13 billion plastic bottles and nearly 5 million aluminium cans every year. Even unopened items add up. “Total sealed beverage waste is 406,000 tons,” she said. “We are not doing anything with that at the moment.” To address this, Cawley argued, airlines require better data, standardized protocols, and onboard training, along with technology that can consolidate scattered efforts into tangible progress.

“I was able to capture one million drawers coming into our kitchens. That volume of data allows you to make these really confident, data-driven decisions.”

A Shift from Downstream Recycling to Upstream Design

gategroup North America Chief Commercial Officer Chris Kinsella described the caterer’s constraints and opportunities. Policy fragmentation is a daily reality that slows progress. “There’s not a standard global policy around recycling,” he said. “In the North American market, you have varying policies, whether it is country to country, state to state, airport by airport.”

The company’s response begins with fundamentals and progresses with data. Baling cardboard, recovering cooking oil, capturing aluminium, and recycling pallets and shrink wrap remain essential. Composting pilots are running in Edmonton, with more sites targeted in the US.

The larger shift is design. “We need to shift as caterers from the downstream mentality to an upstream mentality,” Kinsella said. As such, gategroup now uses AI and visual insights in dish rooms to learn what is returned, what is consumed, and what goes missing. “Standard cabin waste reports” and a “waste consumption analysis report” now inform menu design and loading. “For the longest time, companies like ours did not have that metric,” he added.

From the airline side, KLM’s Matrix de Vries cited a regulatory breakthrough with immediate results. In 2024, the European Commission clarified the rules for Category 1 waste for inbound flights. “Any product that has not been in contact with food can actually recycle,” she said. That transformed inbound sorting in Amsterdam. “Out of the EU, the waste that comes in from our safety plus destinations, we can actually segregate some of that and send it to a recycling plant instead of sending it to landfill.”

Procurement also supports ethics and cost control when scaled with airline partners. On packaging, a gategroup sister company builds rotables with end-of-life recovery in mind. “Once they degrade, they are collected and then brought back to the factory, where they are ground. Those materials come back into play,” Kinsella said.

“In the North American market, you have varying policies, whether it is country to country, state to state, airport by airport.”

– Chris Kinsella, gategroup North America

KLM Embraces Changing EU Regulations

The impact is tangible. On European flights alone, KLM collects about 80,000 kilograms of plastic wine bottles per year, a figure that rises on long-haul routes. The cost to enable it is modest. “I think the biggest investment that we had to do is training our crew in how to segregate it on the flight,” de Vries said.

The trick is teaching nuance. Crews must understand why inbound sorting to Amsterdam is permitted, while outbound sorting to the United States or other countries is not. Dutch crews have an advantage because sorting by material at home is second nature, but the airline still had to embed consistent procedures, she noted.

KLM’s cabin approach follows a simple mantra: reuse, reduce, recycle. The weight versus service balance is always present, de Vries acknowledged. Pull too much off the aircraft, and the customer may feel the cutback. Load too much and weight, fuel burn, and waste all rise.

The Case for Smart Loading

Delta Air Lines Innovation Strategist Tosin Durotoye argued that airlines cannot fix what they cannot see. “It is very hard to take action if you do not know what to focus on,” she said, highlighting that habit and the cultural urge to never run out can push ratios above real demand.

“You are in the kitchen, dumpster diving,” she said of Delta’s initial manual audits. However, scale arrived with the automation of the process. “I was able to capture one million drawers coming into our kitchens,” Durotoye said. The result was a clear view of preferences. “The volume of data allows you to make these really confident, data-driven decisions.”

That evidence paid off. “We have used technology at Delta Air Lines to save on millions of dollars,” she said, citing portion changes, product swaps, and smarter builds. Large sample sizes also win buy-in. “If I bring in the tech and I say, I looked at a million drawers, they are going to say, okay, tell us what you found.”

Pre-order helps, but it does not solve everything. Durotoye said that international routes benefit most from it, but that the concept of domestic upgrades introduce uncertainty that necessitates ongoing consumption analytics.

Delta reboards sealed beverages when permitted by the rules, while monitoring the fuel penalty associated with hauling unused weight.

“Out of the EU, the waste that comes in from our safety plus destinations, we can actually segregate some of that and send it to a recycling plant instead of sending it to landfill.”

Collaboration is Key to Cabin Waste Reduction Success

Throughout the discussion, collaboration kept surfacing as the essential part for the green shift towards less wasteful cabins. Cawley pointed to common standards that make life easier for everyone, even down to the colors of bags and labeling.

Kinsella asked airlines and caterers to meet upstream on the design choices that predetermine waste, and to use joint data to adjust menus. De Vries argued for international regulators to replicate the European clarity that unlocked meaningful recycling in Amsterdam. Durotoye pushed leaders to champion internal change agents who can introduce new tools and ways of working.

Audience questions reinforced the theme. Regarding composting, Kinsella confirmed the importance of active pilots and care in choosing the right facilities, as not all facilities accept the same inputs, including certain bioplastics. On ethical sourcing and cost, he encouraged airlines and caterers to leverage combined buying power and local procurement options, while still tailoring to each carrier’s brand and budget. “There is a tremendous amount of buying power,” one audience member observed, noting how other sectors have pooled demand to bring down costs for cage-free eggs.

Partnerships with technology providers are also maturing. A vendor who helped count Delta’s drawers asked how to maintain strong airline and caterer relationships. Kinsella asked for speed. “We are dipping our toes into a lot of work that was on a slide deck just about a year or two ago,” he concluded.",https://apex.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Green-shift.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:56:38.738398

Why CO2 Supply Could Tighten Again

Many regions in the U.S. could face similar disruptions in the coming years. The long-term outlook for the availability of beverage grade CO2 remains fragile. The recent North American CO2 SummitOpens in new window in Denver, Colorado, cited decreasing supply and increasing demand. Refinery closings in California and current plans to sequester CO2 from both ethanol production and natural well sources, such as the Jackson DomeOpens in new window, are examples of commercial sources of CO2 that are being removed from the market.

At the same time, there is a growing demand for commercial CO2 from emerging industries such as sustainable aviation fuel and dry ice applications.

“Two of Denmark’s largest airports are to be connected by a flight which will use as much sustainable aviation fuel as possible on each flight,” Transport Minister Thomas Danielsen said in the statement.

“This will hopefully help pave the way for more airlines to use greener fuel in the future,” he said.

The flight will use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel made from sources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, or other sustainable feedstocks.

The fuel type can significantly reduce carbon emissions over its lifecycle compared with conventional fossil-based aviation fuel.

A flight fuelled entirely by sustainable energy, which was the original goal, has not proved possible to achieve because aircraft are currently only permitted to use up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel.

The flight between Aalborg and Copenhagen will use at least 40 percent green fuel until the end of 2027, saving a total of 6,700 tonnes of CO2 during the period.

A new tender covering 2027–2029 is planned, by which time the Transport Ministry hopes the necessary approvals will allow flights to use 100 percent green fuel.

Government funding was set aside in 2023 for the project, which aims for all domestic air travel in Denmark to be fossil-free by 2030.",https://assets.thelocal.com/cdn-cgi/rs:fit:1200/quality:75/plain/https://apiwp.thelocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/watermarks-logo-2025100812285444_1000.jpeg@webp,N,,2025-10-08 13:00:12.741081

Ammonia is one of the world’s ‘big four’ chemical products. It is the main feedstock for nitrogen-based fertilisers and it is also used in refrigeration, explosives, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Its production accounts for about 1.5% of total-energy related emissions and the vast majority is currently made by combining hydrogen with nitrogen in the Haber-Bosch process.

According to the International Energy Agency, ammonia is one of the most emissions-intensive commodities produced by heavy industry, nearly twice as emission intensive as crude steel production and four times as intensive as that of cement on a direct emissions basis,

To fully decarbonise its production, companies are also exploring green ammonia. However this comes with its own challenges including high production costs, infrastructure gaps, and a lack of economic incentives.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/shutterstock_2297911471.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 11:57:16.008273

Pune, Maharashtra, India – Business Wire India

Aemetis Inc. (NASDAQ: AMTX) is advancing decarbonization at its 65 million gallon-per-year ethanol plant in Keyes, California, with a $30 million energy efficiency upgrade with integration of a Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) system. Praj Industries (NSE: PRAJIND, BSE: 522205) is supplying the advanced low-carbon solution and equipment that form the key components of this system. Project execution and implementation are being carried out by NPL Construction Co., a subsidiary of Centuri Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: CTRI).

The Aemetis Advanced Fuels Keyes facility has been operating since 2011, utilizing Praj’s ethanol technology, and has consistently delivered reliable performance while contributing to California’s low-carbon fuel standard and U.S. energy security.

The project has received approximately $19.7 million in grants and tax credits from California Energy Commission, and Pacific Gas & Electric, and IRA 45Z tax credits.

Project completion is scheduled for Q2 2026, and once operational, the solution is projected to:

• Reduce natural gas usage at the Keyes plant by approximately 80%

• Generate an estimated $32 million of incremental annual cash flow from energy savings

• Deliver a double-digit reduction in the carbon intensity of the plant’s fuel ethanol, increasing LCFS credits

• Expand eligibility for transferable Section 45Z production tax credits

This investment marks a significant step forward in Aemetis’ decarbonization strategy, complementing its Dairy Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) program and recently approved CARB LCFS pathways.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Chairman of Praj Industries, said:

“Praj has been a trusted technology partner to Aemetis for more than a decade at this facility. The deployment of advanced low-carbon solution marks the next step in lowering the carbon intensity of ethanol while driving greater efficiency and profitability. Together with Aemetis and Centuri, we are enabling meaningful progress in the U.S. energy transition.”

Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis, said:

“This MVR project represents a high-return, high-impact upgrade to our California ethanol facility. By working with Centuri’s EPC team and Praj’s proven technology, we expect to materially improve operating margins, strengthen cash flow, and capture the benefits of Section 45Z tax credits while advancing our commitment to delivering lower-carbon renewable fuels.”

Dylan Hradek, President of U.S. Gas at Centuri, said:

“We are proud to expand our collaboration with Aemetis and Praj on this strategic energy efficiency project. Centuri’s construction expertise and commitment to sustainability align perfectly with California’s clean energy goals, and we look forward to delivering the infrastructure that enables a more sustainable future.”

The MVR system strengthens Aemetis’ ethanol operations by combining energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and margin expansion, while capturing value from favorable regulatory frameworks, including rising LCFS credit prices, Section 45Z incentives, and the adoption of E15 gasoline blends in California.

With a presence in the Americas for more than 30 years, Praj continues to be the decarbonization partner of choice for renewable energy companies seeking proven solutions.

But without clear targets for each individual sector, sustainability-focused investors may instead send their money along paths with less resistance, meaning agriculture misses out.

Several nascent avenues of investment present themselves in Australia’s Agriculture and Land Sector Plan, which is one of six sector plans released in conjunction with the larger Net Zero Plan.

The Net Zero Plan was released to coincide with Australia’s updated commitment to the United Nations to reduce national emissions by 62-70 percent below 2005 levels by 2035.

The land sector plan includes a push to bolster carbon and biodiversity projects, developments which are already gaining traction under the management of investors like Cibus Capital and Silva Capital.

Such projects stand to gain further regulatory support through an Integrated Farm and Land Management method that allows for stacking of multiple carbon activities on one property, without the need to register multiple projects.

The government also expects its reformed Safeguard Mechanism – a policy requiring high-emitting facilities to reduce their net emissions by buying carbon credits – to drive more demand for carbon credits from private buyers.

Plantation forestry is also set for a boost with the government providing about A$74 million in grant funding for new long-rotation softwood and hardwood forests.

Finally, the government’s announcement of a A$1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels program to support domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels should mean savings on transport for canola producers who currently send most of their crops overseas for processing.

It should also lead to more demand for the crop – if Australia introduces a sustainable aviation fuel mandate to catalyze production.

While these initiatives may drive more investment into agriculture and land, and contribute a measure of emissions reduction across the sector, they lack the underpinning of an explicit target.

The sector plan states: “This plan is not setting an emissions reduction target, although many businesses and industry groups are setting their own emissions reduction goals.”

Instead, the plan presents a Treasury-modelled baseline scenario, which sees agriculture emissions fall by 28 percent from 2025 to 2050 even as agricultural production increases by 32 percent.

The model predicts carbon removals through land sequestration will increase by 126 percent over the same period.

According to the model, agriculture will have residual emissions of about 62Mt CO2-e in 2050, contributing about 37 percent of economy-wide emissions – up from 19.6 percent as of 2024.

The model posits that the increase in land sequestration will balance out those residual emissions.

In the absence of a target for emissions reduction, investors could look to the baseline scenario for a direction of travel. However, a target would serve better.

Just look at the electricity sector, which in 2022 received a target to reach 82 percent renewable generation by 2030. It has since benefited from policy like the Capacity Investment Scheme, which is rolling out 40GW worth of renewable generation and dispatch projects to deliver this target.

Private investors are piling in, as affiliate title Infrastructure Investor reports. Agriculture investors would benefit from similar calls to action. These could include targets for carbon sequestration, farm machinery running on clean energy, or reduced methane emissions from livestock by modifying diet, for example.

Of course, targets should be set in collaboration with the industry they are serving, to ensure support and traction for them. But by shying away from target-setting altogether, the government removes what could be a major catalyst for large-scale investment.",https://media.agriinvestor.com/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1326286821.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 00:56:12.607177
