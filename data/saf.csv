This blog is one of a series that illustrates how climate change relates to policy areas covered by subject committees. The accompanying blog, The climate jigsaw part one: the general framework of devolution and climate change, provides an overview of the general division between devolved and reserved powers and responsibilities for the matters relevant to tackling climate change.

This blog covers some of the most significant sectors where action is needed to achieve emission reduction targets, providing an outline of how far these are governed by devolved or reserved powers. The similar complexities in the division of responsibilities for what is needed to provide effective adaptation to climate change are not discussed here and the aim is to give an overview of the general picture, not a comprehensive or fully detailed account.

These blogs have been produced by Professor Colin Reid, Emeritus Professor of Environmental Law, University of Dundee and current Adviser on environmental standards and regulation in a post-Brexit context to the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee, with contributions from the relevant SPICe researchers. As with all guest blogs, what follows are the views of the author and not those of SPICe, or of the Scottish Parliament.

Energy and electricity

Energy matters are notoriously complex from a devolution perspective, with a mix of powers that are reserved (e.g. offshore oil and gas) and devolved (most planning matters), areas where the two combine (e.g. planning controls (devolved) over potential sites for nuclear activity (reserved)) and topics within reserved matters where powers have been delegated to Scottish Ministers (e.g. consent for many individual projects under the Electricity Act 1989). The overall structure of the energy markets for suppliers and consumers, a significant factor for both energy projects and fuel poverty, is in the hands of the UK authorities.

The position has been summarised by the Scottish Ministers as:

“Certain aspects, such as energy efficiency and fuel poverty initiatives, and our positions with respect to granting consent and planning permission for nuclear power and unconventional oil and gas, are matters for the Scottish Government and Parliament, while others – such as market support for different forms of power generation, and regulation of the gas and electricity grids – are reserved to the UK Government.”

On many issues such as the expansion of electricity generation from renewables and the development of hydrogen systems the Scottish Government’s ambition is higher than that of the UK Government.

Marine projects are significant for energy supplies from both renewable and fossil fuel sources. Any subject-based reserved/devolved division still applies but the general position is that the UK Parliament legislates for Scotland’s offshore waters (i.e. more than 12 nautical miles from the shore or baseline), although certain matters in this area not involving oil and gas, defence or pollution from ships have been devolved. Marine planning matters in Scotland’s inshore waters (up to 12 nautical miles from the shore or baseline) are governed by the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, an Act of the Scottish Parliament, and in its offshore waters by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, an Act of the UK Parliament.

Electricity

Electricity is a reserved matter, including control of the grid and the structure of the electricity market and consumer pricing controls. Nevertheless, the UK Government has delegated power to issue consents for onshore generating projects and transmission lines to planning authorities (under 50 megawatts) and the Scottish Ministers (over 50 megawatts). Changes to the current approval procedures for infrastructure projects and related matters are included in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill currently being considered at Westminster.

Oil and Gas

The licensing and consent arrangements for oil and gas projects and pipelines are primarily reserved. Standards for the gas grid are also a reserved matter. The main powers over offshore developments lie with UK authorities, although elements of the land-based infrastructure are subject to devolved requirements for planning permission and environmental authorisations. The Scottish Government has devolved powers over onshore oil and gas (both conventional and unconventional) and the National Planning Framework 4 states that: “Development proposals that seek to explore, develop, and produce fossil fuels (excluding unconventional oil and gas) will not be supported other than in exceptional circumstances” and that “The Scottish Government does not support the development of unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.”

Nuclear

The regulation of nuclear power is a matter reserved for the UK Government, but since planning permission for any sites falls under devolved control, the Scottish Ministers have a de facto veto over any new developments and their current policy is against the development of any new nuclear stations. Environmental controls likewise fall under devolved authority.

Hydrogen

In the Draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan the Scottish Government states that its plans “to accelerate the hydrogen economy in Scotland will require the Scottish Government and its agencies, working with industry and with the UK Government, to apply both devolved and reserved powers in alignment.” As with other energy sources, most of the direct regulatory controls on standards, network regulations etc. fall under reserved powers, but planning controls and elements of financial support are in the hands of devolved authorities, with the Hydrogen Action Plan noting the need for Scottish and UK Governments to work together.

Buildings

Energy Efficiency

Regulation of Energy Performance Certificates for residential and commercial buildings is devolved and proposals have been made for reforms in the near future, providing more information on energy efficiency and heating costs. It is envisaged, however, that aspects of this work will progress in line with developments south of the border, e.g. producing a Home Energy Model (HEM) calculation methodology and a new register that can interface with the UK Government’s systems.

New Buildings

Planning and building standards are matters mostly decided in Scotland. Most individual planning decisions are in the hands of local authorities, but Scottish Ministers can exercise considerable control through the National Planning Framework and their appeal and call-in powers. In terms of the construction process, the UK Government’s control over health and safety and product standards may be relevant at times, as is the fixed-term VAT relief for energy-saving supplies and works.

Heating

Heating of buildings is a major contributor to climate emissions and largely within Scottish Ministers’ control. There are already rules preventing the use in new buildings of heating systems producing high levels of emissions but more far-reaching plans for the Heat in Buildings Bill to ensure the presence of low-carbon heating systems when the ownership of existing buildings changes have been put on hold because of concerns over their effect on tackling fuel poverty. The Bill announced in the Programme for Government 2025-26 will set targets for installing clean heating systems by 2045.

There are some critical pieces of the heat decarbonisation puzzle which are not under the control of the Scottish Government, with the main stated obstacle to the initial proposals for the Heat in Buildings Bill being the economics of low carbon heat. As noted above, the design of the electricity and gas markets is controlled by the UK Government and GB-wide regulators, whilst the United Kingdom Internal Market Act may affect the effectiveness of any restrictions on the supply of particular sorts of heating equipment. In the recent statement to Parliament from the Acting Minister for Climate Action, on the Heat in Buildings Bill, ‘clarity on the future of the gas grid’, the ‘rebalancing of policy costs between gas and electricity’ and ‘reform of the electricity market’ were identified as three, crucial, reserved policy areas.

Heat networks

Legislation has been passed by the Scottish Parliament to establish a framework for regulating and encouraging heat networks, but this has to operate in conjunction with UK legislation.

Transport

Traffic and demand management

Road traffic is a major contributor to greenhouses gas emissions; domestic transport accounts for 28% of Scotland’s domestic emissions. The UK Government is in control of several key levers in relation to emissions from traffic, including fuel duty, vehicle excise duty, construction and use standards for vehicles and the rules limiting the future sales of petrol and diesel vehicles. Nevertheless, a wide range of tools to influence traffic and the demand between modes of transport is available in Scotland, although often requiring collaboration between the Scottish Government and local authorities. Support for public transport (e.g. concessionary travel on buses for various groups and the removal of peak fares on ScotRail services) shows how funding can be deployed to influence the demand for public transport.

The devolved planning system has a major part to play in reducing travel demand (e.g. the idea of 20-minute neighbourhoods) as does the location of health and educational services. More direct measures such as road pricing and the Workplace Parking Licensing schemes are available but have not been used to date. Scottish Ministers are responsible for national speed limits, and through Transport Scotland, for setting speed limits on individual trunk roads. Local authorities are responsible for setting speed limits on public roads within their area.

Electric vehicles

The construction and use standards for vehicles and the requirements for an increasing proportion of new vehicles to be electric are in the hands of UK authorities. Nevertheless, many of the planning, building standards and other controls relevant to the development of an effective network of charging points, a key factor in encouraging drivers to switch, are devolved and could be deployed to speed the enhancement of the network. The same applies for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Railways

ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper are, through Scottish Rail Holdings, owned and financially supported by Scottish Ministers. The strategic direction of Network Rail in Scotland is set and funded by Scottish Ministers through the ‘periodic review’ process. The UK Government is responsible for all daytime cross border passenger rail operators and retains control of rail related legislation. This is being updated to bring all British passenger railway operators into public ownership and to establish Great British Railways, which will own Britain’s mainline rail infrastructure and act as ‘a single guiding mind’ for the railway. The experiment with the abolition of peak-time fares shows how financial support can be used directly to promote lower carbon travel.

Aviation

The devolution of Air Departure Tax gives the Scottish Government a tool to influence demand for air travel (although of limited power given the risk of simply diverting traffic to English airports). At present, though, Scotland continues to participate in the GB-wide Air Passenger Duty system, due to concerns about the continuation under any new system of the current opt-out for services using Highlands and Islands Airports. Key developments on sustainable aviation fuel and the approval of aircraft design are subject to reserved powers and international coordination.

Shipping

The Scottish Government has effective control over Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles ferry service contracts within Scotland and has wide powers over ports, with plans in place to procure zero or lower emission vessels on these routes in the coming years. However, an industry-wide move towards low emissions vessels depends on international standards and the availability of suitable refuelling infrastructure at ports beyond Scotland and ultimately on the decisions of largely multinational shipping corporations. Even within Scotland, grid and fuel storage issues may affect refuelling possibilities.

Industry

Direct environmental controls on emissions fall largely within the scope of devolved power (in future falling under the Environmental Authorisations Regulations), but the regulation of important sectors such as chemicals is more complicated. Some matters such as product standards are largely reserved and for other areas, such as the regulation of chemicals under UK REACH, co-ordination across the UK is required, including to meet international obligations (e.g. the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants).

Emissions reporting

Whereas the obligations on the public sector to report on their emissions and other activities relevant to climate change are determined by Scottish legislation, reporting by private companies falls within the reserved area of business associations and thus is governed by UK legislation.

Waste and circular economy

Waste management activities are regulated under Scottish provisions (scheduled to become integrated into the Environmental Authorisations Regulations), with planning controls on waste sites also being significant. The Circular Economy (Scotland) Act 2024 requires a strategy and targets in building towards a circular economy, but many of the powers, e.g. in relation to the disposal of unsold consumer goods, raise questions over the interaction with the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020.

Landfill and incineration

Planning and regulatory controls for landfill and incineration are devolved, with a ban on the landfill of municipal biodegradable waste due to take effect (after several delays) at the start of 2026; the possibility of extending this to other sources of waste is under consideration. The role of incineration is affected by developments at UK level in relation to its inclusion within the UK Emissions Trading Scheme and support for, and treatment of, carbon capture, utilisation and storage at waste to energy plants. The Landfill Tax is now a devolved tax but any significant divergence in the tax rates from those south of the border risks encouraging environmentally undesirable cross-border “waste tourism”, with waste being transported across the border to benefit from lower rates on its disposal.

Recycling

Although matters such as local collections and waste management are governed under Scottish powers, including the imposition of charges on single-use items, key elements such as the design and sale of products, e.g. banning single-use items or imposing requirements to make them easy to recycle, are largely affected by UK powers or the practical effects of the single market across the UK. Product design and trade descriptions are reserved whilst the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 plays a major role in limiting the practical effectiveness of Scotland-only measures unless an exemption is agreed allowing divergence.

Initiatives have been able to progress either with special rules (e.g. for single-use plastics pending broad alignment across Great Britain) or through inter-governmental co-ordination (e.g. for single-use vapes), whilst the prolonged history of the deposit and return scheme for drinks containers highlights the complexities involved. Extended producer responsibility for products and packaging is an area largely of shared responsibility, with the power to legislate being in the hands of both Scottish Ministers and the UK Secretary of State (with the consent of Scottish Ministers).

Agriculture, forestry and land use

Most aspects of agriculture, forestry and land-use fall within devolved powers. Nevertheless, attempts to attract large-scale investment in natural capital projects (e.g. peatland restoration) and establish carbon markets based on land-uses are affected by the fact that many of the legal and financial vehicles for such investment are shaped by the reserved powers on financial services, markets and pension schemes.

Agriculture

The Scottish Government is working towards its vision for agriculture. As part of this, the Agriculture and Rural Communities (Scotland) Act 2024 will facilitate the move from Common Agricultural Policy style payments, to a four-tier payment structure. The aims of the Act include sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices, on-farm nature restoration, climate mitigation and adaptation amongst others.

The shape and extent of the changes to financial support for agriculture are gradually becoming clearer as part of the Scottish Government’s Agricultural Reform Route Map. These changes represent a more gradual transition away from the EU frameworks than in England. However, Scottish policies must operate within the limits of national and international subsidy controls and in the context of wider market conditions, which are affected by policy in other parts of the UK and potentially by the terms of international trade agreements made by the UK Government.

Forestry

Forestry is a devolved matter, overseen by Scottish Forestry and Forestry and Land Scotland, with the latter managing the substantial area of forestry in public ownership. The relevant regulatory powers (including the existing and forthcoming controls on deer numbers which affect the establishment of woodland in many areas) are in the hands of Scottish authorities, although forestry standards are endorsed by all the governments across the UK.

The Scottish authorities have considerable ability to devote financial support to forestry, although some measures with international aspects, e.g. import controls aimed at preventing the arrival of non-native pests and diseases, are a shared responsibility. The UK role in the regulation of financial markets and taxes is significant for the range of investment vehicles that can make the long-term investment in forestry attractive.

Peatland restoration

The capacity of healthy peatlands to capture and store carbon, and the emissions from degraded peatland, are significant factors in reaching Net Zero. The relevant regulatory powers are in the hands of Scottish Ministers (e.g. controls on muirburn). Finance has been allocated towards peatland restoration, but progress has not been as fast as hoped, for reasons linked to both the uptake of various schemes and capacity to implement them, including skills to undertake the necessary work. Despite being proposed by UK and Scottish governments several years ago, a ban on the sale of horticultural peat has not yet been introduced, with Internal Market implications being a consideration.

Biodiversity

Healthy natural habitats play a part in ensuring carbon storage and resilience in the face of climate threats. The relevant powers in relation to the designation and protection of specific sites for biodiversity are devolved as are those in relation to many of the main drivers of both degradation and restoration (e.g. development, agriculture, forestry).

Emissions trading

Many significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions are subject to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (estimated at 28% of emissions in Scotland), requiring operators to acquire allowances that match the volume of emissions produced. The detailed rules are made by the UK Government, subject to consultation with Scottish Ministers. The success of this scheme in encouraging operators to reduce their emissions will have a major impact on the contribution that these operators make to overall emissions and hence what has to be achieved in other sectors to reach Net Zero overall. The recent UK-EU summit has proposed further work on linking the UK and EU Emissions Trading Schemes.

Negative Emissions Technologies

Since some greenhouse gas emissions are inevitable for the foreseeable future (often falling into the “hard to abate” category in climate reporting), in order to achieve Net Zero there will have to be actions taken to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Much of the contribution here can be expected to come from changes to land use (discussed above), with forestry, grassland and peatland already contributing as carbon sinks, but there is also scope for more direct approaches. Industrial plants aiming to make use of carbon capture and the proposed Acorn carbon transport and storage project, will be subject to devolved controls on planning and industrial emissions.

Although there is a desire to push ahead with such carbon capture, utilisation and storage projects, notably the Acorn project, the Scottish Government cannot proceed alone. The intellectual property, corporate taxation, elements of financial support and any offshore consents (e.g. where underground storage making use of exhausted offshore oil and gas reservoirs is contemplated) are all reserved matters. Developments may also be affected by the availability of significant financial support from the UK Government (under the “Track-2 process”).

Just Transition

The desire to seek a Just Transition towards Net Zero and away from industries dependent on fossil fuels engages governmental actions across the devolved/reserved boundary and financial commitments that likewise fall within Scottish and UK budgets. The Scottish Government is more advanced than other parts of the UK in its Just Transition thinking, with a draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan and the activities of the Just Transition Commission, and the lack of equivalent high-level work in other parts of the UK can be viewed as a hindrance. Actions within devolved power which have been claimed as supporting the Just Transition include wider policy initiatives on energy and buildings; support for reskilling; concessionary bus travel; progress on heat policy; agricultural support measures; and partnerships to assist with the consequences of closures at Grangemouth.

The United States is preparing to object to a recommendation by a United Nations aviation body, citing concerns that it would unfairly benefit Brazilian corn ethanol producers.

The issue centres around criteria developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) technical panel for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which the U.S. believes may put American farmers at a disadvantage.

Global airlines are under pressure to replace fossil fuels with low-emission alternatives, such as SAF, to meet net zero targets by 2050. However, these fuels currently make up less than 1% of jet fuel use.

The International Air Transport Association estimates the transition could cost the industry around $4.7 trillion.

The U.S. claims the recommendation favours Brazil by awarding a lower carbon score to multicropping—growing more than one crop on the same land—a method common in Brazil.

With corn production exceeding domestic demand, U.S. ethanol producers are pushing to reduce emissions by using technologies like carbon capture to compete in the growing green fuel market.

The Iowa Corn Growers Association has warned that Brazil’s ethanol already carries a lower carbon score than U.S. corn ethanol, potentially giving Brazilian exporters an edge in meeting international SAF standards.

The ICAO Council, comprising 36 members, will review the proposal ahead of the UN agency’s major assembly later this year. While ICAO does not set binding rules, its standards often guide national policies.

“Any attempt at political interference would undermine not only the decision-making process, but also the international community’s confidence in the sustainable aviation fuels certification system,” said Bruno Alves of Brazil’s UNEM.

The U.S. State Department has raised concerns but declined public comment. Brazil’s agriculture ministry also did not respond.

Marathon Petroleum, one of the largest US independent refiners, is spending millions to increase jet fuel capacity at its 253,000 b/d Robinson refinery in Illinois. The project will increase the refinery's flexibility to optimise jet output to meet growing demand, chief executive Maryann Mannen says. The company plans to spend $150mn on the project this year and another $50mn in 2026. Marathon would not disclose the planned jet capacity at the refinery but says the project will be ready by the end of 2026.

Another independent refiner, CVR Energy, is increasing jet capacity at its Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery. The company is installing piping and revamping storage tanks at the 132,000 b/d facility to enable 9,000 b/d of jet output by the end of the third quarter, chief executive David Lamp says. Jet production is not subject to a Renewable Volume Obligation, which means that CVR would not need to blend biofuels into it or purchase renewable identification number (RIN) credits as it would if producing diesel. Shifting production from diesel to jet will reduce CVR's annual RINs requirements, Lamp says.

At the same time, the opportunity to sell products to markets further west, where two major refineries are set to close, will continue to grow over the next few years, with jet being an important part of the mix, he says. Phillips 66 plans to shut its 139,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery by October, while independent Valero aims to close or repurpose its 145,000 b/d Benicia, California, refinery by April 2026. CVR has the capability to move products from the midcontinent to California but would need to weigh the potential benefits against the political, regulatory and cost environment in the state and, as a result, may favour other locations, it tells Argus. CVR at present produces jet at its 74,500 b/d Wynnewood, Oklahoma, refinery, shipping it primarily by truck or pipeline to midcontinent locations, but it can also move jet by rail.

Another independent, Delek, has upgraded its 83,000 b/d El Dorado, Arkansas, refinery to produce jet as part of a plan to boost profitability. The company did not disclose how much jet the refinery can produce.

The investments come after US refineries produced a record share of jet in 2024, reflecting higher demand relative to other transport fuels, according to the EIA. The EIA in its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts that US jet demand will average 1.71mn b/d in 2025 and 1.73mn b/d in 2026, up from 1.7mn b/d last year. But US airlines are signalling an uncertain outlook for jet demand, with most withdrawing full-year 2025 financial guidance when reporting first-quarter earnings, as President Donald Trump's evolving tariff plans have made it difficult to predict how travel activity will develop.

SAF conduct

Refiners nevertheless appear bullish on aviation fuels, including renewables. Specialty refiner Calumet will expand sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) output at its Montana plant sooner than expected — reaching 120mn-150mn USG/yr by the second quarter of 2026, with plans to boost capacity to 300mn USG/yr by 2028.

SAF margins have remained ""stable and attractive"", as the introduction of national mandates around the world compliment an already growing base of voluntary demand, chief executive Todd Borgmann says.

US independent Par Pacific's planned $90mn renewable fuels facility at its 94,000 b/d Kapolei, Hawaii, refinery, is near completion. The project will produce SAF and other products, and is expected to start up in the second half of 2025.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-06-23 09:01:22.260510

It is also focused on turning the country into a global clean energy and climate champion, driving the energy transition and opening up markets for British clean energy and low-carbon goods and services.
Part of its role is to identify critical changes needed to diversify clean energy supply chains, including driving investment and addressing bottlenecks.
These are just a selection of a wider range of measures to be introduced under the strategy to further support UK clean energy growth.
“After years of delay, the government has stepped up with a serious industrial strategy that backs clean energy and our industrial heartlands.","The government believes that electric technologies can be much more efficient than fossil fuels, while also reducing the need for fossil fuel imports, which in turn will also make the country more resilient to supply and price volatility on international energy markets. The government’s Invest 2035 consultation found that energy prices and grid connection delays are competitive industrial activity and increased electrification, while the prevalence of gas in the energy mix makes it harder for businesses to plan and invest.

To resolve this situation, the government is offering price relief through its British Industry Supercharger for the most energy intensive businesses and resolving grid connection challenges for energy generation and demand projects.

The Clean Energy Superpower Mission entails a long-term plan to increase energy security and reduce electricity bills by investing in clean energy and improving UK connections to the EU energy market.

Sector Plans will set out how sectors can work in partnership with the government to exploit growth opportunities, for example by scaling net zero transport through battery innovation and EV manufacturing, production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), embedding sustainability across the economy by supporting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), investing in creative industries that are investing in net zero – such as Liverpool’s innovative MusicFutures R&D Cluster and introducing smart data reforms to enable data-driven innovation.

The government is planning to use smart technology to boost grid flexibility thus further adapting the grid to the influx of more renewable energy, while also making the grid more resilient and driving down costs. It is also focused on turning the country into a global clean energy and climate champion, driving the energy transition and opening up markets for British clean energy and low-carbon goods and services.

The UK is leading the Global Clean Power Alliance, a forum that aims to address supply chain challenges. Part of its role is to identify critical changes needed to diversify clean energy supply chains, including driving investment and addressing bottlenecks.

The UK is already working with Japan, since March this year, in an Industrial Strategy Partnership focused on collaboration in offshore wind.

Great British Energy (GBE) will work with the National Wealth Fund to provide strong development and finance support as developer and bank, with an initial £300 million already identified for investment into domestic offshore wind supply.

A new Workforce Strategy will be published by the Office for Clean Energy Jobs this year, utilising Britain’s existing energy workforce to create more good jobs across the country. A new regional skills pilot in Clean Energy Industries in Aberdeen will fund skills support.

The strategy is particularly focused on onshore wind and fixed bottom and floating offshore wind, carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and heat pumps. The government’s interventions, to this end, will include a new £1 billion Clean Energy Supply Chain Fund, under the direction of Great British Energy (GBE), particularly focused on offshore wind supply chains, and a £544 million Clean Industry Bonus for offshore wind developers. The government has also confirmed £13.2 billion of funding for its Warm Homes Plan and it will shortly launch a further round of the Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition, which provides grants to manufacturers investing in new heat pump capacity.

These are just a selection of a wider range of measures to be introduced under the strategy to further support UK clean energy growth. You can view the full Industrial Strategy document here.

“This is a landmark moment” said Laith Whitwham, Senior Policy Advisor at the climate think tank E3G. “After years of delay, the government has stepped up with a serious industrial strategy that backs clean energy and our industrial heartlands. This strategy cuts the sky-high electricity prices driven by gas dependency and gives British industry the shot in the arm it needs to lead the charge to a clean economy.”

“As a UK manufacturer at the heart of the electricity supply chain, it’s a huge confidence boost to see a firm commitment to strengthening the sector that keeps the country powered” added Jon Hiscock, CEO of UK electrical equipment manufacturer Fundamentals. “This is a vital industry, central to economic growth, energy security and decarbonisation. We’re encouraged by the roll out of the Connections Accelerator Service. Speeding up grid access for strategically important projects is exactly what our industry needs to drive innovation and modernise the grid. However the UK's ageing electricity network was never designed to handle the kind of power flows that come from decarbonisation. Turning ambition into delivery will be the real test. We’re also optimistic about the direction of wider electricity‑market reforms, including a final decision on zonal pricing. This could be a promising step toward smarter, fairer power markets. And the Growth & Skills Levy is a smart move. It’s how we turn ambition into the practical skills industry desperately needs. What will make this a success is ensuring these opportunities reach every young person and help fill critical gaps in engineering and the clean energy economy.”

Built by Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL), the clean-energy arm of Adani Enterprises, this 5 MW facility is fully powered by solar energy and incorporates an integrated Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), enabling entirely off-grid operation.

At the heart of the plant is a fully automated, closed-loop electrolyser system engineered to dynamically adjust to fluctuating renewable energy inputs. This capability enhances operational flexibility and efficiency, while maintaining top safety and performance standards.

This kind of real-time responsiveness marks a new era in decentralised hydrogen production, especially valuable in areas where grid power is unreliable or unavailable.

Adani describes the facility as a milestone in India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, setting a benchmark for clean-tech in emissions-intensive industries like fertilisers, refining, and heavy transport.

As a proof-of-concept ahead of the proposed larger Green Hydrogen Hub at Mundra, this plant showcases the group’s ambition to scale hydrogen production and derivatives—such as green ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel—both domestically and for export.

Hydrogen produced via electrolysis using renewable energy—so-called ""green hydrogen""—combines environmental benefits with water-vapour-only emissions at the point of use. This contrasts starkly with grey hydrogen, which is derived from fossil fuels and noxious emissions.

The United States is expected to oppose a UN aviation council recommendation that it says gives an unfair carbon rating advantage to Brazilian corn ethanol over American alternatives.

The debate focuses on rules proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for certifying Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a cleaner jet fuel alternative.

Airlines worldwide are being pushed to adopt SAF to meet net zero emissions goals by 2050. These fuels, made from waste or renewable materials like cooking oil or corn, currently represent less than 1% of total jet fuel use.

The U.S. argues that Brazil’s common practice of multicropping—growing crops like corn and soy on the same land—would be rewarded with lower carbon scores under ICAO’s proposed guidelines.

In contrast, U.S. ethanol producers, particularly in the Midwest, are investing in carbon capture to improve sustainability.

The Iowa Corn Growers Association has voiced concern, noting that Brazil already enjoys a better carbon rating, which may harm U.S. market access in green fuel markets. Brazil’s corn ethanol production is expected to nearly double to 16 billion litres by 2032.

ICAO’s council, which includes 36 nations, will review the SAF certification proposal ahead of its fall assembly. While ICAO’s guidelines are not legally binding, they influence national decisions.

Bruno Alves, director at Brazil’s UNEM, responded to the dispute by saying, “Any attempt at political interference would undermine not only the decision-making process, but also the international community’s confidence in the sustainable aviation fuels certification system.”

The U.S. State Department raised objections in March but has not issued further public statements. Brazil’s agriculture ministry has not responded. The discussions may yet lead to a compromise, according to sources.",,N,,2025-06-23 09:01:34.727613

ACI EUROPE urges the EU to reset aviation policy, warning of competitiveness decline and major risks to decarbonisation progress.

Speaking at ACI EUROPE’s 35th Annual Congress, Armando Brunini, ACI EUROPE President and CEO of SEA Milan Airports, issued a stark warning about the EU aviation sector’s declining competitiveness and its ability to meet decarbonisation targets. Highlighting the need for a comprehensive aviation policy reset, Brunini criticised the EU’s current approach, urging immediate action to align aviation with the bloc’s broader Competitiveness Compass and Roadmap.

Four key challenges to aviation competitiveness and decarbonisation

Brunini identified four major challenges undermining the sector:

Unbalanced climate policy:

He reaffirmed the sector’s commitment to decarbonisation, stating, “Our commitment to decarbonisation remains unwavering… But if we need the sticks… we also need the carrots.” He called for financial support and flexibility to manage the €1.3 trillion investment required to reach net zero, warning that no other global region imposes similar costs on aviation.

Punitive taxation:

Brunini criticised ongoing aviation taxes imposed by EU member states and the UK, pointing out that revenues are not reinvested in decarbonisation efforts. He noted a direct link between aviation taxes and reduced air connectivity, describing Europe as “an exception” globally.

Airport capacity constraints:

Europe already hosts half of the world’s most congested airports, yet governments are hesitant to support capacity expansion. Brunini warned this reluctance limits economic development opportunities, while global competitors are actively increasing capacity.

Regulatory barriers to innovation:

He argued that excessive EU regulation hinders airport innovation in security, safety, and the passenger experience, further weakening the region’s competitiveness.

Call for a new EU Aviation Strategy

Brunini stressed that the absence of a cohesive EU aviation strategy places the sector at risk of becoming “the next automotive sector” due to policy-driven decline. “It is difficult to understand why the European Commission is de facto sidelining our sector while actively working on a maritime strategy, a rail strategy and a tourism strategy,” he stated.

Putting aviation back on track

To futureproof the sector, Brunini outlined several key recommendations:

Prioritise capacity development:

He called for urgent revision of the outdated EU Airport Slot Regulation, strict enforcement of the EU Noise Balanced Approach, and changes to the European Investment Bank’s Climate Bank Roadmap to enable funding for airport capacity expansion. Brunini also highlighted the need for regulatory stability, especially around airport charges, to support long-term investments.

Support for SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel):

The forthcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan must include funding mechanisms for SAF, including earmarked ETS proceeds, post-2030 allowances, and financial institution backing. “Such inclusion will clearly condition our ability to deliver on our net zero Destination 2050 roadmap,” Brunini stated.

Sustain regional air connectivity:

He urged continued operating aid for smaller airports beyond 2027 to preserve regional cohesion under the EU State aid Guidelines.

Promote innovation and resilience:

Brunini emphasised the importance of ongoing support for SESAR R&D and deployment to enhance airport capacity and performance. He also called for a unified EU testing and certification framework for aviation security equipment and simplified procedures to support green technology rollouts.

Brunini concluded with a clear message: the EU must act swiftly to reset its aviation policy. Without this, Europe risks eroding not only the aviation sector’s competitiveness but also its own global standing and economic resilience.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2194199535-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 09:01:43.027878

*******************************************************************

​Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at Greenway 2025 - Accelerating Changes today (June 23):

Your Excellency Ambassador Harvey Rouse (Ambassador and Head of Office of the European Union to Hong Kong), Mr Iñaki Amate (Chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong), consuls-general, heads of chambers, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you, once again, at the Greenway forum, the fourth edition, this year under the theme of ""Accelerating Changes"". And, as before, it's organised by the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao, and the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.

The European Union (EU) has long been one of Hong Kong's long-standing business partners. Hong Kong takes pride in being home to 1 640 EU (European Union) companies, which makes the EU the largest foreign business community in Hong Kong. Thank you and welcome indeed.

Alongside business, we come together in so many others areas of mutual interest, from education and cultural exchange to innovation and technology pursuits. And, yes, to the environment - to global warming and all the complexities it entails.

Because climate change affects us all, it must involve us all. Each and every one of us.

The World Meteorological Organization's latest report, published last month, notes that there is a 70 per cent chance that the five-year average warming, for 2025 to 2029, will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. That's up significantly from the 47 per cent chance forecast in its report last year. So from a 47 per cent chance the forecast jumped to 70 per cent.

Allow me, for the next few minutes, to tell you what Hong Kong is doing to work against the universal threat of climate change, and to achieve climate neutrality.

Since Hong Kong reached its carbon peak, in 2014, our carbon emissions have dropped by about a quarter. In 2023, our per capita carbon emissions were about 4.58 tonnes. To put that in perspective, it is 60 per cent of the EU's emissions, so we aren't doing too badly, and only one quarter of that of the United States.

Hong Kong is well on its way to cutting its carbon emissions in half by 2035, achieving carbon neutrality before 2050, which is our stated goal.

Last week, we welcomed the news that Hong Kong is once again one of the world's top three most-competitive economies. We are dedicated to decarbonising this international financial, shipping and trade centre while keeping up with our competitiveness. And we do that by engineering green transformation through innovation.

Hong Kong's prowess in financial services places us, favourably, in becoming Asia's premier hub for green and sustainable finance. With our financing platforms, we could help to mobilise the capital for climate solutions, while ensuring robust integrity within our financial markets.

Last year, the total green and sustainable debts issued in Hong Kong exceeded US$84 billion. And the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged here amounted to US$43 billion. That places us first in the Asian market for seven years in a row, capturing 45 per cent of the region's total.

Our regulatory framework is fundamental to creating a sustainable finance ecosystem. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance last year, aligning our taxonomy with the two mainstream taxonomies of the Mainland and the European Union. Encompassing economic activities in power generation, transportation, construction, and water and waste management, it will facilitate green finance flows and promote sustainable development.

Like our economy, Hong Kong's resolve to green transformation goes beyond finance. Consider green transport, a transformation moving into the fast lane on our roads. The adoption of electric vehicles has been remarkable.

Just five years ago, Hong Kong was home to about 14 000 electric vehicles. By the end of last year, that number had surged to about 110 000, that's seven times more.

Today, seven out of every 10 newly registered private cars in our city are electric. That, ladies and gentlemen, is among the highest growth rates in the world.

Vehicles, of course, are only one part of a complex equation. An extensive and convenient charging network is the backbone of any electric vehicle revolution.

Our strategy is people-centric, recognising that the best place to charge is at home or at the workplace. Through our EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme, we expect to see charging infrastructure installed in about 140 000 parking spaces in private residential buildings by the 2027-28 financial year. That will enable a smooth and non-disruptive electric vehicle transition for thousands of households.

As for our world-class public transport system, we have unveiled a clear Green Transformation Roadmap for public buses and taxis.

Through targeted subsidy schemes, that will fast-track the introduction of about 600 electric buses and 3 000 electric taxis. We are managing the transition in an orderly manner, using incentives rather than penalties, to ensure that our green ambitions don't translate into additional costs for passengers.

Our vision for green mobility goes well beyond the road. As one of the world's premier aviation hubs, we're looking to the skies, too, to chart the green way to our transport future.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is critical to the long-term future of air travel. It's also essential to ensuring Hong Kong's continuing leadership in aviation.

SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by more than 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government is working closely with the Airport Authority to set a clear target for SAF consumption.

Globally, SAF supply is limited, and the cost remains high. And we see this as an opportunity for Hong Kong to innovate and lead.

We are exploring a range of supply options, including collaborations with enterprises in the Mainland and internationally. Our goal is to establish a stable and competitive regional supply chain for SAF, taking advantage of our unique position within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. It will accelerate the decarbonisation of our aviation industry and provide greener travel options.

Our green ambitions also extend to the iconic Victoria Harbour, a vital artery for our city. Our Pilot Scheme for Electric Ferries will shape the future of maritime transport.

With a commitment of HK$350 million, the Government is subsidising the construction of new electric ferries and their charging infrastructure, allowing operators to test the new green technology in local waters with full support.

The first two of these pioneering vessels are already navigating Victoria Harbour, following rigorous testing.

Beyond the local waters, we are greening the vast shipping lanes that connect Hong Kong to the world. Hong Kong is already a top 10 port for vessel refuelling.

To build on this, we launched an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering late last year, with the goal of transforming Hong Kong into a leading international centre for green maritime fuel bunkering.

Industry response has been overwhelmingly positive, with key partners worldwide expressing strong interest in developing the services here. Hong Kong will spearhead the global effort in decarbonising shipping and, in doing so, create new economic opportunities. Something my good friend has already said: ""Green actually means business.""

When it comes to environmental connectivity, I'm pleased to note that EU companies play an important role in Hong Kong’s waste management and recycling facilities.

And I look forward to the expertise and support of EU companies in the Northern Metropolis, our new engine for growth dedicated to green living, and the area's long-term green development.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong has an iconic skyline. It also holds a treasure of having some 40 per cent of its land pulsing as the city's green lungs, with country parks breathing life into our metropolis, conservation areas cradling biodiversity little seen in other global financial hubs.

This is Hong Kong's defining paradox: where business and ecology coexist in symphony. For us, economic dynamism and environmental stewardship aren't just compatible - they're dual engines propelling our future. We balance development with sustainability. And we will do all we can to work with other places, the EU very much included, on the green way forward.

I look forward to building strong ties with the EU, to finding solutions to climate change, to creating far-reaching opportunities for us all.

My thanks to the organisers, the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao and the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. I'm grateful, too, to today's supporting organisations - the Business Environment Council, the Consulate General of Sweden and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.

I am certain you will enjoy today's Greenway forum, and I look forward to our continuing, rewarding, co-operation in the years to come. Thank you.

The EL9 is equipped with eight electric motors and an equal number of propellers, four on each side.
It only needs a distance of just 150 feet (46 meters) to become airborne, and that makes it something truly special.

Unlike many of the others, though, this one does not plan to make a vertical take-off and landing aircraft, nor a supersonic one.

Instead, Electra focuses on designing a small plane that can take off and land from pretty much everywhere, including (or especially) on and from unprepared surfaces – kind of like a helicopter, without actually being one. This should make it ideal to reach remote locations where no prepared runways are available.

At its core, the EL9 is a hybrid aircraft that makes use of a turbogenerator that can run exclusively on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), or if need be on upcoming eFuels and even hydrogen, and an undisclosed number of battery packs that are there to power the aircraft's motors. The packs will be capable of recharging both on the ground, in the usual fashion, and in the air by using the turbogenerator.

We don't have the full details on this setup yet, but Electra says the motors meant to spin the propellers will work together with blown lift to allow it to take off at very low speeds and over very short distances. But let's take this one step at a time.

The EL9 is equipped with eight electric motors and an equal number of propellers, four on each side. They are installed along the leading edge of the plane's wings and are accompanied by a series of large flaps.

This configuration allows the air to be blown by the propellers over the wings and the flaps, improving the aircraft's low-speed operation and delivering a ""dramatic improvement in aerodynamic performance.""

That's possible thanks to the accelerated airflow over the wing, which forms a thick jet sheet on the trailing edge and effectively makes the wing larger than it actually is, for aerodynamic purposes. A triple redundant, fly-by-wire system is also on deck to coordinate the actuation of the flight control surfaces and the eight electric motors.

According to Electra, this design should allow the EL9 to lift off the ground at speeds of just 40 mph (65 kph). It only needs a distance of just 150 feet (46 meters) to become airborne, and that makes it something truly special. When in climb and cruise mode, the blowing is reduced and the flaps are stowed away.

Now, the aircraft is not particularly large, as it will only be able to carry up to nine passengers and up to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) of cargo. It takes off (and lands) using the electric component of its powertrain, it uses the turbogenerator to cruise, and should be capable of traveling to distances of up to 1,266 miles (2,037 km) from its departure point.

The above are not impressive numbers, by any measure, but the capabilities of the plane when it comes to taking off and landing have already captured the attention of the military and defense contractors. Until last week, however, when the 2025 Paris Air Show took place, we didn't know exactly what this attention translates into.

Taking advantage of the event in the French capital, Electra tied the knot even further with defense contractor Lockheed Martin. More specifically, the behemoth's Skunk Works division will get involved in the development of the plane by having a say in its digital engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, sustainment and global business development.

Lockheed has been an investor in Electra since 2022, but it is only now that the company is taking a more active role in the creation of the EL9. Aside from all of the above, the company will tie the aircraft into the defense industry, as it will ""assess opportunities for potential programs of record with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and global customers.""

It's not yet clear when the revolutionary flying machine will be ready. Not long ago Electra said we should see it flying operationally soon, as no less than 2,200 pre-orders have been placed for it, valued at a total of nearly $9 billion. Most of these orders come from regional operators like Akansel, Dieng & Co Engineering, or Caverton Helicopters.

As per Lockheed, though, the EL9 ""will transform commercial and military aviation for applications including last mile logistics, mobile power generation and emergency response."" Not only thanks to its capabilities, but also on account of the fact that it promises to be 100 times quieter and 70 times cheaper to operate than a conventional rotorcraft of similar capabilities.

We will keep an eye on the EL9, but also on some other of the projects Electra has in the works, some of which are being developed with help from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Michigan, and others.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/hybrid-aircraft-that-needs-just-150-feet-of-runway-to-take-off-is-now-part-skunk-works-253332_1.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 09:02:31.712795

Conclusion Lufthansa Group’s collaboration with Airbus to create a customised SAF fare represents a major milestone in the airline industry’s efforts to reduce emissions from business travel.","In a significant move towards sustainability, Lufthansa Group and Airbus have partnered to introduce a customised version of the “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare” designed to reduce carbon emissions from business travel. The collaboration aims to tackle one of the most pressing issues in the aviation sector: emissions from corporate flights. By offering this new fare, Lufthansa allows companies to offset up to 30% of the CO2 emissions associated with business travel through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a clean alternative to conventional jet fuel.

The new corporate fare was introduced in June 2025 and has already been used by Airbus employees for all their domestic flights within Germany. The fare aims to provide a scalable solution for companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining the convenience and flexibility associated with business air travel. The move is part of the broader effort to integrate sustainability into corporate travel decisions, as companies increasingly recognize the need to address their environmental impact.

A Groundbreaking Partnership in the Aviation Industry

This partnership between Lufthansa Group and Airbus is a landmark in the aviation industry’s ongoing efforts to adopt sustainable practices and reduce its environmental impact. Airlines have long been under pressure to address their contribution to global carbon emissions, and SAF has emerged as one of the most promising solutions for making air travel more sustainable. Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources and can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle when compared to traditional kerosene-based fuels.

Dieter Vranckx, Chief Commercial Officer at Lufthansa Group, expressed his satisfaction with the collaboration, stating, “I am particularly pleased and thankful that our longstanding partner Airbus has opted for a corporate fare with SAF, demonstrating its leading role also in the field of sustainability.” Vranckx emphasized the growing importance of sustainability in business travel, noting that more and more companies are factoring environmental impact into their travel decisions.

This partnership is a direct response to the increasing demand from companies for sustainable travel solutions. As global attention on climate change and carbon emissions intensifies, many businesses are under pressure to reduce their environmental impact, especially in areas like corporate travel, which is a significant contributor to global emissions.

How the Sustainable Corporate Value Fare Works

The new customised Sustainable Corporate Value Fare allows businesses and employees to offset the CO2 emissions from their flights by using SAF on Lufthansa flights. This fare is designed specifically for corporate customers who are looking to make their air travel more sustainable without compromising on the convenience of traditional business-class services.

For Airbus, this new fare provides an opportunity to integrate sustainability into its travel operations. As part of the arrangement, Airbus employees now have the ability to reduce their carbon footprint by choosing flights that use SAF. The fare allows the offsetting of up to 30% of the CO2 emissions from a flight through the use of SAF, helping Airbus make significant strides toward meeting its sustainability goals.

“We have been working in close co-operation with Lufthansa Group since early 2024 to customise their Sustainable Corporate Value Fare to meet the specific needs of Airbus travellers,” said Raphael Duflos, Vice President of Corporate Services Procurement at Airbus. “They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating sustainable aviation fuels, starting in the German domestic market.”

The fare is currently being applied to Lufthansa’s domestic routes within Germany, but both companies have expressed interest in expanding the initiative to include international flights in the future. The partnership demonstrates how the aviation sector can leverage innovation and sustainability to meet the growing demand for environmentally responsible travel solutions.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Aviation

Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as a key solution for reducing emissions in the aviation industry, which is one of the largest sources of carbon emissions globally. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable resources such as plant-based oils, agricultural waste, or even carbon captured from the air. SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines, which makes it a versatile solution for reducing emissions without requiring significant changes to airport infrastructure or fleet technology.

SAF has the potential to cut carbon emissions by up to 80% over the lifecycle of the fuel, making it one of the most promising tools in the aviation industry’s quest to reduce its environmental impact. However, the widespread adoption of SAF is still in its early stages. Currently, SAF is produced in limited quantities and is more expensive than traditional jet fuel. The collaboration between Lufthansa and Airbus represents an important step toward increasing the availability and affordability of SAF, as well as demonstrating its viability as a sustainable fuel for corporate air travel.

Airbus is also working with other major airlines, such as easyJet, to explore and stimulate the use of SAF in commercial aviation. The goal is to make SAF more accessible and cost-effective, ultimately enabling airlines to reduce their carbon emissions and contribute to global sustainability efforts.

Benefits for Corporate Customers

The introduction of the Sustainable Corporate Value Fare provides several key benefits for corporate customers. First and foremost, it allows companies to reduce the carbon emissions associated with business travel, helping them meet sustainability targets and demonstrate their commitment to environmental responsibility. The fare is also flexible and customizable, offering businesses a way to integrate sustainability into their travel programs without compromising on service or convenience.

In addition, Lufthansa offers several other special fares for corporate clients, including the option for companies to invest in larger quantities of SAF through bulk deals. This provides businesses with an opportunity to offset their emissions more effectively and at scale. As more companies adopt sustainable travel practices, the demand for such fares and SAF options is expected to grow, encouraging other airlines to follow suit.

A Model for the Future of Aviation Sustainability

The partnership between Lufthansa and Airbus serves as a model for how the aviation industry can drive sustainability through innovation and collaboration. By leveraging SAF, both companies are helping to pave the way for a more sustainable future in air travel. As more airlines and corporate customers adopt SAF and similar initiatives, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint will be significantly reduced, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.

The launch of the customised SAF fare is just one example of how the aviation sector is evolving to meet the demands of the modern traveler, who is increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of their travel decisions. As the industry continues to innovate and embrace sustainable practices, it is likely that more airlines will follow Lufthansa’s lead, offering similar solutions to corporate customers seeking to reduce their environmental impact.

Conclusion

Lufthansa Group’s collaboration with Airbus to create a customised SAF fare represents a major milestone in the airline industry’s efforts to reduce emissions from business travel. By offering the option to offset up to 30% of CO2 emissions through the use of sustainable aviation fuel, the two companies are setting a new standard for sustainability in corporate travel. As more businesses and airlines adopt similar initiatives, SAF has the potential to play a crucial role in making air travel more sustainable and contributing to global climate goals.

""To put that in perspective, it is 60 percent of the EU's emissions, so we aren't doing too badly, and only one quarter of that of the United States.""

Lee said the SAR is well on its way to cutting its emissions in half by 2035 as it tried to reach its goal of achieving carbon neutrality before 2050.

Hong Kong, he added, has made great strides in its efforts to be environmentally friendly, from green financing to turning to greener modes of transport.

For example, he noted, some 110,000 electric vehicles were on the streets of Hong Kong by the end of last year, around seven times more than the figure five years ago.

Subsidy programmes, Lee said, have also helped bus, taxi and ferry companies to go electric.

The government is also working with the Airport Authority to set a target for using sustainable aviation fuel, which he said is much more environmentally friendly compared to conventional jet fuel.

Lee went on to say that Hong Kong's country parks and biodiversity are very much part of the SAR's uniqueness, which is seen in few places globally.

""This is Hong Kong's defining paradox, where business and ecology co-exist in symphony,"" he said.

""For us, economic dynamism and environmental stewardship aren't just compatible.

Lufthansa said this corporate fare “enables proportional offsetting of calculated CO2 emissions” by using alternative aviation fuels, widely known in the airline industry as SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), on future flights.

The new fare has been used by Airbus’ employees on all their domestic Lufthansa flights within Germany since the beginning of June. It allows for the offsetting of up to 30 per cent of the CO2 emissions from a flight through the eventual use of alternative fuels.

Dieter Vranckx, chief commercial officer at Lufthansa Group, said: “I am particularly pleased and thankful that our longstanding partner Airbus has opted for a corporate fare with SAF, demonstrating its leading role also in the field of sustainability.

“For many companies and its employees, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important factor in travel decisions. As a leading airline group, we are the partner of choice for companies in achieving their goals with tailor-made solutions.”

In a statement, Lufthansa added that it offered “several special fares for corporate customers”, including the customised Sustainable Corporate Value Fare, which was introduced in April. There is also the option for corporates to invest in larger quantities of SAF through bulk deals.

The airline group said that around 4 per cent of corporate customers currently use these sustainable fare options, which are “continuously developed and expanded in line with our customers' needs”.

Adani New Industries Ltd. has commissioned India's first off-grid 5 MW Green Hydrogen Pilot Plant in Kutch, Gujarat. Powered by solar energy and a Battery Energy Storage System, the plant operates independently, marking a breakthrough in decentralized hydrogen production. This project demonstrates the feasibility of renewable hydrogen production at scale, aligning with India's green energy goals.

The Adani Group has announced the successful commissioning of India's first off-grid 5 megawatt green hydrogen pilot plant in Kutch, Gujarat. Developed by Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL), the clean energy arm of Adani Enterprises Ltd., the plant represents a significant advancement in the country's pursuit of clean and self-reliant energy solutions.

An off-grid green hydrogen plant generates hydrogen through electrolysis powered solely by renewable energy—such as solar or wind—without any connection to the conventional power grid. This means the plant operates independently, relying fully on its own renewable energy infrastructure.

Describing the development as a key milestone supporting India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, the Adani Group said the project establishes technical feasibility and sets new standards for off-grid, renewable-powered applications of green hydrogen in high-emission sectors.

""The state-of-the-art plant is 100 per cent green-powered by solar energy and integrated with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), enabling it to operate completely off-grid. This represents a new paradigm in decentralised, renewable-powered hydrogen production,"" the company said in a statement.

Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is also one of the cleanest fuels—emitting only water vapour when used. Its environmental impact varies based on production methods. Hydrogen made from fossil fuels is classified as grey, while green hydrogen is produced using electricity from renewable sources to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

Live Events

ANIL is building an end-to-end ecosystem for large-scale green hydrogen production and its derivatives. This includes green ammonia, green methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the manufacturing of solar cells, ingots and wafers, solar modules, wind turbine generators, and electrolysers at its facility in Mundra, Gujarat, aimed at meeting both domestic and global demand.

The Kutch-based pilot facility is also India’s first of its kind to feature a fully automated, closed-loop electrolyser system that adjusts dynamically to real-time renewable energy inputs. This allows for enhanced operational flexibility to address the inherent variability in solar power generation while ensuring safety, efficiency, and high performance.

""This breakthrough reinforces the Adani Group's commitment to innovation, sustainability, and leadership in the emerging green hydrogen economy. It supports India's ambition to become a global hub for green hydrogen production and sets a benchmark for renewable-powered industrial applications across hard-to-abate sectors,"" the statement added.

The pilot plant also acts as a proof of concept for ANIL’s upcoming Green Hydrogen Hub in Mundra—an ambitious project expected to significantly contribute to India’s low-carbon transition. Green hydrogen is seen as a critical tool for decarbonising challenging sectors such as fertilisers, oil refining, and heavy transport, and plays a central role in achieving global net-zero targets.

Global SAF output last year totalled 1.3bn litres, according to airline industry association IATA.

The EU has allocated revenue from the sale of 20M carbon emissions permits to help airlines cover the price gap between conventional kerosene and more expensive SAF on flights within Europe, according to the report.

Reuters calculations showed these subsidies would cover purchases of up to 216M litres of e-fuels – synthetic fuels produced using captured CO₂ emissions – or up to 2.6bn litres of biofuels.

The EU subsidies cover up to €6 (US$6.89)/litre for e-fuels and €0.5 (US$0.575)/litre for biofuels.

Aviation is one the hardest sectors to decarbonise, with zero-emission aircraft not expected this decade, according to the Reuters report.

Although sustainable fuels could help to reduce air travel’s carbon footprint in the near term, SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply, the report said.

Against this backdrop, airlines have warned that EU targets to use more SAF were impossible to meet, according to the report.

The sector is investing only 1%-3% of revenue or budget allocation in SAF, according to a report this year by Boston Consulting Group.

The EU requires 2% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030.

Este documento proporciona un análisis integral del estado actual de la aviación global y traza el camino hacia un futuro más seguro, sostenible y eficiente.

Bajo la dirección de Willie Walsh, Director General de IATA, este reporte destaca los logros, desafíos y oportunidades que enfrenta el sector tras su recuperación de los efectos de la pandemia.

Seguridad: La Máxima Prioridad

Sin lugar a dudas, la seguridad sigue siendo el pilar fundamental de la aviación y un tema central en la agenda de IATA. El reporte destaca que, en 2024, la industria registró algunas estadísticas que son clave:

7 accidentes fatales en 40.6 millones de vuelos, un aumento respecto a 2023, pero con una tasa de accidentes (1.13 por millón de vuelos) aún mejor que el promedio de los últimos cinco años (1.25), con un total de 244 fallecimientos entre 4.8 mil millones de pasajeros.

Si bien, estos números reflejan una industria segura, el objetivo continúa siendo un futuro con cero accidentes y cero fatalidades.

Las aerolíneas registradas en el programa IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) demostraron un desempeño significativamente mejor, una tasa de 92 accidentes por millón de vuelos, casi la mitad de la registrada por aerolíneas no certificadas (1.70 accidentes por millón de vuelos).

En 2024 se realizaron más de 100 auditoria basadas en el Programa IOSA. El Programa IOSA está basado en riesgos, mediante un enfoque basado en datos para identificar normas y practicas recomendadas, lo que contribuye directamente a la mejora de la seguridad operacional. En promedio en 2024, las auditorias identificaron 3 veces más incumplimientos que las auditorias convencionales, y el enfoque incluye nuevos métodos de auditoria como la evaluación de la madurez del sistema de la gestión de la seguridad operacional (SMS).

El sistema Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) recopiló en 2024:

Datos de más de 8 millones de vuelos, estas cifras me vuelan la cabeza, ya que con la ayuda de la inteligencia artificial (IA) procesar esta data es crucial para la toma de decisiones estratégicas para la industria.

Información sobre 500,000 incidentes y $11 mil millones en costos de mantenimiento.

El uso de inteligencia artificial para analizar esta información maximiza la capacidad de identificar y mitigar riesgos emergentes, mejorando continuamente la seguridad de los vuelos.

Un dato que me dejo pensando, fue el aumento de las interferencias y bloqueos en los Sistemas Globales de Navegación por Satélite (GNSS), incluidas interrupciones de la señal, interferencias y suplantación de identidad, especialmente cerca de zonas de conflicto, representa un riesgo creciente para la aviación. IATA subraya la importancia de mantener sistemas de navegación terrestres como respaldo crítico.

IATA hace un llamado a los Gobiernos para Implementar medidas para prevenir interferencias en los sistemas de navegación que comprometan la seguridad de los vuelos.

Otro dato que me llamó la atención fue que el análisis sobre las investigaciones de accidentes entre 2018 y 2023 revelan el acceso limitado a informes de accidentes, tan solo un poco más del 50% de los informes de accidentes se publicaron conforme a lo que exige el Anexo 13 de la OACI, lo que limita el aprendizaje colectivo y que podría mejorar la seguridad aérea.

IATA subraya la importancia de compartir datos y mejorar la colaboración entre gobiernos y aerolíneas para mantener los estándares de seguridad más altos.

Sostenibilidad: El Reto de Alcanzar Cero Emisiones Netas para 2050

La sostenibilidad ocupa un lugar central en la agenda de la industria aérea. Aunque la aviación mantiene su compromiso de lograr cero emisiones netas de carbono para 2050, el progreso en 2024 fue más lento de lo esperado, y es debido a diversos retos y desafíos que a continuación señalo:

a) Combustibles de Aviación Sostenible (SAF):

La producción de Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) se duplicó en 2024 en comparación con 2023, alcanzando 1 millón de toneladas, pero esto solo representa el 0.3% del combustible total utilizado por la industria, cada tonelada se vendió a un promedio de 2,316 dólares la tonelada, un precio 3.1 veces superior al valor del combustible de aviación convencional. Se prevé que SAF cubra el 65% de las necesidades de mitigación de carbono para 2050, pero su alto costo como ya vimos en comparación del combustible de aviación convencional sigue siendo un obstáculo.

La transición hacia emisiones netas cero requerirá $4.7 billones para 2050, incluyendo $128 mil millones anuales en inversión en biorefinerías.

b) Iniciativas clave para la sostenibilidad:

IATA lanzó el “SAF REGISTRY” y lo transfirió a la Organización de Descarbonización de la Aviación Civil (CADO) este es un registro global de SAF en 2025 que permite a las aerolíneas rastrear y reclamar los atributos ambientales de los combustibles sostenibles adquiridos. Este enfoque de registro y reclamación se basa en la Metodología de Contabilidad e Informes de SAF de la IATA.

También si impulso a los gobiernos deben reforzar su apoyo a programas como CORSIA y evitar impuestos ambientales que no contribuyen directamente a la descarbonización.

c) Desafíos regulatorios:

La normativa “ReFuelEU Aviation”, que entro en vigor el 1 de enero de 2025, y exige un suministro mínimo del 2% SAF en aeropuertos europeos, esta acción ha elevado los precios del SAF gracias a que sus proveedores explotan su posición dominante en el mercado y han dificultando su adopción voluntaria por parte de las aerolíneas.

En su primera etapa, la normativa exige como ya mencionamos al menos 2% del combustible para aviación disponible en los aeropuertos de la UE sea SAF a partir de 2025, pero este porcentaje aumentará gradualmente, alcanzando el 6% para 2030, el 20% para 2035, y el 70% para 2050.

Transformación Digital: Hacia una Aviación Más Eficiente e Innovadora

La parte de la digitalización y la inteligencia artificial (IA) me parece super interesante ya que están revolucionando la industria aérea. IATA está impulsando la adopción de tecnologías que mejoren la eficiencia operativa, la experiencia del pasajero y la sostenibilidad.

Puntos clave:

a) Identidad Digital:

Pruebas exitosas de credenciales digitales en rutas entre Hong Kong y Tokio permiten que los pasajeros pasen controles de seguridad y embarque sin documentos físicos, por el uso del reconocimiento biométrico.

La iniciativa One ID de IATA promueve estándares globales de identidad digital para un viaje más fluido y seguro.

También se alinea con los esfuerzos gubernamentales para adoptar credenciales de viaje digitales basadas en estándares de la OACI.

b) ONE Record:

Este estándar de intercambio de datos para la carga aérea elimina procesos manuales y mejora la transparencia en toda la cadena logística. Proporciona un registro único en los envíos, prevé una cadena de suministro digital integral para la logística de transporte. Por lo que ONE Record eliminará la duplicidad, ayuda a cerrar los puntos ciegos de los datos y refuerza los cumplimientos regulatorios.

El transporte de carga aérea está en camino de alcanzar el 100 % de la capacidad de las aerolíneas con ONE Record para enero de 2026.

c) Uso de datos y ciberseguridad:

La primera Cumbre Mundial de Datos de IATA en 2025 priorizó el uso intensivo de IA y la protección contra amenazas cibernéticas. Como sabemos, los datos son fundamentales para definir el futuro de la aviación, y el tema de seguridad de los datos, gracias a los avances en IA y análisis predictivo, los datos impulsan mejoras en seguridad, eficiencia, experiencia del pasajero y sostenibilidad, entre otros.

La IATA apoya los avances relacionados con los datos mediante una estrategia formal, esta estrategia se basa en el principio de “dar para recibir”, donde las aerolíneas aportan datos a cambio de análisis comparativos anónimos que mejoran la seguridad, sostenibilidad y eficiencia del transporte aéreo.

Perspectivas Regionales: La Resiliencia de la Aviación Global

El informe Anual de IATA destaca un desempeño económico sólido, con un beneficio neto de $32,000 millones en 2024 y un margen neto de 3.4%. El tráfico aéreo internacional global aumento en 2024 un 13.7% Sin embargo, las regiones enfrentan desafíos específicos:

Asia-Pacífico: Lideró el crecimiento del tráfico internacional con un aumento del 26.6% en RPK (Revenue Passenger Kilometers), contribuyendo con casi la mitad del crecimiento global.

América Latina y África: Aunque sus contribuciones financieras son modestas, muestran una mejora constante en rentabilidad.

Otto Aviation has selected the FJ44-4 QPM turbofan engine from Williams International as the powerplant for its Phantom 3500 aircraft.
“Williams International is proud to partner with Otto Aviation on this groundbreaking program,” said John Sordyl, EVP of Customer Experience at Williams International.
“By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations – Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation.
This strategic collaboration marks a key production milestone as Otto Aviation advances toward credible rate-ready manufacturing for its high-efficiency aircraft.","Otto Aviation, a pioneering force in sustainable aviation, held a press briefing at the 2025 Paris Air Show where CEO Paul Touw announced the company would achieve net-zero carbon emissions with its Phantom 3500 aircraft when it enters service around 2030 – two decades ahead of the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon goal.

The aviation industry has set a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal, adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and supported by organizations including the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aims to mitigate the industry's impact on climate change by balancing CO2 emissions with equivalent amounts sequestered or offset.

With an AI-supported clean sheet design, transonic super-laminar flow architecture, and cutting-edge aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 is a lightweight, ultra-low-drag aircraft that burns 60% less fuel than similar-sized jets and reduces emissions by 90% when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

Otto Aviation has selected the FJ44-4 QPM turbofan engine from Williams International as the powerplant for its Phantom 3500 aircraft. The QPM (Quiet Power Mode) variant integrates auxiliary power unit (APU) functionality, allowing for independent ground operations and streamlined support infrastructure.

“Williams International is proud to partner with Otto Aviation on this groundbreaking program,” said John Sordyl, EVP of Customer Experience at Williams International. “The FJ44-4 QPM was designed to meet the next generation of aviation requirements, and the Phantom 3500 is an ideal platform to showcase its capabilities.”

Otto Aviation is choosing the Garmin G700 TXi flight display to equip its initial Phantom 3500 flight test vehicle,

“The Phantom 3500 is the result of relentless innovation and bold thinking,” Touw said during his remarks. “By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations – Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation. It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

On the inside, the Phantom 3500 provides space for nine passengers and has a cabin height of 6.5ft. In place of traditional porthole-style windows along the fuselage, the Phantom 3500 includes high-definition digital displays called Super Natural Vision, which provides passengers with views of the sky and scenery while also enjoying increased efficiency thanks to the streamlined design.

Otto Aviation plans to manufacture the Phantom 3500 at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, according to an announcement made a day earlier at the Paris Air Show by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The company will invest approximately $430 million and move its headquarters to the city. Otto’s plan is to establish initial operations in an available hangar, then build a new plant to manufacture the Phantom 3500 on land at the airfield. The company plans to begin flight tests by early 2027 and aims to achieve certification and enter service in 2030.

Given the US’ high stakes in these commodities – and the geopolitical imperative to find a sizeable alternative market to China – there’s significant pressure on India to remove restrictions on their imports.

But any such opening up in the India-US trade deal could encounter resistance from the two well-established agro-processing industries.

What sugar millers fear

The ethanol-blended petrol programme has been a success story of the Narendra Modi-led government.

Chart 1 shows that the average blending of ethanol in petrol sold by oil marketing companies (OMC) has risen from just 1.5% in 2013-14 to 14.6% in 2023-24. In the current supply year, from November 2024 till May 2025, the cumulative all-India average blending ratio was 18.8%, close to the target of 20% by 2025-26.

Story continues below this ad

But the industry’s concerns are over the feedstock used for ethanol production.

Till 2017-18, the entire ethanol for blending in petrol came from molasses, the leftover dark syrup after extraction of sugar crystals from cane juice. From 2018-19, the mills-cum-distilleries also began using cereal grains (mainly broken or old rice unfit for human consumption) as feedstock. Since 2023-24, the ethanol supplies from grain-based feedstock, particularly maize, has overtaken that from sugarcane molasses and whole juice (Chart 2).

For the 2024-25 supply year, a total 1,047.9 crore litres of ethanol have been contracted or made available to OMCs. Out of that, 710.4 crore litres or nearly 68% is from grain-based feedstock, including 483.9 crore litres from maize, 119 crore litres from the Food Corporation of India’s surplus rice and 107.5 crore litres from damaged/broken grains. Only the balance 337.5 crore litres are from molasses (144.7 crore litres) and sugarcane juice (192.8 crore litres).

“As it is, sugarcane is being marginalised as a feedstock. It would be worse with imports of maize or even ethanol itself,” says a miller from Uttar Pradesh.

According to him, the industry was already facing the prospect of stagnant, if not declining, domestic sugar consumption: “Our future isn’t sugar, but energy. Today, it is 20% ethanol-blended petrol. Tomorrow, it may be 5% blending in diesel or ethanol being converted through additional processing into sustainable aviation fuel producing lower carbon emissions compared to petroleum jet fuel”.

Ethanol from sugarcane, the miller claims, will not create any major “fuel versus food and feed” dilemma. “Sugar consumption won’t increase much in India, unlike milk, egg and chicken that need maize as the key feed ingredient. The diversion of maize for biofuel will cause huge demand-supply imbalances and shortage of grain for livestock and poultry,” he adds.

The US exported a record 1,914 million gallons (724.5 crore litres) of ethanol, valued at $4.3 billion, in 2024. India was its third largest market (after Canada and the United Kingdom), at 187 million gallons (70.8 crore litres) worth $441.3 million. India permits import of ethanol only under licence for industrial (non-fuel) purposes and restricted to “actual users”: Imports can be for manufacture of alcohol-based chemicals, but not for blending in petrol or diesel.

A recent NITI Aayog working paper has suggested that India import GM maize as a feedstock for ethanol production. The protein-rich byproduct from it – DDGS or distiller’s dried grains with solubles – may be entirely exported without getting consumed as a GM feed ingredient within the country.

“US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India’s biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,” the paper – authored by NITI Aayog member, Ramesh Chand, and senior adviser, Raka Saxena – has stated.

Soyabean industry’s misgivings

The NITI Aayog paper has also called for exploring the option of importing soyabean, with the oil extracted from it being sold in the domestic market and the residual de-oiled cake or meal (which contains GM protein matter) exported to other countries.

SOPA’s executive director, DN Pathak, counters this proposal. “Most of our solvent extraction plants are in the interiors (especially Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra) where the crop is grown. It’s not feasible for them to bring imported soyabean from the ports, process it and then take back the meal for exports. The freight cost economics will simply not work. And what will happen to the 7 million-odd farmers cultivating soyabean here?,” he asks.

Indian processors crush 11-12 million tonnes (mt) of soyabean annually to produce 9-9.5 mt of meal. Out of that, 7-7.5 mt is domestically consumed as feed and food ingredient and the rest 2 mt or so exported. This is way below the 105-110 mt that China crushes every year. Much of that soyabean is imported to meet the feed requirement of its humungous swine herd and poultry flock: China is home to roughly half of the world’s pig population and a fifth of its chickens.

“We don’t have this kind of domestic market for soyabean meal. Also, if the GM meal cannot be sold within the country, the processing plants will have to be nearer to the ports for exports. The ones more likely to put up these are the international commodity trading giants such as AWL Agri Business (formerly Adani Wilmar), Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus,” explained Pathak.

SOPA has also voiced concern at the Centre’s decision, on May 30, to slash the effective import tariff on crude soyabean, palm and sunflower oil from 27.5% to 16.5%. That will further squeeze the margins of domestic processors, “as they will have to compete with lower-priced imported oils, forcing them to operate below break-even capacity or shut down altogether”.

Soyabean is now trading in MP and Maharashtra’s mandis at Rs 4,300-4,350 per quintal, as against its official minimum support price of Rs 5,328. A surge in imports, whether of oil or seed, can lead to farmers switching acreage to other crops.

These worries may to come to the fore, as the ongoing trade talks between India and US edge closer to fruition.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/06/soyabean-photo-1600.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 03:59:38.560282

In a bold stride toward redefining urban transportation, China's Hellobike has teamed up with Ant Group and CATL to launch a dedicated robotaxi venture. With an investment of over 3 billion yuan (approximately $417 million), this collaboration aims to go beyond autonomous vehicles, laying the foundation for a green, intelligent, and deeply integrated mobility ecosystem.

Founded in 2016 by Han Mei, Jiang Wei, Li Kaizhu, and Yang Lei, Hellobike—officially Hello TransTech—has rapidly evolved from a modest bike-sharing startup into a shared mobility powerhouse. Headquartered in Shanghai, the company initially caught attention with its focus on accessible and scalable bike services. Its acquisition by Youon Bike in 2017 didn’t slow its pace; instead, Hellobike expanded into e-bikes, carpooling, and ride-hailing—building the operational backbone that now supports its robotaxi ambitions.

So, what’s behind this high-octane trio?

Hellobike contributes its deep operational know-how and user-facing mobility infrastructure.

Ant Group injects cutting-edge digital technologies like AI, blockchain, and carbon credit tracking into the venture.

CATL, the battery titan, powers the vision with its advanced energy solutions—including sodium-ion batteries and battery-swap innovation.

Their combined goal is a smart “vehicle-battery-cloud” system aimed at slashing 150,000 tons of carbon emissions annually while increasing operational efficiency by 30%. The first phase includes deploying 100,000 electric vehicles and 500 intelligent battery-swap cabinets across 20 cities, including Shanghai and Chengdu.

This isn’t just another autonomous driving experiment—it’s a blueprint for how fintech, clean energy, and shared mobility can converge to create scalable solutions for 21st-century cities.

Vietnam Airlines Corporation has just been honored at the program ""Glory of Vietnam 2025"" - an event organized by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor in coordination with Lao Dong Newspaper with the theme ""Pride and Aspiration"".

Entering its 21st year, the Vietnam Glory program has been constantly innovated, promoting the spirit of honoring outstanding groups and individuals, thereby spreading and inspiring the community.

Vietnam Airlines was selected from thousands of nominations and was honored to be on the list of 13 outstanding groups and 6 outstanding individuals this year, representing Vietnam's spirit of aspiration to reach high and far in the period of integration and development.

Vietnam Airlines Deputy General Director To Ngoc Giang affirmed: This title is a great source of pride and also a driving force for Vietnam Airlines to continue to pioneer in creating a green-digital-global aviation future.

With more than 30 years of establishment and development, Vietnam Airlines has continuously affirmed its role as a strategic driving force in three pillars: digital economy, green economy and aviation diplomacy .

As the first airline in the industry to achieve the “Digital Formation” level according to DBI 2023 assessment, Vietnam Airlines has applied big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize flight operations and enhance customer experience, with a satisfaction index of over 4/5 in both domestic and international markets.

In its sustainable development strategy, Vietnam Airlines is the pioneer airline to operate the first commercial flight using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in May 2024. This is the first step in the roadmap to realize the commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

In parallel, the airline has promoted many environmental initiatives with practical impacts, such as the “Fly Lightly to Con Dao” campaign to reduce luggage weight, save fuel and aim to handle 85% of plastic waste generated locally; the “Contribute Leaves to Repair Forests” program, mobilizing the community to raise funds to restore 50-60 hectares of forest each year.

In addition, Vietnam Airlines has eliminated more than 62 million plastic bags each year, recycled more than 3 million meal boxes and operated the entire ground system according to ISO 14001 standards on environmental management, affirming its commitment to comprehensive green development in all activities.

Vietnam Airlines currently operates a wide flight network with more than 100 international and domestic routes, connecting Vietnam to Asia, Europe, Australia and North America, playing an important role as a bridge between the country and friends around the world.

As a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance, Vietnam Airlines not only expands connectivity to more than 1,000 global destinations, but also enhances its competitiveness and ability to serve according to international standards.

Karanjit Singh Wadhwa, Chairman of ACFI, Event Management Task Pillar, and Director of the Grace Group, during the curtain-raiser event, revealed that this year’s conclave would address pertinent questions, such as how India intends to triple its air cargo capacity by 2030, explore ways to make air and cargo more innovative and resilient, and consider what global leadership in cargo would genuinely entail.

The conclave would focus on four key pillars that would capture the sector’s priorities and future direction.

The first of the four pillars will focus on Resilience Through Innovation, moderated by Ramesh Mamidala, Vice President of ACFI and Head of Cargo at Air India Ltd. Satish Lakkaraju, Chairman of the ACFI Regional Outreach and Partnership Task Pillar and CEO of NextGen Logistics Pvt Ltd, speaking on behalf of Mamidala, stated that air transportation is becoming increasingly tense due to various geopolitical skirmishes. Recent geopolitical events have presented opportunities for India to leverage volatility by strengthening regional cargo hubs and enhancing cargo coordination among private players, Customs, and regulators. The session will examine the structural reforms required for transhipment and discuss pre-trade agreements with various countries.

This session will discuss how technology can be leveraged to enhance cargo movement, improve visibility, and increase efficiency, as well as explore the deployment of X-ray machines in India for rapid cargo scanning. These measures would help in reducing the dwell time of cargo. There was a need to impress the shipper that air cargo was not an expensive mode of transport.

Satish Lakkaraju will moderate the discussions in the second pillar. The session will examine ‘Tech-Driven Cargo: Accelerating Express, E-Commerce, and Data-Led Operations. The discussions will be on how cargo efficiency and visibility can be enhanced, particularly in express e-commerce. India’s e-commerce industry is estimated to be worth Rs 85000 crores. How can AI be leveraged to tap into this market?

Green Corridors and Sustainable Trade Lanes: Air Cargo’s ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Imperative will be the focus of the third pillar, moderated by Keku Bomi Gazder, Managing Director and CEO of Aviapro Logistics Services Pvt Ltd. This session will explore ways to promote responsible environmental growth in air logistics that align with global climate goals. India’s air cargo expansion must go hand in hand with sustainability. There is a need to adopt more green solutions at airports and encourage low-emission transportation. The session will also examine Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for freighter aircraft, the electrification of ground handling equipment, and investment in energy-efficient warehouses.

The fourth pillar will focus on Securing India’s Cargo Future: Risk, Resilience, and Disaster Readiness. The moderator for this session will be Yashpal Sharma, Chairman and Managing Director of Skyways Group. This session will examine the mitigation of risks in cargo movement. As cargo volumes increase, compliance must be adhered to. There should be the adoption of AI-based screening, innovative X-Ray systems, and a block for tamper-proof documentation. The session will explore global best practices.

The theme will also address cybersecurity in logistics, including the protection of digital infrastructure and the management of cargo. It is essential to develop a security system that ensures the smooth flow of cargo. The key questions to be addressed will be: How can public and private stakeholders collaborate on cargo security? What training will be needed? How can data protection and privacy be maintained as logistics progressively digitize?",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Acfi-2-image.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:01:08.981172

As part of its wider expansion strategy, the airline is also bolstering its engine capacity with an additional 40 Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. These landmark agreements mark a significant step in Vietjet’s growth strategy as a multi-national aviation group, while also strengthening economic ties between Vietnam, France, and Europe.

The latest order builds on Vietjet’s commitment last month for 20 additional A330neo aircraft, bringing its total widebody aircraft on order to 40.

Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said: “I have a vision and the determination to make Vietnam a regional aviation hub for passenger transportation, technical services, logistics, training, research, global supply chains, and aviation infrastructure. We will continue to develop a robust and modern fleet to support that goal. Today’s agreement with Airbus is more than a commercial contract — it is a significant milestone that marks the beginning of Vietjet’s new journey: a journey of global expansion, new growth drivers, enhanced connectivity, and the development of a sustainable aviation ecosystem powered by ambition and transformation.”

Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business Benoît de Saint-Exupéry said: “Our latest agreement comes just weeks after the airline placed an additional order for A330neo widebody aircraft. Together, the A321neo and A330neo will be perfect partners for Vietjet to continue to spread its wings, efficiently matching capacity more closely to demand across its network.”

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ best-selling A320neo Family, offering exceptional range and performance. Equipped with new generation engines and Sharklets, the A321neo brings a 50% noise reduction and more than 20% fuel savings and CO₂ reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft while maximising passenger comfort in the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky.

As with all in-production aircraft, the A321neo can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to up to 100% SAF capability by 2030.

Vietjet also placed an order for 40 additional Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. The deal reinforces Vietjet’s commitment to building a next-generation widebody fleet, doubling its total order to 80 following an initial agreement at the 2024 Singapore Airshow.

And thirdly, we seek to provide tools and practical measures to support the industry in attaining its sustainability goals.” His one ask to regulators attending the Hong Kong summit?","Airfreight is navigating a year of intense disruption. With trade protectionism, regional conflicts, and fragile consumer sentiment shaping global flows, 2025 demands more than incremental thinking. TIACA’s choice to host its Executive Summit in Hong Kong sends a clear message about where the industry’s centre of gravity is shifting—and where the hard conversations need to happen.

Asia in focus

“We wanted the 2025 Summit to be in Asia as part of the TIACA board’s objective of ensuring our events are held in areas which ensure member accessibility, as well as being in locations which play a crucial role within the global airfreight industry,” said Glyn Hughes, TIACA’s director general. “Hong Kong fits these requirements perfectly, particularly when it comes to being the e-commerce gateway to the world. China accounts for 27 percent of global manufacturing output, and with ‘China plus one’ policies expected to lead to a greater amount of production elsewhere in Asia, it certainly illustrates that the region will be a crucial component of future airfreight industry success.”

The choice is strategic, not symbolic. In an era where logistics resilience and regional diversification are paramount, Hong Kong serves as a real-time laboratory for change. Hughes is clear that the summit is not a networking formality but a focused industry checkpoint.

“We build our agenda around the topics of most relevance to the entire community, so we will focus on e-commerce, digitalisation, airport development, AI, innovation, sustainability, industry trends, and the overall outlook,” he said. “We will have two industry leaders’ roundtable discussions, and as part of TIACA’s commitment to showcase leadership, we will have the finals of our Sustainability Awards, our 2025 Hall of Fame induction ceremony, and two new awards recognising inspirational leadership and a rising star of tomorrow.”

BlueSky: More than a dashboard

A cornerstone of that accountability is TIACA’s BlueSky programme, designed to benchmark and validate companies’ sustainability progress across a wide range of metrics. Yet industry adoption hasn’t been as widespread as expected.

“I have been a little surprised that more companies haven’t signed up for the BlueSky programme, as the feedback we receive from those who have gone through the programme is excellent,” Hughes said. “Not only does it provide a personalised dashboard reflecting how the company is performing across a range of sustainability topics, it also illustrates where they need to focus on going forward.”

The programme’s structure encourages internal reflection, but also collaborative action. “We have just completed the first BlueSky community, led by Air Cargo Belgium and Brussels Airport, which took a group of six leading companies through the programme together. In addition to individual company results, we were also able to highlight areas that were common to many, and this additional guidance will be used by Air Cargo Belgium to provide some new programmes for their members.”

Decarbonisation at a crossroads

When asked whether the sector is progressing fast enough on environmental goals, Hughes didn’t dodge the complexity.

“Overall, I think the airfreight industry is performing well across a number of sustainability topics, although there are a few areas where more needs to be done,” he said. “Reduced waste, including reduction of single-use plastic, is one very positive result of actions taken. Airlines are investing heavily in newer-generation, more fuel-efficient fleets, and forwarders and trucking companies are increasing the number of EVs in their ground fleets. Ground handlers are electrifying GSE, and some are even investigating the use of green hydrogen-based equipment.”

But he cautioned that decarbonisation hinges on more than industry alone. “Airfreight shippers are leading when it comes to committing to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but overall there is a lack of SAF available in the market. Therefore, in order to meet the 2025 net zero target, it is crucial that fuel producers, governments, and the investment community look at how they can increase production capability.”

TIACA’s role: Measuring success

TIACA’s position, Hughes emphasised, is not just to observe industry progress but to facilitate it.

“We see the role of TIACA as threefold in this regard,” he said. “Firstly, we seek to work with legislators to help educate them on what the industry is doing and whether proposed changes to legislative requirements are workable. Next, we aim to help educate the industry as to what the regulatory requirements are. And thirdly, we seek to provide tools and practical measures to support the industry in attaining its sustainability goals.”

His one ask to regulators attending the Hong Kong summit? “That they consider incentive programmes to support the investments that are required to address decarbonisation strategies.”

What does success look like for TIACA by the end of 2025? It’s not headline numbers, but relevance.

“For TIACA it’s all about member satisfaction,” Hughes said. “We undertake an annual member survey and adjust our programmes thereafter to ensure we deliver what our members look for from their association.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/page-4-23--1080x660.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 20:00:56.727002

The milestone was celebrated during a site visit attended by Khaled Abbas, Chairperson of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), and Ahmed Fahmy, ACUD’s General Manager.

Abbas praised the high standards of execution and design at Midtown Solo, describing it as a reflection of the premium quality envisioned for the New Capital. He reaffirmed ACUD’s ongoing commitment to supporting serious developers and accelerating progress on this national megaproject, which stands as a pillar of Egypt’s “New Republic” vision.

Midtown Solo features fully serviced standalone villas, targeting a high-end clientele. Abbas confirmed that 95% of infrastructure works for the project’s first phase have been completed, with final utility connections pending developer compliance with technical specifications. He also noted that landscaping and main roadworks across the R7 district are progressing in phases and will be completed soon.

Fahmy highlighted that Midtown Solo is Better Home’s second project to be delivered in the New Capital, and lauded its architectural quality and integrated services. He stressed that such developments are key to drawing more residents and investors to the city.

To further support developers, Fahmy revealed that ACUD has introduced 4 to 5 facilitation packages, helping struggling companies resolve issues and expedite license issuance. He also acknowledged Better Home’s early and continued investment in the Capital, noting the company’s pivotal role in believing in the city’s long-term potential.

He added that investor interest remains strong, citing a recent electronic land offering in the R8 district that drew three times the available applications.

Ashraf Adel, General Manager of Better Home, emphasized the company’s pioneering role as the first private real estate developer to acquire land in the New Capital. He described Midtown Solo as a landmark development, and the only project in the Capital comprised entirely of standalone villas—390 in total—spanning 66 acres along the prominent South Bin Zayed Axis, near the Cathedral and Green River.

Adel highlighted the project’s low-density design, with 80% of the land devoted to greenery, landscaping, and lagoons, and only 20% for built structures—creating a tranquil and healthy living environment. Residents benefit from a full suite of amenities, including a clubhouse, swimming pools, restaurants, cafés, and pharmacies.

The development sold out in record time, reflecting strong market confidence in the Better Home brand. It also features a 30,000 sqm commercial hub made up of 14 standalone buildings (ground + 2 floors + rooftop + private basement).

This months-long investigation with co-partner Climate Home News focused on a key ingredient vital to making SAF: used cooking oil. Most people probably don't know that their cooking oil used for frying can be turned into jet fuel. Millions of tonnes are collected globally and it is turned into SAF and biodiesel. It's a wonder of modern chemistry. Repurposing used cooking oil, that would otherwise be tossed away, is a great recycling story and it also means less pressure on agricultural land and deforestation. But there's a dark side to this story: greed. The demand for SAF is growing because more and more governments are setting strict useage mandates at airports ( 2 pct SAF use at EU airports, which will rise to 6 pct by 2030). Because there is such demand, that means UCO demand is also growing fast. Our investigation into the trade of UCO between Malaysia and Spain shows there are significant opportunities for fraud: the mixing of virgin palm oil into UCO and adding barely used (fried once) cooking oil into UCO supplies. This can be lucrative for UCO traders and hard to catch by auditors. This illicit ""fattening up"" of UCO supplies risks undermining the whole sustainability credentials, and benefits, of SAF, a fuel that the industry can achieve deep emissions cuts over fossil fuel-derived aviation fuel. It is also a headache for the sustainability certification schemes, for refiners and for airlines, including #Singapore, which is emerging as a global hub for SAF production and use. And it's a headache for the EU, which bans the use of virgin palm oil or any feedstock that could be linked to the risk of deforestation, or labour abuses.

Vinod Khosla rides to LanzaTech’s rescue

ANALYSIS: After a US$40m capital injection, the Kiwi-founded carbon recycling company needs shareholder approval to raise more funds.

Illustration: Michael Hickmott

Key points

What's at stake: Kiwi-founded and US-based carbon recycling company LanzaTech needs shareholder approval for a rescue deal from US billionaire Vinod Khosla and his associated funds to get on a more even financial keel.

Background: LanzaTech's share price has dropped below the level where it can remain Nasdaq-listed unless it does a stock split following falling revenue, widening losses, and concerted shareholder pressure to become profitable. The deal will give Khosla control of the company again.

Main players: LanzaTech, Khosla Ventures, Guardians of NZ Superannuation, Carbon Direct Capital Management.

LanzaTech shareholders appear to have little choice other than to vote in favour at its upcoming annual general meeting of what amounts to a rescue deal from US venture capital firm Khosla Ventures.

US billionaire Vinod Khosla was one of the first investors in the company back in 2007 when it was

This expansion aligns with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals of boosting tourism and international connectivity while offering travelers increased access to one of the region’s most dynamic economies. By enhancing its travel network and leveraging codeshare partnerships, Air France aims to capture a larger share of both business and leisure travel, while promoting its hallmark French service and sustainability initiatives.

Air France Expands Gulf Operations with Ambitious Paris–Riyadh Daily Flight Plan Aligned to Saudi Market Growth

Air France is strengthening its footprint in the Middle East with the announcement of its planned daily service between Paris and Riyadh, signaling a new chapter in the airline’s regional expansion. This move comes shortly after the successful launch of its first direct connection between Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport. The planned frequency increase reflects rising demand and reinforces Air France’s strategic interest in Saudi Arabia, a market witnessing dynamic transformation under its Vision 2030 blueprint.

A Renewed Commitment to the Saudi Market

The launch of this direct service underscores Air France’s determination to reassert its presence in the Kingdom. The airline views Saudi Arabia not only as a fast-emerging tourism and investment hub but also as a vital link in its global route network. According to senior airline executives, this expansion is a response to a significant increase in passenger demand—both from tourists and business travelers seeking easier access to the Kingdom’s evolving economy.

Saudi Arabia has been actively working to boost international connectivity as it diversifies away from oil dependency and attracts global businesses, tourists, and investors. Air France’s decision to operate daily flights comes as a strategic response to this surge in international interest.

Strategic Growth and Network Connectivity

Air France’s ambitions in the region are not limited to frequency increases. The carrier is actively forging new partnerships and reinforcing its regional network through codeshare agreements, particularly with local Gulf carriers. These collaborations are enabling Air France to offer seamless travel options to passengers flying beyond Riyadh to other cities within Saudi Arabia and across the broader Gulf region.

The expanded connectivity strengthens Air France’s overall offering, making it more competitive and accessible for global travelers wishing to fly into Saudi Arabia via Europe. The Paris–Riyadh link is expected to serve as a critical artery for trade, tourism, and diplomacy, enhancing cross-cultural exchange and business cooperation.

Leveraging the Allure of French Excellence

Air France is not only banking on convenience and strategic location—it is also leveraging its French heritage to appeal to discerning global travelers. The airline continues to promote its signature in-flight French culinary experience, luxury service, and refined aesthetics. These elements remain central to the Air France brand and play a key role in differentiating the airline in a competitive global market.

This emphasis on French elegance is particularly well-received in markets like the Middle East, where there is a strong appreciation for high-end service and unique travel experiences. From carefully curated menus featuring French cuisine to cabin interiors inspired by Parisian design, the airline offers a taste of France at 35,000 feet.

A Focus on Sustainable Growth

Air France is not just expanding routes—it is also prioritizing sustainability as a core component of its growth strategy. The airline continues to lead the aviation industry in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), holding the distinction of being the world’s largest buyer of SAF among commercial airlines.

As part of its long-term decarbonization goals, the airline is incorporating new-generation aircraft that consume less fuel and emit fewer carbon emissions. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, both known for their operational efficiency and environmental advantages, are being increasingly integrated into Air France’s long-haul fleet.

Additionally, the airline’s sustainability efforts extend beyond fuel efficiency. Air France has implemented a series of operational changes, such as weight reduction initiatives, more direct routing for shorter flights, and waste reduction strategies onboard, all contributing to its ambitious environmental roadmap.

Technology-Driven Passenger Experience

Enhancing customer satisfaction remains a top priority for Air France. The airline is investing heavily in digital transformation to improve the travel experience from booking to baggage claim. Innovations such as AI-powered check-in kiosks, upgraded in-flight entertainment systems, and personalized services are being gradually rolled out across the airline’s long-haul network.

Frequent flyers can expect a more intuitive and streamlined journey, while occasional travelers benefit from a more customized and responsive service environment. This tech-forward approach is intended to meet the evolving expectations of a digitally-savvy passenger base, particularly in business and premium classes.

A Future-Focused Partnership with Saudi Arabia

Air France’s growing involvement in the Saudi market aligns with the Kingdom’s efforts to position itself as a global tourism and business destination. With mega-projects like NEOM, the Red Sea development, and Diriyah Gate driving tourism and investment interest, connectivity between Europe and Saudi Arabia has never been more important.

By scaling up its service to Riyadh, Air France is not only enhancing its own commercial prospects but also playing a vital role in facilitating Saudi Arabia’s ambitious transformation goals. The airline is expected to contribute significantly to inbound tourism from Europe while also providing Saudi travelers with greater access to global destinations via its Paris hub.

Conclusion

The planned daily Air France flights between Paris and Riyadh represent more than just a route expansion—they symbolize a broader commitment to fostering global connectivity, cultural exchange, and sustainable aviation. As Saudi Arabia continues its journey of rapid economic development, Air France is positioning itself as a key enabler, offering premium service, environmental leadership, and seamless travel options that support the region’s long-term aspirations.

Air France is launching daily flights between Paris and Riyadh to meet rising travel demand and strengthen its role in Saudi Arabia’s rapidly expanding aviation and tourism market. This move supports the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 and reinforces Air France’s Gulf expansion strategy.

With a renewed focus on strategic growth, deepened regional partnerships, and a dedication to sustainable practices, Air France is charting a clear course toward a more connected and environmentally responsible future—one flight at a time.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-100-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 14:02:12.241853

At present, the Kolkata metro railway operates 37 rakes with regenerative braking features.
Regenerative braking has reduced carbon emissions by 13,500 tonnes in the previous financial year, the official said.
In a study conducted by Metro Railway Kolkata, it has been observed that 17-20 per cent regeneration of electricity is possible, he said.
“The unique advanced 'Regenerative Braking System' technology reduces wear and tear of brake, wheel, brake disc as well as maintenance costs,” he said.","Kolkata: The Kolkata metro railway has started using a sustainable braking technology in its rakes, as part of its quest to reduce carbon emissions and save energy costs, an official said on Sunday.

All the new rakes that are being introduced in the city's rapid transit system feature ‘Regenerative Braking', he said.

“The technology allows a train's electric motors to operate in reverse (like a generator) during braking, leading to conversion of the train's kinetic energy back into electrical energy, rather than wasting it in the form of heating of wheels or brake shoes,” a Metro Railway Kolkata spokesperson said.

At present, the Kolkata metro railway operates 37 rakes with regenerative braking features.

“The total energy regenerated in the year 2024-25 – by usage of the system in 37 rakes – has been 1.08 crore units, which have saved around Rs 8.2 crore in energy cost,” he said.

Regenerative braking has reduced carbon emissions by 13,500 tonnes in the previous financial year, the official said.

In a study conducted by Metro Railway Kolkata, it has been observed that 17-20 per cent regeneration of electricity is possible, he said.

“This is a step forward for saving energy and reducing the use of fossil fuel. Urban metro systems like those in London, Tokyo and New York also use regenerative braking,” the spokesperson said.

“The unique advanced 'Regenerative Braking System' technology reduces wear and tear of brake, wheel, brake disc as well as maintenance costs,” he said.

In another green initiative, Metro Railway Kolkata has taken up the work of setting up a 4-MW ‘Advanced Chemical Cell (ACC)' battery storage system, “which is the first of its kind in Indian Railways”.

The batteries have arrived and the system is expected to be operational in the middle of July, 2025, he added.

The announcement follows the launch of the carrier’s first direct route between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and King Khalid International Airport.

Stefan Gumuseli, the airline’s general manager for India and the Middle East, outlined the importance of the new route for the Air France-KLM Group and said it reflects the airline’s ambition to reestablish its presence in the Saudi market.

The decision comes in response to growing demand from travelers and investors eager to access the Kingdom’s expanding economic opportunities.

The new route marks a strategic step for Air France as it expands operations in the region and aligns with the growing connectivity between Europe and Saudi Arabia.

Talking to Arab News, Gumuseli said: “We’re starting with three weekly flights in mid-June, then gradually increasing to five. Our first major goal is to move to a daily service.”

He added that the market is not only outward-looking; the airline is also responding to rising inbound demand for Saudi Arabia, noting that it is experiencing almost exponential year-on-year growth.

Gumuseli also pointed to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, which reflects a strong commitment to developing tourism, hospitality, and culture, supported by substantial ongoing investments. He said: “All these megaprojects are a clear sign that tourism is booming. We have a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia and are expanding our cooperation.”

His comments were echoed by Air France’s Senior Vice President for Benelux, Asia, India, the Middle East, and East Africa Bas Gerressen, who told Arab News: “Tourism is a very important factor, but we also need traffic, which has grown significantly over the past two years.

“The more connectivity there is between the two countries, the more economic exchange will flourish in both directions,” Gerressen added.

Air France-KLM has entered into codeshare agreements to strengthen its network connectivity.

“We also place our code on these flights. So, when you consider all that connectivity from both sides, demand can only grow,” Gerressen said.

He added: “I believe Saudi Arabia has many premium travelers, and we need to reach them in specific markets. We already have strong demand across our business, premium and economy classes.”

At the same time, the airline is leveraging its distinctive French identity.

‘We position ourselves as a truly French brand — luxury, elegance, sophistication ... The French Touch. You can feel it the moment you board,” said Gerressen.

High-end products, gourmet in-flight dining, La Premiere lounges, and exclusive cabin experiences all reinforce this premium positioning. “We offer one of the best cabins in the region with our new first class, featuring a seat with five windows and just four seats in the entire cabin. It’s a revolution in the industry,” Gerressen added.

He emphasized the cabin crew’s vital role in shaping the passenger experience, highlighting their attentiveness and approachable demeanor.

As part of its sustainability strategy, Air France is adopting a comprehensive approach across its operations.

“Each new generation of aircraft reduces CO₂ emissions by up to 25 percent. Today, 28 percent of our fleet consists of these new aircraft, and our goal is to increase this figure to 80 percent by 2030,” Gerressen said.

The airline is also the world’s leading buyer of sustainable aviation fuel.

Gumuseli said: “We account for nearly 16 percent of global SAF usage, despite representing only 3 percent of total global kerosene consumption.”

Air France is investing in technology to enhance the passenger experience.

“We’ve decided to install high-speed Wi-Fi on board. In the event of a delay, passengers will receive updates about their connecting flights directly on their screens. With data and technology, we can truly personalize the service,” Gumuseli said.

“Our target customers include expatriates living in Saudi Arabia and tourists wishing to travel to Europe, North America, South America or Africa. Businesses are also a key audience, given the strong commercial ties between France and Saudi Arabia. We aim to serve all these segments,” said Gumuseli.

“Religious tourism should not be overlooked. Pilgrims can now combine Umrah with a more tourist-oriented experience,” he added.

Gerressen stressed the importance of the eVisa: “It is crucial. Simplifying the visa process will be essential in convincing more people to visit Saudi Arabia.”

JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia plans to raise the cultural sector’s contribution to gross domestic product to 3 percent — or SR180 billion ($48 billion) — by 2030, up from under 1 percent, according to Minister of Culture Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Farhan.

In an interview with Al-Eqtisadiah, the minister said the sector has already surpassed its previous 0.91 percent GDP share, with Vision 2030 targets being met ahead of schedule.

“Vision 2030 forms the foundation of the Ministry of Culture’s strategy and direction,” he said.

“By 2030, we envision a cultural environment that nurtures talent, encourages innovation both locally and internationally, and supports the flourishing of creative and cultural enterprises.” Prince Badr said in the interview.

“Ultimately, our goal is to increase the sector’s contribution to GDP to 3 percent, equivalent to SR180 billion,” he said. “This represents the core mission of the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated bodies in driving an ambitious cultural transformation.”

Since the ministry’s founding in 2018, employment in the sector has jumped 318 percent, while the number of cultural graduates reached 28,800 in 2024, up 79 percent from 2018. The ministry has also issued over 9,000 licenses, while cultural associations and amateur clubs surged from 28 to 993.

“One notable outcome is the increase in the percentage of citizens who believe culture is important—from under 70 percent to 92 percent,” Prince Badr said. The ministry also oversees national celebrations such as Founding Day and Flag Day and has documented 9,317 antiquities sites and 25,000 urban heritage locations.

Saudi Arabia has now met its Vision 2030 target of having eight UNESCO World Heritage sites, with Al-Faw joining the list in 2024. Cultural event attendance exceeded 23.5 million between 2021 and 2024, and major festivals such as the Red Sea Film Festival and Islamic Arts Biennale have become global draws.

The Cultural Scholarship Program has awarded scholarships to 1,222 students studying at over 120 institutions across countries, including the US, the UK, and France. The program’s flexible design — no age limit or required academic background — has broadened participation. “Today, scholarship recipients are pursuing degrees in fields such as music, theater, and visual arts,” the minister said.

Through the Cultural Development Fund, the ministry has disbursed SR377 million to more than 120 projects. “Key areas of growth include heritage, music, and fashion. More than 1,200 creatives and entrepreneurs have benefited from its development services,” he added.

“Globally, there is increasing recognition of culture’s role in sustainable economic value creation,” the minister said. “Our role is to preserve and promote cultural identity while making it accessible and economically valuable.”

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia welcomed 116 million tourists in 2024, exceeding its annual visitor target for the second year in a row, the official data showed.

According to the Ministry of Tourism’s latest annual statistical report, the figure includes 29.7 million inbound tourists, an 8 percent increase year on year, and 86.2 million domestic trips, up 5 percent from 2023.

The milestone reflects the continued acceleration of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 strategy, which positions tourism as a central driver of economic diversification.

After surpassing its original 100 million visitor goal six years ahead of schedule in 2023, Saudi Arabia has revised its ambitions upward, now aiming to attract 150 million tourists annually by 2030. This figure is split between 70 million international and 80 million domestic visitors.

In a post on X, Minister of Tourism Ahmed Al-Khateeb said: “The 2024 Annual Statistical Report showcases the sector’s remarkable growth and its role in enabling Saudi Vision2030, a record performance achieved with the support and guidance of the Kingdom’s visionary leadership.”

Total tourism spending in 2024 hit SR283.8 billion ($75.6 billion), with inbound tourists contributing SR168.5 billion, up 19 percent from 2023, while domestic tourist expenditure reached SR115.3 billion, a 1 percent rise.

“The tourism sector continued to achieve record growth, reaffirming its transformation into a key driver of economic development and a fundamental pillar in advancing and diversifying the national economy,” the minister said.

Inbound tourism also reached a record monthly peak in March with 3.2 million visitors. The average international tourist stayed 19 nights and spent SR5,669 per trip.

A standout development in 2024 was the continued rise in non-religious tourism, now representing 59 percent of inbound visits compared to 44 percent in 2019.

Leisure and holiday travel topped this category, with related spending reaching SR36.4 billion.

Makkah remained the top destination, drawing 17.4 million overnight visitors, and Egypt was the leading source market with 3.2 million arrivals.

Regional analysis revealed that Asia and the Pacific accounted for the largest share of inbound tourists, at 33 percent, followed by the Middle East and North Africa at 28 percent, and the Gulf Cooperation Council at 27 percent.

Europe contributed 8 percent, while both the Americas and Africa each made up 2 percent of total visitors.

The sustained growth reflects the Kingdom’s continued focus on developing its tourism infrastructure and global outreach.

The ministry noted that this report highlights the exceptional and accelerated growth achieved by the sector through targeted marketing campaigns and support programs, contributing to the sector’s record-breaking performance.

RIYADH: Oman’s insured non-oil exports reached 61.2 million Omani rials ($159 million) in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 6 percent increase from the same period last year, according to Credit Oman.

The sultanate’s export credit agency, which provides trade insurance and guarantees to support domestic and international exchange, cited growth in construction materials, petrochemicals, mining, and agriculture as key drivers, the Oman News Agency reported.

This comes as Oman’s broader non-oil exports grew 8.6 percent year on year to 1.61 billion rials, now making up 28.6 percent of total exports. The growth reflects ongoing efforts to boost non-oil trade, support domestic industries, attract foreign investment, localize development initiatives, and offer incentives to the private sector.

The ONA report stated: “Khalil bin Ahmed Al Harthy, CEO of Credit Oman, explained that the volume of insured export sales in the building and construction materials sector witnessed a growth of 24 percent, with a total value of 27.16 million rials.”

Exports in the petrochemicals and plastics sector climbed 45 percent to 9.2 million riyals.

The mining sector experienced the largest percentage growth, jumping 150 percent to 570,000 rials. Meanwhile, agricultural exports surged 96 percent to nearly 5 million rials, driven by increased demand and favorable market conditions.

Despite the overall growth, Al-Harthy noted setbacks in some sectors, including packaging, fisheries, and apparel, adding that the results still reflect the broader progress of the national economy and the government’s continued push for economic development.

“He pointed out that Credit Oman is making significant efforts to support Omani manufacturers and exporters, contributing to boosting their sales both locally and internationally by offering a range of insurance services and overcoming the challenges associated with Omani products entering global and new markets,” the OMA report added.

In its earlier outlook, Credit Oman projected strong growth potential for the country’s non-oil exports in 2025. The agency cited an estimated untapped export capacity of 5 billion rials, according to the International Trade Centre.

However, it emphasized that realizing this potential would depend on evolving global trade conditions, particularly the impact of emerging tariff and non-tariff barriers, geopolitical uncertainty, and shifts in global economic trends.

This growth comes after a challenging 2024, when Oman’s non-oil exports declined 16 percent due in part to a reclassification of high-value fuel-related goods into the oil and gas category.

The 2025 rebound suggests improved export diversification, aided by Credit Oman’s efforts and favorable conditions in sectors like agriculture and plastics.

LONDON: Most stock markets in the Gulf were trading higher on Sunday, relatively unscathed by escalating tension in the region following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, as investors assessed the potential economic impact of the conflict.

US forces struck Iran’s three main nuclear sites late on Saturday, and President Donald Trump warned Tehran it would face more devastating attacks if it does not agree to peace.

By around 0915 GMT, Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index TASI had edged 0.4 percent higher, helped by a 0.7 percent rise in the country’s biggest lender, Saudi National Bank. Qatar’s benchmark index QSI had gained 0.2 percent, reversing slight early losses.

“It is admittedly a bit surprising to see regional equities shrugging off the US strikes on Iran with relative ease, with opening losses having pared relatively rapidly,” said Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone.

Brown said that the markets had already discounted the probability of a US attack, and investors anticipated a swifter resolution to the conflict following the attacks.

The market is focused on whether the conflict spreads to other nations in the region, with there being no sign of that happening right now, he added.

Bahrain and Kuwait, home to US bases, made preparations on Sunday for the possibility of the conflict spreading to their territory, with Bahrain urging drivers to avoid main roads and Kuwait establishing shelters in a ministries complex.

Kuwait’s premier index reversed early losses to trade 0.3 percent higher by around the same time, while Bahrain’s main index was flat. The Omani share index MSX30 was up 0.5 percent.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, Egypt’s benchmark index EGX30 was trading 1.7 percent higher, while the main index in Tel Aviv was up around 1 percent to reach its all-time high.

RIYADH: Cement sales in Saudi Arabia climbed 6.4 percent year on year in the first quarter of 2025 to 13.4 million tonnes, driven by a construction surge tied to Vision 2030 megaprojects.

According to data from Al Yamama Cement covering the Kingdom’s 17 producers, local sales accounted for nearly 13 million tonnes, while exports edged up to 408,000 tonnes.

Al Yamama Cement led the domestic market with 1.68 million tonnes, followed by Saudi Cement at 1.33 million tonnes and Qassim Cement with 1.25 million tonnes.

Saudi Arabia is powering through the largest construction surge in its history, a pillar of the Vision 2030 diversification plan. A Bloomberg report this month valued the live roster of real estate and infrastructure schemes at roughly $1.3 trillion, ranging from Riyadh’s driverless metro grid and entertainment hubs like Qiddiya to the brand-new cities of NEOM on the Red Sea coast and New Murabba in the capital’s northwest.

Those giga-projects, along with heritage revamps such as Diriyah Gate and the Red Sea’s string of luxury resorts, have now moved well beyond site grading and piling.

Gulf Construction, a trade journal for the building and construction industries, noted in May that major project packages are entering the concrete-intensive vertical-build phase, where tower cores, bridge piers, and precast facades consume significantly more cement and clinker than earlier earthworks.

In short, the Kingdom’s transition from drawing board to steel-and-concrete reality is fueling an insatiable appetite for building materials — and cement producers are gearing up their kilns to meet it.

Momentum kept building after March. Domestic sales jumped 42.9 percent year on year to 4.18 million tonnes in April, while exports rose 26.9 percent to 703,000 tonnes, according to Al Jazira Capital’s latest dispatch survey. Contractors are pouring concrete early, keen to stay ahead of the summer heat and tighten project timelines.

Profits do not rise equally

Higher volumes did not translate into across-the-board gains. International Cement Review’s CemNet bulletin said in June that sector-wide net profit fell 16 percent in the first quarter to about SR648 million ($173 million) despite stronger turnover.

Yamama Cement posted about SR142 million in earnings — up 23 percent — while Saudi Cement slipped nearly 5 percent to SR108 million. Qassim Cement improved 27 percent to roughly SR94 million, but Al Jouf Cement stayed in the red at around SR15 million.

Producers faced an added challenge from Saudi Aramco’s fuel price revision, effective Jan. 1, which several companies warned would raise kiln fuel costs by around 10 percent.

Inventory cushions remain thick. Al Yamama figures show Yanbu holding 18.9 million tonnes of clinker at end-March, with Southern Province close behind on 18.1 million tonnes. Across the sector, stockpiles cover roughly nine months of normal domestic demand, allowing firms to throttle kilns if margins tighten.

Modern kilns slash fuel use

According to Global Cement’s April report, engineering firm Sinoma has finished erecting a new preheater tower as part of Yamama Cement’s relocation and upgrade project south of Riyadh.

The upgrade increases the former 10,000-tonne-per-day line to 12,500 tonnes, with Sinoma noting it had to dismantle, relocate, and integrate large equipment while installing the latest kiln technology.

Completion of the tower clears the way for commissioning and final handover of the higher-capacity, fuel-efficient plant.

The efficiency drive extends to the Red Sea coast, where Yanbu Cement’s 34 megawatts waste-heat-recovery system already supplies about a quarter of the plant’s electricity.

The upgrades are crucial because older kiln designs waste a great deal of fuel. According to the European Cement Association, long-dry kilns consume about one-third more energy than the latest preheater–pre-calciner models, while old wet kilns can burn up to 85 percent more.

By contrast, modern PH-PC lines require only about 3.3 gigajoules of heat to produce one tonne of clinker — roughly the energy contained in 30 litres of petrol. Transitioning from long-dry or wet kilns to PH-PC technology significantly reduces fuel consumption, lowers production costs, and cuts carbon emissions — all critical advantages as energy prices continue to rise.

With Saudi Aramco’s January fuel-tariff hike expected to raise kiln-energy bills by around 10 percent, plants that already sip less fuel will feel the pinch far less — and that cost edge is flowing straight into sharper export offers, reinforcing the Kingdom’s competitive position in nearby markets.",https://www.arabnews.pk/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarkpakistan/public/main-image/2025/06/22/4614126-2087809185.jpeg?itok=r9TPFQY3,N,,2025-06-22 10:05:54.715990

The three aerospace companies plan to develop the future ENGHE (European Next Generation Helicopter Engine), a new 100% European engine for Europe’s next generation of military rotorcraft, scheduled to enter into service around 2040. At Paris Air Show, a long-term partnership agreement was signed to this effect.

The partners are convinced European armed forces need a new engine with advanced design maturity and affordable operating and maintenance costs. To tackle this challenge, workshare will be distributed equally between Safran, MTU and Avio Aero. The companies’ cooperation will form the core of an extended and long-term European partnership involving participants from other European nations.

This increased partnership underscores the strong progress made on the project over the past two years: Safran and MTU announced their collaboration on a new helicopter engine in 2023. Last year, the two companies established a 50/50 joint venture, EURA (EUropean Military Rotorcraft Engine Alliance), to develop the engine. Now, Avio Aero will contribute its expertise and capabilities in military helicopter engines.

Cédric Goubet, CEO of Safran Helicopter Engines, commented: “We are delighted to extend our cooperation in the field of future military helicopter engines with Avio Aero. The next step in this decisive cooperation to strengthen Europe’s autonomy in the field of defence and security will be to respond to the specific call for a future helicopter engine within the European Defence Fund, with the versatile European team of top European aerospace partners that has already been set up under the coordination of EURA.”

Michael Schreyögg, Chief Program Officer of MTU Aero Engines, commented: “Achieving breakthrough success requires a strong alliance of industry leaders from across the continent. The fact that Avio Aero, MTU and Safran have joined forces underlines the importance of this program in further reinforcing European sovereignty and strengthening the European supply chain. Together, we are starting the next chapter in Europe’s defence history and adding another success story to our record of cooperation. By maintaining strong relationships and involving partners across Europe, we are shaping the future.”

Riccardo Procacci, CEO of Avio Aero, commented: “We are proud to join forces with Safran Helicopter Engines and MTU Aero Engines to collaborate on the development of a European turboshaft engine that will power the next generation military rotorcraft. This agreement is a major opportunity for the aerospace industry to work together in support of Europe’s strategic autonomy and technological leadership. At Avio Aero, we are excited to play a key role in this collaboration, offering our industrial capabilities and expertise in turboshaft engine development to meet future needs of European armed forces.”

During the ceremony, Mr. Sean White, European Defence Agency’s Director for Industry, Synergies and Enablers, praised the signatories and highlighted the urgency and significance of cross-border industrial cooperation for reinforcing our continent’s sovereignty and supply chain security.

This partnership between Avio Aero, MTU and Safran Helicopter Engines will enhance the robustness and relevance of the proposal for the European Defence Fund’s specific call for a next-generation helicopter engine. The proposal will be coordinated by EURA and submitted to the European Commission in October 2025.

The future ENGHE (European Next Generation Helicopter Engine) will feature breakthrough technologies that will considerably increase its efficiency while reducing its operating and maintenance costs. It will be particularly well suited to the ENGRT (European Next Generation Rotorcraft Technologies) and NGRC (Next Generation Rotorcraft Capability) projects. ENGHE’s exceptional characteristics will provide these future helicopters with enhanced capabilities, such as greater range, higher speed, improved maneuverability and increased availability. In addition to these improvements, the engine will also feature reduced fuel burn, be 100% compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and incorporate enhanced electric hybridization.",https://www.edrmagazine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ENGHE-European-Helicopter-Engine.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 10:06:00.548185

In fact, if you ask, it is one of the most commonly loathed inconveniences of everyday life. Archer Aviation's (NYSE: ACHR) goal is to help alleviate the traffic pressure in major cities around the world. How? With electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) taxi networks. Electric air taxis take off vertically and go from point-to-point terminals across metropolitan areas, greatly reducing travel times. In theory, at least.

Investors are excited about the prospect, sending Archer Aviation shares soaring in the last year as it gets closer and closer to operating a taxi network. Will Archer Aviation disrupt the transportation market? Should you buy the stock? The answer may surprise you.

Flying above the traffic

Founded in 2018, Archer Aviation has devoted the last few years to designing and building its Midnight model aircraft. It already has some approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to operate an air taxi service, and it is currently working to get FAA approvals for the Midnight model. If approved, the company has already established multiple partnerships to bring the eVTOL concept to cities around the world. eVTOLs are different from helicopters in that they use battery-electric power and much quieter propellers, which will enable them to operate in areas with more people.

For example, Archer Aviation has a partnership with United Airlines to bring a point-to-point network to New York City, helping passengers skip traffic as they head to the airport. It is working with cities around the globe, including Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. It is even a working sponsor of the Los Angeles Olympic Games, with eVTOL trips set to take place during the 2028 event, if all goes according to plan.

Archer Aviation raised a lot of money to help fund its efforts. As of the first quarter of 2025, it had paid-in capital of $2.79 billion. Recently, it did another capital raise of $850 million with a common stock offering at $10 a share. The company estimates it has $2 billion of liquidity to fund its growth plans. It may need every penny. The company reported $450 million in negative free cash flow this year.

Will people be willing to pay up for a ticket?

The business model for Archer Aviation is still under development. First, it needs to get full approval from the FAA. Then, it will start selling its Midnight aircraft to customers or work with partners to operate its own taxi networks. Each air taxi will be manned by a pilot and has room for four passengers and their luggage.

The Midnight is estimated to sell for $5 million per vehicle, with likely slim profit margins, especially if there are bulk discounts like with airplane sales. Boeing, for reference, had a gross margin of just over 10% at its peak (it is much lower today). If each ticket costs $100 per passenger, there are 10 flights a day, and all four tickets are booked on every flight, that is $4,000 in daily revenue for each eVTOL. Annually, that is $1.46 million in revenue for each aircraft.

While that may seem like a lot of money, it will take years for operators of the air taxis to make up for their upfront aircraft purchases and operating costs at these ticket prices. Pilots need salaries, and the electric battery power is not free. In order to operate profitably, tickets for eVTOL routes will need to cost much more than $100. It is unclear how much demand there would be for a product like this, especially if potential passengers are already paying for an airline ticket.

This, in my mind, is the largest hurdle to Archer Aviation's business model. Investors should be worried about this more than FAA approval.

Data by YCharts.

Disruption is a long way away

Even if Archer Aviation keeps making progress with its electric air taxi, it will be a long time before any disruption happens to traffic in major cities. 10,000 air taxi trips a day -- which would take hundreds if not a thousand taxis flying around in a single city, something that is likely not going to be deemed safe by the FAA -- may take an equivalent amount of trips off the road. This is nowhere near the traffic figures in a major city like New York. On the Brooklyn Bridge alone, over 100,000 cars travel every day.

Traffic problems will not be solved by eVTOLs anytime soon. That does not mean there is no demand for a point-to-point air taxi network. Perhaps a few wealthier customers will be willing to spend hundreds of dollars a ticket to skip out on an hour of traffic heading to the airport and back. What should concern investors is the business model for Archer Aviation and the stock's valuation.

Archer Aviation has a market cap of $6.5 billion, and that is before considering its recent stock offering. It is generating zero revenue today. In the future, it may sell 100 eVTOL units a year, which could translate into $500 million in revenue. With slim profit margins, this would likely turn into less than $100 million in bottom-line earnings, and that is many years from now. Its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) would still be sky high. The company is burning a lot of cash. You get the picture.

I don't believe Archer Aviation can solve traffic issues in cities, and I believe the stock is overvalued today. Avoid adding this hot stock to your portfolio right now.

The announcement came a week after another announcement of the A321XLR with GTF engines receiving type certification from the European Union Safety Agency (EASA).
The GTF family has also been hit by inflight failures that could have caused serious accidents.
The PW1500G engines, also geared turbofans, have also faced issues with inflight shutdowns that the GTF-A will need to avoid.
It will also power the A320neo family and offer improvements of a few percentage points across several key metrics.","The Pratt & Whitney PW1100G, a variant of the engine series marketed as the P&W GTF, used on the A320neo, has received a further update, the GTF Advantage (GTF-A). This engine was announced in December 2021, with the manufacturer claiming it to have better fuel efficiency, durability, and the ability to deliver high thrust at hot and high-altitude airports.

This article explores the major differences between the GTF series and the GTF-A, as well as the methods used to achieve these distinctions. It then examines when the GTF-A will enter service and the pitfalls experienced by the PW1100G that will need to be avoided. What will become clear is that the GTF-A is not a radically different engine. Rather, it is an improvement that offers P&W the chance to wipe the slate clean after multiple issues with the PW1100G.

What Are The Key Differences?

The GTF-A builds on the GTF series, which already offers the lowest fuel consumption for single-aisle aircraft. The GTF-A offers even greater fuel efficiency, with claims of a 1% improvement. Tom Pelland, the company's GTF chief engineer, claims that the engine will have 8% greater thrust at hot and high airports, and 4% better thrust at sea level. Engines often struggle in these conditions that cause reduced air pressure. It also builds on the successful testing of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the GTF series, with Pratt & Whitney aiming for the engine to be 100% SAF compatible. The improvements will enable airlines to fly longer, carry higher payloads, and have a reduced environmental impact.

Pratt & Whitney has achieved this progression on an already successful engine through several advancements. The company's engineers have increased core airflow by optimizing the active clearance control between the turbine and seals, lowered the high-pressure compressor temperatures, and used more durable coatings and blisk rotors.

Risk Deurloo, President of Commercial Engines for Pratt & Whitney, commented on what these advancements will mean for the aviation industry. He said:

“GTF engines already offer the lowest fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions for single-aisle aircraft. The GTF Advantage engine extends that lead and enhances aircraft capability, providing more thrust and even more value to operators of A320neo family aircraft, especially on longer-range aircraft like the A321XLR, all with a more durable configuration.”

The GTF-A also emerges from a different context than the original GTF turbofan. The original GTF brought new geared technology to the commercial aviation industry. This ground has already been broken for the GTF-A. Engineers were able to use 100,000 hours of engine and rig testing across the GTF family and 40 million flight hours to develop an improved engine.

Why Was The P&W GTF So Revolutionary?

In most cases, a turbofan's turbine and fan rotate at the same speed. The PW1000G family bucks this trend as a geared turbofan, a design decision shared with the GTF-A engine. A geared turbofan is fitted with a gearbox, allowing the turbine and fan to rotate at different and optimum speeds. This brings advantages in terms of fuel consumption and reduced noise pollution.

This technology was not entirely new with the P&W GTF. Turbomeca Aspin developed small-geared turbofans in the 1950s, and the Garrett TFE731 and Lycoming ALF 502 engines went into production in the 1970s. However, the idea didn't catch on due to concerns about weight and reliability. General Electric and Safran opted not to use geared technology when developing the CFM LEAP family for this reason.

The table below outlines the key specifications of the PW1100G. This is the engine from the P&W GTF family that the GTF-A is most closely derived from:

The successful use of geared technology by Pratt & Whitney has inspired some other manufacturers to develop geared turbofans. Rolls-Royce has been developing its UltraFan since 2016. The scaled-down UltraFan 30 is a clear competitor to the PW1100G. It is designed for single-aisle aircraft, generating 30,000 lbf (130 kN) of thrust. The manufacturer plans to run this engine by 2028.

Powering The Same Aircraft

As well as using the same propulsion methodology, the GTF-A will also power the same aircraft family: the A320neo. The engine will compete with the CFM International LEAP-1A and attempt to make a stronger case for geared turbofans.

If it can be reliable, the GTF-A will be an enticing option for A320neo customers. This jet was designed to be 15-20% more efficient than previous models, demonstrating a clear alignment in missions. The table below details the A320neo's specifications. Although the A320neo family includes the A319neo, A320neo, A321neo, A321LR, and A321XLR, all of which have the PW1100G as an engine option, the table consists of data for the A320neo itself:

The GTF-A is also likely to reach the thousands of orders achieved by the PW1100G. As of May 2025, 3,954 A320neo jets have been built, but thousands more are still to come. Airbus has achieved a total of 11,128 A320neo orders.

When Will The GTF-A Enter Service?

The GTF-A has achieved US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification, and deliveries are expected to begin later in 2025. The announcement came a week after another announcement of the A321XLR with GTF engines receiving type certification from the European Union Safety Agency (EASA).

In February 2025, when this announcement was made, over 2,200 GTF-powered aircraft had been delivered to 80 customers worldwide. These engines improved fuel efficiency by 20% and saved over 2 billion gallons of fuel. Airlines flying with GTF turbofans have reduced their CO2 output by 20 million metric tons. The engine also remained popular despite groundings and reliability issues, and the company had 11,000 engine orders and commitments across the GTF family.

Deurloo, President of Commercial Engines for Pratt & Whitney, commented on the significance of the certifications for the company's storied history. He said:

“With this certification and engine deliveries on track for later this year, it’s fitting we mark these milestones in 2025, as Pratt & Whitney celebrates a century of powering the future.”

P&W Will Want To Avoid Replicating The PW1100G's Failures

The P&W GTF has had some concerning failures. The manufacturer will want to avoid these problems resurfacing once it launches the GTF-A. Ongoing issues with specific engine parts led RTX, P&W's parent company, to announce that it will be removing 600–700 engines between 2023 and 2026. This was set to require 350 aircraft to be grounded, with a turnaround time of 250-300 days for each jet. The manufacturer would have to remove and reinstall each engine on the wing. Neil Mitchill, RTX's chief, stated that the company would pay out $1 billion in credits for grounded aircraft.

The GTF family has also been hit by inflight failures that could have caused serious accidents. The Indian Airline IndiGo reported four in-flight engine stalls during a climb in October 2019. All were traced to problems with the Low-Pressure Turbine (LPT). The Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) later instructed the airline to replace the engines on 98 of its A320neos.

The PW1500G engines, also geared turbofans, have also faced issues with inflight shutdowns that the GTF-A will need to avoid. These problems were largely with Swiss International Air Lines Airbus A220s. In one case, the engine shut down because a faulty O-ring seal led to a loss of oil pressure. In another incident, a little less than a year later, the engine's low-pressure compressor disintegrated as the jet climbed to 32,000 ft.

GTF-A Is A Chance To Rewrite The History Of Geared Turbofans

In developing the PW1000G family of geared turbofans, Pratt & Whitney aimed to set a new standard of efficiency for the aviation industry. It has achieved this, but only when the engines have been operational. CFM International's concerns about the reliability of geared turbofans may have been vindicated due to the P&W GTF family's groundings and in-flight shutdowns. It is noteworthy that other engine manufacturers haven't clamored to produce geared turbofans.

To some, the GTF-A could represent more of the same. It will also power the A320neo family and offer improvements of a few percentage points across several key metrics. Yet, the GTF-A is also a chance to wipe the slate clean. If this engine can reliably deliver the advantages it offers, other manufacturers will have to take notice.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/engine-2.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 10:06:38.394169

With some union officials unaware of — or unwilling to comply with — settled law, it’s more important than ever for public employees in the state to understand their rights under union representation.
In 2020, Colorado union officials gained mandatory collective bargaining affecting state employees.
Now, union officials want to fundamentally change the state’s labor landscape once again.
In Connecticut, union officials insisted that school cook Tina Curtis abide by a requirement, similar to Pueblo’s, that forced employees to pay union fees.","Imagine starting a job in public service, only to be told you must hand over a cut of each paycheck to a labor union — years after the U.S. Supreme Court has already declared this requirement illegal.

Unfortunately, this isn’t a hypothetical for thousands of public employees in Colorado.

Consider the city of Pueblo, which employs an estimated 2,000 workers. The Pueblo Association of Government Employees union, also called AFSCME Local 1712, claims it can charge so-called “fair share fees” to the technicians, park caretakers, engineers and other employees who help Pueblo run, but who choose not to join the union. That’s according to the active collective bargaining agreement between the city and the union.

The problem? The agreement directly contradicts the U.S. Supreme Court’s Janus decision, where the court, in 2018, ruled that public-sector unions could not force nonmember employees to pay fees to a union.

If union officials are acting on this contract provision and charging fees to nonmembers, they are breaking the law. And even if the provision isn’t being enforced, it still has consequences.

Pueblo’s unconstitutional contract language makes it seem as though an employee’s only options are to join the union and pay dues, or decline union membership and pay up anyway.

It’s not much of a choice — the union is effectively strong-arming employees into joining their ranks.

Pueblo’s contract isn’t even the worst offender in Colorado. The Denver Housing Authority’s contract, enacted this year, says that its 300-plus employees must be full, dues-paying members of the union, AFSCME Local 535.

If enforced, the requirement could be one of the most egregious violations of public employees’ rights of free speech and association anywhere in the country.

With some union officials unaware of — or unwilling to comply with — settled law, it’s more important than ever for public employees in the state to understand their rights under union representation. And because union power has been steadily rising, Pueblo’s and Denver’s problematic union contracts should concern all Colorado workers.

In 2020, Colorado union officials gained mandatory collective bargaining affecting state employees. Three years ago, they landed compulsory organizing of many county workers. And the following year, Colorado lawmakers granted more favorable rules on how certain municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals interact with and speak about unions.

Now, union officials want to fundamentally change the state’s labor landscape once again.

They have pledged to overturn Gov. Jared Polis’s recent veto of Senate Bill 5, legislation that would help unions force private-sector workers to pay a union as a requirement of their job. Union advocates have promised a referendum, making clear that even the governor’s veto pen won’t end their push to expand labor’s reach.

Public workers across the Rocky Mountain State need to know their rights under union representation so that they aren’t vulnerable to misinformation, even when it shows up in their employment contracts.

This sort of misinformation is not limited to Colorado. Indeed, union officials in many other states have been caught using the relative obscurity of labor law to get their way at employees’ expense.

In Connecticut, union officials insisted that school cook Tina Curtis abide by a requirement, similar to Pueblo’s, that forced employees to pay union fees. As in Pueblo, union officials had ample time to comply with the Janus ruling that banned these fees for nonmembers but conveniently ignored it.

Curtis sued union officials with the help of the Fairness Center, the nonprofit law firm where I serve as president, forcing the union to change its collective bargaining agreement and promise not to violate workers’ rights in this way again.

But there’s no way to know exactly how many other employees — in Connecticut, Colorado and nationwide — are being fed similar misinformation and could be funding union activity with money they have a right to withhold.

Of course, labor unions should follow the law when they enter binding legal agreements with employers. But if union officials act like they don’t know the law, it will be up to workers to know — and defend — their rights.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-06-22 10:06:42.123416

Los llamados e-fuels, o combustibles sintéticos, han emergido como una de las grandes apuestas para descarbonizar industrias que, hasta ahora, presentaban enormes dificultades para reducir sus emisiones, como la aviación o el transporte pesado.

Estos combustibles, generados a partir de hidrógeno verde y CO₂ capturado, prometen una menor huella ambiental y una compatibilidad total con las infraestructuras actuales. Sin embargo, el sector enfrenta todavía retos económicos y tecnológicos importantes para que el uso de e-fuels se generalice a gran escala en los próximos años.

¿Cómo se producen los e-fuels y por qué se consideran sostenibles?

Los e-fuels son líquidos o gases sintéticos creados combinando hidrógeno obtenido por electrólisis de agua usando electricidad renovable y dióxido de carbono capturado, normalmente de procesos industriales o incluso directamente del aire. El resultado es un combustible que, al ser quemado, emite el mismo CO₂ que se utilizó en su producción, lo que permite considerarlo carbono neutral, especialmente si toda la cadena se basa en energía renovable.

Algunos ejemplos de estos combustibles son la e-gasolina, e-diesel y e-queroseno, este último con un papel fundamental en la descarbonización de la aviación, donde la electrificación es inviable para vuelos de largo recorrido.

Aplicación en la aviación: avances y desafíos

El sector aéreo está en el punto de mira, ya que la aviación representa aproximadamente el 2,5% de las emisiones globales de CO₂ provenientes de la energía. Los e-fuels, específicamente el denominado e-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel sintético), ofrecen la posibilidad de reducir hasta un 90% las emisiones respecto a los combustibles convencionales de aviación.

Compañías como OXCCU, junto con otras startups y grandes multinacionales, han realizado pruebas exitosas de vuelos utilizando mezclas de e-fuel. Por ejemplo, KLM y la fuerza aérea británica ya han volado utilizando e-SAF, aunque en cantidades limitadas y en demostraciones.

El principal obstáculo para la expansión del e-fuel en aviación sigue siendo el coste: fabricar un litro de e-fuel puede llegar a ser tres veces más caro que el queroseno tradicional. Para paliar esta diferencia, la Unión Europea y el Reino Unido están desplegando políticas de incentivos y marcos regulatorios que establecen cuotas obligatorias de SAF en los próximos años. Por ejemplo, la UE exigirá que el 0,7% del combustible de aviación sea e-SAF en 2030, mientras que el Reino Unido tiene su propio calendario para aumentar el uso de estos productos.

La escalabilidad también representa un reto fundamental. Producir suficiente hidrógeno verde y captar el CO₂ necesario requiere una gran inversión en instalaciones y energías renovables, además de cooperación internacional y un marco regulatorio estable que brinde seguridad a largo plazo a los productores.

Crecimiento del mercado global y tendencias

El mercado de los e-fuels está creciendo de forma acelerada. Según informes recientes, en 2024 el valor global del mercado se situó en torno a los 159.850 millones de dólares y se espera que alcance los 900.800 millones para 2034, lo que supone una tasa de crecimiento anual compuesto cercana al 19%. La controversia sobre los biocombustibles y su impacto en las emisiones también ha influido en el interés hacia los e-fuels.

Europa lidera actualmente en la adopción y desarrollo de e-fuels gracias a su ambiciosa legislación en materia de descarbonización y a la inversión pública y privada en proyectos de I+D. La región Asia-Pacífico, por su parte, se proyecta como la que experimentará una mayor expansión en los próximos años, impulsada por el crecimiento industrial y la necesidad de reducir la contaminación atmosférica.

Empresas como INERATEC GmbH, Carbon Recycling International, Sunfire GmbH, LanzaTech, Siemens Energy AG y Neste Oyj son algunos de los actores destacados en el sector. Además, compañías energéticas consolidadas como TotalEnergies y Uniper SE también están invirtiendo en estas tecnologías, desarrollando plantas piloto y nuevas líneas de negocio para la producción de combustibles sintéticos.

Perspectivas regulatorias y fiscales

La adopción de los e-fuels está estrechamente vinculada a la existencia de marcos regulatorios claros e incentivos fiscales. La Unión Europea, por ejemplo, ha establecido un sistema de comercio de derechos de emisión (ETS), que permite financiar la diferencia de precio entre SAF y queroseno convencional mediante subvenciones específicas, facilitando así la entrada de los combustibles sintéticos en el mercado.

Países como Reino Unido planean que, para 2030, al menos el 10% de todo el combustible de aviación sea sostenible, aumentando a un 22% para 2040. Algunas aerolíneas, como KLM, han comenzado a probar suplementos en el precio de los billetes para financiar la compra de SAF, evaluando la disposición de los consumidores a colaborar en la transición.

Es probable que solo una combinación inteligente de inversión pública, regulación coherente y apoyo del sector privado permita que los e-fuels alcancen precios competitivos y una producción suficiente en la próxima década.

Oportunidades industriales y retos futuros

El desarrollo de los e-fuels abre la puerta a una nueva industria energética que puede transformar la producción y el consumo de combustibles líquidos y gaseosos. La utilización de CO₂ capturado y energía renovable podría convertir a los e-fuels en una pieza clave no solo en la aviación, sino también en sectores difíciles de electrificar, como el transporte marítimo, ferroviario y algunas industrias.

El alto coste inicial de las plantas de producción, el acceso a hidrógeno verde a gran escala y la infraestructura necesaria para el suministro y la logística son algunos de los obstáculos a superar. No obstante, la colaboración entre empresas tecnológicas, energéticas y gobiernos está promoviendo la innovación, con la esperanza de que los e-fuels se conviertan en una parte habitual del mix energético global.",https://www.renovablesverdes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/e-fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 10:07:05.184687

Et si nos frites devenaient les alliées d’un ciel plus vert ? En France, Total Energies mise désormais sur nos huiles de friture usagées pour en faire du carburant d’avion. Un partenariat ambitieux vient d’être signé afin de recycler près de 60 000 tonnes d’huiles chaque année et soutenir le développement des biocarburants durables.

Des huiles de friture collectées pour alimenter les futures bioraffineries

À l’occasion du salon du Bourget, Total Energies a officialisé un accord avec Quatra, un acteur spécialisé dans la récupération d’huiles alimentaires. Ensemble, ils prévoient de collecter 60 000 tonnes d’huiles de cuisson usagées par an, principalement issues des restaurants et de l’industrie agroalimentaire dans plusieurs pays européens.

Ces huiles, une fois récoltées, seront utilisées dans deux bioraffineries françaises : celle de La Mède, déjà en activité près de Marseille, et celle de Grandpuits, encore en cours de transformation. Cette dernière devrait ouvrir ses portes en 2026. Toutes deux sont conçues pour transformer des déchets organiques en carburants plus respectueux de l’environnement.

Un objectif ambitieux pour réduire l’empreinte carbone de l’aviation

Total Energies ne cache pas son ambition : produire à terme 500 000 tonnes de carburants durables d’aviation chaque année d’ici 2028. Ces biocarburants, appelés SAF (pour Sustainable Aviation Fuel), sont censés représenter une alternative plus écologique au kérosène traditionnel.

Derrière cette démarche, il y a aussi une pression réglementaire croissante. Depuis peu, les compagnies aériennes opérant au départ de l’Union européenne sont tenues d’incorporer au moins 2 % de SAF dans leur carburant. Cette part minimum passera à 6 % d’ici 2030. Autant dire que les acteurs du secteur n’ont plus vraiment le choix s’ils veulent rester dans les clous.

Un levier stratégique pour l’avenir de l’énergie

Du côté de Total Energies, on rappelle régulièrement que le développement des biocarburants est un axe clé pour l’avenir. L’entreprise investit massivement dans ce type de production alternative, compatible avec les moteurs d’avion actuels. Cela permettrait de réduire jusqu’à 80 % des émissions de CO2 sur l’ensemble du cycle de vie du carburant, selon les données disponibles.

Et au passage, cela donne une vraie seconde vie à des déchets alimentaires qui, autrefois, finissaient souvent à la poubelle ou dans les canalisations. C’est assez fou, mais nos restes de nuggets ou de frites pourraient bientôt aider à faire décoller des avions un peu plus propres à travers le monde.

DHL là một đơn vị thành viên của DHL Group (với doanh thu năm 2024 đạt 84,2 tỷ euro.","JAKARTA, INDONESIA- Media OutReach Newswire – Thông qua Chiến lược 2030 – Accelerate Sustainable Growth (tạm dịch: Tăng tốc tăng trưởng bền vững), DHL – công ty logistics hàng đầu thế giới – tập trung vào việc hỗ trợ tham vọng của Indonesia trở thành một quốc gia chủ chốt trong cả thương mại khu vực và toàn cầu.

Theo DHL Trade Atlas 2025, trong 5 năm tới, Indonesia dự kiến ​​sẽ được xếp hạng trong Top 30 quốc gia hàng đầu về tốc độ và quy mô tăng trưởng thương mại. Nền kinh tế năng động của nước này, được thúc đẩy bởi quá trình chuyển đổi số nhanh chóng và các khoản đầu tư vào cơ sở hạ tầng chiến lược, mang đến những cơ hội đáng kể cho các doanh nghiệp. Tuy nhiên, môi trường kinh doanh bất ổn – đặc trưng bởi căng thẳng về địa chính trị và sự thay đổi mô hình thương mại – đặt ra những thách thức và bất ổn cho tăng trưởng.

Với sự hiện diện của 3 bộ phận thuộc DHL Group là DHL Express, DHL Global Forwarding và DHL Supply Chain – các doanh nghiệp có trụ sở tại Indonesia có thể khai thác các dịch vụ logistics trọn gói trên khắp các bộ phận, tiếp cận mạng lưới logistics toàn cầu rộng lớn và dựa vào chuyên môn sâu để giúp điều hướng các phức tạp thương mại biến động. Ngoài ra, các bộ phận của DHL đặc biệt tập trung vào việc hỗ trợ mở rộng các lĩnh vực phát triển nhanh tại Indonesia như xe điện, khoa học sự sống và chăm sóc sức khỏe, cũng như thương mại điện tử và bán lẻ.

Sự hiện diện của DHL rất phù hợp để giúp Indonesia và các doanh nghiệp đạt được tham vọng tăng trưởng

Những luồng gió thuận theo địa lý

Ông Ahmad Mohamad, Cố vấn kỹ thuật cấp cao của DHL Express Indonesia nhận xét: “Gần đây, các nước láng giềng của Indonesia đã nhận được sự chú ý khi nói đến khả năng phục hồi của chuỗi cung ứng, nhưng đất nước này còn nhiều điều để cống hiến. Chúng tôi có thị trường trong nước, nguồn nhân lực lớn và Chính phủ đã đầu tư vào việc hiện đại hóa ngành logistics thông qua nền tảng Hệ sinh thái logistics quốc gia”.

Ông Ahmad Mohamad cho biết thêm: “Chúng tôi cũng thấy các cơ hội tăng trưởng ở các thành phố ngoài khu vực Jakarta mở rộng, chẳng hạn như Surabaya, Semarang, Batam và Bali, cùng nhiều nơi khác, đây là những lựa chọn khả thi cho các doanh nghiệp muốn đa dạng hóa chuỗi cung ứng của mình. Quan trọng hơn, chúng tôi cũng muốn giúp các thương hiệu Indonesia mở rộng tầm nhìn của họ ra ngoài thị trường địa phương thông qua thương mại điện tử”.

Ngoài các thương hiệu quốc tế mở rộng sang Indonesia, còn có một nhóm ngày càng tăng các thương hiệu Indonesia đang vươn ra toàn cầu. Vị trí chiến lược của Indonesia và sự gần gũi với các thị trường lớn trong khu vực khiến nơi đây trở thành một địa điểm hấp dẫn như một trung tâm thương mại toàn cầu. Indonesia là một phần tích cực của ít nhất 12 hiệp định thương mại song phương và đa phương lớn, bao gồm Hiệp định Đối tác Kinh tế Toàn diện Khu vực (RCEP), hiện là hiệp định thương mại tự do (FTA) lớn nhất thế giới.

DHL Group đã đầu tư vào Indonesia để giúp thúc đẩy năng lực logistics và chuỗi cung ứng của quốc gia này. Công ty có hơn 4.000 nhân viên tại Indonesia, với khoảng 180 cơ sở trên khắp lãnh thổ nước này, nhằm đáp ứng nhu cầu của các công ty đang phát triển nhanh chóng tại đây.

Năng lượng mới

Ông Matthias Gehrsitz, Giám đốc điều hành của DHL Supply Chain Indonesia nhận định: “Một lĩnh vực khác mà chúng tôi thấy có cơ hội tăng trưởng lớn là năng lượng mới tại Indonesia, đặc biệt là pin xe điện. Mục tiêu của Indonesia là trở thành một trong ba nhà sản xuất pin xe điện hàng đầu thế giới vào năm 2027 cũng phù hợp với trọng tâm Chiến lược 2030 của chúng tôi trong lĩnh vực này”.

Ông Matthias Gehrsitz cho biết thêm: “Kể từ năm ngoái, chúng tôi đã chứng kiến ​​ít nhất bảy nhà sản xuất xe điện cam kết xây dựng các cơ sở sản xuất tại quốc gia này. Ngoài ra, còn có sự quan tâm lớn từ nhiều doanh nghiệp xe điện của Trung Quốc đang tìm kiếm một đối tác logistics có thể cung cấp dịch vụ logistics an toàn và tuân thủ từ đầu đến cuối. Kinh nghiệm hiện có của chúng tôi trong ngành ô tô với các khách hàng như Chery và Wuling Motors, cùng với năng lực và bí quyết trong ngành xe điện, giúp chúng tôi có vị thế hàng đầu để giúp các công ty xe điện điều hướng bối cảnh Indonesia”.

The so-called e fuels, or synthetic fuels, have emerged as one of the major bets for decarbonizing industries that, until now, have had enormous difficulties in reducing their emissions, such as aviation and heavy transport.

These fuels, generated from green hydrogen y CO₂ captured, promise a smaller environmental footprint and full compatibility with existing infrastructure. However, the sector still faces significant economic and technological challenges to ensure the widespread use of e-fuels in the coming years.

How are e-fuels produced and why are they considered sustainable?

E-fuels They are synthetic liquids or gases created by combining hydrogen obtained by electrolysis of water using renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide, usually from industrial processes or even directly from the air. The result is a fuel that, when burned, emits the same CO₂ that was used in its production., which allows us to consider it neutral carbon, especially if the entire chain is based on renewable energy.

Some examples of these fuels are: e-gasoline, e-diesel y e-kerosene, the latter playing a key role in the decarbonization of aviation, where electrification is unfeasible for long-haul flights.

Application in aviation: advances and challenges

The airline sector is in the spotlight, as aviation accounts for approximately 2,5% of global CO₂ emissions from energy. The e fuels, specifically the so-called e-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel synthetic), offer the possibility of reducing emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional aviation fuels.

Companies like OXCCU, along with other startups and large multinationals, have carried out Successful flight tests using e-fuel blendsFor example, KLM and the British Air Force have already flown using e-SAF, albeit in limited numbers and for demonstration purposes.

The main obstacle to the expansion of e-fuel in aviation It remains the cost: manufacturing a liter of e-fuel can be as much as three times more expensive than traditional keroseneTo address this gap, the European Union and the United Kingdom are implementing incentive policies and regulatory frameworks that establish mandatory SAF quotas in the coming years. For example, the EU will require 0,7% of aviation fuel to be e-SAF by 2030, while the United Kingdom has its own timeline for increasing the use of these products.

Scalability also represents a fundamental challenge. Producing enough green hydrogen and capturing the necessary CO₂ requires a large investment in facilities and renewable energy, in addition to international cooperation and a stable regulatory framework that provides long-term security to producers.

Global market growth and trends

The market of e fuels is growing rapidly. According to recent reports, the global market value stood at around $2024 billion in 159.850 and is expected to reach 900.800 million by 2034, which represents a compound annual growth rate of around 19%. controversy over biofuels and their impact on emissions has also influenced interest in e-fuels.

Europe currently leads in the adoption and development of e-fuels thanks to its ambitious decarbonization legislation and public and private investment in R&D projects. The Asia-Pacific region, for its part, is projected to experience the greatest expansion in the coming years, driven by industrial growth and the need to reduce air pollution.

Companies like INERATEC GmbH, Carbon Recycling International, Sunfire GmbH, LanzaTech, Siemens Energy AG y Neste Oyj are some of the leading players in the sector. In addition, established energy companies such as TotalEnergies y Uniper SE They are also investing in these technologies, developing pilot plants and new business lines for the production of synthetic fuels.

Regulatory and tax perspectives

The adoption of the e fuels is closely linked to the existence of clear regulatory frameworks and tax incentivesThe European Union, for example, has established an emissions trading system (ETS), which allows the price difference between SAF and conventional kerosene to be financed through targeted subsidies, thus facilitating the entry of synthetic fuels into the market.

Countries like United Kingdom They plan for at least 2030% of all aviation fuel to be sustainable by 10, rising to 22% by 2040. Some airlines, such as KLM, have begun testing ticket price supplements to fund SAF purchases, assessing consumer willingness to assist with the transition.

It is likely that only one smart combination of public investment, coherent regulation and private sector support allow e-fuels to achieve competitive prices and sufficient production in the next decade.

Industrial opportunities and future challenges

The development of e fuels opens the door to a new energy industry that can transform the production and consumption of liquid and gaseous fuels. The use of CO₂ captured and renewable energy could make e-fuels a key player not only in aviation, but also in sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as shipping, rail, and some industries.

El high initial cost from production plants, access to large-scale green hydrogen and the infrastructure needed for supply and logistics are some of the obstacles to overcome. However, collaboration between technology companies, energy companies, and governments is promoting innovation, with the hope that e fuels become a regular part of the global energy mix.",https://www.renovablesverdes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/e-fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 00:57:58.024374

Dalam era transisi energi global, kebutuhan akan bahan bakar alternatif yang rendah emisi menjadi sangat penting, terutama pada sektor transportasi udara. Industri penerbangan adalah salah satu penyumbang emisi karbon yang terus meningkat. Menurut laporan International Air Transport Association (IATA), emisi karbon dari penerbangan pada tahun 2023 mencapai lebih dari 900 juta ton CO, dan jumlah ini diperkirakan akan terus naik seiring pertumbuhan sektor penerbangan global. Di tengah urgensi tersebut, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) muncul sebagai solusi strategis untuk dekarbonisasi industri penerbangan. Indonesia, sebagai negara agraris dan maritim dengan keanekaragaman hayati dan komoditas pertanian yang besar, memiliki peluang luar biasa untuk memanfaatkan Crude Coconut Oil (CCO) atau minyak kelapa mentah sebagai bahan baku utama SAF.

Mengapa SAF Penting?

SAF adalah bahan bakar penerbangan yang berasal dari sumber daya terbarukan seperti minyak nabati, limbah biomassa, dan lemak hewan. Berbeda dengan avtur konvensional yang berasal dari minyak bumi, SAF memiliki jejak karbon yang jauh lebih rendah dan dapat menurunkan emisi CO hingga 80% dalam siklus hidupnya. Selain itu, SAF telah terbukti kompatibel dengan infrastruktur dan mesin pesawat yang ada, sehingga dapat digunakan langsung tanpa memerlukan modifikasi teknis.

Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional (ICAO) melalui program Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) mendorong penggunaan SAF secara global untuk mencapai target netral karbon. Target ini juga telah diadopsi oleh banyak maskapai dan pemerintah, termasuk Indonesia, yang memiliki komitmen Net Zero Emission (NZE) pada tahun 2060.

Crude Coconut Oil: Bahan Baku Lokal yang Ramah Lingkungan

Minyak kelapa mentah atau CCO merupakan hasil ekstraksi dari daging kelapa segar (copra) tanpa melalui proses pemurnian lanjutan. Berbeda dengan minyak sawit, CCO memiliki kandungan asam lemak jenuh rantai sedang seperti asam laurat yang tinggi (sekitar 45--50%), menjadikannya sangat cocok untuk proses konversi melalui teknologi HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). Teknologi HEFA adalah jalur produksi SAF yang paling umum digunakan secara komersial dan telah disertifikasi oleh ASTM International.

Indonesia memiliki luas perkebunan kelapa sekitar 3,6 juta hektar yang tersebar dari Sumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, hingga Maluku dan Papua. Produksi kelapa nasional mencapai lebih dari 16 juta ton per tahun, namun sayangnya sebagian besar produk kelapa hanya diproses menjadi kopra dan minyak goreng. Dengan pendekatan industrialisasi hijau, sebagian produksi CCO dapat dialihkan untuk produksi SAF, yang nilai ekonominya jauh lebih tinggi dan strategis.

Jika diasumsikan 10% dari total produksi kelapa nasional diolah menjadi CCO untuk SAF, maka potensi pasokan bisa mencapai sekitar 1 juta kiloliter per tahun. Jumlah ini cukup untuk memenuhi sebagian besar kebutuhan avtur domestik, sekaligus membuka peluang ekspor ke pasar global yang permintaannya terus meningkat.",http://assets.kompasiana.com/items/category/27-1628766766.jpg?t=o&v=1200,N,,2025-06-21 18:03:20.818818

Senior Technical Advisor DHL Indonesia Ahmad Mohamad menuturkan mulai mengambil langkah konkret. Salah satu arahan terbaru adalah mendorong fasilitas energi baru yang dibangun ke depan agar mengandalkan sumber tenaga surya. Dalam tahap awal, targetnya adalah agar minimal 15 persen dari fasilitas baru tersebut berbasis energi surya.

“Saya sebenarnya ingin menekankan bahwa fasilitas EBT (Energi Baru dan Terbarukan) kita saat ini baru menyumbang sekitar 15 persen dari total pemakaian energi. Sisanya masih dari sumber lain kita perlu punya visi ke depan, bukan hanya menambah kapasitas, tapi juga memastikan transisi ini berjalan dengan baik,” tegas dia dikutip Sabtu, 21 Juni 2025.

Dia mengatakan akan bekerja sama dengan negara lain dan berbagai pihak agar proses ini tidak membebani terlalu berat di awal. Kita harus bisa move on dari ketergantungan pada energi lama.

“Arahan saya untuk fasilitas energi yang baru, kita harus mulai beralih ke energi surya. Target awalnya adalah 15 persen menggunakan tenaga surya. Dan jika memungkinkan, kita ingin dorong EBT ini mencapai 30 persen dalam waktu yang tidak terlalu lama,” tegas dia.

Managing Director DHL Supply Chain Indonesia Matthias Gehrsitz menuturkan energi terbarukan, terutama sektor kendaraan listrik, menjadi salah satu fokus utama DHL di Indonesia.

DHL menyambut ambisi pemerintah Indonesia untuk menjadi salah satu dari tiga produsen baterai EV terbesar di dunia pada 2027. DHL menggarap strategi logistik yang menyeluruh untuk mendukung kebutuhan rantai pasok industri energi bersih, termasuk manufaktur EV, komponen baterai, dan teknologi pendukung lainnya.

“Kami melihat lonjakan investasi dari berbagai produsen EV global, khususnya dari Tiongkok, yang kini tengah mencari mitra logistik terpercaya untuk menghadirkan sistem supply chain yang efisien dan aman,” ujar dia.

Dia menegaskan pengalaman DHL dalam melayani klien otomotif seperti Chery dan Wuling Motors memperkuat posisinya sebagai pemain strategis dalam mengakselerasi industri EV di

Indonesia.

Sebagai bagian dari transisi menuju ekonomi hijau, DHL juga mengintegrasikan praktik logistik berkelanjutan ke dalam operasionalnya. DHL Express Indonesia, misalnya, telah mengoperasikan 28 kendaraan listrik untuk pengiriman first dan last-mile, serta menawarkan layanan GoGreen Plus yang memungkinkan pengurangan emisi gas rumah kaca hingga 80 persen melalui penggunaan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Divisi DHL Supply Chain juga mendorong penggunaan gudang netral karbon yang dilengkapi panel surya dan sistem pemanfaatan ulang air hujan, serta menerapkan penggunaan kemasan dan palet yang dapat digunakan kembali.

“Fasilitas-fasilitas kami telah dirancang untuk mendukung pertumbuhan sektor energi bersih. Dengan efisiensi tinggi dan prinsip keberlanjutan di setiap titik supply chain, kami ingin memastikan bahwa pertumbuhan industri hijau di Indonesia bisa berjalan seiring dengan komitmen terhadap lingkungan,” tambah Gehrsitz.

Posisi Strategis Indonesia

Lokasi geografis Indonesia yang dekat dengan pasar Asia Timur dan kawasan Asia Tenggara menjadikannya lokasi strategis untuk pusat produksi dan distribusi teknologi energi terbarukan.

DHL melihat peluang besar di kota-kota di luar Jakarta seperti Surabaya, Batam, Semarang, dan Bali yang kini mulai berkembang sebagai hub industri dan logistik baru.

Dengan lebih dari 4.000 karyawan dan 180 fasilitas di seluruh Indonesia, DHL terus memperkuat infrastruktur logistiknya untuk menjawab kebutuhan industri yang kian berkembang. Investasi ini diharapkan dapat membantu merek-merek lokal maupun global dalam menavigasi kompleksitas rantai pasok, sekaligus mempercepat adopsi energi terbarukan di tanah air.

La provincia de Chubut fue elegida como base para el primer proyecto de producción de combustible sostenible de aviación (SAF) en Sudamérica, gracias a una alianza entre la firma alemana GreenSinnergy GmbH y la compañía francesa Axens, líder mundial en soluciones tecnológicas para combustibles bajos en carbono.

El acuerdo fue formalizado a través de un Memorándum de Entendimiento (MOU) y contempla el desarrollo conjunto del proyecto Eco-Refinerías del Sur, cuya propuesta es pionera no solo en la Argentina, sino en toda la región. El foco estará puesto en la producción de SAF a partir de hidrógeno verde generado con energía eólica, aprovechando las condiciones excepcionales de viento de la Patagonia.

“Estamos ante un proyecto inédito en Sudamérica. El SAF es el derivado del hidrógeno verde con mayor proyección comercial, y Chubut ofrece una plataforma natural única para su producción”, explicó Ismael Retuerto, especialista energético y uno de los impulsores de la iniciativa.

Tecnología europea, recurso patagónico

La elección de Chubut no es casual. Su excepcional recurso eólico, considerado uno de los mejores del mundo, permite una generación competitiva de hidrógeno verde, insumo clave para la producción de SAF sintético mediante el proceso Fischer-Tropsch.

GreenSinnergy liderará el desarrollo integral del proyecto, mientras que Axens aportará la licencia tecnológica para todas las etapas críticas del proceso industrial: captura de CO₂, purificación de hidrógeno, síntesis química y mejora de los combustibles resultantes (queroseno y nafta).

SAF, la vía más realista hacia la aviación sostenible

El Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) es hoy la opción más inmediata para reducir las emisiones del sector aéreo, especialmente en rutas de media y larga distancia donde las tecnologías eléctricas aún no son viables. Al ser producido a partir de fuentes renovables —como aceites reciclados, residuos o hidrógeno verde— permite reducir entre un 50% y 60% las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero en comparación con el combustible fósil tradicional.

Desde 2021, el impulso internacional al SAF ha ganado tracción gracias al compromiso de la IATA de alcanzar emisiones netas cero en 2050, y a la implementación de mandatos de mezcla como el europeo, que exige un 6% de SAF para 2030.

Una hoja de ruta industrial para el sur argentino

El proyecto Eco-Refinerías del Sur se encuentra actualmente en etapa de factibilidad técnica y económica. Según sus promotores, el objetivo es no solo construir una planta de producción de SAF en territorio patagónico, sino también desarrollar una cadena de valor regional, con fuerte impacto industrial y generación de empleo calificado.

Además de la transferencia tecnológica, el acuerdo contempla una hoja de ruta integral que incluye la identificación de socios estratégicos, obtención de permisos, acuerdos de compra de largo plazo (offtake agreements), logística, y evaluación detallada de CAPEX y OPEX.

Nasıl mı? E-yakıt veya ""elektrikten üretilen sıvı"" yakıt diye adlandırılan üçüncü nesil sürdürülebilir havacılık yakıtı (sustainable aviation fuel / SAF) sayesinde.

Uzmanlar, bu teknolojinin aslında şaşırtıcı derecede basit olduğunu söylüyor. Havacılık endüstrisinin aşması gereken en büyük engel ise maliyet.

Avrupa Hava Emniyeti Ajansı'na göre e-yakıtların tonu 8 bin 720 dolar, biyolojik bazlı SAF'in tonu 2 bin 365 dolar ve geleneksel jet yakıtının tonu 830 dolar.

Aether Fuels CEO'su Conor Madigan, e-yakıtın atmosferdeki veya endüstriyel emisyonlardan elde edilen karbondioksitin (CO2) doğrudan elektroliz yoluyla veya hidrojenle birleştirilerek karbonmonoksite (CO) dönüştürülmesiyle üretildiğini açıklıyor.

Daha sonra karbondioksit ve hidrojen birleştirilerek çeşitli hidrokarbon bileşikleri oluşturulabiliyor ve bunlar rafine edilerek jet yakıtına dönüştürülebiliyor.

Sustainable Aviation CEO'su Duncan McCourt, yakıldığında karbon saldığını belirtiyor. Bu, üretiminde yenilenebilir enerji santrali kullanılırsa tamamen net sıfır olduğu anlamına geliyor. Ayrıca biyolojik kaynaklı SAF'ten farklı olarak hammadde sınırlamaları ve arazi kullanımı sorunları da sözkonusu değil.

The Independent'a konuşan McCourt, ""ticari seviyeye ölçeklendirmenin ve bunu makul bir maliyetle yapmanın"" engel teşkil ettiğini söylüyor.

Madigan daha ayrıntılı bir şekilde, e-yakıt tesislerinin maliyetinin ""yüksek olduğunu ve mevcut politikalar kapsamında gereken türde hidrojenin kıtlığının projeleri daha küçük ölçekli operasyonlarla sınırladığını"" açıklıyor.

Bunun ""maliyet verimliliğinin düşmesine ve kabul edilebilir sermaye getirisi elde etmek için çok yüksek fiyatlara yol açtığını"" ifade ediyor.

Madigan şöyle devam ediyor:

CO2 artı H2 yakıtlarını teşvik eden politikaların olduğu sadece iki pazar var (Birleşik Krallık ve AB) ve bunlar sadece atık hidrojen veya yeşil hidrojenin kullanımına izin veriyor. Birçok şirket sermaye harcamalarını azaltmanın yollarını arıyor ancak çoğu yaklaşım bu süreçte verimlilikten ödün veriyor.

Madigan, atmosferden CO2 yakalamanın ""çok fazla enerji gerektirdiğini ve dolayısıyla çok pahalı"" olduğunu ancak bu sorunun yakıt fiyatına daha az etki ettiğini söylüyor.

PEKİ ÇÖZÜM NE?

Bu kısmen politikacıların elinde.

McCourt ""Hidrojen üretmek ve karbonu büyük ölçekte yakalamak için gereken enerjinin maliyeti, başlıca zorluklardan biri"" diyor.

Bu sorunun üstesinden gelmek için kayda değer yatırımlar ve destekleyici hükümet politikalarına ihtiyaç var.

Peki havacılık endüstrisi ""havadan yakıt""ı benimseyecek mi? Birkaç havayolu şirketi uçuşları için alternatif yakıtlar denediğinden, bu olası görünüyor.

“I think the House made good headway on several fronts. But we think there are areas in the federal government, areas of waste, fraud, and abuse we can further identify, which would make that a more robust package.”

Top Senate Ag Committee Democrat Amy Klobuchar says her party members won’t support the bill and proposed SNAP cuts are a big reason.

“Farmers will be losing revenue at 35 billion dollars over ten years. Look at what they’re already facing: markets shrinking because of the Trump tariffs, input costs up, weather issues, cuts to the USDA, veterinarians leaving, and now this.”

Farmers have suffered market losses for years, and Republicans argue Democrats still refuse to give up any SNAP money to boost reference prices, which the House did in its version of the bill.

This transformation has had a profound impact on students—making global education more accessible, flexible, and diverse than ever before.

From study abroad programs to international conferences and research projects, aviation has opened new doors for learning and cultural exchange.

The Evolution of Student Travel

In the 1950s, studying abroad was largely a privilege for wealthy students due to the high cost and time required to travel. Fast-forward to today, and international education has become far more attainable.

Over 340,000 American students studied abroad in a recent year—an increase of 2% from the previous year, with similar trends seen globally. Though COVID-19 temporarily paused this growth, student mobility is once again on the rise.

While students often focus on destinations and experiences, few realize the essential role aviation plays in enabling these journeys. Airports, airline networks, and support staff are critical to the functioning of every global education program.

Many students choose to document and share their experiences through reflective essays, often using essay editing services to ensure clarity and professionalism in their writing. These personal stories enrich both academic and personal development.

How Flying Changed Everything

The influence of aviation on education goes far beyond transportation. It has reshaped how institutions, educators, and students approach learning:

More study destinations: Opportunities now exist beyond major capital cities.

Short-term global programs: Weekend or week-long trips are now logistically possible.

International faculty: Professors can now teach or conduct research across campuses.

Collaborative research: Global research teams can meet and work in person.

Home visits: International students can return home more easily and frequently.

As Richard Branson once said, “Students who travel handle global problems better.” Increasingly, universities agree—international experience is seen as a vital part of a modern education.

For students working on research-heavy projects, using a thesis writing service KingEssays can help them present international perspectives more effectively.

Aviation itself has also become a major academic and career field. Institutions such as Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and numerous flight schools around the world train thousands of future pilots, engineers, and aviation professionals each year.

The Democratization of Air Travel

Perhaps the most significant development in student mobility has been the rise of affordable air travel. Once considered a luxury, low-cost carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Southwest Airlines have made flying more accessible than ever.

These airlines cut costs by:

Using secondary airports

Minimizing turnaround time

Charging for optional services

Relying on online bookings

Increasing seat density on planes

The result? Students can now book cross-country or even international flights for less than the price of a restaurant meal.

According to historical data, the cost of air travel has decreased by over 60% since 1970. Even with fluctuating fuel prices, competition and efficiency keep flights affordable—making international education feasible for many.

Busy students sometimes opt to pay someone to write an essay during their travels, helping them balance academic demands while making the most of their time abroad.

New Destinations and Opportunities

More accessible routes have expanded student options well beyond traditional study abroad locations. Destinations that were once difficult to reach are now part of the global education map.

Emerging cities for student programs include:

Da Nang, Vietnam – Green growth and sustainability studies

Medellín, Colombia – Urban transformation and social innovation

Kigali, Rwanda – African entrepreneurship and development

Tbilisi, Georgia – Cross-cultural and regional studies

Tallinn, Estonia – Digital governance and tech education

Major universities are also expanding their global footprints. Institutions like NYU have campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai, while Yale-NUS College in Singapore exemplifies international collaboration. These networks rely on aviation to link students, staff, and campuses across continents.

Technology and Sustainability Challenges

The growth in student air travel comes with environmental challenges. As climate awareness rises, many students are rethinking the environmental impact of their journeys.

Aviation’s sustainability efforts include:

Developing more fuel-efficient aircraft

Investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

Offering carbon offset programs

Exploring hybrid and electric flight technology

Activists like Greta Thunberg have brought attention to the issue, choosing to avoid flying altogether. This has sparked conversation about balancing sustainability with the value of global education.

At the same time, virtual exchanges, hybrid courses, and remote internships are emerging as complementary—not replacement—tools for global learning.

The Future of Student Air Travel

What lies ahead?

Purpose-driven travel: Educational trips will focus on specific academic or cultural goals—e.g. architecture in Japan, agriculture in New Zealand, or cybersecurity in Israel.

Tailored student services: Airlines like Emirates now offer extra baggage allowances for students, and platforms like AirAsia promote dedicated student deals.

Blended learning models: Students may begin programs online and travel for short-term immersive sessions—combining flexibility with international experience.

As Emirates President Tim Clark noted, “New aircraft will make long-haul travel more affordable, opening up even more opportunities for global educational partnerships.”

Finding Balance in a Connected World

Today’s students are part of a globally connected education system unimaginable just decades ago. Aviation has turned what was once a rare opportunity into an essential aspect of academic and personal growth.

Going forward, students will continue to travel with intention—seeking deeper cultural engagement and real-world learning. Institutions will embed international experience into standard curricula, and airlines will evolve to meet this demand responsibly.

As the world becomes more connected, the skies remain a vital part of every student’s educational journey.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pexels-ekaterinabelinskaya-4671912-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 14:02:00.802398

Studies show that time in nature boosts mental health and well-being. As you walk beneath the canopy, you might admire the wildlife or listen to a stream wind through the woods.

However, few people consider how Minnesota’s nearly 18 million acres of forests can drive bioinnovation, supporting both a healthy environment and economy. For those who do, they’d likely underestimate the growing diversity of products that can use components of wood sustainably harvested from our state’s forests.

Research at the University of Minnesota is leading the way to further develop those innovations, to work with industry and government agencies, to grow Minnesota’s forest resources economy, and to create jobs and improve our environment.

One such emerging opportunity is using woody biomass to produce climate-smart, low-carbon biofuels. In fact, dead and dying wood in our forests that can increase fire danger and intensity can instead be harvested and used to create sustainable aviation fuel to fly airplanes.

That financial “upcycling” of woody residuals can then support reinvestment in our forests to help them be more resilient to climate change, mitigating harm caused by wildfire, insects, invasive species, and disease. That’s a win-win for the economy — a $17 billion win annually — as well as for the environment and employment.

Timber harvesting is Minnesota’s fifth-largest manufacturing sector, contributing more than 8% of the state’s total manufacturing payroll. According to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the state’s forest-products industry supports nearly 73,000 jobs.

Here at the University of Minnesota, one way we help advance the forest industry is by researching how forests can adapt to climate change and how to control invasive species. For example, warmer winters have allowed the western pine beetle to spread into Minnesota, killing pine trees and increasing the risk of wildfires. The Minnesota Invasive Plants and Pests Center, funded by the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund through the Legacy Act, is developing new methods to stop its spread.

Clearly, forest loss also brings economic costs. Each acre burned or left unproductive loses $234 in carbon value, not to mention all the other products that could be created from that acre. Bottom line: Managing forest health and timber harvesting creates jobs, strengthens the economy, and reduces carbon emissions and wildfire risks. The University of Minnesota leads this effort through partnerships with industry, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Minnesota DNR, supported by public investment. The university offers the state’s only Society of American Foresters-accredited Forest and Natural Resource Management program, and its Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering program turns forest resources into sustainable fuels, materials, and food ingredients.

Those living in thriving urban centers like Duluth, St. Cloud, or the Twin Cities gain from the trees in our urban forests. Trees lower the heat-island effect of cities, directly reducing energy costs of cooling your home in the summer. In the long run, the trees on your property can add as much as 10% to 20% to the value of your home. Urban forests are under stress, too, however, due to invasive pests and diseases like emerald ash borer and oak wilt, to name just two. We train the tree (arborists), insect (entomologists) and forest-disease (pathologists) scientists who help manage and protect these valuable natural assets for you and your community.

As you can see, our forests work hard for us. So, next time you walk in the woods, take a moment to appreciate the full value of trees — not just their beauty but also their essential role in sustaining our economy, our state, and our planet. Forests are often treated as free public goods, but their true worth is immeasurable. That’s why public investment is critical to advancing forest-based innovation and protecting these vital natural assets. They are the lungs of the earth.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/db2930b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x800+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F31%2F2c52499140d9a136c137503ea2c6%2Fxxxx25-op-dnt-buhrtoon.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 13:03:39.498444

LOT Polish Airlines places its first-ever Airbus order

LOT Polish Airlines has placed a firm order with Airbus for 20 A220-100s and 20 A220-300s, marking the first time Poland’s national carrier has selected Airbus aircraft as part of its fleet modernisation. The agreement which could foresee a future increase to 84 A220 aircraft was announced at the 2025 Paris Air Show.

Michał Fijoł, LOT executive officer, said: “Today’s decision is about the future. The Airbus A220 family aircraft, which will start joining our fleet in 2027, open up new opportunities for development and growth – key pillars of our strategy. These modern, efficient, and passenger-focused aircraft will allow us to compete effectively in the European skies, strengthen our position as the preferred carrier in Central and Eastern Europe, and prepare LOT for its role as a leading airline at the Central Communication Port.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP sales of the commercial aircraft business, said: “This order for 40 Airbus A220s marks a historic milestone as we officially welcome LOT Polish Airlines into the Airbus family. The A220 Family will be instrumental in LOT's fleet modernisation and network expansion strategy with the A220-100 and A220-300 being the ideal combination for their needs. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with LOT, leveraging Airbus global expertise to support its renewal program and ensure the A220's seamless integration.”

New possibilities

The A220 aircraft will gradually replace the LOT’s existing regional fleet, offering new possibilities for route development and new destinations thanks to the A220 benefits. Combining the longest range, lowest fuel consumption, the A220 is the most modern airliner in its size category, carrying between 100 to 160 passengers on flights of up to 3,600nm. Depending on cabin configuration, the A220-100 serves the 100-135 seat market, while the larger A220-300 is perfectly tailored for the 120-160 seat market.

The A220 is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500 GTF engines and offers a 50% smaller noise footprint compared to the previous generation of aircraft.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and the companuy is targeting for its aircraft to be 100% SAF capable by 2030. At the end of May 2025, the A220 had secured over 900 firm orders from more than 30 customers worldwide, with over 415 aircraft already delivered, and is currently in successful service with 24 airlines globally, operating on more than 1,600 routes and serving over 470 destinations.

Greece’s Aegean Airlines has unveiled a bold financial strategy by announcing the launch of a Two Hundred Fifty Million Euro bond offering, fully aligned with European Union regulations and Greek financial law. This major initiative reflects the airline’s unwavering confidence in the regional aviation rebound and its aggressive push to modernize its operations, expand its route network, and strengthen its market dominance in the post-pandemic era. The upcoming bond, to be listed on the Athens Exchange, marks a strategic milestone in Aegean’s long-term growth vision—inviting investors to support a high-impact transformation backed by regulatory integrity and strong recovery momentum across Europe.

Aegean Airlines Set to Unveil Bold Two Hundred to Two Hundred Fifty Million Euro Bond Offering to Drive Aviation Comeback and Power Long-Term Expansion

Aegean Airlines has announced its intention to raise significant capital through a new bond issuance, as part of its continued strategy to strengthen its financial structure and support long-term growth. In a formal statement released on Friday, the airline’s Board of Directors confirmed the approval of a common bond loan with a minimum target of two hundred million euros and a maximum ceiling of two hundred fifty million euros. This financial instrument will be made available to investors in Greece through a public offering and is scheduled to be listed on the Athens Exchange’s regulated market, specifically under the Fixed Income Securities Segment.

The move underscores the airline’s ongoing efforts to optimize its capital reserves and secure a more resilient financial foundation in the wake of the aviation industry’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Once listed, the bonds will provide investors with an opportunity to participate directly in the national carrier’s growth trajectory, as it continues to expand operations and modernize its fleet.

Regulatory and Legal Compliance

The bond issuance will be carried out in full compliance with Greek legal frameworks, particularly Law 4548/2018, which governs corporate operations in Greece, as well as provisions under Law 3156/2003, which pertain to bond loans. In addition, Aegean Airlines is aligning its procedures with European Union regulatory standards, which include EU Regulation 2017/1129, the guiding document for securities prospectuses across the EU. The offering will also follow the rules laid out in Delegated Regulations 2019/979 and 2019/980, ensuring that all necessary investor protections and disclosure obligations are met.

In preparation for the offering, a comprehensive prospectus is being compiled. This document will contain essential information for investors, including the bond structure, maturity period, interest rate, and risk factors. The Hellenic Capital Market Commission (HCMC) is currently reviewing the prospectus. Once approved, it will be made publicly available ahead of the offering to ensure transparency and allow potential investors ample time to review the terms.

Timing and Market Sensitivity

While a definitive timeline has not yet been announced, Aegean has emphasized that the launch and listing of the bonds will be contingent on prevailing market conditions. Volatility in financial markets or geopolitical developments could potentially influence the timing of the public offering. The company has assured investors that it will release updated communications as soon as the HCMC approves the prospectus and listing procedures move forward.

This cautious approach reflects the airline’s focus on ensuring the success of the bond sale, both in terms of attracting institutional investors and setting favorable interest rates. Analysts believe that favorable economic indicators and a recovering travel sector in Southern Europe may boost investor appetite for aviation-related bonds, particularly those issued by a company with a strong domestic presence like Aegean.

Strategic Importance for Aegean Airlines

The capital raised through this bond issuance is expected to play a pivotal role in Aegean’s post-pandemic strategy. Over the past few years, the airline has navigated the turbulent conditions caused by international travel restrictions, decreased passenger volumes, and rising operational costs. Despite these challenges, Aegean managed to maintain operational continuity, partially due to government support and cost optimization strategies.

Now, with international tourism returning to more normalized levels and passenger demand steadily increasing across European routes, Aegean is entering a new phase of expansion and modernization. The funds from the bond offering will likely be channeled into several strategic areas, including:

Fleet renewal and fuel-efficient aircraft acquisitions

Route expansion across Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa

Digital transformation and IT infrastructure upgrades

Sustainability initiatives, such as carbon offset programs and sustainable aviation fuel partnerships

These investments are aligned with Aegean’s broader vision of becoming a more competitive and environmentally conscious carrier, appealing to both leisure and business travelers across the region.

Implications for Investors

The announcement has drawn interest from both institutional and retail investors, particularly within the Greek market. Fixed-income securities issued by a well-established airline with a strong domestic market share are seen as a relatively stable investment, especially in an environment where traditional savings products offer limited returns.

For investors, Aegean’s upcoming bond offers the potential for regular income through interest payments, alongside the security of investing in a publicly listed company with a proven operational history. However, as with any investment in the aviation sector, some risks remain — notably fluctuations in fuel prices, geopolitical tensions, and potential resurgences of global health crises.

Nevertheless, the positive outlook for Mediterranean tourism and the airline’s financial recovery in 2024 suggest a favorable environment for the success of this bond issue.

Aegean Airlines’ move to launch a bond valued between two hundred and two hundred fifty million euros signals its strong belief in the resilience of regional air travel and underscores its bold ambition to position itself at the forefront of Greece’s aviation industry. By securing additional capital through public investment, the airline is positioning itself to respond effectively to changing market demands, enhance operational resilience, and offer shareholders and passengers a stronger, more modernized airline.

Greece’s Aegean Airlines has announced a transformative Two Hundred Fifty Million Euro bond offering, fully compliant with European Union regulations, to fuel its strategic expansion and lead the country’s aviation resurgence. This bold financial move signals confidence in regional air travel and a commitment to long-term growth.

As the final steps toward listing unfold, investors will be closely watching for the release of the prospectus and subsequent offering dates. This financial milestone, if successful, could set a precedent for other regional carriers looking to shore up balance sheets and expand their networks in the evolving landscape of global aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__83055-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-21 14:02:05.219190

Rolls-Royce is proudly marking a major milestone in British engineering excellence as its Trent engine family celebrates 30 years in service.

A symbol of precision, innovation and endurance, the Trent engines have not only redefined the aviation industry but continue to set the gold standard for performance, reliability, and sustainability.

Since the first Trent 700 took flight aboard an Airbus A330 in 1995, the Trent family has grown into the most successful widebody engine programme in aviation history. With over 200 million engine flying hours under its belt, the Trent series has transported 3.5 billion passengers – on holidays, business trips, and humanitarian missions – reaffirming its place at the heart of global air travel.

A Legacy of Engineering Brilliance

Today, the Trent engine family includes the Trent 700, 800, 500, 900, 1000, XWB and 7000. In 2010, there were around 1,500 Trent engines in service. That number has now soared to nearly 6,000, with a Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft taking off or landing somewhere in the world every three seconds.

“At Rolls-Royce, our products are Designed to Last,” the company states. “Our world-class engineers deliver precision, performance and reliability in every component, ensuring our engines perform for our customers for decades to come.”

This success is underpinned by a continuous improvement philosophy. The Trent’s robust three-shaft architecture, a signature of Rolls-Royce design, enables each variant to meet specific thrust requirements while absorbing cutting-edge technologies. Many of these innovations, such as advanced materials and subsystem designs, are also retrofitted into earlier models, ensuring even older engines evolve and improve with time.

As a result, since the first Trent took flight, fuel efficiency has improved by 15%, and reliability has increased eight-fold. The Trent XWB, powering the Airbus A350, is now the world’s most efficient large aero engine in service. All Trent engines are also 100% compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – accelerating the industry’s path to net-zero flight.

TotalCare: Pioneering Service, Reimagined

The Trent engine’s story of success is also a story of unmatched service. Rolls-Royce revolutionised aftercare with TotalCare – a programme introduced shortly after the first Trent entered service. TotalCare links support to engine flying hours, offering airlines both predictability and peace of mind.

This approach evolved into the CareStore, a full suite of services that support the engine throughout its life cycle, serving not only airlines but freight operators and lessors. With a sharp focus on fleet insights and digital health monitoring, Rolls-Royce now delivers 99% dispatch reliability, helping customers eliminate unexpected disruptions.

British Innovation: A Proud Heritage

Rolls-Royce’s engineering journey began at the Midland Hotel in Manchester, and its legacy is etched with aviation firsts. From the Conway – the world’s first bypass gas turbine engine – to powering the first transatlantic passenger flight using 100% SAF with the Trent 1000 on a Boeing 787 in 2023, the company has continually pushed boundaries.

With pioneering innovations like the wide-chord hollow titanium fan blades and the versatile three-shaft architecture, Rolls-Royce has equipped the Trent family with unmatched durability and global reach. The Trent XWB is set to add another chapter by powering the longest non-stop passenger flight from London to Sydney.

Designed to Last: Powered by People

At the core of Rolls-Royce’s success is its people – past, present, and future. Generations of engineers have dedicated their careers to building and maintaining the Trent legacy. With graduate and apprenticeship programmes thriving, the company is ensuring the continuation of its tradition of excellence.

“Many of our engineers enjoy decades-long careers at Rolls-Royce, and three generations of employees can be found throughout the organisation,” the company proudly affirms.

Investing in Tomorrow

The Trent story is far from over. Rolls-Royce is investing over £1 billion in engine upgrades, including a Durability Enhancement package for the Trent 1000 and 7000, which more than doubles the engine’s time on wing.

Looking ahead, the UltraFan demonstrator – the largest jet engine ever built – is being developed with sustainability at its core. Ready to run on 100% SAF from day one, UltraFan combines new technologies to deliver even greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions.

As Rolls-Royce looks to the next 30 years and beyond, the message is clear: the Trent engine family isn’t just made in Britain – it’s made to last.",https://i0.wp.com/conservativepost.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Rolls-Royce-UltraFan-engine.jpg?fit=1800%2C1013&ssl=1,N,,2025-06-21 12:09:27.550179

Will The A350-1000 Ever Surpass The -900 In Orders?

The Airbus A350 has surpassed 1,400 orders at the Paris Air Show this week. More than 1,000 of those are for the A350-900, which has historically out-sold its stretched stablemate, the A350-1000, by a factor of 3-to-1. But something has changed in 2025. The -1000 has picked up 87 orders so far this year, spurred on by the new commitments in Paris from Riyadh Air and STARLUX. By contrast, the -900 has just 18 orders year-to-date. The -1000 obviously offers advantages in terms of range and capacity (particularly ahead of the wing for premium passengers), but also comes with a higher price tag. But are airlines now willing to pay that extra for the chance to boost their premium seating capacity and the associated revenues? Which begs the question: Will the A350-1000 ever surpass the -900 in total orders?

A220-500: Which Airlines Will Be First In Line?

Airbus has confirmed that it expects to complete its feasibility studies for a stretched A220, informally known as the A220-500, by the end of the year. Assuming it goes ahead with the aircraft, this would see it enter service in the early 2030s. The aircraft would be larger than the current A220-300, with the ability to seat an estimated 160–170 passengers, roughly the same size as a Boeing MAX 8 or A320neo. However, with a clean sheet design and potentially new engine options, the aircraft could likely offer significant efficiency advantages over rivals. Existing A220 customers like Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Air France, and Breeze Airways have all expressed interest in a stretched version of the A220. But what do you think?

Should JSX Acquire Silver Airways' Former ATR Planes?

American air carrier JSX recently announced a surprising purchase of some brand-new ATR turboprop planes, despite turboprops not being a popular choice for most airlines in the US. Not only does this mark the first time JSX will operate turboprop planes, but it serves as a rebound for American turboprop passenger service after a very short time span due to one airline ceasing operations just a few days ago. On June 11th, Silver Airways, a regional airline serving most of Florida and the Caribbean, ceased operations. Before its closure, it was one of the only American carriers to operate turboprop flights. With Silver's closure, this leaves its eight ATR planes up for grabs. Considering that JSX is now venturing into turboprop service, should it acquire Silver Airways' former ATR planes? Share your thoughts in the comments! This is user-generated content.

Should Delta Air Lines Retire The Boeing 767?

Delta Air Lines is one of the world's largest operators of the Boeing 767, a widebody that has mostly gone out of fashion with global carriers. Many major airlines have retired the Boeing 767 in favor of more efficient next-generation twin-engine aircraft like the Airbus A330neo or the Boeing 787. Nonetheless, Delta keeps the jet around, and today the Boeing 767 still serves as one of the most important pieces of the airline's commercial lineup. The Boeing 767 has long been the workhorse of Delta's transatlantic network, and it also operates certain flights to destinations in Latin America, Africa, and East Asia. Do you think it is about time that Delta retires the Boeing 767?

Will Southwest Order Boeing 787s?

There is growing speculation that Southwest is planning a major international expansion. And we're not talking just about the ""close-in"" routes to Mexico or the Caribbean, but rather its first flights to Europe. Initial thoughts from industry experts and Wall Street analysts are that it will build on its partnership with Icelandair by introducing flights from Baltimore, Nashville, and Denver to Reykjavík. But Southwest's international ambitions are currently limited by how far its Boeing 737 MAX 8s can fly. Interestingly, when CEO Bob Jordan was asked about long-haul flights, he acknowledged that rethinking Southwest's international strategy ""could require that we think about a different aircraft."" Which begs the question: What would that aircraft be? I believe that if Southwest does choose to double-down on long-haul, then the Boeing 787 is the natural pick. The airline is already an all-Boeing operator, and no doubt enjoys the best discounts Boeing is able to offer. And the 787

Is The A220 The Right Choice For LOT?

LOT Polish Airlines and Airbus announced today at the Paris Air Show an agreement for up to 84 Airbus A220 family planes. This includes 40 firm orders, and options for an additional 44 aircraft, and represents the Polish airline's first-ever order with Airbus. The new aircraft are destined to replace LOT's Embraer-based regional fleet, where it currently operates a total of 44 Embraer ERJ-170/175/190/195 aircraft. It was widely expected that LOT would simply upgrade its regional fleet to the next-generation Embraer E2 series. The Brazilian manufacturer was the incumbent, and had the installed base of Embraer pilots and maintenance operations, and LOT has no prior relationship with Airbus. But CEO Michal Fijol says it ultimately chose the A220 because of its superior passenger experience and larger size, which would drive faster growth. This may be true, but Airbus almost certainly also offered a substantial discount to get a toe-hold with a new European customer. But what do you

Could A Pan Am Revival Take On The 'Big Three' Middle Eastern Airlines?

Pan Am is one of the most recognizable airline brands in history, and was a staple of pop culture and aviation as a whole. However, all the glamour faded away due to competition and financial problems, ultimately leading to its closure in late 1991. However, nearly 34 years after it closed down, Pan Am has returned to the skies (albeit as a short private charter flight) for an around-the-world journey priced at nearly $60,000 per person. Even though this is only a temporary return of the Pan Am name on a plane, it makes me wonder if a proper revival of regularly scheduled Clipper flights could be a possibility. Pan Am has always been known for its supreme luxury compared to other airlines of its time. Throughout its peak (the 1950s to the 1970s), Pan Am revolutionized the way we view air travel forever. From transatlantic service to luxurious services, the airline was truly a trailblazer. A modern comparison would be the Middle East's 'Big Three' (Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad)

Which Aircraft Could A Modern Pan Am Use?

Pan Am has taken to the skies for the first time since its closure in 1991. The special private charter experience will see them use a Boeing 757 operated by Icelandair for an around-the-world journey for 50 passengers. While this doesn't signify that a revival is on the cards, a Pan Am revival would be very special, nonetheless. It also makes me wonder which aircraft a modern Pan Am would use. The choices are significant, such as the A350, 787, A321neo, a 747-8, or maybe even an A380 to compete with the other operators such as Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Lufthansa, Etihad, British Airways, and others.

Should Boeing Have Built The Boeing 747-8?

The largest aircraft built to date by the Boeing Company has been the Boeing 747-8, a modern version of its decades-old Boeing 747 design. When the 747 entered passenger service around the globe, it fundamentally revolutionized air travel by reducing operating costs to the point that airlines could really open up air travel to the masses. These long-haul jets could fly halfway around the globe and carry hundreds of passengers. Nonetheless, the market for inefficient four-engine aircraft slowly began to shrink over the years, so the airline's sales performance for the Boeing 747-8 was undoubtedly lackluster. Nonetheless, the carrier was able to continue competing with Airbus' A380 offering. This all bodes an interesting question: was it smart for Boeing to build the 747-8?

What Do You Make Of Emirates' Desire To Expand Its Indian Network?

Over the past two years, Emirates has looked to nearly double its seat capacity into India, after its bilateral agreements were used up completely, preventing any more services into the nation. Emirates has a desire to spread its services to tier two cities such as Amritsar and Goa, which both have Qatar Airways services, whilst Air India operates Amritsar to Gatwick and Birmingham. Goa maintains seasonal TUI connections to Manchester. The question is whether India will increase its bilateral rights with Dubai. The likely answer for now is no, as the Indian Government is reluctant to decrease Air India's international market share. Emirates' increased presence would allow competition, more options for travellers, and cheaper fares. The arrival of the A350 and 787s in the coming years could fuel Emirates' persistence to grow and capitalise on the Indian market. Alternatively, its sister company FlyDubai could be used to operate smaller aircraft such as the 737 MAX 8 into cities like C

Should More Airlines Outside The US Order The Embraer E175?

Despite having a successor already developed, the first-generation Embraer E175 is still receiving orders, mainly from the US. This is due to a pilot scope clause that forced US regional airlines to choose specific planes that are approved for use. That means planes such as the larger and more advanced E2 cannot join the US regional lineup. Because of that, the 1st generation E175 remains in production to benefit US regional airlines, albeit with slight modifications for improved efficiency, practicality, and comfort. It seems that the program will likely not go away anytime soon, as SkyWest, the largest regional airline in North America, recently announced a massive order for more E175s at the 2025 Paris Air Show. However, it seems that SkyWest is the only one who is keeping the E175 program in the air. This makes me wonder if other airlines outside the US can make use of the E175. While the E2 generation has more benefits, the E175 is not far behind. Plus, it is cheaper than a new

Can United Airlines’ Push For Sustainable Aviation Fuel Reshape The Industry?

United Airlines has committed to a bold goal: to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for 100% of its domestic flights by 2035. This effort is part of a larger plan to dramatically reduce the airline’s carbon footprint and push the aviation industry toward net-zero emissions. SAF is made from renewable resources like agricultural waste, algae, or recycled cooking oil, and it can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. For airlines, it offers one of the few immediate options to cut greenhouse gases without sacrificing flight range or performance. However, the scale of this transition poses serious questions about feasibility. Is SAF production capacity and supply chain ready to meet the demands of a major carrier like United within the next decade? Will the costs of SAF remain prohibitively high compared to conventional jet fuel, potentially affecting ticket prices? There’s also the question of whether other airlines will be able to follow Unite

Which Canceled Route Do You Wish You Could Have Flown On?

Over the years, various different routes have come and gone from carriers' networks, as travel demand and market conditions dictate changes in airline strategy. This means that there are many corridors today that used to be served, but no longer see connections provided by scheduled commercial flights. For me, one route that I wish still existed was British Airways' unlikely connection between Cambridge, UK (CBG) and Gothenburg, Sweden (GOT). Operated by Sun Air using Dornier 328JET regional aircraft, these flights primarily shuttled Astra Zeneca employees across the North Sea, but, for several years, members of the public could also buy a certain number of seats. Naturally, the fact that I now live in East Anglia and visit Gothenburg several times a year due to my partner's family residing in the Swedish city does mean that I have a particular bias on this front. However, from an avgeek's perspective, I would also love to sample the Dornier 328JET, a curious plane that I am yet to f

Where Should VietJet Air Expand?

VietJet Air has a massive future awaiting it, having, at the 2025 Paris Airshow, announced a deal for up to 150 Airbus A321neos, further expanding its narrowbody fleet. This complements its existing order for some brand new A330neo widebodies for its expansion plans. In addition to a fleet renewal, VietJet has opened a second subsidiary airline in Kazakhstan after acquiring the rights to operate Qazaq Air, rebranding it as VietJet Qazaqstan in the process. Not only will this complement its existing Thai subsidiary, simply known as Thai VietJet Air, but it also unlocks new places to expand. Speaking of expansion, this recent fleet renewal points to a lot of big promises for a possible addition of new destinations. Where do you think it should go next?

What Are Your Best Hacks For Making Low-Cost Air Travel More Bearable?

Many people love to hate low-cost air travel, with the perceived gulf in service compared to legacy operators being an easy stick with which to beat such carriers. However, a few little tips and tricks here and there can go a long way in making budget airlines a perfectly serviceable way of getting from A to B, even (or maybe especially) if such hacks aren't widely known. Personally, my top tip concerns the seating onboard the Boeing 737-800 and MAX 8-200 aircraft at Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair. Specifically, as confirmed by aeroLOPA, seats on the DEF side of the aisle in the front half of the cabin (rows 3-15 on the 737-800 and 3-16 on the 737 MAX 8-200) offer half an inch more legroom compared to their counterparts on the ABC side. While not a major difference, it can play a key role in enhancing comfort for taller travelers - as someone whose height is four inches taller than the average UK male, it definitely helps me!

Virgin Atlantic vs. British Airways: Which Carrier Do You Prefer For Long-Haul Travel?

There are dozens of carriers operating flights across the North Atlantic each night, but two of the most noteworthy are British Airways and Virgin Atlantic. These two airlines have continued to compete over the years to be the dominant player in the United Kingdom's long-haul travel market, and both have jostled for control at major hubs like London Heathrow Airport (LHR). With each carrier having its own independent partnerships with US-based legacy airlines, each of these carriers has its network, and you could very much end up on either of these airlines on your next flight to London. But which of these two carriers do you prefer for long-haul travel? For me, it is probably Virgin Atlantic due to their excellent service and emphasis on passenger comfort.

IN THIS REPORT

Christchurch Airport wants to become the world’s first truly “green” airport, challenging the aviation industry’s high-carbon reputation.

The airport has already cut its direct operational emissions by 92 percent compared to a decade ago through innovations like geothermal heating.

Now it’s tackling the much larger problem of aircraft emissions by preparing for electric planes, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel. But will it work?

Can an airport be sustainable?

Before you answer that question, step outside any terminal and catch a whiff of burning jet fuel — a searing, earthy odor that reminds you air travel is one of the most carbon-intensive industries on the planet.

But Christchurch Airport, a small aviation hub on New Zealand’s sparsely populated South Island, is determined to flip the script. Over the past two decades, the airport has quietly tried to transform itself into a sustainability innovator — and prove that even in an industry notorious for its environmental impact, meaningful change is possible.

“It’s a challenge,” says Claire Waghorn, the airport’s sustainability transition leader. “But we must rise to the challenge.”

Christchurch Airport has already slashed its operational emissions by 92 percent from a decade ago. Now it’s tackling the far greater challenge of reducing aircraft emissions. While the path to sustainability is fraught with challenges and occasional missteps, Christchurch Airport’s progress offers a possible blueprint for how airports — and perhaps entire industries — can reimagine their environmental impact.

A sustainability journey rooted in indigenous wisdom

Christchurch Airport’s approach to sustainability is deeply influenced by Māori principles, particularly the concept of kaitiakitanga, or guardianship.

“It’s about recognizing that everything is interconnected,” Waghorn explains. “We can’t address climate change in isolation. We have to consider biodiversity, social equity, and economic resilience as part of the same puzzle. Alongside this, understanding we need to act with intergenerational interests at heart.”

This holistic philosophy is reflected in the airport’s use of the “doughnut economics” framework, which balances environmental limits (the outer ring of the doughnut) with social minimum standards (the inner ring). The goal is to operate within these boundaries and ensure that the airport’s operations are not at the expense of the planet.

Cutting emissions: Down 92 percent and counting

Christchurch Airport’s sustainability journey began in 2006, long before most airports were even thinking about carbon footprints. Back then, their emissions tracking was rudimentary, but it laid the groundwork for what would become one of the most ambitious decarbonization plans in the aviation industry.

By 2015, the airport had a clear road map in place. Since then, it has reduced its operational emissions by 92 percent. How did they do it?

Ground source heat pumps. In a world-first engineering feat, the airport tapped into aquifers deep beneath the terminal to create a geothermal heating and cooling system. This innovation allowed it to ditch diesel generators and slash emissions.

Electric ground power units. Planes can plug into clean electricity while parked at the gate, eliminating the need for jet fuel-powered auxiliary engines. The electricity comes from green sources, too.

Electric fire trucks. After years of negotiating with manufacturers, the airport is transitioning its firefighting fleet to electric vehicles.

Automated energy management. A smart building system ensures lights and HVAC systems are only active when needed, cutting energy waste.

Your Voice Matters

“We’ve got this little bit left on our own plate,” Waghorn said, referring to the remaining 8 percent of emissions. “It’s things like backup generators and fire extinguishers — tiny amounts that are surprisingly hard to eliminate.”

The elephant on the runway: aircraft emissions

While Christchurch Airport has made steady progress in reducing its own emissions, it’s quick to acknowledge the bigger challenge: aircraft emissions.

“Our operational footprint is around 240 tons per year,” Waghorn noted. “The airlines? Eight hundred thousand tons.”

To address this, the airport is positioning itself as a pioneer in the transition to low-carbon aviation. Its strategy focuses on three key technologies:

Electric planes. For short-haul regional flights, electric aircraft are already being tested. Christchurch Airport welcomed ElectricAir onsite in 2020, and is working to ensure infrastructure will adequately support electric aviation needs.

Green hydrogen. For domestic and medium-haul international flights, the airport formed the H2 in Aviation Consortium and is investigating hydrogen infrastructure, including liquefaction and refueling facilities.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). For long-haul flights, SAF — made from biofuels or green hydrogen with captured carbon — offers a promising, if still limited, solution.

“Airlines sign contracts for new planes three to four years before delivery,” says Waghorn, “but the infrastructure to support them takes seven to eight years to build. It’s very challenging. We have to act now, even without certainty about which technologies will dominate.”

A circular economy approach

Sustainability at Christchurch Airport isn’t just about cutting emissions. It’s also about biodiversity, water conservation, energy efficiency, and rethinking waste. The airport has implemented a robust circular economy program, focusing on materials recovery and reducing single-use plastics.

One standout initiative is its waste sorting system. The airport collects everything and sorts it back of house offsite. The results have been staggering: half of what was once considered general waste is now diverted to recycling or composting streams.

“We’ve also partnered with local organizations to repurpose food waste from our lounges,” Waghorn added. “It’s about finding the best possible outcome for every item that comes through our terminal.”

Challenges — and skepticism

Despite the progress, Christchurch Airport faces its share of challenges and skeptics. For one, sustainability efforts often go unnoticed by passengers.

“A lot of this work happens behind the scenes,” Waghorn acknowledges. “It’s not as tangible as, say, a solar panel or a wind turbine.”

Sustainability is not entirely invisible. For example, you might see the airport’s solar farm when you taxi for takeoff — it’s being built on the southwestern side of the airport. And you might notice electric buses shuttling passengers around the airport and into the city.

There have been a few missteps. The airport’s attempt to replace milk bottles with milk kegs failed because of timing and fluctuations in milk use.

Christchurch Airport’s sustainability journey is far from over. With a goal of achieving absolute zero emissions in airport operations by 2035 — no offsets, just real reductions — the facility is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in airports, while continuing to explore how to support and accelerate the wider aviation transition.

“It’s really, really hard to get consistent behavior from a transient crowd,” says Waghhorn.

Some of the missteps are funny, in hindsight. Consider the airport’s purchase of an electric autonomous shuttle in 2017. Although the shuttle was a bold step toward modernizing airport transportation, it could not be used on the road because it wasn’t street-legal.

“We learned so much from that,” laughs Waghorn. The airport quietly sold the shuttle and transitioned to an electric van driven by a human.

Pro Tip

The airport’s experiences suggest that the path to sustainability is almost never linear. The airport has had to adapt, learn from its errors, and stay focused on the bigger picture, even when faced with setbacks and skepticism.

“We always have to keep trying to do more,” she says.

A model for the future?

Christchurch Airport’s sustainability journey is far from over. With a goal of achieving absolute zero emissions by 2035 — no offsets, just real reductions — the facility is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in airports.

But perhaps its greatest contribution lies in its willingness to share its successes — and failures.

“Collaboration is everything,” Waghorn says. “We can’t do this alone. It’s about working with airports, airlines, manufacturers, energy providers, and communities to create a shared vision for the future.”

For travelers, Christchurch Airport offers a glimmer of hope. It’s proof that even in an industry as carbon-intensive as aviation, sustainability is not just a buzzword. It’s a tangible, achievable goal. And while the road ahead is long and filled with pitfalls, the airport’s progress serves as a reminder that every step, no matter how small, may bring us closer to a sustainable future.

FAQs

How to spot a genuinely ‘green’ airport

Check for a Sustainability Report — Before you book, visit the airport’s website. Genuinely committed airports publish detailed, data-driven sustainability reports with clear targets, not just glossy marketing pages.

Observe Ground Transportation — When you arrive, look at the shuttle and bus services. Widespread use of electric vehicles for passenger transport and ground operations is a strong, visible sign of commitment.

Inspect Terminal Facilities — Notice the details inside. Look for water refill stations to reduce plastic use, clear signage for comprehensive waste sorting (recycling, compost), and energy-saving lighting like LEDs.

Look for Action at the Gate — Check if parked aircraft are connected to electric ground power units. This allows them to shut down their noisy, jet fuel-powered auxiliary engines, significantly cutting emissions.

See if They Support Future Fuels — Check the airport’s news for partnerships related to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green hydrogen, or electric aircraft charging. Proactive support for these technologies shows a true long-term vision.

The Minnesota Farmers Union recently opened a meat processing plant in Staples where students will be able to train, added the commissioner.","WILLMAR — Agriculture continued to receive bipartisan support in the state legislature, leading Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen to offer an upbeat assessment of the recent legislative session.

With a split Legislature —101 DFL’ers and 100 Republicans — the session went about as well as Petersen believed it could, he told an audience that filled the Life Sciences auditorium of the MinnWest Technology Campus in Willmar, where the annual Partners in Ag Innovation conference was conducted Tuesday.

The agriculture bill was the first approved, Petersen said, and it addressed priority issues for agriculture.

The Legislature approved replenishing the emergency account for responding to the highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak affecting the state’s poultry and dairy industries, according to the commissioner.

The agriculture bill included funding for the development of 100 weather station sites across the state, an initiative supported by the state’s corn growers, according to the commissioner.

The new legislation continues to offer incentives for the development of the sustainable aviation fuel industry in Minnesota, but some of what Petersen termed the “bigger pieces,” or tax credits, were dropped out of the final bill.

The commissioner is optimistic about the state’s prospects for becoming a leading producer of plant-based fuel for the aviation industry. “We’re right on the cusp of getting this,” he said.

Petersen said he expects that corn will initially be the primary feedstock for the fuel production, as development continues on other possible crops. Minnesota raises corn on roughly 8 million acres, making it the state’s largest crop.

“Corn is going to be in the mix,” Petersen said.

The University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative has been researching the use of winter camelina and pennycress as potential feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel.

The Legislature approved continuing to provide grant funds to help retail service stations install the infrastructure for E15 and higher ethanol blends.

Petersen also pointed to continued state support for developing more small meat processing operations across the state. Minnesota livestock producers were among the hardest hit when the COVID pandemic led to closures and cutbacks in production at large meat processors.

At one point, pork producers in the state had 30,000 hogs a day backing up with no place to deliver the animals for processing, he pointed out.

In response, the state has helped support meat processing programs at post-secondary educational facilities, including Ridgewater College. The Minnesota Farmers Union recently opened a meat processing plant in Staples where students will be able to train, added the commissioner.

Petersen also cited the importance of work to help young people get into farming.

“Fifty percent of the farmland in Minnesota is going to change hands in the next 20 years,” he said.

The commissioner would like to see more funding for the beginning farmer tax credit. Funding for it was decreased while eligibility for the tax credit it provides on land and equipment purchases was expanded to allow more participants. As a result, the department is now only able to fund 62% of the requests for the credit, according to the commissioner.

Petersen said the state is one of the few actually adding farms. The new farmers are people raising livestock and produce for local markets.

They are typically operating in areas such as his home county of Pine, where there is access to smaller parcels of land that are more affordable. In locations such as Kandiyohi County, it’s virtually impossible to start a 1,000-acre operation unless taking over as part of a family operation, he said.

Asked about the situation for undocumented workers, Petersen said he is regularly taking calls from large entities — everything from landscapers and horse racing tracks to dairy and pork producers — concerned about it. He said the Agriculture Department is working with the Attorney General’s Office on the issues.

Most of the foreign workers in Minnesota are here under the H-2A visa program, which allows for temporary employment.

“Many of these workers come every year, same families, farms, businesses. Very important for our whole sector,” said the commissioner.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/466b1cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3872x2592+0+0/resize/1592x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2a%2F0b%2F2460475c4de7bafd526a0b386fe0%2Fdsc-0028.JPG,N,,2025-06-21 09:01:46.568810

Germany’s proposed fine of €17,000 would be significantly higher than this minimum and could be adjusted in the future.

The proposed fine, revealed in a draft seen by Argus, is aimed at enforcing compliance with upcoming EU rules that require a growing share of hydrogen-based fuels in aviation, reports Argus.

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation will require fuel suppliers to begin blending e-SAF starting in 2030. From 2030 to 2031, at least 1.2% of the total aviation fuel supply must be e-SAF on average, with a minimum of 0.7% each year. The blending requirement will increase over time — reaching 2% in 2032, 5% in 2035, and eventually 35% by 2050.

The EU mandates that national penalties for non-compliance be set at no less than twice the price difference between e-SAF and conventional jet fuel. Based on reference prices released earlier this year by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, the minimum penalty should be around €13,922 per tonne. Germany’s proposed fine of €17,000 would be significantly higher than this minimum and could be adjusted in the future.

E-SAF is made using renewable or low-carbon hydrogen, including hydrogen produced via nuclear-powered electrolysis. While the direct use of hydrogen in aviation is also permitted under EU legislation, this is widely regarded as a longer-term solution.

Germany had previously considered setting its own national e-SAF targets but abandoned those plans following the adoption of the EU-wide rules.

In a historic statement at the 55th International Paris Air Show, Air France-KLM and Groupe ADP, in conjunction with the French government, unveiled their ambitious “Connect France” vision.

With French President Emmanuel Macron, Air France-KLM Group CEO Benjamin Smith, and Groupe ADP Chairman and CEO Philippe Pascal affirmed an alliance to enhance global connectivity to France and to position Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG) as the world’s leading aviation hub.

A Unified Vision for the Future of French Aviation

The “Connect France” initiative arises from a mutual understanding of the current global aviation challenges. The geopolitical climate, paired with escalating competition from non-European players, has made it crucial to enhance the synergy between Air France and Groupe ADP. The goal is to strengthen the operational efficiency and competitiveness of Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, ensuring its place as a global leader in air travel.

The new collaboration brings together two pillars of France’s aviation infrastructure—Air France, a leading international airline, and Groupe ADP, the operator of Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport. Together, they employ over 870,000 people in direct and indirect roles across France, with the airport playing a pivotal role in France’s economy. With 11% of the nation’s export value flowing through CDG, the initiative is a strategic move to safeguard France’s economic and political sovereignty in aviation.

Facing Fierce Competition and Securing France’s Aviation Future

While France remains the world’s top tourist destination, its aviation services are gradually shifting to foreign hands. Airports in neighboring European nations, benefiting from more attractive fiscal and regulatory frameworks, are diverting traffic that previously passed through France. The growing trend of “silent offshoring” poses a direct threat to the dominance of Paris-Charles de Gaulle, and “Connect France” aims to address this gap by ensuring France’s aviation industry can thrive in a competitive environment.

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, emphasized the need for closer collaboration to face this growing competition, particularly from non-European airlines. “With ‘Connect France,’ we are formalizing the approach needed to protect France’s aviation infrastructure, boost connectivity, and continue to provide high-quality service to our passengers,” Smith stated.

Philippe Pascal, Chairman of Groupe ADP, highlighted that this partnership will also focus on enhancing the passenger experience and promoting France’s distinctive cultural offerings to the world. “Paris-Charles de Gaulle is an essential asset for the country, and by capitalizing on the synergies between Air France and Groupe ADP, we will create a competitive edge that cannot be matched by other airports.”

Key Initiatives and Timeline for Progress

The ambitious “Connect France” partnership is focused on a set of key initiatives designed to improve the air travel experience for passengers, enhance operational performance, and meet sustainability goals. These initiatives will be rolled out in phases over the next few years.

Improved Passenger Experience

One of the standout features of the partnership is the introduction of a “short connection pass” for passengers with tight layovers. This initiative will streamline the journey for connecting passengers, offering dedicated pathways and prioritized screening. The system will be fully operational by Summer 2025, ensuring smoother transfers and shorter waiting times for travelers.

Optimizing Airport Operations

Air France and Groupe ADP are focused on optimizing the operations at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport, with a goal of increasing the wide-body aircraft contact rate to 95% at peak times by 2026. This will reduce bus transfers for passengers and enhance operational capacity, particularly during high-traffic periods.

Terminal Enhancements and Naming Strategy

By 2026, CDG’s terminals will undergo a redesign to improve passenger flow and navigation. Clearer signage and better wayfinding will be implemented, aligning with international standards to provide a smoother travel experience. Additionally, a new joint stopover offering will showcase the best of Paris, offering passengers connecting through CDG an opportunity to explore the city during layovers.

Sustainability Goals and SAF Development

Sustainability remains a core focus of the initiative. Air France is already one of the largest global buyers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and Groupe ADP is committed to providing low-carbon energy solutions at CDG. Together, they plan to push the envelope on SAF production in Europe, with an announcement expected by the end of 2025 on new projects and collaborations to bolster SAF infrastructure.

Creating a “Flagship France” Experience

As part of the broader vision, Groupe ADP aims to make CDG’s second Hall K the benchmark for French excellence. This terminal will feature the best in French culture, gastronomy, and fashion, offering a unique and luxurious travel experience for passengers.

Strengthening France’s Global Aviation Leadership

Until 2026, the consortium’s programs will reshape Paris-Charles de Gaulle’s international reputation for air leadership. Backed by the French government, the “Connect France” program signals that an overall national strategy is needed to sustain France’s competitive edge in global air transport.

It is not only aimed at increasing performance indicators but also at increasing international recognition for France as an air travel leader. In partnership between Groupe ADP, Air France, and public authorities, “Connect France” will transform Paris-Charles de Gaulle into one world-class airport hub.

This statement by Benjamin Smith is typical of this shift’s strategic imperatives: “This isn’t about competition; it’s about keeping France ahead of the curve in terms of industry, providing one-of-a-kind experiences to international travelers.”

The full information on the “Connect France” program, including progress in specific projects and the actual timeline for rollout, will be made available at intervals in the coming months as the partnership proceeds towards targets.

The transportation sector becomes more electrified in accordance with the energy transition to renewable energy. However, aviation is challenging to decarbonize due to low energy density of batteries. Specifically, it is difficult to store large-scale batteries in aircraft because there are stringent limitations in weight and space. Therefore, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) should serve as a bridge to battery-powered aircraft until the battery technology matures to lower transportation-related carbon emissions. It is imperative to produce SAF in a techno-economically feasible manner. Nevertheless, the successful commercialization of SAF is being hampered by the shortcomings of the SAF production processes, such as low efficiencies. Therefore, a co-production strategy is employed to build a new process addressing uncompetitive economics and low carbon efficiency of the SAF production process. The developed process co-produces valuable biochemicals, adipic acid and furfural, with butene oligomer (i.e., SAF) using lignocellulosic biomass. In this paper, comprehensive evaluations including tech-economic analysis and life-cycle assessment are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed process. The findings reveal that the proposed approach not only improves the process economics by approximately 2.7%, but also significantly enhances the environmental sustainability of the process, achieving a reduction of 15.75 kg CO2 eq/kg SAF.",https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image-v2.jpg,N,,2025-06-21 10:00:23.403857

Indonesia, a member of several biofuels initiatives, recently accepted India’s Global Biofuels Alliance invitation, emphasizing biofuels' growing role in international cooperation.","Biofuels are an increasingly indispensable complement to electrification and energy efficiency strategies in the global energy transition, particularly for the Global South. With fossil fuels projected to remain critical for transportation in developing economies, biofuels offer a lower-carbon alternative that is compatible with current vehicular technologies, but also capable of decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping. Their compatibility with existing infrastructure, reliance on locally available feedstocks, and potential to enhance rural livelihoods underscore their relevance for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, energy security, and inclusive development.

Yet significant challenges remain. The cost gap between biofuels and fossil fuels persists, particularly for advanced fuels like biojet and biomethane. Feedstock sustainability poses another constraint: expansion may conflict with food security, biodiversity, and land-use goals. Innovation remains underfunded, especially in second- and third-generation biofuels, and finance for large-scale deployment is unevenly distributed.

To address these barriers, the paper recommends three priorities: (i) expanding integrated policy frameworks that include blending mandates and sustainability certifications; (ii) accelerating technological innovation through R&D investments and public-private partnerships; and (iii) strengthening global cooperation and cross-learning, particularly through platforms like the Global Biofuels Alliance. These actions are essential to aligning biofuel deployment with net zero goals and advancing a just, resilient energy transition.

I. INTRODUCTION

Biofuels are increasingly regarded as vital to the process of energy transition, especially in the countries of the Global South. With a growing urban population, the energy demand from household consumption and transportation will increase significantly in the foreseeable future. Even with the share of renewable energy from solar, wind, hydrogen, and geothermal sources rising over time, fossil fuels will continue to remain an essential part of the energy mix, especially for the transportation sector in developing countries.

Biofuels offer an alternative to reduce the carbon intensity of energy demand both in the short and long run. They can have a lower carbon footprint than fossil fuels and can significantly decarbonize transportation, especially in hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation. Biofuels are highly adaptable and compatible with existing infrastructure, can use residues from agriculture, and offer additional sources of income for rural communities. Finally, several countries such as Brazil and India have existing policies to increase the use of biofuels and to enhance production capacity to meet the demand for biofuels. Over time, global collaboration and investment in new technologies have the potential to accelerate the transition to more sustainable methods that depend less on primary inputs from agriculture, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, and palm, which are still the base for the majority of global biofuel production.

On the supply side, greater uptake of biofuels will depend on production capacity, distribution network, and regulatory mandates. While ethanol is approaching cost parity with fossil fuels in countries like Brazil, biomethane and biojet fuel for aviation can be twice as expensive. The availability of feedstock is a significant challenge as it often competes with food production. Expanding biofuels production using current technologies can also lead to land use conflicts, deforestation, and biodiversity loss, underlining the urgency of investing in new technologies to augment the output of second and third-generation biofuels that do not jeopardize food security.

Currently, 80 percent of the global production of biofuels is concentrated in the United States, Brazil, Europe, India, and Indonesia. Countries like India, Brazil, and the United States have adopted policies that support supply growth. The policies have sustained annual growth rates above 20 percent during a 5-year timeframe, resulting in Brazil having 21 percent of its transport energy provided by biofuels while the United States has 7 percent. In India, ethanol accounted for 6 percent of the energy used in gasoline vehicles in 2022, twice the levels recorded in 2019. However, these markets comprise only half of the worldwide transport fuel demand. For there to be a sustainable increase in biofuels, new markets will have to be developed, while current ones will have to expand their production. Consequently, compacts like the Global Biofuel Alliance (GBA), launched during India’s G20 presidency in 2023, can serve as knowledge platforms that foster collaboration and work on ensuring secure and cost-effective biofuel supply while shaping robust standard settings and certifications for nations and other stakeholders.

This paper argues that biofuels represent a viable alternative within the energy mix for a country’s comprehensive energy transition, especially in the Global South. It will explore the bioenergy market and its dynamics, examine countries' sustainable policies and mandates, and assess the GBA's role in fostering innovation to scale production and align the sector with Net Zero Emissions goals and targets.

II. The Role of Biofuels in the Energy Transition, Market Dynamics, and Investment

Sustainable biofuel production is still not on course with the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) by 2050 Scenario. In the NZE Scenario, sustainable biofuel production needs to triple by 2030 to successfully abate emissions from current and future vehicles, such as trucks, planes, ships, and passenger cars, that have few other mitigation measures. To narrow the gap between biofuel production and deployment with the NZE goals, there is a need to strengthen existing country-level policies to establish new biofuels blending targets, advance technology, and develop new markets.

As the world works to decrease its dependence on fossil fuels, road transport is the closest to meeting the NZE Scenario targets as a result of greater use of biofuels and an increased share of electric vehicles. High-income countries have progressively augmented the electrification of their transportation systems, in addition to EVs constituting 25 percent or more of new vehicle sales. In the Global South's low- and middle-income countries, biofuels derived from crops and a small set of waste and residues like the used cooking oil and tallow offer immediate, affordable alternatives for decarbonizing the transportation system. Biofuels derived from other wastes and residues, such as cellulosic ethanol and algae, are costly, thus slowing their adoption until now.

Most biofuels mandates have a minimum greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) intensity requirement, ensuring biofuels are at least 50 percent lower emitting than fossil fuels and as much as 80 percent for some fuels. Additional advantages include biofuels serving as “drop-in” alternatives for fossil fuels, as their use integrates well with a good portion of the existing petroleum and natural gas infrastructure (Figure 2). In South American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Guatemala, replacing gasoline and diesel with ethanol and biodiesel could reduce GHG emissions by up to 84 percent. Studies indicate that significant reductions in GHG emissions for biofuels are possible in countries in Africa and Asia, up to 78 percent for biodiesel and 81 percent for ethanol compared to conventional fuels.

While there is substantial evidence that the available sustainable feedstocks could triple biofuel production by 2030, over 80 percent of that production occurs in only four countries: the United States, Brazil, Europe, and Indonesia. African nations, for instance, are nearly absent from the biofuels market, representing less than 1 percent of global production and consumption. Although current producers frequently expand their output, to align biofuel production with the NZE scenario, demand and supply must increase, necessitating the development of new markets and a boost in existing production.

The global biofuels market share surpassed $113 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $261 billion by 2034, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9 percent from 2025 to 2034. The increased demand is driven by heightened concerns about energy security, economic development, sustainability goals, climate policies, and government incentives to decarbonize various sectors. A total of 58 countries have mandated ethanol blending with gasoline, while 48 countries have set biodiesel blending requirements.

Certain emerging markets — Brazil, Indonesia, and India — are leading growth in biofuel production through mandates and incentives, primarily in road transport, which is expected to increase fuel demand by 27 billion liters. However, despite setting targets for the use of biofuels in aviation and maritime sectors, these countries have yet to implement concrete mandates and incentives to support these ambitions. In contrast, advanced economies like the United States and the European Union (EU) members are leading growth in air and maritime shipping, respectively, driven by strong mandates. By 2030, the aviation and shipping industries are projected to account for 75 percent of the new biofuel demand, mainly in the United States and the EU, spurred by policy incentives.

This growth is further reinforced by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework, which introduces a global fuel standard requiring ships to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas fuel intensity and establishes an economic mechanism where high-emitting vessels must purchase remedial units while low-emission ships may receive financial rewards. While advanced economies are currently driving the transition, there is untapped potential for emerging economies to expand into the maritime biofuels market by adopting similar regulatory and incentive structures.

While U.S. mandates under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remain uncertain, the EU has set a target to reach 14.5 percent renewable energy in transportation by 2030, setting specific targets for biofuels and hydrogen, including a 2 percent aviation fuel blend by 2025. India’s 2022 update to its National Biofuels Policy has accelerated targets for blending ethanol and biodiesel. Brazil’s 2024 Fuel of the Future program aimed at boosting investment, including sustainable aviation fuel (Figure 4).

Private sector investments have also played an essential role in advancing the global biofuels industry. In 2023, the net amount of power generated by transport biofuels increased to a decade-high level, attributed to an 8 percent rise in investment. Although several traditional biofuel projects have been announced recently, such as Brazil’s Grupo Potential investing $109 million to increase its annual biodiesel production capacity from 900 million to 1.62 billion liters, most new investments in the biofuels sector are now directed toward expanding the production of so-called drop-in fuels. These include renewable diesel (HVO), biojet, and biomethane, which are chemically similar or identical to the fossil fuels they replace and can be used without engine or infrastructure modifications. In contrast, bioethanol, biodiesel, and biogas generally require blending or equipment adjustments and thus are not considered true drop-in fuels. For example, Raízen, Brazil’s largest sugar and ethanol producer, recently unveiled plans to invest R$11.5 ($2) billion in constructing nine second-generation ethanol (E2G), biogas, and biomethane plants across the country, of which only biomethane would be classified as a drop-in fuel.

III. International Collaboration on Biofuels and Lessons from the Global South

International cooperation, involving the joint action of nations, organizations, and stakeholders, is crucial to realizing biofuels' full potential. Emerging markets in Latin America and Asia are experiencing robust growth in their biofuels sectors. The increasing demand for sustainable energy, abundant local resources, and ample land for biofuel production fuels this growth and showcases the potential for further development.

The Global Biofuel Alliance and Its Priorities

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi launched the GBA at the G20 Summit in Delhi in 2023. The alliance, which includes governments, international organizations, and industries, brings together the world's biggest biofuel consumers and producers. Its 24 member countries include the United States and Brazil, the world’s largest and second-largest biofuel producers, respectively. It builds on existing global initiatives such as the Clean Energy Ministerial Biofuture Platform, the Global Bioenergy Partnership, and the Technology Cooperation Program that have advanced international biofuel cooperation over the past four decades.

The alliance's three key priorities are to identify and develop high-potential markets for the sustainable production of biofuels, to accelerate technology deployment to commercialize biofuels, and to establish performance-based sustainability frameworks. Global alliances like the GBA are essential in balancing biofuel adoption with climate goals. While biofuels offer a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, their impact depends on the technologies and processes countries and industries use to produce them. Without careful implementation, production risks could undermine climate change mitigation efforts.

To succeed in these priorities — attracting public and private sector investment and advancing the commercialization of innovative conversion technologies — a complete life cycle assessment of biofuels is essential to determine whether these fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The GBA can set the directions for the entire biofuel supply chain upstream (feedstock and land use), midstream (conversion pathways), and downstream (blending and deployment) to prevent any additional environmental degradation. Our review points to a trio of key lessons for the GBA to be an effective instrument to support the adoption of biofuels as a key objective of a just and equitable energy transition led by the Global South. As we explain below, those are implementing strong regulations, promoting technological innovation, and advancing cross-learning.

Lessons from the Global South

Strong Regulatory Frameworks, Standards, and Targets Governments utilize various tools, including blending mandates, excise taxes, subsidies, tax credits, and fiscal incentives, to narrow biofuel cost gaps, boost production, and shield consumers from price fluctuations. Financial incentives like tax credits, loan guarantees, and subsidies help mitigate the higher production costs of biofuels, attract investment, lower market barriers, and accelerate biofuel adoption. Renewable fuel standards and blending targets create steady biofuel demand by requiring fixed volumes or percentages in fuel mixtures. To tackle sustainability concerns, feedstock regulations prevent deforestation and biodiversity loss, while certification programs such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) establish sustainability standards.

Brazil is a global leader in biofuels, producing 23 percent of the world's supply in 2021, with a strong regulatory framework supporting its biofuel sector. The country’s biofuel policies, such as the RenovaBio, aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector by promoting the production and use of biofuels. RenovaBio includes a certification system that rewards producers for their carbon efficiency, enabling them to trade decarbonization credits (CBIOs) on the stock exchange. These initiatives are part of Brazil's commitment to meeting its climate targets under the Paris Agreement, reducing emissions, and boosting investment in biofuels through innovative market-based mechanisms.

India has also made significant strides in biofuel development with its National Biofuels Policy, which targets a 20 percent ethanol blend by 2025-2026 and a 5 percent biodiesel blend by 2030. The country’s Ethanol Blending Program (EBP) has improved ethanol supply and reduced fuel import reliance. India is working towards self-sufficiency in biofuels, supported by new standards introduced in 2023 by the Bureau of Indian Standards. These standards aim to boost production and industry practices as India moves toward its long-term energy goals, including achieving net zero by 2070.

Meanwhile, Indonesia has focused on enhancing its biodiesel sector, using its abundant palm oil resources. The country aims to increase its biodiesel blending rate to 50 percent by 2028 and has introduced the Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil Standard (ISPO) to ensure sustainability in palm oil production. This framework aligns with domestic and international regulations to strengthen the palm oil sector’s competitiveness while contributing to emission reduction targets.

Promoting Technological Innovation To commercialize the advanced biofuels necessary to align with the NZE scenario, the rate of technology deployment must increase fifteen-fold by 2030 compared to 2021 standards. To achieve this, efforts in technology development and innovation are crucial for enhancing land productivity, optimizing the use of existing marginal land, and improving the collection of waste and residues from feedstocks compatible with current biofuel technologies. Brazil, India, and Indonesia are leading the way in biofuel innovation, integrating research with industry to bolster energy security, sustainability, and economic growth.

Brazil's biofuel growth has been backed by research led by Embrapa, a state-owned research corporation connected to the Ministry of Agriculture of Brazil. Embrapa focuses on increasing feedstock productivity without deforestation. Fermentation, bagasse recycling, and land restoration innovations optimize agricultural waste use. With over 40 million hectares of degraded pastureland, Brazil has significant potential to expand its biofuel production. Embrapa collaborates with companies such as Petrobras to develop low-carbon products, including biofuels, green chemicals, and fertilizers. Other partnerships, such as with Acelen, which operates the Mataripe refinery, involve cultivating the macaw palm for large-scale renewable fuel production. The project seeks to establish clear environmental and social guidelines, create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs, and generate over $1.3 billion in annual income for the involved communities.

India has also led biofuel production technology by investing $17 million in 75 joint biofuel projects, emphasizing sustainable biofuels, carbon capture, and smart grids. Funding for clean energy has surged, resulting in 5,000 compressed biogas (CBG) plants and pilot projects for hydrogen-methane fuel. The government also backs enzyme research for 2G ethanol and bioenergy research centers.

Indonesia has advanced biodiesel research since the 1990s, with institutions like LEMIGAS and BPPT developing biodiesel production from palm oil, used cooking oil, and jatropha. Research on pilot-scale production and engine trials led to small- and medium-scale biodiesel plants for testing and quality refinement. Once standards were met, regulations enabled commercial production. The biodiesel sector expanded with government and investor support, leading to the formation of APROBI (Indonesia Biofuel Producer Association) in 2006 to strengthen industry collaboration and policy development on biofuel usage in Indonesia.

Advancement of Cross-Learning One significant barrier to expanding biofuel use is the absence of internationally recognized sustainability standards. This mainly concerns the debate over land use for biomass cultivation and food security, which suggests that land necessary for food production may be diverted to biofuel production. Brazil, India, and Indonesia are engaged in international biofuel initiatives to establish standards for sustainable practices and promote adoption while considering local conditions in emerging producing countries. Brazil participates in the Biofuture Platform Initiative, the IEA Bioenergy Technology Collaboration Program, and bilateral agreements like its memorandum of understanding on Bioenergy Cooperation with India. Indonesia, a member of several biofuels initiatives, recently accepted India’s Global Biofuels Alliance invitation, emphasizing biofuels' growing role in international cooperation.

Leading bioenergy producers demonstrate that biofuel demand can be satisfied. However, solutions must be customized to each country’s conditions, considering resource availability, regulations, and technology. Since no nation can independently serve the biofuel market, international collaboration through platforms like the GBA is essential for promoting global biofuel sustainability. Countries like Brazil, India, and Indonesia have established strong institutional frameworks and policies that can serve as models for countries in the GBA and others.

IV. Conclusion

Biofuels emit significantly lower levels of greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels, making them a key solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and an essential step in the energy transition process. They also enhance energy security by reducing the reliance on imported fossil fuels and increasing domestic production, which can increase countries’ energy system diversification and stability. Additionally, biofuel can strengthen rural economies by creating jobs and new revenue streams for farmers while establishing sustainable credentials and standards that ensure ecologically and socially appropriate production methods.

Although advancements have been made in the biofuels sector, fully realizing their potential and aligning production with the Net Zero Emissions Scenario will require ongoing efforts across industries and stakeholders. Drawing from emerging market models, which have been leading biofuel growth, the Global Biofuels Alliance can play a crucial role in addressing the institutional challenges that new biofuel-producing countries face, enabling collaboration, fostering policy development, and promoting sustainable frameworks.

By fostering global dialogue, supporting national bioenergy legislation, and collaborating with existing international initiatives, the Global Biofuels Alliance can help streamline the integration of biofuels into the worldwide energy mix. The alliance can also facilitate access to global financial resources, ensuring that countries and industries have the support needed to enter and compete in the biofuels market. Through coordinated efforts, the alliance can strengthen biofuel trade, drive investments in innovative technologies, and promote responsible policies and sustainable frameworks. By expanding market opportunities and ensuring sustainable resource use, the Global Biofuels Alliance can accelerate the transition to a resilient energy future, aligning with global sustainability goals and emission reduction targets.

The announcement came as its latest aircraft, B-50028, arrived from Airbus’s Toulouse facility with a 5% SAF blend, cutting emissions by around 80% compared to conventional fuel, per UDN. Nine A320neo jets will be delivered under this plan, per CNA.

Tigerair Taiwan expects to receive two new A320neo aircraft this year following earlier delivery delays. Each will be ferried using a fixed SAF percentage as part of the airline’s carbon-reduction strategy. Ferry flights refer to one-way trips for delivery or maintenance purposes.

The A320neo fleet is a core part of Tigerair Taiwan’s modernization program, the carrier said. These jets offer up to 18% better fuel efficiency and 50% less noise, thanks to new engines and sharklet winglets.

The airline also touted improved passenger comfort, noting that the aircraft features the widest single-aisle cabin in the market. This supports its broader effort to combine sustainability with service quality.

Cllr Ross outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region and how it also raises questions about the government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.
In the letter, Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.
“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies.

In a joint letter with Cllr Anne Handley, leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, addressed to secretary of state for business and trade, Jonathan Reynolds MP, as well as Heidi Alexander MP, secretary of state for transport, Cllr Ross stressed the need for strong central government support for Vivergo Fuels ahead of next week’s launch of the national Industrial Strategy.

He stated that the future of the Vivergo plant, based at Saltend Chemicals Park, is at imminent risk as a result of the recent UK-US trade deal and poor regulation.

Cllr Ross outlined the wider impact closure of Vivergo Fuels could have on the region and how it also raises questions about the government’s commitment to green energy and its policies to support it.

In the letter, Cllr Ross said: “Not only is Vivergo Fuels the UK’s largest bioethanol producer, with a crucial role to play in UK transport decarbonisation, but it’s also a strategically important anchor employer in the region.

“It supports over 160 skilled jobs directly and around 4,000 more in the supply chain, the majority of which are based in our Hull and East Riding region.

“The Humber has gained a deserved reputation as a beacon for renewable energy development and production and we are working extremely hard to attract further investment to the region in emerging technologies. such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel.

“This would be immeasurably harder to do if regulatory and financial support are not forthcoming for this business, which has already seen over £700m of private sector investment since 2012.

“The Government’s new UK-USA trade deal has deliberately moved the commercial goalposts, damaging a UK business, which invests in the UK and employs UK workers, whilst advantaging American businesses who produce their product overseas.

“Allowing closure of the Vivergo Fuels plant would send a hugely damaging signal to clean energy investors and to any businesses who are considering investing in this region and across the UK.

“The government has identified clean energy as one of its priority industries and states that its number one focus is encouraging growth, so we now need to see that rhetoric matched with concrete actions and support.

“On behalf of Hull City Council and East Riding of Yorkshire Council, I urge you to act swiftly to secure the necessary support for this business which is of great significance to the residents of our authority and many across our wider region.”

Ben Hackett, managing director of Vivergo Fuels, added: “Vivergo Fuels is a fantastic asset to Hull and East Yorkshire. Not only do we employ a highly skilled workforce and support thousands more jobs in the supply chain, we are a catalyst for further green industrial development and investment which would allow the fuels of the future to be pioneered right here on the Humber.

“We are simply asking the government for measures that will allow UK ethanol producers to remain competitive in the face of US imports, which benefit from a range of advantages from genetically modified crops to cheaper energy costs.

“We now need to see concrete commitments from ministers in the coming days to safeguard jobs, and protect against the loss of significant investment in the people of this region.”",https://news.hull.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/guildhall_ross-e1655900108632.webp,N,,2025-06-21 01:58:17.714029

Palantir is cutting emissions by 31% from its 2019 baseline. It offsets the rest with high-quality carbon credits.

This achievement shows how software companies can lead in ESG even without making physical products. Its “product-first” strategy helps customers create climate solutions. At the same time, it keeps its own footprint low. This is ideal for investors who care about AI and sustainability. Let’s uncover how Palantir achieves its net-zero goal.

Cutting Code and Carbon: How Palantir Hits Net Zero

Palantir reached a major sustainability milestone in 2024 by achieving carbon neutrality across its global operations. This was made possible by reducing its total greenhouse gas emissions by 31% compared to its 2019 baseline.

In 2024, Palantir reported emissions of 23,018 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂e), a slight increase of 1.7% from 2023, when emissions were at 22,635 tCO₂e.

The company attributes the 2024 increase to a gradual return to business travel and operational activity. The trend shows clear progress. Emissions per employee have fallen by 57% since 2019. Now, each employee is responsible for only 6 tCO₂e.

Palantir’s carbon footprint is small compared to companies with physical supply chains or manufacturing. As a software company, it neither owns nor operates production facilities and primarily leases office spaces.

The software giant’s direct (Scope 1 and 2) emissions remain low and are mostly tied to heating and electricity use in its offices. The company partners with utility providers and landlords. This helps them gather better data on energy use, which improves reporting accuracy.

Most of Palantir’s emissions are Scope 3. This includes business travel, employee commuting, cloud computing, and third-party services. Business travel, in particular, has been the largest contributor.

To lessen this impact, Palantir urges employees to hold virtual meetings. They can join programs like United Airlines’ Eco-Skies Alliance. This program helps create sustainable aviation fuel.

Palantir has made notable progress in reducing emissions from its digital infrastructure. Between 2022 and 2023, the company’s cloud computing emissions fell by 32%. This decline was largely due to more energy-efficient data centers and software optimization.

The company is looking for partnerships with cloud providers. They focus on renewable energy and high energy-efficiency ratings.

RELATED: Palantir Reports Record-Breaking Q4 and Net Zero Success

To balance its residual emissions, Palantir purchases and retires verified carbon credits that support projects such as:

Landfill gas capture

Destruction of ozone-depleting substances

Renewable energy development

These projects were chosen for their environmental credibility. They also match the company’s commitment to long-term sustainability.

In 2023, Palantir formalized its environmental efforts by publishing its first Environmental Policy. The same year, its UK operations released a Carbon Reduction Plan, committing to a 42% cut in emissions by 2029. These steps show a bigger plan to include climate goals in how we operate and share information with the public.

Building Green Tools: Palantir’s Climate-Focused AI Platforms

Palantir not only manages its own environmental impact but also helps other organizations reach their climate and net zero goals. It uses its strong AI and data platforms to do this. The company describes itself as having a “product-first” philosophy—one that gives customers the tools to build climate solutions at scale.

Palantir offers platforms like Foundry, Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). These support many climate-related use cases. These include:

Building digital twins of infrastructure to simulate environmental risks

Enhancing grid resilience through predictive modeling

Planning electric vehicle infrastructure deployment

Tracking carbon emissions across supply chains and operations

One of Palantir’s flagship ESG tools is the Agora platform, launched in 2022. Agora enables energy and commodity firms to monitor supply chain emissions in real time.

At the 2023 Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC), Palantir showed how Agora helps big partners like bp, Ecopetrol, and Trafigura. They use it to track, analyze, and cut carbon emissions from oil and gas operations.

In July 2024, Palantir teamed up with Tree Energy Solutions (TES). This partnership aims to boost green hydrogen production. TES uses Palantir’s software to model its supply chain, which includes hydrogen production sites and transport logistics. This helps track emissions, optimize energy use, and scale low-carbon fuel projects more quickly.

Palantir also works on internal sustainability initiatives. For example, in its London office, the company partners with Fooditude to reduce plastic and food waste. This partnership has cut single-use water bottles by 80%. It also promotes eco-friendly packaging and food sourcing.

Palantir is growing its AI and data operations. The company is also working hard to make its software and infrastructure more energy efficient. This means creating lighter apps, reducing server strain by optimizing workloads, and choosing cloud providers that use renewable energy.

Palantir’s approach highlights how software companies can impact climate change. They do this not only by reducing their own emissions but also by offering digital tools. These tools help speed up decarbonization in various industries.

Low Footprint, High Ambition

Palantir’s low footprint reflects its business model. It leases offices rather than owning buildings and doesn’t operate factories or own data centers. Even its cloud usage—from AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud—is relatively clean, with a 32% year‑over‑year drop in cloud‑related emissions from 2022 to 2023.

The company uses market-based accounting for Scope 2 and regularly audits its energy sources to improve accuracy. It invests in compute‑efficiency improvements for its AI platforms as well.

Palantir continues to reduce emissions in every area and offset what remains through verified credits and sustainable aviation fuel. It also submitted its emissions targets to the Science‑Based Targets Initiative in 2023 to gain external validation.

Why ESG‑Minded Investors Are Paying Attention

For investors focused on AI and ESG—especially those preferring companies with strong sustainability records—Palantir offers a compelling case with these reasons:

It proves corporate carbon neutrality is doable even for tech firms with global operations.

It features transparent emissions reporting, including per‑employee metrics and absolute reductions.

It enables other companies to reduce their own carbon footprints through Palantir-powered analytics.

Palantir shows that software companies can aim for net zero without sacrificing innovation. After reducing emissions by up to 38% since 2019 and offsetting the rest, it remains carbon neutral through 2024. Meanwhile, its AI platforms serve as foundations for climate solutions—from decarbonizing industry to planning clean energy.

For ESG-conscious investors and industry professionals, Palantir offers proof that advanced AI can support a sustainable future—not just improve the bottom line. Its path shows how tech giants can help the planet while building value, one code line at a time.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_2566125289.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 18:03:46.763833
,,2025-06-20 21:06:25+00:00,The Straits Times,Turbulence ahead: How used cooking oil could hinder aviation's green fuel hopes | The Straits Times,"Azril Annuar, David Fogarty",,,,,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/turbulence-ahead-how-used-cooking-oil-could-hinder-aviations-green-fuel-hopes,"Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin has previously acknowledged there is fraud in the country’s UCO supply chain.
To ramp up SAF usage, from 2026, all flights departing Singapore’s two civilian airports must use 1 per cent SAF.
The goal is to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent SAF use by 2030.
“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain.
Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry.","– This is the starting point for the world’s – and especially Europe’s – lofty dreams of greener air travel: a collection point for plastic bottles filled with discarded frying oil in Malaysia.

One Saturday morning in May 2025 in the city of Melaka, volunteers in green T-shirts rushed over as Ms Adibah Rahim and her husband drove into the central square, eager to unpack, weigh and register her consignment of used cooking oil (UCO) – the “liquid gold” in European and Asian plans to ramp up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ms Rahim, a housewife, told The Straits Times it was her first time selling used oil, which she had collected over five to six months. She left the collection point RM90 (S$27) richer: At RM3 per litre of oil, it is a welcome boost to her family’s household budget.

“We usually collect UCO from around 200 members of the public,” said Mr Michael Andrew, sales manager for Evergreen Oil & Feed, the company running the Melaka collection with the local council. Evergreen, which runs similar collection drives elsewhere in Malaysia, supplies leading European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell and Finland’s Neste, the operator of SAF refineries in Europe and Singapore.

The aviation industry and many governments, including Singapore’s, are pinning their hopes on SAF as a way to cut the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions, which are set to increase as demand for flying grows.

And fuel suppliers around the world are scrambling for raw materials to meet new legal SAF blending quotas in Europe and growing demand elsewhere.

When it is made from waste such as UCO, rather than agricultural commodities such as soya or palm oil, SAF purportedly has up to 80 per cent less planet-heating emissions than kerosene jet fuel. And repurposing waste cooking oil avoids using land that would otherwise be used for food crops, or fuelling forest destruction.

But behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks – raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

The concern is that barely used and virgin palm oil – the latter is not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO that traders supply to fuel companies, experts and industry operators said.

The investigation focused on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, the EU’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers – oil and gas giant Repsol.

The investigation was funded by Journalismfund Europe.

Fried in Spain?

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Repsol chief executive Josu Jon Imaz held up his company’s new €250 million (S$369 million) plant for renewable fuels, including SAF, near the historic Spanish port town of Cartagena as an example of how Europe can pursue a fair green transition.

Repsol, which aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, started large-scale production of biodiesel and jet fuel – with its SAF mainly made from UCO – at the plant early in 2024.

Contrasting this with electric vehicles, many of them imported from China, Dr Imaz said the raw material for Repsol’s renewable fuels “comes from the Spanish farms and from the Spanish rural economy”.

In a promotional video for those fuels, Spanish celebrity chef Susi Diaz is seen dispensing advice to young cooks in the kitchen of her La Finca restaurant. Olive oil is then poured out of a pan into steel jugs as a voiceover explains how the waste cooking residue will be sent to the Repsol biofuel refinery.

The company is also promoting the recycling of UCO from Spanish households – of which it says only 5 per cent is currently collected – at its fuel stations across the country.

Spain’s restaurants and homes, however, are not the main source of Repsol’s UCO.

In 2024, more than 126,000 tonnes of UCO from Asia – enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools – arrived in the Spanish region of Murcia, where Repsol’s flagship biofuel plant is located, according to trade data published by Spain’s tax agency.

Nearly two-thirds came from Malaysia, whose UCO exports to the region saw a tenfold rise in the same year that the energy heavyweight fired up its Cartagena SAF refinery.

The figures do not specify who provided or bought the raw material. But trade data shows that Repsol purchased at least 53,000 tonnes of UCO from five Malaysian companies, including Evergreen Oil & Feed, in 2024. That amount represents 18 per cent of the UCO the Repsol plant in Cartagena uses annually.

This is based on an analysis of Customs records provided by investigative consultancy Data Desk, which provided Climate Home News with a list of shipments of UCO certified for the European market, sourced from Malaysia by Repsol’s trading unit in Singapore.

No incidents of fraudulent UCO were detected in Repsol’s supply chain, with imports meeting EU rules on green certification.

Repsol told Climate Home News it “complements with imports when necessary” and receives raw material shipments from more than 20 countries. It declined to provide more details about the imports for “competitive reasons”.

Repsol’s heavy reliance on Malaysian supplies exposes it to fraud risks that raise wider questions about global assertions over the sustainability of SAF.

Asked what steps it takes to fight fraud, Repsol said it operates a rigorous supplier monitoring system to ensure the sustainability and integrity of its SAF production. A “very strong” compliance process means dubious raw materials and suppliers suspected of misconduct are quickly weeded out, it added.

“Any type of fraud distorts the market and undermines the confidence in the system, so it must be fought with all possible legal means,” the company said in e-mailed comments.

Shrinking air travel’s carbon footprint

Europe’s green aviation fuel refineries are boosting output because of new requirements by the EU for planes to use more SAF in the coming decades. From the start of 2025, fuel supplied to airports across Europe needs to contain at least 2 per cent of SAF, with targets rising to 70 per cent by 2050.

A million tonnes of SAF is needed to hit the EU’s 2025 mandate, and this will rise to 2.7 million tonnes a year by 2030 to meet the 6 per cent mandate.

SAF is crucial for shrinking aviation’s carbon footprint, according to industry body the International Air Transport Association (Iata), and is expected to account for 65 per cent of emissions reductions by 2050, when the sector has committed to reaching net zero.

In 2023, emissions from international plane travel accounted for 2.5 per cent of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions. As air travel increases, and other sectors are more easily able to decarbonise, that share is set to grow.

One of the reasons SAF is so attractive is that it is a drop-in fuel for planes, requiring no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Repsol’s Dr Imaz told financial analysts early in 2024 that emissions-cutting alternatives to SAF – such as restricting short-haul flights – would represent “a drop in the ocean”.

Repsol’s plant uses 300,000 tonnes of UCO to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable fuels, including SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil.

But surging demand for UCO, SAF’s feedstock of choice, and a far-from-perfect global certification system based on self-declaration at the start of the supply chain are encouraging fraud that undermines the new fuel’s green credentials.

‘Ridiculous’ export statistics

This investigation found that by the time Asia-based traders ship UCO supplies overseas to refineries for processing into SAF, guaranteeing their environmental integrity is virtually impossible – despite the certification system on which fuel companies and airlines rely.

A source at a leading Malaysian UCO supplier to companies including Repsol told ST that he suspects that both UCO collectors and restaurants are committing fraud by providing oil that does not qualify as used, although it is difficult to prove.

In Malaysia, which is among the world’s leading suppliers of UCO and virgin palm oil, government-subsidised cooking oil is cheaper than UCO – providing a clear incentive for fraud. Subsidised cooking oil sells for RM2.50 per kg versus the UCO trading price of up to RM4.50 per kg.

In a 2024 report, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) cited figures showing that Malaysia already exports about three times as much UCO as it is estimated to collect domestically and import, raising concern about where that oil is coming from – and what it consists of.

In 2023, 458,000 tonnes of UCO originating in Malaysia were registered with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), the leading certification scheme recognised by the European Commission to demonstrate compliance with its biofuel sustainability criteria.

In absolute terms, that puts Malaysia second only to China, which registered 1.65 million tonnes. Malaysia’s UCO volume, if indeed collected from its population, works out to 15.2 litres per person – the highest worldwide by far.

This figure is “ridiculous”, said Mr Cian Delaney, campaign coordinator at T&E, adding that for it to be feasible, Malaysia would need to be “a world-leading collection and refining system – which it isn’t”.

In comparison, China collected 1.4 litres per capita, while the figure is 0.9 litre in Indonesia and 3.8 litres in Spain.

Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin has previously acknowledged there is fraud in the country’s UCO supply chain. He told Reuters in February 2025 that the government would crack down on this to uphold the country’s “reputation as a responsible exporter”.

In a response to questions from ST, he said: “To maintain supply chain integrity, various measures are in place, including traceability systems, certification requirements, and stringent export documentation. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board , in collaboration with other regulatory bodies, is actively monitoring the industry to prevent fraudulent activities.”

He also said the government was strengthening enforcement mechanisms to uphold industry credibility.

Opaque supply chain

The waste ingredients from which SAF is made change hands multiple times in a largely opaque system. To verify their sustainability, European regulators rely on checks by private auditors and agencies that issue green certificates based on their findings.

But there is a systemic blind spot: The restaurants, street stalls, households and factories from which the UCO is pooled self-declare the origin of their contributions. Aside from ad hoc spot checks and sampling, there is no way of knowing that all of these providers are telling the truth.

“The opportunity ... of fraud is very high,” said Mr Vasu R. Vasuthewan, former Malaysia head for the ISCC.

The Malaysian authorities recently uncovered criminal syndicates that had pocketed thousands of dollars a day by getting hold of large amounts of subsidised cooking oil, mixing it in with UCO, and then selling it on to industrial UCO traders.

Sources within the industry told Climate Home News and ST that many households and restaurants are motivated to replace cooking oil after a single use – contrary to the standard practice of three to five times – and then sell it on as UCO. Cooking oil is considered waste when it is no longer fit for frying.

“Restaurant compliance (with sustainability standards) may be very low,” said Mr Vasuthewan, who now runs his own UCO import and export business. “Many will fake their declaration, hoping they won’t get caught.”

Mr Delaney of T&E said it is difficult for auditors to physically check the origin of the oil, since hundreds of restaurants can supply the same collection point, making it a “notable blind spot”.

Singapore, a global SAF hub in the making

Singapore is a key part of the global SAF supply chain and is positioning itself as a leader in the production and usage of such fuel. The Republic is home to the world’s largest SAF refinery by capacity: Neste’s biofuel refinery in Tuas. Its SAF production capacity is one million tonnes a year.

Government trade data shows that Singapore is a major importer of UCO from China and Malaysia; this is most likely for the Neste refinery. The Republic also has a licensing framework for local UCO collectors, who pick up UCO mainly from restaurants, hotels and commercial kitchens, with about 19,000 tonnes collected annually from 2021 to 2024, according to the National Environment Agency.

The Government regards SAF as a critical tool to reduce aviation emissions while allowing the industry to keep expanding and Changi Airport, one of the world’s busiest, to keep growing.

To ramp up SAF usage, from 2026, all flights departing Singapore’s two civilian airports must use 1 per cent SAF. The goal is to reach 3 per cent to 5 per cent SAF use by 2030.

Fraud is a concern for the authorities and the industry.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) told ST that it recognises the importance of ensuring transparency and integrity in SAF feedstocks.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain. We share the same concerns as these pose risks to market confidence, fair trading and development of a nascent SAF market,” said CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng.

He said the authority is working with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection to develop “harmonised standards for feedstock verification to prevent further fraudulent practices”.

Neste told ST, in response to questions: “Neste sources traceable UCO and other renewable raw materials globally from carefully selected suppliers. Neste evaluates its suppliers and accepts renewable raw materials only from those suppliers that are able to meet strict criteria for sustainability.”

The Singapore Airlines Group said it works closely with its partners to ensure supplies meet internationally recognised standards such as the ISCC, and comply with regulatory requirements in jurisdictions with SAF mandates.

Spot checks, patchy audits

There is a system in place to keep fraudulent stocks out of the supply chain. Buyers and regulators in Europe rely on audit companies to trace the raw materials used in SAF and prove their green credentials.

Those audits are verified by authorised certification systems like the ISCC – which is led by the biofuel industry and, according to one source, enjoys “a kind of monopoly” in the sector. It then issues sustainability certificates to commodities traders and fuel suppliers.

According to the ISCC, its certification supports “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”.

While in some cases auditors conduct random field checks, that happens less often in countries outside the EU, industry experts say.

According to Mr James Cogan, compliance and markets lead at Irish biofuel firm ClonBio, it is far easier for fraud to occur outside the EU where “it’s much less visible to us”.

A 2024 analysis by T&E in China, for example, showed that sampling of points of origin happened in less than 10 per cent of the ISCC-approved audits, whereas in the EU, it was about 30 per cent.

Mr Adam Kirby, ISCC’s senior sustainability manager, told Climate Home News that auditors monitor volumes going in and out of collection points for any suspicious behaviour, in addition to carrying out spot checks. He added that the ISCC follows the requirements established by regulators like the European Commission.

In 2024, the ISCC also conducted 79 special “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. In a third of the cases, it found violations of its certification requirements, including an inability to demonstrate the traceability of products, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Long paper trail

Under the current system, the entire SAF supply chain relies on a long paper trail rooted in those self-declarations and sporadic inspections at the points where UCO is collected.

In Malaysia, Evergreen’s owner C.K. Lau told ST that the company follows the proper processes in its collection based on the requirements established by the ISCC. He added that the documentation is critical as, otherwise, the company would not be able to export its UCO.

Repsol, for its part, said it requires “suppliers to be certified under European Commission-recognised voluntary regimes”.

In turn, airline companies that buy from Repsol, such as the International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and Level – rely on documentation they get from it and other jet fuel providers, to show that the SAF they are paying for has green certification.

In exceptional cases, IAG has sent its own staff to carry out checks on the ground, as with a Shanghai-based Chinese supplier in 2024. It told Climate Home News the outcome of that audit – which included supply, record-keeping, environmental and health and safety standards – was “positive”.

Mr Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for Iata, believes airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry. “You’ll see a race to the top... on sustainability, and it will, in a way, be self-regulated,” he added.

SAF certification faces EU scrutiny

In the meantime, following a string of fraud allegations about the authenticity of UCO-derived biofuels imported from China, the EU has been trying to ascertain whether the certification system that governments and businesses rely on is fit for purpose.

The EU authorities have been in talks to strengthen that system, leading to speculation that the ISCC could be suspended for failing to catch cases of biodiesel fraud. The ISCC denied in a statement that regulators had considered halting automatic EU-wide acceptance of its certificates, adding that its relationship with the European Commission remained constructive.

“There are always bad actors, there are always bad people, and there’s only a certain amount of policing that can be done in any industry,” said Mr Kirby. “We at ISCC have done, I think, an incredible job.”

The ISCC did not respond to follow-up questions from Climate Home News on whether it has full confidence in the current system, including self-declaration.

A European Commission spokeswoman said the bloc’s executive arm was closely monitoring the SAF market “to detect and prevent fraud, which risks undermining the EU’s ambition to effectively decarbonise air transport”.

Demand for UCO sizzles

Demand for SAF and UCO is only expected to increase as usage in Europe, Asia and elsewhere grows and as new refineries are completed in China, South Korea and Malaysia.

In 2024, Malaysia’s state energy firm Petronas, Italy’s Enilive, and Euglena of Japan announced they would develop a biorefinery at Petronas’ Pengerang Integrated Complex in Johor. Due for completion in 2028, it would produce SAF and other biofuels.

Malaysia plans to mandate SAF usage by 2027, with the initial goal of blending it into aviation fuel at a 1 per cent rate.

Leading European refiners like Repsol are pushing for a level global playing field as well as more public funding to bring down costs and help develop the nascent sector on the continent.

Iata warned earlier in June that the European mandates had caused the SAF price paid by airlines to double because of hefty compliance fees being charged by producers.

Repsol’s aviation head Carlos Suarez Cubillo warned that fuel producers in parts of the world with laxer rules could produce SAF “with less regulation and less control of the feedstock... and here in Europe that could de-incentivise the production, the construction of new facilities”.

In Brazil, for example, an emerging SAF industry is gearing up to use crop-based feedstocks that are commonly linked to deforestation – and are therefore banned in Europe – such as soya and palm oil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol, which has been linked to labour abuses and modern slavery.

An investigation by Climate Home News’ partner in Brazil, InfoAmazonia, found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region – billed as Brazil’s first SAF project – is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

Iata hopes its efforts to put in place a global registry for SAF, launched in April as a voluntary initiative, will boost transparency around feedstocks and their greenhouse gas savings – and enable airlines to have some level of visibility and comparability between countries, fuel providers and airports.

SAF producers and airlines are also looking to other waste-based materials to meet rising mandates – especially as more advanced fuels made from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, known as e-SAF, are still being developed and tested.

Repsol, for example, recently closed a deal with US vegetable oils giant Bunge to source camelina and safflower – non-food crops that can grow on poor land – to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil for biodiesel and SAF.

In January, it also announced it would invest more than €800 million in Europe’s first plant in the Catalan city of Tarragona to produce renewable methanol from organic urban waste, for use in maritime, road and aviation transport from 2029.

But in the meantime, Europe’s overwhelming reliance on UCO means it will continue to import supplies from Asia – despite the concerns over fraud, said Ms Sophie Byron, global head of biofuels pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“That trade flow is not going away any time soon,” she said.

While that is a relatively small share of total global emissions, it looks set to increase in the decades to come, as significantly cutting emissions is still a distant technological prospect for commercial aircraft, even as other sectors, such as road transport, are doing so by going electric.

For airlines and governments across the world, the solution is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which backers say can cut emissions by more than 80 per cent, without requiring aircraft modifications.

SAF is designed to be a drop-in fuel for planes, needing no new additional infrastructure at airports. Current technology allows up to 50 per cent of SAF to be blended with fossil fuel-based jet fuel.

Here are some key things to know about SAF:

How is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made?

The fuel can be made from a variety of raw materials, or feedstocks, using different techniques, but today virtually all of it is made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (Hefa). The Hefa production process involves stripping oxygen from the fat molecules of natural oils and fats and replacing it with hydrogen. Hefa fuel has various uses, including in aviation.

Used cooking oil (UCO) is currently the most common feedstock for SAF, especially in Europe where policies promote its use as a recycled waste product that does not compete for land with food production or carry a high risk of deforestation, in contrast to virgin oils derived from soya beans or palm.

Other regions are prioritising feedstocks that can be easily sourced locally, such as soya in the US and palm oil in Brazil. The two agricultural powerhouses are also expected to produce large quantities of SAF by converting ethanol made from corn or sugarcane – another kind of drop-in fuel known as alcohol-to-jet.

SAF can also be made without crops or organic waste. Synthetic fuels – known as e-SAF or power-to-liquid SAF – are made using hydrogen, generated from renewable electricity, and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes.

How much SAF are airlines using?

A tiny amount. SAF accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association, which has called the take-up rate “disappointing”.

Cost is the main reason for the slow roll-out. Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, depending on how it is produced. That is primarily down to the limited availability of feedstocks like UCO, which is hard to collect from restaurants and households. The price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is also kept artificially low because of wide-ranging tax exemptions.

Around the world, a number of governments are trying to expand the market for cleaner aviation fuels by offering financial incentives and making the use of SAF in planes compulsory.

The European Union and the UK introduced the world’s first SAF mandates in January 2025, requiring fuel suppliers to blend at least 2 per cent SAF with conventional kerosene. The blending requirement will gradually increase to reach 32 per cent in the EU and 22 per cent in the UK by 2040.

SAF mandates are also coming into force over the next few years in Singapore and Brazil, and other major aviation hubs such as Japan and China plan to introduce targets for its use.

Singapore has been very active in trying to grow regional demand for such fuel. In May , the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, a Temasek-owned investment platform, launched the Green Fuel Forward initiative to scale up production of SAF. The initiative draws in airlines, refiners, logistics companies, banks and others to invest in greater SAF usage.

Will SAF lead to net-zero air travel?

That remains to be seen. Existing and planned SAF projects in advanced stages will meet between 2 per cent and 4 per cent of jet fuel demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency, far short of what is needed to put the sector on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero by 2050.

Airlines have been sounding the alarm about scant supplies and demanding policies to incentivise production to lower costs. In March, the chief executive officers of Ryanair, the International Airline Group (IAG), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM warned that the EU’s 6 per cent SAF requirement for 2030 would be impossible to meet because of the high cost and scarcity of the greener fuel.

Asked to comment, the EU said the current SAF targets are “realistic and feasible”.

Who guarantees that SAF is a climate-friendly solution?

Governments and the International Civil Aviation Organisation require specific certification to prove the sustainability of a batch of SAF and the raw materials needed for its production.

The world’s leading certification scheme is the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), an industry-led initiative that aims to support “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”. EU regulators use ISCC certificates as proof of origin and sustainability of SAF produced and used in the bloc.

Approved third-party auditors are in charge of inspecting SAF plants and their suppliers along the global supply chain, which are then approved by the ISCC following EU standards.

Throughout the different stages of the SAF supply chain, the ISCC requires operators to pass certified information on the origin of raw materials and their carbon savings from one operator to another. But for some feedstocks, tracing their origin can be tricky.

In the case of UCO – the main raw material used in the EU today – suppliers at the point of origin, such as restaurants and individuals, are required to fill out a self-declaration form. The system relies on their honest claim that their product is actually waste oil. So there is some room for fraud, and efforts from airlines and regulators to close any loopholes are key.

Are air ticket prices higher because of SAF?

Some airlines have started passing on the extra costs of SAF to passengers, but for now this remains a small amount. However, IAG warned in 2024 that airfares would need to rise to fund the shift to cleaner fuels.

Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have added mandatory SAF levies to tickets, with the German flag carrier charging up to €72 (S$110) per flight depending on the route and fare, to cover the cost of complying with Europe’s new SAF mandates.

While stopping short of applying a surcharge, British Airways encourages members of its loyalty programme to make voluntary contributions for SAF, enabling them to pay with and earn points.

In Singapore, travellers flying out of the country will pay an SAF levy from 2026, when all departing flights will be required to carry fuel with 1 per cent SAF. Preliminary estimates from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore suggest that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul and $16 for long-haul flights.

A growing number of airlines also offer customers the option to pay a voluntary SAF charge as a way to help offset the carbon footprint of their journey.

Wood said its scope of work on the LBCC project will include redesigning existing processing infrastructure within the refinery to enable production of gasoline with notably reduced sulfur content complying with Colombia’s national targets for cleaner fuels, as well as ambitions to improve national air quality and health.
""This is a major project that will ensure the [Barrancabermeja] refinery continues to be the most sustainable in Latin America,” said Ricardo Roa Barragán, Ecopetrol’s chief executive officer and president.
Wood said it expects the Barrancabermeja refinery will begin first production of lower-sulfur gasoline from the LBCC project by 2030.
Ecopetrol previously undertook a series of major upgrades at Barrancabermeja valued at an overall investment of nearly $780 million in 2021 (OGJ Online, Feb. 19, 2021).","Majority state-owned Ecopetrol SA has let a contract to John Wood Group PLC to provide engineering works for a planned clean-fuels project at the operator’s 250,000-b/d Barrancabermeja refinery in Santander, Colombia.

As part of the June 19 contract, Wood will deliver detailed engineering design for associated upgrades as part of Ecopetrol’s Línea Base de Calidad de Combustibles (LBCC)—or fuel quality baseline—project, which is designed to improve the refinery’s quality of gasoline production, as well the site’s environmental performance, the service provider said.

Wood said its scope of work on the LBCC project will include redesigning existing processing infrastructure within the refinery to enable production of gasoline with notably reduced sulfur content complying with Colombia’s national targets for cleaner fuels, as well as ambitions to improve national air quality and health.

The proposed modifications at the refinery—which, as the nation’s main refining center, is responsible for producing more than 40% of domestically consumed fuels—will also play a critical role in the country achieving its energy transition targets of net-zero emissions by 2050, Wood and Ecopetrol said separately.

By 2030, Colombia’s energy plan calls for producing higher-octane gasoline with a reduced maximum-sulfur level of 10ppm accommodate entry of high-tech vehicles into the national market, as well as contribute to lower emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere.

The LBCC project specifically will ensure compliance with Colombia’s Ministries of Mines and Energy and Environment and Sustainable Development’s Resolution 40444 of 2023, which established a path to improving the national quality of diesel and gasoline to support increased environmental protection and improve health of Colombian citizens, Ecopetrol said in a Mar. 25 release.

LBCC project details

Officially approved by the company’s board in March 2025 at total investment of about $1.2 billion for allocation during the next few years, Barrancabermeja’s LBCC upgrading project will—alongside enabling output of lower-carbon gasoline—also equip the refinery to produce lower-emission hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

""This is a major project that will ensure the [Barrancabermeja] refinery continues to be the most sustainable in Latin America,” said Ricardo Roa Barragán, Ecopetrol’s chief executive officer and president.

“[The upgrading and revamp project will equip the refinery] to achieve greater production autonomy, produce cleaner [and] lighter gasoline, and support the [site’s] decarbonization [efforts in line with] the energy transition,"" Roa Barragán added.

Ecopetrol said internal calculations indicate Barrancabermeja’s LBCC project could reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by about 4.5 million tonnes/year (tpy)—equivalent to planting nearly 207 million trees annually—and help lower Colombia’s overall CO2-equivalent emissions by 5.3%.

The project additionally could reduce emissions of other pollutants such as nitrous oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), and carbon monoxide (CO) by about 90,000 tpy, which equates to an emissions-reduction rate for these pollutants of about a 2.7% from current levels, according to the operator.

Alongside spurring economic growth in the region, Ecopetrol said its level of investment in the LBCC project combined with the technical, operational, and logistical complexities involved in the project will also help create new employment opportunities for both skilled and unskilled workers on a regional and national basis.

Wood said it expects the Barrancabermeja refinery will begin first production of lower-sulfur gasoline from the LBCC project by 2030.

As American families make travel plans and assess energy costs for their farms and businesses during the summer, it is as important as ever to champion domestic production of affordable fuels. While gasoline prices in Nebraska are down 5.6 percent from this time a year ago, and diesel prices are down 5.8 percent, tensions around the world put supply chains and energy security at risk. In light of this, policies which embrace the capacity of American biofuels producers to meet demand, such as year-round availability of ethanol blends of 15 percent (E15), are crucial for an all-of-the-above, winning strategy for American energy affordability.

According to Growth Energy analysis, E15 has the potential to save American drivers $20.6 billion in annual fuel costs and generate $66.3 billion for U.S. gross domestic product. My bill with Senator Deb Fischer, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, would end the unnecessary cycle of dependance on summertime waivers from the EPA and permanently allow year-round, nationwide sale of E15. Our legislation does not have the effect of a mandate. It simply removes existing unscientific restrictions on E15 sales.

I am grateful last week the Trump administration rightfully recognized the key role biofuels play in American energy security when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements for 2026 and 2027. In May, I wrote to President Trump with 25 colleagues calling for timely and robust renewable volume obligation (RVO) requirements, and I look forward to working with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and the president to ensure these proposed RVO levels have the intended effect of promoting American energy production. If finalized, these RFS volumes will support our agriculture producers, provide much needed certainty to the industry, and ensure consumers have greater access to affordable liquid fuels.

Remarkably, the overall economic impact of the ethanol industry for our state is $8.18 billion—more than 50 times the total impact of the 2024 College World Series, which itself is wonderful for our economy. Because of the importance of biofuels to Nebraska’s economy and energy abundance, I supported inclusion of a provision in the House-passed reconciliation package to extend and improve the 45Z biofuels production tax credit through 2031. This measure directly supports farmers in the Third District and equips producers with the certainty to invest and power the future of sustainable aviation fuel and other clean transportation fuel.

In addition, last week the Trump administration took action to halt production at the EPA’s red tape factory and restore energy abundance. Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA has proposed a rule to eliminate the previous administration’s “Clean Power Plan 2.0,” which threatened to undermine grid reliability and inflate costs for Nebraskans, who get about half our state’s electricity from coal. Also, President Trump signed into law a resolution I supported which rescinded an EPA waiver granted under President Biden. The waiver permitted the State of California’s electric vehicle mandate which functionally banned the sale of vehicles powered by internal combustion. These Biden-era rules were unworkable, out of touch, and a step backward for American energy.

As co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Biofuels Caucus, I am committed to maximizing accessibility of renewable fuels and flexibility for American producers, consumers, and retailers.

The two companies will work together to set up systems that allow airlines, even those in remote areas, to get this fuel more easily. They will also help airlines understand how to use SAF within the rules that apply to air travel, without affecting their regular operations.

ATR’s Chief Executive Officer, Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, said that using cleaner fuel is one of the best ways to cut pollution from flying in the short and medium term. She pointed out that many smaller airlines struggle to get SAF, and this partnership is meant to fix that problem and make the fuel available to airlines all over the world.

Arnaud Namer, the head of ATOBA ENERGY, said he was proud to be part of a plan that gives all airlines a chance to use cleaner fuel. He explained that their method allows airlines, no matter where they are located, to reduce the amount of pollution they cause.

This effort is part of ATR’s bigger goal to make all of its planes ready to run entirely on sustainable fuel by the year 2030. This goal supports international efforts to fight climate change and is being developed with help from local and national governments.

The agreement also aims to improve trust in the aviation industry by sharing clear and accurate information about how this fuel affects the environment. By being open about the fuel’s benefits, ATR and ATOBA ENERGY hope to help more airlines make better choices for the planet.

This partnership is seen as a strong step toward making flying more environmentally friendly, especially for smaller airlines that often face challenges in making the switch.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2025-06-20 19:02:40.376582

This innovative initiative allows Airbus business travelers to reduce the environmental impact of their trips. The option is available directly through their booking tool.

Following the success of a pilot project in 2023, Air France-KLM and Airbus are strengthening their collaboration with a dedicated SAF fare agreement. Airbus has committed to purchasing SAF options for its employees’ business travel by joining Air France-KLM’s “SAF Corporate” program for the third consecutive year, a program that facilitates the funding and purchase of SAF.

Since the beginning of 2025, Air France-KLM has offered Airbus employees the opportunity to finance a percentage of SAF during the booking process on a selection of routes frequently used by the Group, such as Toulouse-Paris and Toulouse-Montreal, where Airbus has a production facility. This option, visible at the time of booking, aims to raise individual awareness among employees about efforts to reduce CO2 emissions related to business travel.

Since joining the SAF program in November 2023, Airbus has reduced its CO2 emissions by more than 2,000 tons through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF. This approach offers employees a concrete opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel.

Sébastien Guyot, Executive Vice President Global Sales at Air France-KLM, stated: “Reducing our CO2 emissions is a priority for our Group. Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to achieving our ambitions, and the contribution of our corporate customers, like Airbus, is crucial.”

Raphaël Duflos, Vice President Corporate Services Procurement at Airbus, added: “We are proud to be pioneers in adopting the new ‘SAF Bundle’ offer following the rollout of the New Distribution Capability (NDC) with Air France.

The 45Z production tax credit is critical to putting American energy production and farmers first.
It will help SAF producers establish new markets for farmers to sell their sustainably produced crops, rewarding farmers for their investments in regenerative agriculture.
This is critical to putting America first and securing new opportunities for Iowa farmers.
We are on the cusp of an energy revolution driven by Iowa farmers and biofuel producers.","Being a farmer in Iowa is no easy feat, and the last few years have presented new challenges. The value of Iowa farms was down 3.1% last year due to lower crop prices, increased interest rates, and high labor and supply costs.

If we don’t change course, this will have community-wide effects on the entire ag economy—in Iowa and across the country. Thankfully, supportive federal policy for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production could provide farmers like me new opportunities to stay in the game.

The 45Z production tax credit is critical to putting American energy production and farmers first. It will help SAF producers establish new markets for farmers to sell their sustainably produced crops, rewarding farmers for their investments in regenerative agriculture. For example, when farmers sell their crops as feedstocks to SAF producers, they can expect to earn up to an additional 20 cents per bushel of sustainably grown corn.

Many farmers, including myself, have adopted cutting-edge practices and technologies that allow us to efficiently and sustainably produce more crops per acre while also growing our bottom line. The market incentive to adopt these practices is clear and compelling: beyond the sizable market demand for sequestering carbon, these practices save us valuable time and money relative to more traditional methods.

By leveraging practices like low- or no-till farming systems, improved fertilizer management, and conservation crop rotation, farmers can improve crop and soil health while increasing efficiencies and profitability. This means that even amidst volatile growing conditions, farms are prepared to withstand shock and remain economically viable.

The U.S. House of Representatives, thanks to the leadership of the Iowa delegation, included a provision in its budget bill to extend the 45Z credit through 2031. This is critical to putting America first and securing new opportunities for Iowa farmers. Farmers across the country applaud the House for its support of this credit and urge the Senate to ensure this provision becomes law. Securing this extension would not only allow SAF producers to attract and sustain the financing needed to scale the next generation of aviation fuel. It would also ensure this nascent industry can thrive and support American energy security.

These practices are the future of farming—providing farmers with an economic and environmental edge. In 2023 alone, Iowan farmers earned more than$9.5 billion by selling corn as feedstock to biofuel producers.

American farmers are ready to deliver wins for America and strengthen our domestic energy security, but we need these markets for biofuels like SAF to grow and thrive. These fuels are ready to be used today in existing aircraft and airport fueling infrastructure, simplifying adoption. By helping to launch this nascent industry, policymakers can give American biofuel producers and aviation the competitive edge needed to win on a global stage.

As a third-generation farmer in Iowa, it's essential to find new demand, like SAF, for our corn. Thanks to technological advances and sound farming practices, we continue to raise more corn on fewer acres of land with fewer fertilizer inputs. My son, a fourth-generation farmer on this land, is now farming with me, and it is paramount that we find new markets to use the higher production that we are realizing. Without new markets like SAF, it will be difficult to sustain the next generation in our operation.

We are on the cusp of an energy revolution driven by Iowa farmers and biofuel producers. As Congress acts on required tax legislation this year, it is critical it implements and extends the 45Z credit in that package. Representatives Randy Feenstra, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Ashley Hinson, and Zach Nunn have done their due diligence on the 45Z extension. With continued support from Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Chuck Grassley, Iowa can remain an energy leader while creating new opportunities for our farmers and bolstering our local communities.

It has also joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s CO₂ Connect program, further reinforcing its environmental leadership.
Its unique geographical position, coupled with a long-term strategy rooted in neutrality, infrastructure investment, and sustainable development, has elevated the country into a key node in global air transit.
In an increasingly turbulent world, Azerbaijan’s air corridors are poised to become enduring lifelines for global connectivity.","The global aviation industry is undergoing a profound transformation as escalating geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts disrupt long-standing East-West air corridors. The full-scale war in Ukraine and rising hostilities in the Middle East have forced airlines to abandon traditional flight routes, resulting in longer journeys, higher operational costs, and increased carbon emissions.

In this environment of uncertainty, the search for stable, efficient, and politically neutral transit alternatives has become an urgent priority for global carriers. Against this backdrop, Azerbaijan has rapidly emerged as a critical aviation link between Asia and Europe. Positioned at the heart of the Eurasian landmass, the country offers not only geographic advantage but also modern infrastructure, diplomatic neutrality, and a clear vision for sustainable and multimodal connectivity. As traditional air corridors unravel, Azerbaijan is positioning itself not as a temporary substitute but as a long-term, strategic hub shaping the future of Eurasian aviation.

The full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 fundamentally altered global aviation patterns. Western airlines, banned from Russian airspace, were compelled to adopt significantly longer routes between Europe or North America and East Asia. This rerouting has had substantial environmental and economic consequences.

Research indicates that these detours led to planes using an average of 13% more fuel compared to their original routes, with flights specifically between Europe and Asia experiencing an even greater increase of 14.8% in fuel consumption. This operational adjustment contributed to a 1% increase in global aviation carbon dioxide emissions in 2023, adding an estimated 8.2 million tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere. Approximately 1,100 flights per day were affected by these airspace restrictions, underscoring a systemic disruption rather than isolated incidents.

Layered onto the disruptions caused by the Ukraine war, the escalating tensions and direct missile exchanges between Israel and Iran have led to immediate and widespread airspace closures across the Middle East, including over Iran, Iraq, Jordan, and Israel. This has resulted in major disruptions, forcing international airlines to cancel or reroute hundreds of flights. Over 500 flights were cancelled or delayed across major Middle Eastern airports due to these restrictions. Major carriers such as Air India, Qatar Airways, Emirates, Lufthansa, FlyDubai, Etihad, and El Al were significantly affected, with many flights rerouted or even returned to their origin points. This situation, combined with the Ukraine war, effectively closes or severely restricts a second critical East-West corridor, dramatically reducing available safe airspace and forcing airlines into increasingly constrained and circuitous routes.

The immediate diversion of numerous international flights to Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD) in Baku during the Middle East airspace restrictions demonstrates Azerbaijan’s role as a reliable haven. Baku Airport explicitly stated its capacity to “safely reroute regional and global air traffic under any emergency circumstances,” possessing “all the necessary infrastructure and operational resources.” This spontaneous rerouting signifies a high level of trust in Azerbaijan’s air traffic control, ground services, and its perceived geopolitical neutrality. It elevates Azerbaijan from a theoretical alternative to a proven, real-time crisis response hub, showcasing its immediate utility and strategic value in volatile times.

Azerbaijan’s emergence as a pivotal East-West air connector is not merely a reactive response to current crises but is rooted in its unique geographical advantages, rich historical legacy, and a carefully cultivated foreign policy. Strategically located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, bridging the Caspian Sea and the South Caucasus, Azerbaijan naturally positions itself as a critical transit point for goods and people moving between the two continents.

At the heart of this positioning is the “Middle Corridor,” also known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, which stretches across Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, and the South Caucasus into Europe. Azerbaijan forms its crucial central link. The nation’s strength as an air hub is not isolated but is part of a broader, integrated national strategy to become a comprehensive multimodal logistics center, offering seamless transfers between air, rail, road, and sea networks.

Since regaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has diligently pursued a foreign policy centered on connectivity and cooperation, consistently emphasizing regional stability. Its commitment to neutrality is a cornerstone of its appeal as a safe transit corridor. Amidst escalating Israeli-Iranian confrontation, Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov explicitly stated that “Azerbaijan will never allow its territory to be used for attacks against friendly states, including Iran.” This declaration of neutrality, coupled with its active participation in organizations like the UN, OSCE, and the Organization of Turkic States, reinforces its commitment to regional stability and cooperation. This proactive approach and sustained commitment to infrastructure development, rather than merely reacting to crises, instill greater confidence in its reliability as a hub.

Azerbaijan’s commitment to becoming a leading aviation hub is visibly supported by substantial investments in modern infrastructure and advanced operational capabilities. Heydar Aliyev International Airport (GYD) in Baku has undergone significant modernization and achieved remarkable growth, solidifying its position as the region’s leading aviation hub. In 2024, the airport served 7.5 million passengers, marking a substantial 31% increase compared to 2023. Transit travel, a key indicator of its hub status, saw exceptional growth, with the number of transit passengers rising by an impressive 130% to 373,383. The airport handled 59,238 flights and expanded its route network to 80 destinations, served by 40 airlines. This growth and operational excellence have garnered significant international recognition, with GYD named the “Best Airport in Central Asia and the CIS” by the prestigious Skytrax World Airport Awards.

Furthermore, the new Alat Cargo Airport, located within the Alat Free Economic Zone (AFEZ), is designed to become a critical multimodal logistics hub, further strengthening Azerbaijan’s position as a key transit point between Europe and Asia. Equipped with state-of-the-art air navigation systems by Indra, it will enhance operational efficiency and ensure flight safety for round-the-clock cargo operations. This airport is strategically located adjacent to the Port of Baku and directly linked to Azerbaijan’s railway and highway networks, facilitating seamless cargo movement across sea, land, and air.

Beyond Baku, Azerbaijan’s commitment to modernizing its air traffic control (ATC) systems and expanding its airport network extends to other regions. Fuzuli International Airport, for instance, built within an impressive eight months, was inaugurated in 2021, serving as Karabakh’s gateway to the world. It features a 3,000m runway, instrumental landing and navigation systems, and an ATC tower equipped with an automated PHOENIX tower system, all complying with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) regulations. Azeraeronavigation (AZANS) serves as the national air navigation service provider, ensuring safe and efficient air traffic services across the country’s airspace.

Azerbaijan’s emergence as a key air transit hub is intrinsically linked to its broader national economic strategy, with aviation serving as a critical catalyst for diversification and sustainable growth. The Azerbaijani government’s strategic focus on air transport reflects its broader goal to diversify the economy beyond its traditional reliance on oil and gas. A State Program is in place to enhance the efficiency of logistics processes, making air transport more accessible and reliable for businesses, aiming to attract crucial foreign investments.

Furthermore, expanding air transport capabilities is expected to bolster tourism significantly. Azerbaijan was indeed the fastest-growing tourism destination among the 30 largest European destinations, recording a 26% increase in air bookings between May 2023 and April 2024 and May 2024 and April 2025. This growing passenger demand complements transit traffic, strengthening the overall viability and profitability of aviation operations.

Azerbaijan has also made sustainability and the transition to a green economy central to its long-term national development strategy. In alignment with this vision, Azerbaijan Airlines (AZAL) has announced a major initiative to explore the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as part of its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and advancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. AZAL is actively engaging with financial institutions to attract green investment and is developing a comprehensive ESG strategy. It has also joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA)’s CO₂ Connect program, further reinforcing its environmental leadership.

Moreover, AZAL has unveiled ambitious plans to modernize its fleet and enhance operational efficiency, with new Airbus and Boeing aircraft expected by 2032. The airline plans to streamline its fleet by 2030 to include only two models: the narrow-body Airbus A320 Neo family and the wide-body Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This strategic investment in a modern, fuel-efficient fleet will further enhance Azerbaijan’s appeal as a transit hub, offering airlines and passengers access to contemporary and reliable air transport services.

As global aviation navigates a new era of uncertainty and fragmentation, Azerbaijan has emerged not as a peripheral alternative but as a central pillar in reconfiguring East-West air connectivity. Its unique geographical position, coupled with a long-term strategy rooted in neutrality, infrastructure investment, and sustainable development, has elevated the country into a key node in global air transit. The convergence of geopolitical crises—from the war in Ukraine to instability in the Middle East—has underscored the urgency of identifying stable, efficient, and geopolitically neutral corridors.

Azerbaijan’s swift, coordinated response to these challenges, demonstrated through both policy and performance, reveals its growing capacity to anchor regional and intercontinental aviation flows. With state-of-the-art infrastructure, a rapidly expanding airport network, strategic policy vision, and a commitment to green transformation, Azerbaijan is not merely adapting to shifting global dynamics; it is actively shaping them. In an increasingly turbulent world, Azerbaijan’s air corridors are poised to become enduring lifelines for global connectivity.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/c-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 14:05:21.669349

It has partnered with Airbus to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for all domestic flights of Airbus employees in Germany. This collaboration, which started on June 1, is key to Lufthansa’s climate neutrality goals.

The press release highlights that this partnership uses Lufthansa’s “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare.” This fare helps companies like Airbus offset CO₂ emissions by using SAF in the airline’s fuel operations.

Dieter Vranckx, Chief Commercial Officer of Lufthansa Group, said,

“Together with our customers and strong partners from the industry, we strive towards greater sustainability. I am particularly pleased and thankful that our long-standing partner Airbus has opted for a corporate fare with SAF, demonstrating its leading role also in the field of sustainability. For many companies and its employees, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important factor in travel decisions. As a leading airline group, we are the partner of choice for companies in achieving their goals with tailor-made solutions.”

How It Works: A Smarter Way to Fly Greener

SAF isn’t used directly in individual flights. Instead, it blends with fossil kerosene before reaching airports. As a “drop-in” fuel, SAF fits easily into existing aircraft and fuel systems. Once purchased, Lufthansa ensures that the equivalent SAF related to the customer’s carbon footprint is used within six months.

This method cuts the emissions impact of flying, even if SAF isn’t used on one flight. Over its lifecycle, SAF made from biogenic waste reduces CO₂ emissions by about 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

Airbus Walks the Talk: Making Employee Travel Sustainable

By adopting the Sustainable Corporate Value Fare, Airbus is making employee travel within Germany more climate-friendly. This reflects a growing trend where more companies choose climate responsibility in travel.

Raphael Duflos, Vice President Corporate Services Procurement at Airbus, also noted,

“We have been working in close cooperation with Lufthansa Group since early 2024 to customize their ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ to meet the specific needs of Airbus travelers. They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuels, starting in the German domestic market. We are confident that such ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ is going to be successful across the Business Travel ecosystem.”

For Lufthansa, this shows that its climate-focused travel products attract business customers.

Supports SAF to Cut Emissions and Drive Industry Growth

Airbus is using SAF as a key solution to reduce its aviation emissions. It is promoting SAF not just through internal use, but also by forming partnerships and making targeted investments.

Airbus Sustainability

The aviation giant has been using SAF for nearly a decade and aims to cover at least 30% of its internal fuel use with SAF by 2030. This includes fuel for internal transport and employee business travel. Notably, all current Airbus aircraft can fly on up to 50% SAF.

By 2030, the goal is for all aircraft and helicopters to be ready for 100% SAF. New single-aisle models are already being designed with this goal in mind.

Since 2024, Airbus has purchased SAF options from Air France-KLM for employee flights between Paris and cities like Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich, and Toulouse.

Pilot Projects with Airlines

To help scale SAF use, the company launched two pilot projects last year. One with easyJet funded 106 tonnes of SAF for flights between Toulouse and Bristol using a 30% SAF blend. The trial showed how airlines and corporate partners can share SAF costs and build demand.

Another trial with Wizz Air included over 50 flights using blended SAF, with Airbus providing technical support.

Long-Term Partnerships

Airbus has also partnered with TotalEnergies, which has supplied SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. By 2024, TotalEnergies met over half of Airbus’s SAF needs in Europe. They are also working together on research to enable 100% SAF use.

In recent years, Airbus signed agreements with Neste and OMV to expand access to SAF, encourage new demand, and support new production sites. It also invested in LanzaJet, a leading SAF producer, to help speed up the transition across the industry.

Lufthansa’s Climate Targets: Big Ambitions, Concrete Steps

The airline has clear climate goals. It plans to cut net CO₂ emissions from flights by half by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. It also aims for net-zero by 2050 and carbon neutrality in its home market by 2030.

SAF Use Grows Across Lufthansa’s Network

In 2024, Lufthansa cut 71,952 tonnes of fossil CO₂ by using SAF.

The sustainability report shows that the fuel was sourced through co-processing, where biogenic feedstock is refined alongside fossil crude oil. This method helps scale SAF efficiently while maintaining high quality.

Corporate clients can access SAF in two main ways:

Sustainable Corporate Value Fare: Business travelers can offset up to 30% of their CO₂ emissions through SAF.

SAF Bulk Deals: Companies can invest in larger SAF volumes to maximize their climate impact.

Expanding Green Fares for Leisure and Business Travelers

Lufthansa’s Green Fares product expanded in December 2024 to include intercontinental routes. On these flights, 10% of emissions are offset using SAF, while 90% through certified climate projects. For continental routes, the mix is even more ambitious: 20% SAF and 80% offsets.

The response has been modest but is growing. In 2024, about 4% of customers chose Green Fares on continental routes and 1.5% on long-haul flights.

These fares led to a total reduction or offset of 143,000 tonnes of fossil CO₂, with 28,000 tonnes saved directly through SAF.

A Multi-Faced Approach to Sustainability

Lufthansa’s climate strategy goes beyond SAF. It combines technology upgrades, operational efficiency, and better ground logistics:

1. Fleet Modernization: The Group has updated its fleet with new aircraft like the Airbus A320neo, A321neo, A350-900, and Boeing 787-9. These planes have new engines and materials that lower emissions and noise.

In 2024, Lufthansa added 18 new aircraft and retired four older models.

By 2025, 30 more new aircraft are expected.

The modernization plan covers around 240 aircraft. 99.6% of the fleet meets ICAO’s Chapter 4 noise standards.

2. Flight Operation Efficiency: Through smarter routing and digital tools, Lufthansa cut 37,000 tonnes of CO₂ in 2024. Innovations like AeroSHARK surface technology saved 12,000 tonnes of kerosene—enough for 142 roundtrips between Munich and New York with an Airbus A350-900.

3. Alternative Transport to Hubs: Lufthansa has reduced short-haul flights by offering over 750 daily connections via rail or bus. In 2024, over 1.1 million passengers chose these low-emission options, cutting unnecessary air traffic.

4. Offsetting Where Necessary: Besides SAF and fuel savings, Lufthansa and its customers actively offset emissions. In 2024, they offset 606,000 tonnes of CO₂ using high-quality climate projects—531,000 tonnes by customers and 75,000 tonnes from Lufthansa’s travel.

Sustainable Travel Becomes Mainstream

The Airbus-Lufthansa agreement signals a shift in aviation’s approach to travel. With scalable SAF programs, new aircraft, and changing passenger expectations, Lufthansa is positioning itself as a sustainability leader.

Real change needs collective effort. For aviation to meet climate goals, it requires increased SAF production and broader adoption by travelers.

Attachment Carbon-Neutral Fuels Market","Dublin, June 20, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Carbon-Neutral Fuels - Global Strategic Business Report"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The global market for Carbon-Neutral Fuels was estimated at US$88.4 Billion in 2024 and is projected to reach US$126.5 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2024 to 2030.

This comprehensive report provides an in-depth analysis of market trends, drivers, and forecasts, helping you make informed business decisions. The report includes the most recent global tariff developments and how they impact the Carbon-Neutral Fuels market.

Why Are Carbon-Neutral Fuels Emerging as a Critical Solution in the Global Energy Transition?

As the global community intensifies efforts to combat climate change, carbon-neutral fuels are gaining prominence as a vital pathway toward decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. These fuels produced using renewable energy sources and designed to release no net carbon emissions during their lifecycle are increasingly seen as a bridge between existing fossil fuel infrastructure and a fully electrified future. Unlike conventional fossil fuels, carbon-neutral fuels such as green hydrogen, synthetic e-fuels, and biofuels derived from waste biomass can provide a drop-in alternative with minimal modifications to engines, distribution systems, or fueling stations. This compatibility is crucial for sectors like aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking, where direct electrification remains technically or economically challenging.

Governments and climate pacts like the Paris Agreement are applying pressure through carbon pricing, emissions targets, and clean fuel mandates, incentivizing rapid adoption and innovation in carbon-neutral technologies. With rising global energy demand and growing skepticism over the pace of electrification, carbon-neutral fuels offer a pragmatic, scalable alternative that aligns environmental goals with industrial reality. Furthermore, these fuels can be synthesized using carbon captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes, enabling a closed-loop carbon cycle that supports global net-zero ambitions. As the urgency to act on emissions intensifies, carbon-neutral fuels are moving from concept to commercial deployment, becoming a linchpin in the strategy to decouple energy consumption from carbon output.

What Policy Measures and Market Trends Are Accelerating Adoption?

The policy landscape is evolving rapidly to support the growth of carbon-neutral fuels, with governments, international agencies, and private-sector coalitions all playing pivotal roles. In Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive II and Fit for 55 package mandate a rising share of renewable and low-carbon fuels in transportation, including aviation and maritime sectors. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law offer tax credits and funding for clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects, while Canada, Japan, and South Korea have unveiled national hydrogen strategies with strong incentives for carbon-neutral fuel development. Carbon pricing mechanisms such as the EU Emissions Trading System are making fossil fuels more expensive to use, indirectly boosting demand for cleaner alternatives.

Meanwhile, corporate commitments to net-zero targets are prompting major logistics, airline, and energy firms to invest in long-term supply agreements for carbon-neutral fuels. International aviation bodies like ICAO are setting SAF adoption targets, while maritime regulators push for low-carbon fuel usage across shipping lanes. Financial markets are also playing a role, with green bonds and climate-aligned investment funds directing capital toward fuel innovation projects.

On the consumer side, increased awareness of carbon footprints is driving demand for sustainable travel and low-emission delivery options, indirectly influencing fuel sourcing. These policy and market shifts are creating a favorable ecosystem for carbon-neutral fuels to scale moving the conversation from niche pilot projects to global industrial deployment, and establishing the regulatory certainty needed for long-term infrastructure investments.

What's Powering the Growth of the Global Carbon-Neutral Fuels Market?

The growth in the carbon-neutral fuels market is driven by several intertwined factors spanning environmental targets, industrial demand, technological viability, and strategic policy support. At the core is the global push toward net-zero emissions, with more than 140 countries and thousands of corporations committing to carbon neutrality by mid-century. This sweeping commitment is translating into direct demand for low-emission alternatives in sectors that cannot easily electrify aviation, marine shipping, heavy manufacturing, and long-haul freight. On the technology side, the rapid maturation of green hydrogen electrolysis, CO2-to-fuel conversion, and biomass gasification is enabling large-scale, commercially viable production pathways.

From an end-use perspective, industries are eager to decarbonize without overhauling existing infrastructure, making drop-in carbon-neutral fuels an attractive proposition. Consumer and corporate behavior is evolving, with rising scrutiny of Scope 3 emissions, greater interest in sustainable sourcing, and ESG frameworks pushing companies to adopt low-carbon fuel solutions. Policy support is equally vital, with tax incentives, fuel blending mandates, infrastructure funding, and clean energy subsidies helping bridge the economic gap between conventional and carbon-neutral fuels.

Additionally, geopolitical concerns over energy security and fuel independence are prompting many nations to invest in local, renewables-based fuel production, reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. International cooperation through climate accords and technology-sharing partnerships is further accelerating knowledge transfer and deployment. Together, these drivers are not only propelling the carbon-neutral fuels market forward but are also positioning it as a foundational pillar of the emerging global green energy economy.

Speaking at the biennial Paris Air Show this week Nathalie Tarnaud Laud, chief executive of ATR, said aircraft orders have continued to show a positive trend this year.
Having secured orders for 30 new aircraft so far in 2025, ATR has now sold over 1,900 aircraft since the start of the 72-600 programme.
“We are very optimistic about the commercial performance going forward but still pragmatic when it comes to restoring the supply chain and delivering those aircraft,” Tarnaud Laud said.

Speaking at the biennial Paris Air Show this week Nathalie Tarnaud Laud, chief executive of ATR, said aircraft orders have continued to show a positive trend this year.

Having secured orders for 30 new aircraft so far in 2025, ATR has now sold over 1,900 aircraft since the start of the 72-600 programme. A recent order for 19 from Uni AIR was the largest since 2017.

Tarnaud Laud said this shows the trust customers are placing in ATR which she said it working on improving the product in terms of sustainability and maintenance.

She said ATR has a “really strong pipeline” and the second half of 2025 will ensure it out-performs last year “which was a really good year in terms of orders”.

“We are very optimistic about the commercial performance going forward but still pragmatic when it comes to restoring the supply chain and delivering those aircraft,” Tarnaud Laud said.

“We said at the beginning of the year that 2025 will be a year of stabilisation and I can confirm we are still on track to stabilise the deliveries from last year.

“This year is also a year of preparing for the future. We want to ramp up, that’s very clear. And that’s why we have continued a lot of effort in improving our processes, in the way we work with our suppliers to start that ramp up in 2026.”

Tarnaud Laud added: “When it comes to product improvement for that this year we have decided to launch specifications which will continue to move forward the performance of the aircraft.

“The ATR is one of the most cost-effective aircraft operating on the close to 500 nautical miles. That’s why we decided to invest in a couple of improvements reducing costs and improving the availability of the aircraft.

“We have a few initiatives like reducing the corrosion on the aircraft increasing the checks from two to three years. This is a very important pillar for us and we want to achieve this in a time frame of two to three years.”

Tarnaud Laud said ATR also want to continue the sustainability journey, describing it as being “in the DNA of the company”. “We want to continue to lead the sustainability journey when it comes to regional aircraft.”

ATR is working with engine supplier Pratt & Whitney in two areas. The first is to improve the PW127XT’s fuel efficiency and maintenance costs.

The OEM is also working on alternative fuels including working with Pratt & Whitney on its Able concept for developing hydrogen propulsion.

ATR is also continuing to work on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) having been the first manufacturer to operate a 100% SAF flight in June 2022.

This week ATR signed a deal with French SAF aggregator ATOBA to address the key issue with SAF which is the cost and availability.

Tarnaud Laud said: “When it comes to reginal aviation on one side we are smaller players as customers …and access to SAF is not that easy so they need to join forces with others.

“On the other side you have the producers and, of course they are looking for scale, and they are looking for commitments. We want to work together with ATOBA to bring customers and producers together.”

ATR has achieved the EASA CS-CO2 certification which is based on stringent ICAO efficiency standards.

The 72-600 outperformed regulatory requirements delivering 20% margin beyond required criteria.

As the Senate continues to roll out its versions of the reconciliation bill, there are some differences between the House and Senate proposals when it come to agriculture.

The main variations come down to changes in the tax provisions, but it’s key to note proposed changes to the farm safety net are similar in both the House and the Senate.

What’s Next?

The House and Senate will now need to work out their differences in the two versions of the Big Beautiful Bill. President Trump said he wants to sign the legislation on July 4, but many reports cast doubt Congress can meet that approaching deadline. Politico even reported this week the Senate GOP’s version of the bill is “facing major headwinds in the House.”

Read More: Big, Beautiful Bill: What’s in it for Agriculture?

Farm CPA Paul Neiffer believes the July 4 deadline isn’t likely as the debate heats up, but he still remains optimistic the bill is close to the finish line.

“I think July is the date, but not July 4,” Neiffer says. “They’ll get it done before the August recess. I think they’re actually pretty close. The media out there talks about how they’re really far apart on Medicaid and state and local taxes. But I think when push comes to shove, the president has a lot of clout, and they’ll come up a compromise. So, I’m pretty optimistic they’ll get it done.”

Weighing the Differences Between the Senate and the House

Neiffer says he would grade the Senate’s overall budget reconciliation proposal as a “B” for ag, which is slightly below how he rated the House’s proposal. One reason is what the Senate is proposing for Section 199A:

The Senate has a Section 199A deduction of 20%, while the House’s version is 23%.

Both the House and Senate are calling for 100% bonus depreciation, but the Senate’s would be permanent. The House’s version would expire at the end of 2029.

“With the Senate making that permanent, that’s a really good deal for ag,” Neiffer says. “They would now have some certainty all of the assets that a farmer purchases — combines, tractors, buildings and everything but land — they can deduct 100%.”

Neiffer says another difference is on state and local tax deductions.

The Senate is keeping the current $10,000 deduction and reducing the benefit of the pass-through entity tax deduction.

The deduction is at the $40,000 level in the House and retains the pass-through entity deduction in full for farmers.

Beefed Up Farm Safety Net

Under the Senate’s version, Neiffer says farmers would be paid the higher calculated payment rate under Price Loss Coverage (PLC) or Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) during the 2025 crop year.

The Senate Ag Committee’s proposal also increases the reference price formula, and instead of having a floor based on 85% of the Olympic moving average marketing year price, the Senate is proposing an increase up to 88%.

“That actually results in a boost on the corn PLC price by about $0.15. And I think on soybeans, it’s about $0.35,” Neiffer says. “So, that’s very beneficial. Now, I was hoping they were going to boost the ceiling. Right now, the ceiling is 115% of the EFR. And they had talked last year about boosting it up to 120%. I think that was too much for the budget, so they kept it at 115%.”

The Differences on 45Z

When it comes to the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit, there’s one major difference. The Senate allows foreign feedstocks to be eligible for the credit, just with a 20% “haircut.”

In the House’s version, only feedstocks produced or grown in the United States or Canada qualify for the tax credit. That change would help detour some of the used cooking oil imports from China.

“To me, a 20% haircut means there’s got to be some senators out there maybe pandering to somebody that I don’t know about. Because really, they should eliminate the whole foreign feedstock and just give you a credit based on domestic production,” Neiffer says.

The Bigger Issue with 45Z

Peter Meyer of Muddy Boots Ag says no matter what version of the 45Z tax credit makes the final cut, there’s a bigger issue at hand. The Trump administration needs to provide guidance and rules around 45Z — something the Biden administration failed to do during its time in office.

“We’re just clamoring for clarification, right? All I want is clarification. They can say all they want about extending this to 2030. That’s great. That’s a positive. But tell me what the rules are. We still don’t know the rules,” Meyer says.

Meyer knows there’s been so much talk about 45Z and sustainable aviation fuel, but little action in terms of demand. Meyer says the lack of action in terms of demand is largely because there’s no clarity around the tax credit.

“We need more demand for the ethanol they’re producing,” Meyer says. “Soybean oil can be converted to sustainable aviation fuel. But you just cannot produce sustainable aviation fuel without a credit. You can’t.”",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/fa50f97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x720+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-farm-journal.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2F73%2Fbc32110546e598783ace1a9bcece%2F4a3b34e2eff74d24bc4f64372b05c4d1%2Fposter.jpg,N,,2025-06-20 11:05:43.916077

People taking its Midnight aircraft could conceivably fly over gridlock rather than being stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic. There are many possible uses for the piloted electric air taxi, which is quieter than a helicopter and has zero operating emissions.

Given all the potential for the stock, can this be a possible 40-bagger investment -- one that turns a $25,000 into $1 million in the future?

The business is still in its very early stages

One thing investors need to be aware of is that while there are significant opportunities for Archer, it still has to obtain approval for its Midnight aircraft, and for it to produce it at scale. It has obtained multiple approvals from the Federal Aviation Administration thus far, and the hope is that it may not be too long until the aircraft is cleared for use in the U.S.

But even if that happens, the company still needs to ramp up production. The Midnight aircraft can accommodate four passengers, so the company will need to develop a considerable fleet before it can truly become a big player in the air taxi industry. Its goal is to be producing 650 aircraft per year by the end of the decade. This year, it's aiming to get to just two per month.

Since it's so early in its development, Archer isn't generating any revenue thus far, and its losses have totaled $514 million over the past four quarters. The good news is the business is already seeing strong demand, with a backlog of around $6 billion thus far, including United Airlines, which has ordered 200 of Archer's eVTOL aircraft already, plus an option for 100 more.

Is a valuation of $220 billion a possibility for Archer?

If Archer proves to be a 40x investment, its valuation would need to reach more than $220 billion in the future, given its current market cap of around $5.6 billion. If air taxis truly revolutionize travel and demand for Archer's aircraft takes off, that can be a possibility in the very long run.

But that's a scenario that's also riddled with multiple ifs. The necessary infrastructure needs to be built, and air spaces would become more crowded, which could result in greater legislation and red tape along the way. And with the company still in the early stages of producing its aircraft, it's also difficult to know what kind of margins it will make on them and how profitable the business may or may not be.

A lot of things would need to go right for the business for it to be worth well over $200 billion. Forecasting the future for an industry that's still in its infancy is not easy. And while there's certainly potential for Archer's valuation to grow significantly, investors shouldn't assume that the stock is destined for greatness and that it can generate 40x returns, even over the very long term.

Should you invest in Archer stock today?

Even though investing in Archer may not be a surefire path to becoming a millionaire, it may still be a growth stock worth adding to your portfolio. If you're comfortable with the risk and uncertainty that comes with this business, it could make for a good buy-and-hold investment.

However, given the risk involved, I wouldn't suggest investing more than 5% of your portfolio into the stock. By allocating just a modest amount of money into Archer, you can limit your losses while still giving yourself the possibility to benefit from its growth in the long run.
