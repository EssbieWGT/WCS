“TotalEnergies is taking action to meet the strong demand from the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuels are essential to bring the air industry’s CO2 emissions down immediately,” said Patrick Pouyanne, chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.

The work to expand production is already in progress with a €500m investment to transform the Grandpuits biorefinery site into zero-crude platform including a biorefinery with a production capacity of 230,000 tonnes per annum in 2026.

Meanwhile, the company also expects to produce15,000 tonnes of SAF at the La Mede refinery in southern France. At the Normandy refiner, the company has already begun coprocessing SAF with nameplate capacity of 50,000 tonnes per annum.

Beyond France, the company earlier this year launched SAF coprocessing at the Antwerp refinery in Belgium. The company plans to increase annual production capacity to 80,000 tons a year.

Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail.

Europe a leader on e-kerosene announcements, laggard on implementation

A new T&E study shows that Europe can be a leader in e-kerosene (also called e-SAF), housing more than half of the world’s announced production capacity. Around 40 large-scale projects [1] are planned in Europe, with a potential e-kerosene production capacity of close to 3 million tonnes (Mt) per year — roughly 5% of the fuel that Europe’s aviation sector needs to operate.

Europe’s early lead in the e-kerosene market has been driven by the EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels, ReFuelEU, which set specific targets for using e-fuels in aviation. If all the announced projects were built, the EU could meet these targets — but none of the large-scale plants identified in this report are even under construction. Only four are at an advanced stage [2], and none have reached a final investment decision (FID). This slow progress is due to an array of challenges, with financing posing the biggest barrier, and traditional fuel suppliers being notably absent from the conversation.

Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said: “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe — but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential. Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

With a potential to cut CO₂ emissions by more than 90% compared to fossil kerosene, e-kerosene is key to decarbonising aviation, an emission-intensive industry that is projected to keep on growing [3]. As representatives of the industry gather at the International Paris Air Show today, an event showcasing the growth, prowess and latest innovations in aviation, the study’s findings highlight that despite progress, the path to significantly reducing aviation emissions through truly sustainable solutions remains long and complex.

While Europe is currently the leader for e-kerosene [4], other markets are creeping up. China is the second-largest hub – around 10 large-scale projects have been announced here, representing around 20% of global capacity. The United States is also picking up the pace, with the largest e-kerosene offtake agreement to date secured by a US-based startup, and one of the world’s first FIDs for a large-scale e-kerosene plant secured in May by Infinium, another US-based startup [5].

Funding bottlenecks and oil majors are hampering progress

Despite favourable conditions, e-kerosene projects continue to face significant hurdles in Europe, including challenges related to energy costs, infrastructure, and CO₂ sourcing. Regulatory uncertainty is also in the mix, brought about by industry pressure [6] to delay ReFuelEU’s SAF targets in anticipation of the scheduled review of the legislation in 2027

Financing poses the biggest barrier, with each plant requiring €1–2 billion in capital, bringing total capital requirements to €10 – 20 billion by 2030. EU funding mechanisms for e-kerosene are not strong enough to support the level of investment needed to get these projects off the ground, and traditional fuel suppliers are notably absent from the conversation. To date, major oil companies have made negligible contributions to e-kerosene, while continuing to spend billions on fossil fuels.

“Despite their huge financial capacity, major oil companies are largely absent from the e-kerosene market,” Camile Mutrelle acknowledged. “Startups have taken the lead, but lack the internal resources to finance the capital-intensive infrastructure that is urgently needed. Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs. The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a chance to set the right flight path by prioritising e-SAF, providing a comprehensive mechanism to address the challenges EU projects face.”

T&E urges EU leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the existing ReFuelEU targets, especially in the run-up to the legislation’s scheduled review, and prioritise e-kerosene in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). It also calls for a European market intermediary using a double-sided auction mechanism to be established to address the current issues around financing.

Otto says the Phantom 3500 will burn 60% less fuel than similar-sized jets, reducing emissions by 90% when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

The aviation industry’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“The Phantom 3500 is the result of relentless innovation and bold thinking,” Touw said at a press briefing at the International Paris Air Show in France. “By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations—Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation. It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

Otto also offered details about suppliers for the plane, which will be assembled in at Craig Airport in West Jacksonville. The company also will move its headquarters there from Texas.

The jet’s twin FJ44 engines will be made by Pontiac, Michigan-based Williams International.

In May, Williams announced a $1 billion plan to build jet engines in Crestview in Okaloosa County about 320 miles west of Craig Airport. A manufacturing facility will be built in three phases in the Shoal River Industrial Park.

In 2022, the state of Florida awarded $3.2 million through the Florida Job Growth Grant Fund to expand manufacturing in Okaloosa County.

“Williams International’s investment in the Florida Panhandle will create more than 330 jobs, and is a success story of the Florida Job Growth Grant Fund in Northwest Florida,” Gov. Ron Desantis said in a May news release announcing the deal.

Williams’ first 250,000-square-foot facility is planned for completion in late 2026. The second phase is planned for completion in 2028 and the final phase by 2035/36.

Williams also has plants in Pontiac and Ogden, Utah.

Another Otto supplier is Italian aerospace company Leonardo, which will make the jet’s carbon fiber fuselage at its plant in Grottaglie in southern Italy.

Flying Magazine reported that Otto is also working with Mecaer Aviation, an international provider of aircraft solutions headquartered in Borgomanero, Italy.

The Phantom 3500 will carry nine passengers and use digital displays instead of windows to reduce drag, using laminar flow to boost efficiency.

Otto said it can sell 1,600 aircraft over the 2030-2040 period with around one-third of that total “already spoken for.”

Otto will begin operations at Craig Aiport in Hangar 825, which was vacated by The Boeing Corp.

Otto plans to begin flight tests by early 2027 and aims to achieve certification and enter service in 2030.

Flying Magazine said Otto plans to conduct about three years of flight testing using four production-conforming aircraft and plans to complete a preliminary design review by October.

Aviation International News reported that Otto has raised more than $170 million to date and is expected to close on another round of funding by year-end.

“Right now, the aircraft is at a stage where our design is mostly locked down,” he said, noting that the parts for flight-test vehicle one will arrive in Hangar 825 next year in preparation for assembly.

Flying Magazine said Touw estimated the program will cost $1 billion, with half going toward aircraft development and the rest supporting construction of a final assembly line.",https://media.yourobserver.com/img/photos/2025/06/17/otto_aviation_t1100_r1080x720.jpg?a5a8e335434cfe3a93dc299de6ea435221e0bf0d,N,,2025-06-17 15:10:15.205222

At 1pm on Saturday (14 June), as part of King Charles’ birthday celebrations, over 30 Royal Air Force (RAF) planes flew over Buckingham Palace in a ceremonial flypast.

As every year, the grand finale featured a dramatic aerial display by the pilots of the RAF aerobatic team flying the Red Arrows.

But unlike previous years, the nine Red Arrows’ BAE Systems Hawk fast-jets were powered by a high-ratio blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biofuel used to produce the trademark red, white and blue vapour trails.

According to the RAF, using these renewable fuels is a “world-first” and the result of many trials by its engineers and logisticians.

Squadron leader Andy King, the Red Arrows’ senior engineering officer, who led the pioneering fuels project, said: “The vibrant vapour trails that we generate is what sets the Red Arrows apart and so to be the first aerobatic team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.”

Made from sustainable sources, including materials such as household waste or used cooking oil, SAF is considered a major tool in helping to lower climate change emissions from air travel – widely regarded as one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise.

SAF can be used in existing aircraft, and it emits on average 70% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than using fossil jet fuel on a life-cycle basis.

HVO is a type of renewable diesel made of 100% renewable raw materials, with a chemical structure almost identical to the regular diesel traditionally used by the aerobatic team for its vapour trails.

Compared with standard diesel, HVO emits up to 90% fewer emissions across its life span.

To switch the nine Hawks to greener fuels took the RAF less than six months and was done entirely using existing resources and staff.

A successful trial flight took place earlier in the year.

King said: “The beauty of these alternative fuels is how easily they can be used and with little additional work.”

Before Saturday’s flypast, the aircraft were topped up at the team’s home base of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, as they headed to London.

The RAF has said it will continue to work with alternative fuels to power its aircraft. The aim is not not only reduce carbon emissions but also to help lessen reliance on global fossil fuel supply chains.

Air Vice-Marshal Shaun Harris, the RAF’s director support, said: “Importantly, this technology has the potential to increase our resilience and protect our operational outputs in a more volatile world, with no loss of performance.

“As the Red Arrows have shown, the RAF is adapting to ensure we can continue to fly and fight globally, using any fuel source, as these alternative supplies become more common.”

A recent study found that emissions from European airlines have soared to pre-Covid-19 levels .

On 1 January 2025, the UK’s SAF mandate came into force, which requires the flight sector to supplant 2% of its jet fuel demand with SAF in flights taking off from the UK from 2025. This will grow year-on-year to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

To support green aviation fuel producers, in May 2025 the Department for Transport announced a revenue certainty scheme and an additional £400,000 in funding.

While the government wants the UK to be a global hub for SAF production, there is concern about where the feedstocks for this production will come from. In 2023, a study by the Royal Society found that the transition to SAF would require the use of 50% of the UK's agricultural land.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-06/web-Red-Arrrows-%C2%A9-Crown-Copyright-CRN-OFFICIAL-20250614-0704-051.jpg?itok=pIMVKFs_,N,,2025-06-17 16:10:53.079502

by Allison Lampert and Oliver Griffin (Reuters) Global aviation sector strives for net zero emissions by 2050; Sustainable aviation fuel made from ethanol seen as one option; Brazil ethanol producers fear US interference in UN's SAF rules -- The U.S. is expected to object this month to a recommendation at the UN aviation agency council that Washington says unfairly favors Brazilian corn farmers at the expense of U.S. producers in development of green jet fuel, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

One of the sources said the discussions could be resolved by a compromise. Still, Brazil's corn ethanol producers have warned that the disagreement could undermine global confidence in certification of sustainable aviation fuels.

Global carriers, aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, are being pressed to swap kerosene for cleaner but costly alternatives made from materials such as municipal waste or cooking oil.

The International Air Transport Association estimates the long-term cost of the aviation sector's green transition at $4.7 trillion.

Global SAF now accounts for less than 1% of industry’s total jet fuel usage. But products that can make fuel with lower emissions should find growing markets due to European quotas at airports, tax incentives and global targets.

With U.S. corn production outpacing domestic demand, farmers and ethanol producers in the Midwest have said they are trying to lower the emissions involved in producing and marketing corn ethanol for new markets like green jet fuel. For instance, some U.S. ethanol producers have suggested using carbon capture technology.

The Iowa Corn Growers Association, which supports carbon capture and sequestration projects to lower emissions, has said Brazil already has a lower carbon score for corn ethanol than the U.S., which would give the South American country an advantage in meeting demand from airlines.

The U.S. State Department raised objections in March, opens new tab to a recommendation from an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) technical panel, which has proposed criteria for SAF. The U.S. argued that the recommendation unfairly helps Brazil over the rest of the world as it would award a lower carbon score to multicropping, or farming when two or more crops like corn and soy are grown on the same land, a common practice in the South American nation.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 16:11:10.979431

MONTREAL/SAO PAULO (Rtrs) -The U.S. is expected to object this month to a recommendation at the UN aviation agency council that Washington says unfairly favors Brazilian corn farmers at the expense of U.S. producers in development of green jet fuel, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

One of the sources said the discussions could be resolved by a compromise. Still, Brazil’s corn ethanol producers have warned that the disagreement could undermine global confidence in certification of sustainable aviation fuels.

Global carriers, aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, are being pressed to swap kerosene for cleaner but costly alternatives made from materials such as municipal waste or cooking oil.

The International Air Transport Association estimates the long-term cost of the aviation sector’s green transition at $4.7 trillion.

Global SAF now accounts for less than 1% of industry’s total jet fuel usage. But products that can make fuel with lower emissions should find growing markets due to European quotas at airports, tax incentives and global targets.

With U.S. corn production outpacing domestic demand, farmers and ethanol producers in the Midwest have said they are trying to lower the emissions involved in producing and marketing corn ethanol for new markets like green jet fuel. For instance, some U.S. ethanol producers have suggested using carbon capture technology.

The Iowa Growers Association, which supports carbon capture and sequestration projects to lower emissions, has said Brazil already has a lower carbon score for corn ethanol than the U.S., which would give the South American country an advantage in meeting demand from airlines.

The U.S. State Department raised objections in March to a recommendation from an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) technical panel, which has proposed criteria for SAF. The U.S. argued that the recommendation unfairly helps Brazil over the rest of the world as it would award a lower carbon score to multicropping, or farming when two or more crops like corn and soy are grown on the same land, a common practice in the South American nation.

The recommendation is coming to ICAO’s 36-member council for review ahead of the global agency’s triennial assembly this fall. ICAO cannot impose rules on member states, but countries that approve the agency’s standards and guidance usually abide by them.

The U.S. State Department declined comment. Brazil’s agricultural ministry acknowledged it received questions from Reuters but did not respond further. Montreal-based ICAO was not immediately available for comment.

In Brazil, where annual corn ethanol output is forecast to almost double to around 16 billion litres by 2032, the producers’ association UNEM told Reuters that recommendations from ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) should be free from politics.

""Any attempt at political interference would undermine not only the decision-making process, but also the international community’s confidence in the sustainable aviation fuels certification system,"" said Bruno Alves, director of institutional relations and sustainability at UNEM.

""UNEM believes it is essential that this technical and transparent process be respected and preserved.

“By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations—Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation,” Touw told reporters.
“The technology to understand laminar-to-turbulent flow transition didn’t exist…until the last five years,” Touw told FLYING.
But with reduced fuel burn, it aims to do so for about 43 percent less than the hourly cost of burning Jet A on a super-mid.
Its cruising altitude of 51,000 feet will help avoid turbulence caused by inclement weather, further cutting drag and fuel burn.","PARIS—In 2022, member states of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted the goal of net-zero aviation emissions by 2050: a target also backed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and aviation stakeholders worldwide.

At the Paris Air Show on Tuesday, though, a U.S. startup committed to achieve carbon neutrality two decades earlier—without the help of electric or hybrid-electric engines.

Otto Aviation believes its “ultra-low-drag” Phantom 3500, which it says will reduce emissions by 90 percent versus traditional jets through the use of sustainable aviation fuel, could shift the sustainability paradigm. The 3500’s breakthrough is a laminar flow architecture, which Otto says has been tested and proven to cut drag by 35 percent—and fuel burn by nearly 60 percent—compared to similarly sized conventional aircraft. It will be propelled by a pair of gas- or SAF-powered Williams International FJ44 engines.

“The basic energy storage system for an electric aircraft is about 24 to 27 times heavier for the same energy stored as Jet-A fuel,” Otto CEO Paul Touw told FLYING in Paris. “Everyone designing airplanes knows weight matters a lot. Therefore, electric energy storage systems are vastly too heavy to effectively fly anything beyond approximately 200 nm. Turbofan aircraft can fly 8,000 to 9,000 nm—something electric aircraft will likely never achieve.”

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Monday revealed Otto will relocate from Fort Worth, Texas, to Jacksonville, Florida, where it will set up a manufacturing plant at Cecil Airport (KVQQ) to produce the super-midsize business jet. The company will invest about $430 million into the move, which is also backed by a $35 million incentive package and $20 million grant. Maiden flight is planned for 2027, with certification and entry into service expected around 2030.

“By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations—Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation,” Touw told reporters. “It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

A Decade in the Making

Otto has refined its laminar flow for more than a decade. In 2017, it began flight testing with a demonstrator, the Celera 500, designed specifically with that architecture in mind. The Celera was built with a streamlined fuselage and smooth surfaces, with few external rivets or panel gaps on the entire airframe—not just the wing. That uniformity makes airflow less turbulent.

“The technology to understand laminar-to-turbulent flow transition didn’t exist…until the last five years,” Touw told FLYING. “Everyone was comfortable with turbulent-flow aircraft, and no one was willing to take the risk and dive into the laminar-flow world until we came around. Plus, advanced manufacturing capabilities have improved significantly, allowing for extremely precise, high-tolerance production methods.”

Over three years, Celera racked up north of 100 hours across more than 50 test flights in real-world conditions. Beyond the drag reduction, it proved an 80 percent reduction in operating costs versus traditional models and “near-jet speeds at a fraction of the fuel burn,” per Otto. Wind tunnel testing in 2024 further proved those benefits, which Touw told FlightGlobal “surprised even us.”

With laminar flow refined on Celera, Otto transitioned the technology to the Phantom 3500, which it claims will reach transonic speeds beyond 260 knots. But with reduced fuel burn, it aims to do so for about 43 percent less than the hourly cost of burning Jet A on a super-mid. Lightweight and low burn means Otto will use fewer materials to build the model, which can lower manufacturing costs. Touw said the company aims to churn out about 1,600 Phantoms annually after the model enters service but was tight-lipped about the number of firm orders.

The 3500’s estimated maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 19,000 pounds places it toward the upper limit of the FAA’s Part 23, under which Otto intends to certify it. That process is typically reserved for lighter jets with shorter range and is uncommon for a business jet. But Otto claims the Phantom’s 3,500 nm range beats aircraft with a similar MTOW, due to its fuel efficiency. Its range and performance are intended to match that of the Bombardier Challenger 3500 or Embraer Praetor 500, but with half the MTOW.

The Phantom’s balanced field length, less than 3,500 feet, opens up operations at twice as many airports, the company says. And with greater range and efficiency, it will require fewer stops. Its cruising altitude of 51,000 feet will help avoid turbulence caused by inclement weather, further cutting drag and fuel burn.

Otto also claims the Phantom’s 800-cubic-foot cabin will be twice the size of a conventional jet, with its 6-foot, 5-inch height allowing as many as nine passengers to stand comfortably. Porthole-style windows—removed to smooth out the airframe—are replaced by high-definition displays that give a view of the sky and scenery below.

Prior to Part 23 authorization, Otto plans to conduct about three years of flight testing using four production-conforming aircraft. It is working with suppliers—including Leonardo and Mecaer Aviation—to complete a preliminary design review by October. The company is also working toward a Series B raise to fund production.

Touw has estimated the program will cost $1 billion, with half going toward aircraft development and the rest supporting construction of a final assembly line.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-17-124131.png,N,,2025-06-17 12:18:08.371983

Market Overview and Growth Trajectory:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Growth: According to an exhaustive report by The Research Insights, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market is experiencing significant growth. Several environmental, regulatory, technological, and economic forces combine to drive strong growth in the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market. The aviation industry faces growing demands for decarbonization because of international climate agreements including the Paris Agreement and ICAO's CORSIA initiative. The adoption of SAF is speeding up due to government mandates and incentives like tax credits and blending obligations in key regions including the EU and U.S. The surge of sustainability pledges from major airlines and logistics firms has resulted in increased long-term SAF offtake contracts. Through technological developments in feedstock processing which include waste-based methods like HEFA and advanced Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuel production, SAF production becomes both more scalable and cost-efficient. The increasing investor attention on eco-friendly aviation technologies together with rising R&D funding creates innovative business structures and collaborative partnerships. SAF emerges as a crucial element for sustainable aviation because the public's increased environmental consciousness and eco-conscious travel trends strengthen the need for cleaner aviation solutions.

Air travel faces strict carbon emission rules alongside worldwide climate agreements:

The main factor propelling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market growth stems from increasing demands on the aviation industry to shrink its carbon footprint while meeting global climate objectives. The aviation sector produces around 2–3% of worldwide CO₂ emissions yet this figure will continue growing along with air travel expansion unless measures are implemented to control it. Aircraft emissions reduction targets are being enforced through strict new regulations from governments and international regulatory bodies including the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the European Union. ICAO leads CORSIA which requires airlines to balance emissions that exceed 2020 levels while promoting SAF usage to achieve reduction targets. Flights within the EU must adhere to binding SAF blending mandates under the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 packages.

On June 14, 2025, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz approved an omnibus tax bill that increases the state’s cannabis tax rate. The bill makes numerous corporate franchise and personal income tax changes including new income tax subtractions, changes to the alternative minimum tax, changes to treatment of certain retirement benefits, and changes to the sustainable aviation fuels, education, film production, research, renter’s, short line, and the homestead credit refund. The bill makes a number of sales and use tax changes to provisions relating to payments of tax by large vendors, changes to the qualified data center and sustainable aviation fuels exemptions, the definition of “certified service provider,” and the location of sales. The bill allows a brewer qualifying for the brewer tax credit to file its alcohol excise tax annually; and also makes changes to the provider tax research credit rate and pharmacy refund. The bill makes a number of changes to the state’s property taxes, including the exemptions for institutions of public charity, property used to distribute electricity to farmers, property owned by certain Indian tribes. The bill also enacts changes to the property tax treatment of low-income rental properties, agricultural property, class 1 property, affordable housing, utility cooperatives, the Sustainable Forest Incentive Act, and certain penalties relating to certificates of rent paid. Finally, the bill makes several changes to the insurance premium tax and the estate tax. ( L. 2025, H9 (S.S.), effective as stated.)

Individual income and corporate franchise tax provisions.

The bill makes a number of amendments to the state’s individual income and corporate franchise tax law. Among the changes made are the following:

New income tax subtractions: Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, the bill creates new income tax subtractions for coerced debt, certain consumer enforcement public compensation payments, and for foreign service pensions. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the bill creates a new income tax subtraction for student loan payments made by critical access dental clinics. Effective June 15, 2025, the bill creates an income tax subtraction for stipend payments that were included in a collective bargaining agreement between the state of Minnesota and SEIU Healthcare Minnesota and Iowa. The bill excludes stipends for the income measures used to calculate the renter’s credit, homestead credit refund, and alternative minimum tax. The bill specifies that stipend payments must not be considered income, assets, or personal property for the purposes of determining eligibility for child care assistance, general assistance, housing support, the Minnesota Family Investment Program, other economic assistance programs, or certain health care programs.

Temporary additions and subtractions: Effective retroactively at the same time the provisions adopted in the 2023 conformity bill were effective for federal purposes, the bill amends the temporary provisions of the 2023 conformity law relating to individuals, estates and trusts to clarify that “net income” includes the delayed business interest addition for composite and pass-through entity filers.

Alternative minimum tax: Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, the bill specifies that the income tax subtractions enacted by the bill also reduce alternative minimum taxable income for the Minnesota alternative minimum tax.

Education credit: Effective for assignments after December 31, 2025, the bill repeals language allowing taxpayers to assign a Minnesota education credit to a lender and makes conforming changes to the provisions on the standard of conduct for tax preparers.

Film production credit: Effective retroactively for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022, the bill makes a conforming change for a provision enacted in 2023 that allows taxpayers to claim the film credit if their expenses were incurred in any consecutive 12-month period.

Correction of errors for certain retirement contributions: Effective retroactively for contributions made in calendar year 2023 and designated to apply to the tax year 2022 contribution limitation, an annuity contract provider must designate certain IRA contributions to the tax year prior to the year the contribution is made, provided that the contribution is timely made under federal law and notice is provided to the provider within three years of the taxpayer’s return filing deadline.

Retirement benefits: Effective June 15, 2025, the bill clarifies that the public pension subtraction for “basic” pension plans applies to pensions earned based on service for which the member or survivor did not earn Social Security benefits.

Political contribution refund program: Effective for contributions made on or after December 31, 2026, the bill makes a number of amendments to the law governing the processing of political refund contribution claims, to reflect the electronic filing system required by the bill. Among the changes, the commissioner is prohibited from issuing a refund, whether in one payment or in aggregate, to a taxpayer if the refund exceeds the maximum refund amount permitted by law. Refund claims must be submitted using the electronic filing system and must reflect a minimum $10 claim amount.

Sales tax changes.

The bill makes a number of amendments to the state’s sales and use tax laws. Among the changes are:

Large vendors: Effective for taxes remitted after May 31, 2027, vendors with $250,000 or more of annual sales tax liability must remit 5.6% of their June liability two business days before June 30.

The Biden administration’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, for example, aims to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by the year 2030.
As a result, there’s increasing scrutiny about making global freight operations greener.
This initiative reflects a broader push within the industry to reduce emissions both in the skies and on the ground.
A sustainable transition By combining smarter packaging, transitioning to SAF, and investing in renewable energy for ground operations, a future where airfreight supports global commerce efficiently and sustainably seems to be underway.","AS the industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact, Finnair’s green initiatives blend pragmatic innovation, cross-sector collaboration, and a forward-thinking approach that addresses both waste reduction and decarbonisation.

Anna-Maria Kirchner, Finnair’s Head of Global Cargo Sales and Sustainability, explained, “For starters, one of our main focuses is reducing packaging waste, which is often overlooked but has a real impact on the overall sustainability of air cargo. For example, we’re testing reusable pallets that weigh less than traditional wooden ones. By switching to those, we reduce weight, which translates directly to lower fuel consumption and in turn, lower emissions.”

Besides their packaging practices, the airline is also transitioning to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These fuels are usually derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste, and can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80 percent, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

While European carriers have been early adopters, the US has also begun scaling its SAF ambitions in the past few years. The Biden administration’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, for example, aims to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by the year 2030.

Finnair has also actively participated in partnerships focused on sustainability in cargo logistics. These alliances promote knowledge sharing, joint innovation projects, and coordinated efforts to help reduce carbon footprints throughout supply chains.

“Collaboration is key,” Kirchner said. “We can’t simply tackle these challenges by ourselves. When we work together, sharing data and innovations, we help accelerate progress.”

Airfreight is responsible for about three percent of worldwide CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That said, emissions are growing rapidly due to e-commerce expansion and ever-increasing global trade. As a result, there’s increasing scrutiny about making global freight operations greener.

At the conference, Kirchner emphasised the airline’s holistic approach. “Sustainability is not a single fix; rather, it’s the sum of applying many small improvements across our processes,” she said. “From lighter packaging materials to cleaner fuels and better collaboration, it’s all part of the big picture.”

A path to sustainable aviation?

While Finnair and other European carriers have taken massive strides in regard to sustainability, adoption around the rest of the world is a little more fluid. The United States, for instance, has shown varying degrees of commitment and hesitation when it comes to sustainable aviation practices.

On one hand, as noted earlier, the US Department of Energy has launched the SAF Grand Challenge, and in light of that initiative, private companies have ramped up production. For example, Infinium is developing a Texas facility backed by Amazon and Breakthrough Energy to create electrofuels using renewable power and waste carbon dioxide.

However, SAF in the US still costs roughly two to three times more than conventional jet fuel, thus limiting more widespread use. Binding SAF blending mandates like the EU’s ReFuelEU initiative—which requires two percent SAF by 2025 and 70 percent by 2050—make for a broader and faster push to adopt newer fuel sources. Instead, airlines in the US rely on incentives such as the Blender’s Tax Credit, which was introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Solar-powered

In addition to its in-flight efforts, Finnair also addresses its emissions when it comes to ground operations. The airline has installed solar panels at its Helsinki cargo terminal, a move that powers parts of its facility with clean energy and helps reduce dependency on fossil fuels for ground support equipment.

This initiative reflects a broader push within the industry to reduce emissions both in the skies and on the ground. These panels are expected to cut tons of CO2 annually by offsetting grid electricity consumption.

A sustainable transition

By combining smarter packaging, transitioning to SAF, and investing in renewable energy for ground operations, a future where airfreight supports global commerce efficiently and sustainably seems to be underway.

The push comes ahead of the first European eSAF mandates taking effect in Germany (2026), the UK (2028) and the EU (2030).

Electro-sustainable aviation fuel, which is also known as power-to-liquid (PtL), is a low-emissions kerosene replacement that can be synthetically manufactured from water, carbon dioxide and renewable electricity, creating a virtually unlimited supply.

However, eSAF production is caught in a chicken-and-egg dilemma in which eSAF producers need long-term contracts, but most airlines cannot afford to tie themselves into long-term contracts at today’s prices, which are up to 10 times the cost of traditional kerosene.

To date, no EU commercial-scale eSAF projects have reached final investment decision and only a third of the mandated supply is on track to be available by 2030.

With European Commission input, Project SkyPower developed a double-sided auction mechanism to help kickstart the EU eSAF market. This model, which has already been used by H2Global in the green ammonia sector, would match the lowest cost producers and highest offtake bids, and the government funding would be used to bridge any price differential.

“This intermediary would act like a government-backed commodity trader, purchasing e-SAF in long-term contracts to provide revenue certainty to producers and selling in short-term contracts,” Project SkyPower said, noting its plans to continue working with the EU on the model.

The signatories included Airlines for Europe (A4E), Air France-KLM, Boeing, Copenhagen Airports, easyJet and SAS, plus a number of eSAF suppliers and financiers.

During a separate Paris Air Show briefing, executives from Air France-KLM and Airbus also called on the EU to extend EU emissions trading system SAF allowances and consider introduction of a formalized book-and-claim system. Under book-and-claim, companies can buy SAF for use elsewhere, when there is no local supply.

The EU is developing the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which is expected to be finalized in Q3. Aviation stakeholders are pushing for SAF and eSAF to be included in the STIP.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-06-17 12:18:40.435713

This deal contributes to secure the feedstock to produce biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

From the collection of used cooking oil to the production of biofuels in France

Under the terms of the agreement, Quatra will collect used cooking oil directly from restaurants, restaurant chains and industry in France and the rest of Europe. The oil will then be delivered to Quatra sites for filtering before being shipped to TotalEnergies’ biorefineries to produce road biofuels and SAF.

TotalEnergies has converted its refineries at La Mède in the south of France and Grandpuits near Paris into biorefineries.

La Mède: The biorefinery at La Mède, launched in 2019, has an annual production capacity of 500,000 tons of biofuel. Through this site, TotalEnergies is the only producer of HVO biodiesel in France. This year, La Mède will also produce sustainable aviation fuel for airports in the south of France.

Grandpuits: the site’s conversion into a zero-crude complex includes a biorefinery with an annual production capacity of 230,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel. Commissioning is planned for 2026. TotalEnergies has partnered with SARIA, the European leader in the collection and reuse of organic waste in the form of sustainable products, which will supply most of the site’s feedstock.

“I am delighted with this strategic agreement with Quatra that contributes to our aim to secure the feedstock we need to produce biofuels in our biorefineries. The development of biofuels is one of our Company’s strategic goals. By directly reducing the carbon intensity of the energy products used by our customers, we are actively working with them as part of our net zero approach, together with society,” said Valérie Goff, Senior Vice President, Renewable Fuels & Chemicals at TotalEnergies.

“At Quatra, we believe in long-term partnerships with leading industrial groups that combine logistics, environmental responsibility and financial viability. The deal between Quatra France and TotalEnergies is an excellent example of that. By supplying locally collected used cooking oil, we are contributing to a sustainable value chain. That allows us to focus on our core business, which is the efficient collection of used cooking oil across France, allowing TotalEnergies to turn that valuable resource into biofuel,” stated Pol Van Pollaert, Co-CEO, Quatra.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable aviation fuel providing a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel.","Neste has reached an agreement with Amazon to provide 7,500 metric tons (2.5 million gallons) of neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel for its Amazon Air cargo operations at San Francisco International Airport and Ontario International Airport in California, through to the end of 2025. This agreement makes Amazon the first company to purchase and use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Ontario International Airport, ranked among the top 10 cargo airports in the U.S.*

Amazon has made an ambitious commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040, and adopting SAF is a key lever to decarbonize its air cargo operations. The agreement to use SAF in California is part of a broader cooperation between Amazon and Neste that started four years ago when Neste delivered SAF to Amazon at Cologne Bonn airport in 2021.

Neste’s SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied to the Amazon Air network at both airports. The first volumes were successfully delivered earlier this year. Leveraging Neste's SAF supply capabilities established in Northern California in 2020, the fuel is delivered directly to San Francisco International Airport via existing pipeline infrastructure. For Amazon Air’s operation at Ontario International Airport, the SAF is delivered to the airport by trucks from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Los Angeles by Diesel Direct, Neste’s long-term partner. Diesel Direct uses Neste’s renewable diesel to fuel trucks dedicated to the SAF deliveries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from SAF transportation.

“We are excited to provide SAF to Amazon Air at two major airports in California. This milestone sends a positive signal that SAF is available to airlines and cargo operators, like Amazon Air at these airports. Our supply chain solution for these California gateways builds on our existing SAF supply capabilities on the West Coast in the U.S., and leverages our partnership with Diesel Direct to transport SAF by trucks running on renewable diesel. This demonstrates how renewable fuels can help our customers easily reduce greenhouse gas emissions across different transportation modes,” said Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable aviation fuel providing a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel. Using Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste’s SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. SAF is certified for commercial use and can currently be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel before use. It works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Today, Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons (around 515 million gallons) per annum, and it is set to grow to 2.2 million tons (around 750 million gallons) in 2027.

That this House has considered hydrogen powered aviation.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I will start by thanking everyone who has come this morning to participate in this debate. This subject sits at the crossroads of three major challenges facing our country today: our climate ambitions, our pursuit of technological innovation and our desire to kickstart domestic industry.

As the Member of Parliament for North Somerset, my constituency is certainly no stranger to the aerospace industry. Since the pandemic, Bristol airport has emerged as one of the UK’s fastest-growing airports, now serving 10 million passengers a year, with plans to increase that to 15 million passengers a year by 2040. Although many of my constituents have expressed support for the potential for the 10,000 or so additional jobs such an expansion may bring to my local area, many more have expressed concern over how it can be squared against the airport’s aim to achieve net zero by 2030.

Last week, we saw the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill enter the House for its Second Reading. That Bill will do much to spur and support the nation’s sustainable aviation fuel sector, in which Bristol airport is already a leading light. I—and I have no doubt many Members in this room—would echo those sentiments. I am a strong supporter of sustainable aviation fuel, and I look forward to seeing the transformational effect it will have on aviation emissions in the years to come.

The Government have already clearly displayed their vision and leadership in this space, and set forth a sensible plan to bring about the maturity of this sector. That is why I wish to focus our debate today not on the technology of tomorrow, but on that of the day after. Hydrogen-powered aviation presents one of the few truly scalable zero-emission pathways for the future of aviation, allowing us to meet our net zero targets while simultaneously keeping flying affordable and accessible.

We currently find ourselves in a fortunate position. The UK is already home to some of the most innovative aerospace companies in the word. From Airbus, located near my old house in Filton—in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Claire Hazelgrove)—to Rolls-Royce in Derby, we have a wealth of expertise to draw on, with a track record of innovative success. Aviation is currently responsible for around 7% of emissions in the UK today, with that figure expected to rise to 16% by 2035 unless meaningful action is taken soon.

Although in recent years we have had great success in decarbonising our power generation, cars, heating and many other sectors, the stark reality is that aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. Currently aviation is primarily fuelled by kerosene, and although great strides have been made in sustainable aviation fuel in recent years, there are currently no cost-competitive alternatives available. As the world continues on the inextricable path towards even greater levels of globalism and integration, the aviation industry’s ability to move people and goods swiftly across continents will only continue to grow in importance.

However, as aviation’s role in the global economy continues to grow, so will its contribution to global emissions, unless we have the foresight today to take the necessary steps for tomorrow and begin supporting the nascent hydrogen aviation industry. In my constituency, Bristol airport has shown real vision and leadership by taking a leading role in the Hydrogen in Aviation alliance, which has laid out a clear case for immediate action to secure our comparative advantage, not just for the betterment of our environment but for the economic prospects. That is a part of this debate that is not spoken about enough.

Many years ago, the UK was an early innovator and pioneer in the offshore wind sector, but a slow, disjointed deployment saw many of the manufacturing opportunities shift abroad to Europe, China and elsewhere. Today we find ourselves in a similar situation with hydrogen. The next 10 years will be critical: either we develop a coherent policy framework, which encourages private sector investment, or we will cede our leadership to the United States, China, the European Union and others, who are already heavily investing in hydrogen-powered aviation. By 2050, the global hydrogen economy is predicted to be worth around $8 trillion. Let us not make the mistake of the offshore wind sector again. Let us be leaders in this space, and so reap the rewards.

The west of England boasts the largest aerospace cluster in the UK. I recently had the privilege of visiting my former university in Bath, and the science park it has developed in tandem with the University of Bristol. They are doing excellent work to realise hydrogen’s potential to transform the aviation sector. Those twin pillars of south-west higher education are working closely with Airbus and Bristol airport as part of the Hydrogen South West group, which aims to cement the position of North Somerset, Bristol and the surrounding area as a national leader in the field.

During my visit to the science park it was made clear to me that although they are excited about the role that hydrogen has to play in the future of the aviation industry, the ever-shifting net zero policy landscape—especially the perceived lack of clarity from the Government on hydrogen’s future role—has handicapped the sector’s ability to draw in private investment. The Government must make it clear to the private sector that they do have faith in hydrogen’s ability to transform the aviation sector, and that early investment into the nascent industry will be rewarded in future.

According to data supplied by the sector’s trade association ADS, the global aviation industry could require more than 100 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050, even by today’s lacklustre transition plans. As we have seen with sustainable aviation fuel, the scaling up of production to those levels will require not just significant private and Government investment, but years to develop plans, build plants and train a sufficiently skilled workforce. It is imperative that we get moving on this issue today.

Although in one moment we must applaud the Government for their work on sustainable aviation fuel, in the next we must begin turning and then fixing their gaze towards hydrogen. The Government have already signalled support of the sector by announcing £100 million for the development of hydrogen planes through the Aerospace Technology Institute programme shortly after coming to power last July. In the autumn Budget, the Government announced almost £1 billion for the aerospace sector over the next five years. Similarly, in the spending review delivered by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last week, £500 million was committed to support the development of hydrogen infrastructure.

Over the past year, however, I have had innumerable conversations with leading figures in the sector, who have told me time and again of significant anxiety as to whether the UK Government envisage hydrogen having a direct role in the aviation industry in the medium to long term. While other countries push ahead with hydrogen, rightly seeing it as a valuable export market, we run the risk of being left in their wake—or contrails—unless we get a move on and make clear to the industry our steadfast support.

The experience of transition to renewables taught us that although Government investment can catalyse partnerships with the private sector, it ultimately must fall to the private sector to be the driver of change. Before the private sector will start the engine, it falls to this House and this Government thoroughly to investigate this area, set sensible standards and support the development of the necessary infrastructure, to enable a hydrogen-powered aviation future. To that end, I eagerly look forward to hearing from the Minister how he intends to support the industry further in the critical 10 years to come.

It is a real pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I thank the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for leading the debate and setting the scene so well. It is a pleasure to see the Minister and shadow Minister in their places. I look forward to the Minister’s response and helpful answers to our questions, to ensure we are encouraged by this debate that benefits will come to our constituencies.

Hydrogen is an alternative that is becoming more widely explored. There is no doubt it could and must play a part in the UK’s contribution to net zero targets. The ultimate secret to reaching net zero targets is how to do so without adversely impacting our constituents. I am not a sceptic—I never have been. Some people might be sceptics, but I am not one of them. I recognise the importance of meeting the targets, and hydrogen is one way to do that. Alternative forms of energy are being used in many transport paths, so it is important that we are here today to discuss the progression of our aviation industry.

I want to mention some of the things that are happening in Northern Ireland. Undoubtedly, a progression to hydrogen rather than fossil fuels has its benefits in terms of the transport industry. There are zero carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrogen is attractive for long-haul flights and has faster refuelling mechanisms. Of course, cost implications are very important as we move forward. Any new technology is always costly at the start, but as it gets easier to do, the cost implications reduce. At this moment in time the implications are incredibly large. Airports across the UK will require massive infrastructure upgrades. Most planes will require to be redesigned with larger storage capacity and the freezing temperature of hydrogen must be considered, so there are cost implications there. But for every airport across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we can do it better together.

Companies across the UK such as Airbus, easyJet, Boeing and Wrightbus in NI have looked at and announced plans for hydrogen-powered aircraft and other modes of transport. We just need to look at the transition that was made back home in Northern Ireland by Wrightbus in Ballymena, who developed a green hydrogen production facility capable of powering up to 300 hydrogen buses daily. It has taken some time to get there, but it was on the cusp of something new, and I understand that now almost every bus in London is a Wrightbus, with potentially more across the country. Furthermore, Airbus has announced plans for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. That is another indication of the timeline. easyJet successfully tested a hydrogen combustion engine in 2022. There have been many advances—small steps now, but great steps for the future as we look forward.

We have spoken a lot today about the importance of our aviation and aerospace sector to the economy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. When we look at transforming capabilities for the future, the key word is investment, so I am keen to get the Minister’s thoughts on how he sees that investment happening with all of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the beneficiaries of that. We are very fortunate to have a Minister in place who is a friend of Northern Ireland and who regularly visits. He has had discussions with the Minister back home at the Assembly to formulate ideas and move forward positively and constructively.

The key phrase is investment in the sector. I look at companies such as Spirit AeroSystems in Belfast and in my constituency of Strangford, which offers world-class aerospace engineering capabilities but is in the middle of a “buyover” that guarantees nothing for Northern Irish jobs. In the Chamber last week, when I had an opportunity to ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade about this, they were agreeable to the idea of meeting unions and people who could “buy over” to ensure the continuity of jobs across Northern Ireland. How can we possibly talk about investing in companies like this but offer nothing to preserve the future? It is really important that we get it all together in the right way. Perhaps this is a reminder to the relevant Ministers that issues like this will not go away, and that Government intervention to protect the future of our aviation sector is imperative.

There are roles in which all companies across the United Kingdom can play a part, small to large. All of us have a role to play. Some are more critical, but all of them are very helpful. For the likes of Northern Ireland, for instance, we have smaller airports that are perfect for short-haul early flight trials. We are very fortunate to have Belfast International, Belfast City and Londonderry airports, but they are all for short-haul and domestic flights, although there is an indication that next year there will be direct flights to the United States of America.

On early flight trials I have one thought. Ards airport is a small constituency airport—we have the Ulster flying club—and there are possibilities for using that for early trials. Why not? That shows that the reach of this debate can go even further. We have green targets that we are planning to meet. It would be fantastic if the UK could be a global leader in green aviation, but we must never underestimate the cost, the time and the infrastructure that are required.

There is no doubt about the Minister’s commitment to the aviation sector, but I look to him to get an idea of his plans and strategy for the future. That is the encouragement that I am looking for today arising from this debate, and I seek reassurances about people’s jobs in the aviation sector. We need to retain people with the relevant skills, so in the event of any changeovers—for instance, at Spirit AeroSystems back home—we must ensure that jobs are retained and encouraged. The industry would be nothing without the workers in it, who make it what it is, and Government intervention is required to maintain its success.

I look forward to seeing what the future looks like for hydrogen-powered aviation, and I have a very strong and positive hope—indeed, perhaps a vision—that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland can showcase what we have to offer for the future of aviation, and particularly for hydrogen-powered aviation.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Stringer. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for securing this timely and very important debate.

My constituency of Mansfield is just a stone’s throw away from East Midlands airport, which is one of the UK’s key freight and passenger hubs. It is important not only to our local economy, but to many of my constituents, who use the airport to get away on family holidays. With climate change being a significant concern to many of my constituents, and with the instability of hydrocarbon-based aviation fuel pricing as a result of numerous factors, including global conflict, I very much welcome the consideration of hydrogen-powered aviation as a practical and vital path towards sustainable flight.

The east midlands has always been at the heart of British industry and innovation, and now we must be at the forefront of clean technology. Aviation accounts for around 7% of our carbon emissions and the figure is growing, but rather than grounding its progress, we need to power it differently. Hydrogen offers us a really tangible solution: it produces zero carbon emissions at the point of use, and has great potential to fuel short and medium-haul flights by the mid-2030s—exactly the kinds of routes that operate out of East Midlands airport.

Hydrogen has real, tangible benefits over other approaches such as sustainable aviation fuel and battery power. We are already seeing British companies—including companies local to me in the east midlands, such as Rolls-Royce, and ZeroAvia in the south-west, which is working with East Midlands airport—investing in hydrogen engines. I believe that the Government have a responsibility to at least consider supporting that transition, not only to meet our climate targets but to protect and grow jobs in aviation, engineering and logistics in the east midlands.

Let us not forget that our constituents all want cleaner skies and to reach net zero, but they also want the opportunity to travel. Hydrogen-powered aviation can potentially deliver both, but to develop the technology to do that, we need the right investment in infrastructure, and particularly in research and development. We can turn regional airports into hubs of innovation that are important for the regions, and create a new export market in green aviation technology—that is not pie in the sky thinking. It will take some work to achieve it, but it is practical and necessary.

We should back British innovation and cleaner aviation. Let us ensure that the east midlands, Britain and the UK lead the world with this new, exciting technology.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I thank the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for securing this debate, which is particularly important for the west of England.

Hydrogen-powered flights have real potential to cut carbon emissions in a notoriously difficult to decarbonise industry, while still allowing people to enjoy flying around the world, as the aircraft would emit only water vapour. The industry needs support now, however, which means thinking about the technology, infrastructure and regulation.

Airbus, where many of my constituents work, is aiming for hydrogen-powered airliners by 2035. Its studies suggest that UK hydrogen aviation could support up to 110,000 jobs in this country, and we absolutely have the potential to show global leadership. When I discussed the ZEROe project on a visit to Airbus last year, it was trying to decide between hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. It has now plumped for the latter, although it does not rule out direct combustion in the future. It and other manufacturers are working in collaboration with academia, and there is some excellent knowledge in this area in our local universities. We need to back investment in research, development and manufacturing infrastructure. Other companies such as GKN, which has a base in my constituency, are also looking at hydrogen.

The west of England has a long history of innovation in aviation, going back to the days of Sir George White; it has many things that co-ordinate to make it a place to invest. For example, just outside my constituency, we have the Bristol and Bath science park, and we have the national composites centre. Hydrogen molecules are very small, so containing it is a challenge, but that is where the national composites centre’s expertise can help. In the science park, the institute for advanced automotive propulsion systems is also looking at hydrogen.

Obviously, it is no good having hydrogen-fuelled aeroplanes if we do not have the hydrogen, so we need large-scale investment in green hydrogen. It is all very well having zero emissions on our flights, but if the electricity is being generated from non-low carbon power in the first place, there will still be associated emissions. As the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee has heard a number of times in its inquiries, it is really important that the Government make a decision about the future use of hydrogen. Given that we will only ever be able to produce a finite amount of green hydrogen, I think we need to prioritise it for industries where there are no realistic alternatives, including aviation.

We need to be thinking about how we produce that energy, and again our area has something to offer the country, because we have the potential for new nuclear at Oldbury and we have the River Severn, where there was a recent commission on tidal power. We therefore have the means of producing green energy. We have expertise in all those areas, with excellent nuclear specialism in our local universities, the aviation expertise to develop its use in aviation, and the facilities that I described in the Bristol and Bath science park to help to tackle some of the problems associated with deploying the technology.

On infrastructure, we obviously need to think about not just how we are producing that energy, but how we are delivering it to airports and how we are storing it. Again, that comes back to the question about the future of the gas grid in this country—will it be repurposed for hydrogen at some point? Regulation and having the right regulatory environment are important. People are very aware that hydrogen is highly flammable, but we can make it safe by putting the right protocols in place.

Our 2024 manifesto set out taxation reform that would help to redirect people away from frequent high carbon flights. It is important that we give people a means of judging the carbon emissions from their flights. Many companies will be looking at their own net zero aims, and it is important that people understand the implications of their choices when flying.

Hydrogen-powered aviation has the potential to cut transport emissions and boost our economy through new jobs. The west of England is particularly well placed to support the industry. It is time to make sure that the regulatory environment is right and that limited public money is invested effectively.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I thank the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for securing this debate and for continuing the conversation that we have been having over the last couple of weeks about the future of aviation—something it is always a pleasure to talk about.

Nothing is inevitable about the pollution in our skies. Aviation does not have to be the easy poster child for conspicuous consumption of resources and casual carbon emissions. It does not have to be part of the problems we face with a warming planet, melting ice caps and increasingly extreme weather. With the right choices, it can be part of the solution. Britain is already feeling the mounting toll of climate change: flash floods, record heatwaves and freak storms. That is not abstract; it is already costing lives and livelihoods across the country. Aviation contributes to that problem and we cannot pretend that it does not.

In 2022 alone, UK domestic and international flights produced nearly 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 7% of the nation’s entire greenhouse gas emissions. If nothing changes, the Climate Change Committee projects that aviation will account for 16% of UK emissions by 2035. We cannot meet our net zero goals without tackling this issue. This debate is particularly well timed following the introduction of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill last week, which addresses the climate emissions of existing technology fuels.

There is good news beyond that, however, and aviation can be part of the solution to our fight against climate change. Thanks to scientific progress and industry innovation, we now have the technology to fly without fossil fuels. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, is a clean fuel that emits no carbon when used. It is one of the most promising solutions for decarbonising aviation, whether by powering aircraft directly or by creating sustainable aviation fuels. That is not a pipe dream; it is already happening.

Hydrogen aircraft are being trialled, green fuel production is scaling up and aircraft around the world are beginning to prepare for a hydrogen-powered future. However, the UK risks being left behind unless we match ambition with investment. The ATI estimates that aerospace’s economic contribution to the UK economy could increase from £8.4 billion today to over £37 billion by 2050, driven by new low and zero emission technologies such as hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Britain’s aerospace sector is ready, but it lacks confidence that essential infrastructure exists, such as the hydrogen production that those aircraft will require. ADS, the UK trade association for aerospace, defence, security and space, estimates that global aviation could require more than 100 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050—3 million tonnes of which would be used in the UK. It is essential that we scale up the production of green hydrogen to meet that challenge, and enable the shift in the industry to take place. Investment is required in production, as is massive investment in refuelling systems and supply chains, as well as the planning approvals that are required to approve projects necessary for that development.

The ATI strategic programme has supported several key projects in the shift to develop hydrogen-electric propulsion systems, including ZeroAvia’s HyFlyer and advanced fuel cells for aviation decarbonisation projects, GKN’s H2GEAR and H2FlyGHT—lots of confusing acronyms and project names—and Project Fresson, led by Cranfield Aerospace Solutions. Some of those projects, including those by ZeroAvia, have resulted in or will soon result in certification applications with the Civil Aviation Authority that will complete in the coming years—the earliest of them by 2026.

ZeroAvia, which is based in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cotswolds (Dr Savage), is backed by many huge investors, including Airbus, British Airways, and the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund. It is already attracting orders from airlines such as Alaska Airlines and United Airlines. Critically, it has also had investment from the UK Infrastructure Bank and the Scottish National Investment Bank, which shows the immediate viability and attractiveness of investing in this technology.

Having raised over $250 million and grown a team of more than 200 employees across Gloucestershire and London, ZeroAvia is already making a significant contribution to the aviation industry. It is currently targeting certifying with the CAA a hydrogen-electric powertrain for planes with up to 20 seats, with the target of it entering service next year. The step after that will be developing an engine for larger 40 to 80-seat aircraft by 2028. The certification will require investment in the CAA to provide the skills and expertise to evaluate and then certify the aircraft as safe.

The advantage of ZeroAvia’s approach is the ability for airlines to retrofit the engines into existing fleets. This is not a tale about a technology of the future. ZeroAvia has already performed several world-first breakthrough flight demonstrations of its powertrain technology from its base at Cotswold airport. ZeroAvia is an incredibly exciting new entry to the sector, but existing aviation giant Airbus has also seized the opportunity of hydrogen. Its plans are bigger and depend on more infrastructure; as a result, Airbus recently announced its ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft programme would be delayed by a decade because of concerns about the availability of infrastructure to support hydrogen flight.

The ZEROe aircraft features an electric-propellor propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells that uses the hydrogen to generate electricity on board through a chemical reaction, similar to the approach taken by ZeroAvia. The only by-product of this reaction is water, and when combined with green hydrogen production, the process is carbon-neutral. The ZEROe approach with propeller propulsion is the likely first-generation hydrogen powerplant type, replacing domestic and regional aircraft, like those ZeroAvia is already developing, for shorter flights.

That approach contrasts with the one Rolls Royce is taking with its project to modify existing technology engines to run on gaseous hydrogen, instead of requiring a conversion to electrical energy to power an onboard electric motor. Rolls showed the huge potential of that work back in 2022 when it successfully ran a modified AE 2100-A engine, which is a variant of the turboprop powerplant that equips the Saab 2000 regional airliner, which is a long-established and widely used regional turboprop.

The next stage of that work is to modify a Pearl 15 business jet engine, which is a twin shaft turbofan that currently powers the Bombardier Global Express, showing that this approach is potentially applicable to turbofans as well as turboprops. The direct combustion of hydrogen in a modified existing-technology engine shows an alternative route to harnessing hydrogen to decarbonise the aviation industry. These projects show the huge potential of this fuel to take aviation into the modern era of low and zero-emission operations.

There are three approaches: eSAF, fuel cell to electrical production on the aircraft and direct hydrogen propulsion. They are all viable technologies and approaches that the market, industry and research will understand and develop for the appropriate sectors. For now, those projects are all being held back by infrastructure availability, and I call on the Minister to fix that. I welcome his Government’s July announcement of the commitment of over £100 million for the development of hydrogen and electric aircraft through the Aerospace Technology Institute, and nearly £1 billion over five years to support innovation in the aerospace sector. There is no denying that those are serious, positive moves, but they must be only the start. If we get sustainable aviation fuel right, the benefits for cities such as London will be enormous. Clean flights mean cleaner air, fewer respiratory illnesses, fewer days lost to sickness, and longer, healthier lives. Getting it right would also mean economic leadership, new green engineering jobs, revitalised manufacturing, and a chance for Britain to lead the global hydrogen economy.

Of all transport sectors, on a first-principle basis, aviation is the one to which hydrogen is most applicable. In fact hydrogen will be essential if aviation is to make its net zero targets. Aviation is the most energy-intensive mode of transport and the most sensitive to mass, as the Breguet range equations that I explained to all hon. Members last week show. That is why aviation will be the most suitable use of hydrogen fuel in the future. Aviation has the least competition from other zero-emission pathways, due to their various shortcomings. The sector’s energy demand is plannable and high, creating significant offtake that can bring H2 down the cost curve. Additionally, the professionalised and regulated environment of aviation is very well suited to handling the new fuel, and establishing standards and safety. Hydrogen’s success in aviation will be a major proof point against many existing investor concerns for other sectors.

I urge the Minister first to provide longer-term clarity to industry on the availability of hydrogen. The Government must signal their intentions on renewable energy and hydrogen production targets beyond 2040, and, to bring forward the business models for hydrogen transport, storage and power, they should also extend Aerospace Technology Institute funding to a 10-year horizon.

Unlike what we have heard from other hon. Members in this debate, this is absolutely not a call for flights to be grounded and Britain isolated. This is a call to fly smarter and cleaner, to back British science and leadership to build a better and more sustainable future. Aviation connects us to people, places and possibilities. It can drive innovation. It boosts economies and it brings the world closer together. With the right action, it can keep doing all of that without costing us our planet.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Stringer. I congratulate the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) not only on securing the debate but on setting out the case for hydrogen aviation so clearly in his opening remarks. The Second Reading of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill last week was but the precursor to this Westminster Hall debate—this debate was trailed in that one. I also congratulate all other hon. Members who have spoken in the debate.

It is a pleasure to speak for His Majesty’s Opposition in this important debate on the policies of the Government of the United Kingdom on hydrogen-powered aviation. Aviation is a sector that underpins global connectivity, international trade, and regional economic growth, but its long-term sustainability requires bold innovation, and a clear policy framework that supports low-carbon propulsion technologies while enabling British industry to lead.

Let me be clear: hydrogen is not a hypothetical solution. It is a practical, viable and strategically critical path forward for decarbonising flight. The UK has a golden opportunity to lead the world in this technology, not just by developing aircraft but by creating the entire hydrogen aviation value chain, from production and distribution to propulsion and maintenance. When combusted purely, hydrogen emits only water vapour, unlike kerosene, obviously, which produces carbon dioxide. Moreover, unlike battery electric aircraft, hydrogen aviation scales better over distance and payload, making it suitable for not just short-term hops but future regional and potentially transcontinental routes. That is not only good for the planet, but good for Britain.

According to the Aerospace Technology Institute, the UK could generate up to £34 billion in GVA and support 60,000 jobs by 2050 through hydrogen powered aviation. That is thousands of skilled engineering, manufacturing and research and development roles across the country. These areas stand to benefit significantly from hydrogen aircraft production, airport infrastructure retrofitting and fuel supply chain development. In Bristol and Gloucestershire, Airbus and GKN Aerospace are already laying the groundwork for hydrogen propulsion and systems integration. In the midlands, particularly in Derby and Coventry, Rolls-Royce is developing hydrogen combustion engines in work that has the potential to sustain and expand our world leading turbo machinery industry. In Teesside, the Conservative Government-designated hydrogen transport hub is pioneering fuel production and logistics, with Teesside international airport poised to become a hydrogen aviation testbed. In Scotland, Prestwick airport is leading hydrogen aircraft trials and Aberdeen is already a recognised centre for hydrogen fuel development. Belfast, home to Spirit AeroSystems, is well positioned to play a central role in manufacturing structural components for the hydrogen aircraft of the future.

A successful future-focused aviation sector means more than environmental progress; it means greater reliability and connectivity for passengers, and competitive ticket prices driven by fuel efficiency. For business, it means faster, lower emission logistics, better access to export markets and the growth of regional airports as hubs for commerce and investment. There is an important distinction to be made here, and one that we in this place must be honest about. While hydrogen fuel cells offer lower energy losses and may suit smaller aircraft or drones, it is pure hydrogen combustion that offers the best chance of achieving decarbonisation for medium to large aircraft, especially within the constraints of airframe weight and power density. Combustion also enables more rapid retrofit of existing aircraft designs and is more compatible with current maintenance ecosystems and airport infrastructure. Simply put, hydrogen combustion is the most practical, scalable route for commercial aviation and the UK should be focusing investment accordingly.

It was the Conservatives in government who recognised that early on. Under the jet zero strategy established in 2022, we committed funding to Project FlyZero, supported by trials by ZeroAvia and Rolls-Royce. We ringfenced funding for hydrogen infrastructure at UK airports. We laid the groundwork for the SAF price mechanism that this current Government is carrying through with the SAF Bill. We established the hydrogen transport hub in Teesside, where our fantastic mayor Ben Houchen, now Lord Houchen, oversaw a combined £23 million funding package to kick-start the local hydrogen-based economy. We also made Britain one of the first countries to support regulatory frameworks for hydrogen-powered flight trials.

Turning to the new Government, the mantle has clearly democratically passed to them, and the test on whether hydrogen aviation can succeed lies with them. The promised expansion of the aerospace growth partnership, sadly, has been watered down. The Aerospace Technology Institute’s hydrogen propulsion roadmap seems to have stalled, and companies at the cutting edge, from Cranfield to Kemble to Prestwick, report difficulty in accessing follow-on support, despite clear potential and private co-investment. The Government must stop conflating hydrogen policy with overreliance on electric-only solutions, which simply cannot be scaled to long-haul aviation. A narrow vision such as that would be misguided; it is actively stifling British leadership in this vital sector. If we want to lead the next aviation revolution to match our leadership in jet engines with leadership in zero carbon propulsion, then ambition must be matched by action. That means committing long-term funding for hydrogen combustion propulsion research and development, providing meaningful and long-term support for airport hydrogen infrastructure trials, especially in regional hubs, accelerating the certification and regulatory pathway for hydrogen aircraft and aligning hydrogen production strategies with the wider UK aviation sector.

The hydrogen age is not coming. It is here, and unless the Government correct course, the opportunity to lead it will pass us by. The last Conservative Government laid the foundations for hydrogen-powered aviation. I very much hope that this Government, and this Minister, do not allow the UK to lose that legacy through indecision. I challenge the Minister, who is very thoughtful on this subject and has the best interests of aviation at heart, to ensure that hydrogen is part of that future.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Stringer. It was also a pleasure, as a young councillor, to serve under your leadership of Manchester city council in the early ’90s. As I said in a debate the other day, you were chairman of the airport that last built an international runway in the UK—the only one in 80 years. I learned a lot in that period, and I am always grateful to you.

I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) on securing an excellent first debate in Westminster Hall and thank other hon. Members for their contributions. Famously, my hon. Friend is a pharmacist by training and by trade; he actually lives in a village called Pill, which is probably the strongest case of nominative determinism I have come across in my political career. He is also a doughty champion for Bristol airport. He never fails to tackle me about the issue in the Lobby or the Chamber. The airport plays a crucial role in providing connectivity and enabling growth in the south-west, and I welcome the leading role that it has played in developing hydrogen, such as the recent Project Acorn trials, which demonstrated the safe use of zero emission ground handling equipment in an airside environment.

I am grateful to hon. Members for their contributions on the SAF Bill last week. The Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith), spoke well about his passion for this issue, and mentioned that hydrogen fuel produces only water vapour. It is good for the environment, jobs and airports. It can help general and commercial aviation.

Upon coming into government, I had to take some tough decisions. The Jet Zero Council, established under the last Government, was reasonably ineffective. It hardly met and it was unwieldy; people said that it had become a talking shop with limited outcomes. I made big decisions to refocus it, narrow it down and ensure that it had tangible outcomes.

For all the groundwork that the Opposition spokesperson said that the last Government laid, we have had to make tough decisions. We are the Government that introduced the mandate for SAF, which came into law on 1 January this year, and in the first Session of this Parliament we are making decisions about the revenue certainty mechanism. I am grateful to all hon. Members who are supporting that, but we should have been doing this years ago. We now have a Government who are committed to making progress, and we will continue doing so.

As the Secretary of State noted when introducing the Bill last week, the Government recognise the key role of the aviation sector in driving growth, and

“we will not accept false trade-offs that pit aviation’s growth against our commitments to net zero.”—[Official Report, 11 June 2025; Vol. 768, c. 1031.]

I want to see a future in which more passengers and goods fly while we transition to a greener aviation sector. In addition to introducing the SAF Bill, the Government have already established a SAF mandate, as I have said. The mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism will provide much-needed support to SAF producers, stimulating investment in domestic production, which we all want to see, by reducing financial risk and uncertainty for those producers and supporting the UK to become a world leader in sustainable fuel production. As I said in last week’s debate, the world is looking to us and asking us about our revenue certainty mechanism, because we are leading the world in that field.

As we all know, we are also acting to modernise our airspace. Earlier this month, we released a response to the consultation on a new UK airspace design service—UKADS—and support fund. UKADS will make flightpaths more direct and efficient, reducing unnecessary emissions and supporting flights with fewer delays.

Let us get to the subject in hand. I recognise the clear potential of hydrogen as a zero emission aviation fuel and what it could contribute towards greener aviation. As the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) said in his customarily excellent speech, it produces zero CO2. He is right that it is costly, but we know that the costs will become competitive as we scale up. He speaks well of Spirit in his constituency and the workers who work there in this field. I pay tribute to him and them for what they do in Northern Ireland.

Given our world-leading aerospace sector, we should seek to capture in the UK the jobs and growth benefits emerging from these technologies. The Government have already acted to support the use of low-carbon hydrogen in aviation through the SAF mandate, with eligible hydrogen rewarded through the provision of tradeable SAF certificates. Innovation led by the sector is key, and I welcome the work by Airbus and GKN on hydrogen technology in the south-west and the support provided by academia, such as by Bath University. I congratulate the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Claire Young); the south-west is well placed in the R&D world for this technology. Given her work as a former leader of the council and her expertise in the tech sector, I welcome her valuable contribution to the debate.

We will continue to co-invest with industry on a range of R&D projects, which a number of Members raised, including the development of hydrogen aircraft technology through the Aerospace Technology Institute programme that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Luke Taylor) mentioned. As announced in the spending review, we will invest more than £3 billion in the next four years in the advanced manufacturing sector on zero emission vehicles, batteries and aerospace technologies. I join him in congratulating Cranfield Aerospace Solutions, which I visited while in opposition, on its work.

The Government will further set out our approach to the advanced manufacturing sector in the modern industrial strategy later this month. That will benefit from the UK-US trade deal signed today, under which there will be zero tariffs on UK aerospace trade with the United States. I am aware that aircraft developers are moving at pace, with ZeroAvia announcing plans last month for a manufacturing base in Glasgow. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Steve Yemm) for mentioning it and for being a doughty champion for East Midlands airport near his constituency. He is right to mention the geopolitical situation. There are many reasons why we should make these changes, but energy security is one of them, given that we are in an increasingly uncertain world. He brings his previous tech experience to the debate, and I congratulate him on his contribution.

The wider sector should prepare for the adoption of this new technology and, to support those whole-system changes, the Government, the aviation and aerospace sector, and academia must work together. The Jet Zero Taskforce that I have established is a key focus for that collaboration, and I am pleased to co-chair the expert group alongside the Minister for Industry. Importantly, one of the task and finish groups of the Jet Zero Taskforce is reviewing barriers to the commercial operation of hydrogen aircraft. The group will report on its findings in the autumn, and I look forward to considering them closely.

As the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate said, regulation is critical. Improving regulation in the UK, and ensuring that it enables growth and does not unduly hold back investment, is an essential part of the Government’s growth mission and of delivering on the plan for change. For that reason, in March the Chancellor announced that in the current financial year the Department for Transport will fund the Civil Aviation Authority’s hydrogen in aviation regulatory challenge. This work is helping the CAA to collaborate with innovative companies through regulatory sandboxes, in order to develop a proportionate regulatory framework for them.

Finally, I will touch on the production of low-carbon hydrogen, which is essential not only for aviation but for the wider economy. We have strong domestic expertise and favourable geology and infrastructure to develop a thriving low-carbon hydrogen sector in the UK. We are delivering real projects to kick-start the UK’s hydrogen economy, as demonstrated by the recently signed contracts for projects that were successful in the first hydrogen allocation round.

Later this year, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will publish a refreshed hydrogen strategy to ensure that hydrogen achieves its unique role in the Government’s clean energy superpower and growth missions. Just last week, the Government announced over £500 million to develop the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, boosting industrial regions such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber.

The week of the international Paris air show is an important time to reflect on the progress that we are making towards a greener aviation sector. I therefore reiterate my ambition on this important matter, as well as my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset for securing today’s debate and to other hon. Members for contributing to it.

I, too, thank all the hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. It was fantastic to hear from the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) about the importance of mitigating any impact of this change on constituents and of challenging scepticism about hydrogen’s role. He is definitely on the bus when it comes to hydrogen. My hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Steve Yemm) is a champion of his local airport and of green hydrogen, which offers us strategic energy independence and jobs while also helping us to meet climate targets. The hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Claire Young) talked about the innovation history in the west of England, a region that she said is up for the challenges of hydrogen while prioritising change in aviation.

Front Benchers made a number of important points, too, including about the risk of doing nothing for our ability to meet our climate targets; the skills needed to reflect the changes to regulation to go alongside the Government’s announced funding; the need for a long-term plan to drive investment; the fact that hydrogen is good for the planet and good for Britain; the role of the Government in providing leadership in this hydrogen age, not only in the UK but internationally; and the effect of a refocused Jet Zero Council on progress on catching up in order to meet our plans for a greener aviation sector. I also welcome the UK-US trade deal and its potential benefits for the nascent hydrogen economy. I thank all the relevant Members for bringing those points to the fore; I am certain that the Minister has heard them and will take them away.

We have heard today about the extraordinary opportunities across the country that the development of the aviation sector might bring. I have seen at first hand in my constituency of North Somerset that it is an incredibly exciting sector, which has long been at the cutting edge of innovation in this country; hydrogen-powered aviation is just the latest link in a chain stretching back over 100 years.

I get the sense that we are unified behind hydrogen-powered aviation. We all agree on the need to reach our legally binding net zero targets, and that we must do so in a way that maintains the affordability and accessibility of the modern aviation industry. I believe that hydrogen-powered aviation is the answer. Down the line, we might disagree on some minor tactical points, but so long as we agree on the overarching aim and strategy, I believe that we can get there.

Realising the potential of hydrogen-powered aviation is incredibly important, not just for the long-term regional economic prospects of constituencies such as mine, in which Bristol airport plays such a key role in our local economy, but for our nation as a whole. As we have heard, the aviation industry supports over 1.6 million jobs across our country and contributes over £120 billion to our economy every year. While we are here to recognise its contributions to our emissions, I think we agree on its importance to our future economic growth and, therefore, on the need to support its decarbonisation while not imperilling its expected strong growth.

I thank Members again for their contributions. I look forward to seeing how the sector continues to develop in the years to come. As they say, the sky’s the limit.

Question put and agreed to.

,,2025-06-17 10:49:32+00:00,www.argusmedia.com,US Senate bill would cut extra subsidy for SAF | Latest Market News - Argus Media,Argus Media,,,,,https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2699673-us-senate-bill-would-cut-extra-subsidy-for-saf,"The US Senate tax-writing committee is proposing cutting a tax credit's extra subsidy for low-carbon jet fuels over road fuels and introducing less-restrictive limits on foreign biofuel feedstocks, major shifts from current law and the House version of the bill.
The Senate draft proposes offering a maximum subsidy of $1/USG for all fuels based on their carbon intensities starting next year.

The Senate draft is just a proposal and could be changed.","The US Senate tax-writing committee is proposing cutting a tax credit's extra subsidy for low-carbon jet fuels over road fuels and introducing less-restrictive limits on foreign biofuel feedstocks, major shifts from current law and the House version of the bill.

Republicans have planned to use a far-reaching budget bill this year to alter climate policies from the Inflation Reduction Act, which created a new tax credit for clean fuel producers known as ""45Z"". The House passed its version of the bill last month, which would have kept the general structure of that incentive — upping fuel subsidies as emissions fall — and extended the incentive by four additional years through 2031. The credit took effect this year.

But the Senate Finance Committee in draft language released Monday floated its own changes, suggesting that Republican lawmakers are not yet aligned on how to alter the subsidy just weeks before President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to pass the major bill into law.

The Senate draft proposes offering a maximum subsidy of $1/USG for all fuels based on their carbon intensities starting next year. The House made no changes to that part of the law, which currently offers road fuels up to $1/USG and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) up to $1.75/USG, plus inflation adjustments for all types of fuel.

That change would reduce the incentive's upfront costs — potentially alleviating concerns among some conservative lawmakers that the bill would add to the budget deficit — but could reduce alternative fuel availability for airlines and upend many refiners' plans to convert more renewable diesel output to SAF.

""We have always supported tech-neutral biofuel incentives and at first blush the Senate draft seems to be moving toward making 45Z truly tech-neutral,"" said David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs at the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, which had opposed treating aviation fuels differently than road fuels.

The Senate proposal would also scrap a provision in the House bill that starting next year would restrict eligibility to fuels derived from North American feedstocks. Instead, the Senate committee has proposed cutting subsidies for fuels from foreign feedstocks by 20pc while still allowing them some credit.

LE BOURGET—Air France expects sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) costs to rise to €650 million ($750 million) in 2030, up from €90 million in 2024, as a European mandate for SAF use rises to 6% SAF, the airline’s CEO Anne Rigail says.

“Our issue at the moment–it’s not new but we have to fight against it–is that SAF is currently very expensive, about three to four times more expensive than conventional fuel,” Rigail said June 17 in an address at the Paris Air Lab, part of the Paris Air Show.

The cost—and availability—of SAF is a big issue for European airlines, which have in recent months been expressing doubts about whether the 2030 SAF target, part of ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, is attainable, and even controversially suggesting the target should be pushed back.

On that same timescale, Rigail says European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System (ETS) costs will reach more than €200 million, up from €100 million, while the cost of fleet renewal—which the airline says is currently the most efficient way for it to decarbonize—will be stable at around €1 billion.

Rigail says European airlines risk being put at a disadvantage to airline peers from other parts of the world because of rising decarbonization costs in the region.

“It’s crucial for us to implement mechanisms in the EU to narrow the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene to preserve our competitiveness. Those mechanisms, for us, must include directing aviation-related regulatory costs toward SAF development. This is what Germany just announced with the intention to allocate toward SAF 50% of its aviation ETS revenues,” Rigail says. “This is also what has been decided in France in the maritime sector. It’s time to reassess aviation taxation.”

At a European level, airlines are awaiting the presentation of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, due to be presented later this year, which they hope will be a stepping stone to increasing SAF volumes and bringing down prices.

Speaking to Aviation Week on the sidelines of the air show, Rigail says it is a question of “wait and see” as to whether investment in SAF would be tackled as the industry hopes in this plan.

But she says Air France is hopeful of a growing move in the region toward allocating ETS revenues to SAF purchase and investment in the SAF supply chain, as recently seen in Germany.

“That’s something we’re asking for in France,” Rigail says. “We have hope that little by little awareness is growing that European airlines will not be able, in a world in which there is international competition, to finance their decarbonization costs by passing them on to customers.”

During her speech, Rigail noted that European carriers had lost 11 points of market share on routes to and from Europe over the past 20 years, with a total market share of 41% in 2024 compared to 52% in 2004. Non-European carriers have been growing twice as fast on that timescale, she says. French carriers have lost 19% of market share between France and the rest of the world over that period.

“With the increase in environmental regulation in the EU but not in other regions, the risk is not only to see this trend continue, but to see this trend … worsen. The core issue is that those environmental constraints and their associated costs are not harmonized in the world,” Rigail says.

The airline industry is still waiting for other parts of the world to follow the EU and the UK in imposing SAF mandates, she adds.

Referring to the recent move to increase the so-called “solidarity tax” on aviation in France, a move heavily criticized by airlines, Rigail says: “Overtaxing aviation does not reduce its impact, it only undermines its accessibility and limits the ability of airlines like Air France to invest in fleet renewal and SAF. We urgently need a wake-up call in the EU. We know that the UK, US and China are moving very fast on SAF and we cannot let the EU be marginalized. We need a clear, coordinated policy.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-06-17 08:05:56.800858

@Vietjet @Airbus #A321neo #PAS25","Paris, France, 17 June 2025 - Vietjet, Vietnam’s largest private airline, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Airbus covering a major new order for 100 single-aisle A321neo aircraft, with the potential to add another 50 in the future.

The agreement was signed during the Paris Air Show by Vietjet CEO Dinh Viet Phuong and Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business.

“This new agreement marks a significant milestone in our strategic partnership with Airbus,” said Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. “These modern and efficient aircraft have been instrumental in Vietjet’s growth, helping us make air travel more accessible and affordable for millions, while strengthening our role as a connector for economic development, cultural exchange and global connectivity. This landmark agreement represents a vital step in Vietjet’s growth strategy as a multi-national aviation group.”

“Our latest agreement comes just weeks after the airline placed an additional order for A330neo widebody aircraft,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry. “Together the A321neo and A330neo will be perfect partners for Vietjet to continue to spread its wings, efficiently matching capacity more closely to demand across its network. The airline will also benefit from the high levels of technical commonality that are unique to latest generation Airbus aircraft.”

Operating a fleet of more than 100 Airbus aircraft, Vietjet continues to expand its global network and fleet modernisation.

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ best-selling A320neo Family, offering unparalleled range and performance. By incorporating new generation engines and Sharklets, the A321neo brings a 50% noise reduction and more than 20% fuel savings and CO₂ reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft, while maximising passenger comfort in the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky.

At the end of May 2025, more than 7,000 A321neo aircraft have been ordered by over 90 customers across the globe.

As with all in-production aircraft, the A321neo is able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to up to 100% SAF capability by 2030.

He said, “The drafting agency needs to closely the Politburo on innovation in law-making and enforcement to meet the requirements of national development. Major policy issues will come under the legislative authority of the National Assembly, while implementation and technical management issues will be the responsibility of the government, ministries, and agencies. We need to clearly define who does what, with the right role, and the right task.""

The DPM noted that aviation security and safety is facing new threats that require addressing, from regulations on infrastructure, telecommunications equipment, and pilots, to flight safety officers and security systems inside and outside the airport.

According to Uong Viet Dung, director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, based on a review of the current law, the recommendations made by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and emerging development needs, the drafting agency has proposed five main policy groups for revision.

The first is completing a legal framework on the organisation of state management of the aviation sector, clarifying the role and legal status of aviation authorities and aviation security authorities, and developing the aviation industry.

The second is completing aviation safety policies, closely following the eight key elements in the ICAO's safety monitoring system.

The third is updating and supplementing aviation security policies, considering them part of national security, with specialised organisations and independent investigation mechanisms.

The fourth is amending policies on investment and operation of airports, especially dual-use facilities with defence-security functions and public-private partnerships.

The fifth is developing air transport, including policies to encourage cargo carriers, improve service quality, and airline responsibility.

The Ministry of Construction (MoC) has proposed adding regulations for drones and flying taxis to catch up with technology trends and pave the way for piloting new models.

DPM Ha emphasised that new policies on aviation must aim to create breakthroughs, remove bottlenecks, and improve state management, closely following international commitments and paving the way for the development of a modern, integrated aviation industry.

He stressed that the revised law must definitively address land use and defence-security asset management at dual-use airports to prevent overlaps among aviation, land, and defence laws. Clear rules are also needed to define public-private roles in airport infrastructure investment, and operation and management, ensuring transparency and avoiding duplication.

“The drafting body should review policies on competition, slot allocation, and operating rights to ensure fairness between state-owned and private airlines, as well as a mechanism to support Vietnam's aviation development,” DPM Ha added.

He also called for the addition of environmental protection and sustainable development policies, such as updating the CO₂ emissions reduction roadmap, fully participating in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, and encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuels.",https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2025/062025/17/14/in_social/deputy-prime-minister-tran-hong-ha-chaired-a-meeting-photo-vgp-20250617142133.jpg?randTime=1750161979,N,,2025-06-17 08:06:26.590306

Europe’s lethargy is being echoed by an acceleration in SAF development in other regions, however – China has announced around 10 large-scale e-kerosene projects, accounting for approximately 20% of global planned capacity.
“Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs.
The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a chance to set the right flight path by prioritising e-SAF, providing a comprehensive mechanism to address the challenges EU projects face.” Read more here.","While Europe has taken an early lead in the development of e-kerosene, the most scalable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a series of bottlenecks could mean it loses its first-mover advantage, Transport & Environment (T&E) has said.

According to T&E, Europe has the potential to host more than half of the world’s e-kerosene production, with a production capacity of close to 3 million tonnes – or around 5% of the fuel that Europe’s aviation sector needs to operate.

While Europe’s early progress has been boosted by EU law on sustainable aviation fuels, specifically ReFuelEU, the development of production facilities is hampered by financing challenges, as well as by traditional fuel suppliers being ‘notably absent from the conversation’, T&E said.

‘E-kerosene revolution’

“|The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential,” commented Camile Mutrelle, aviation policy officer at T&E.

“Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

T&E notes that only four projects are at an advanced planning stage, with financing the main barrier – each project requires between €1 billion and €2 billion in capital. Overall, the capital required to meet 2030 targets for SAF is estimated at €10 billion to €20 billion.

Europe’s lethargy is being echoed by an acceleration in SAF development in other regions, however – China has announced around 10 large-scale e-kerosene projects, accounting for approximately 20% of global planned capacity.

Funding mechanisms

Currently, EU funding mechanisms for e-kerosene are ‘not strong enough to support the level of investment needed to get these projects off the ground’, T&E noted, while traditional oil companies have made ‘negligible contributions’, continuing to invest in fossil fuels.

“Despite their huge financial capacity, major oil companies are largely absent from the e-kerosene market,” Mutrelle added. “Startups have taken the lead, but lack the internal resources to finance the capital-intensive infrastructure that is urgently needed.

“Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs. The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a chance to set the right flight path by prioritising e-SAF, providing a comprehensive mechanism to address the challenges EU projects face.” Read more here.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSarYrCRgtflDS1W/36f06281fc3d2f9f50953c4896de395eb7f9d3f5a33d3d1fca38f172d9b480a7/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=news-1&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%231e6000%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2024%252F12%252Flogo-white.png%253Ffit%253D1000%25252C141%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F06%252Fpexels-ekky-wicaksono-1370255-3760564.jpg%253Ffit%253D900%25252C600%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Europe%2520risks%2520%2527losing%2520its%2520lead%2527%2520in%2520sustainable%2520aviation%2520fuel%2520development%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainabilityonline.net%2Fnews%2Feurope-risks-losing-its-lead-in-sustainable-aviation-fuel-development,N,,2025-06-17 07:02:13.088780

Otto Aviation’s CEO, Paul Touw, has detailed how his company plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 with the design, certification and production of its clean-sheet business jet, the Phantom 3500.

During a briefing held at Paris Air Show on Tuesday 17 June, Touw explained that Otto’s breakthrough technology for its groundbreaking aircraft builds on the Celera 500 experimental aircraft and is based on unlocking the physics of laminar flow. Studied by NASA for over 60 years, Touw described laminar flow as “the holy grail of aerodynamics”.

First ultra-low drag aircraft to fly at transonic speed

First unveiled in 2023 the Phantom 3500’s ultra-low drag aircraft design leverages laminar flow to achieve a 35% reduction in viscous drag. Touw explained that “laminar flow keeps air moving smoothly along the aircraft’s surface, reducing resistance and improving aerodynamic efficiency. Lower drag lowers aircraft systems and weight and in turn exponentially lowers fuel burn and emissions.”

Following wind tunnel testing at Europe’s high-tech European Transonic (ETW) last year, which saw the company conduct over 30,000 trials, the company has validated performance metrics of its 87% laminar flow airfoil.

Touw explained that the Phantom 3500, which is expected to enter service in the 2030s, could cut fuel burn by over 60% when compared with competitive aircraft such as the Bombardier Challenger 3500. “On a 1,000nm trip the Phantom would burn 115 gallons of fuel while larger aircraft would burn 300 gallons” said Touw. The Phantom will also reduce emissions by more than 90 when combined with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)%.

Contrail reduction

Capable of flying at 51,000 ft and therefore avoiding jet streams, the aircraft will also reduce contrail formation by 90%. It will have a maximum range of 3,500nm and a maximum speed of 600+mph.

The mid-sized jet will feature a spacious 6.5 feet high cabin. Meanwhile, high-definition Super Natural Vision digital windows will replace traditional porthole-style windows along the fuselage, maintaining the aircraft’s streamlined design.

Powered by Williams International FJ44 engines, Touw highlighted that he hoped selecting already-certified engines would help to accelerate the certification process.”

First test flight aimed for 2027

While the first test flight is planned to take place in 2027, Touw aims to achieve certification in 2030 with around 1600 of the aircraft being produced between 2030 and 2040. Touw revealed that “around a third of that production is already accounted for and we hope to be making announcements on that in September.”

He anticipates an $18m price tag for the aircraft.

Earlier this week Otto also announced that it is relocating its production facility to Jacksonville, Florida. The move is supported by a $515 million incentive package from Florida state.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Otto-Aviation-Paul-Touw-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 06:02:31.743056

The new company, North Sky, will focus on producing approximately 40 million Nm³ of biogas annually - enough to meet the gas needs of around 20,000 Danish households.

It also plans to build on Skovgaard Energy’s existing biogas infrastructure while exploring the potential of e-SAF, an emerging sustainable aviation fuel made from carbon dioxide and green hydrogen.

This marks Sumitomo Corporation’s first foray into the biogas sector and forms a central part of its broader strategy to scale up its energy solutions business, one of the key pillars of its Medium-Term Management Plan.

Denmark, known for its agricultural output, is positioning biogas as a cornerstone of its transition to carbon neutrality. With a national target to fully replace fossil natural gas with biogas by 2030, the country is investing in infrastructure that utilises organic waste as renewable energy sources. Biogas plays a dual role: reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy self-sufficiency by relying on domestic raw materials.

Skovgaard Energy, founded in 1999, has a strong track record in renewable energy and already operates biogas facilities that process cattle manure. The company has also secured long-term feedstock supply agreements with Danish agricultural cooperatives, ensuring a steady input of raw materials through to 2032. It has also secured land suitable for Power-to-X projects, including the development of e-SAF.

By combining Sumitomo Corporation’s extensive European business network with Skovgaard Energy’s technical expertise and local partnerships, North Sky aims to become a key player in Denmark’s green energy transition.

Denmark’s near-total reliance on renewable electricity makes it well placed to produce green hydrogen, a key component in the synthesis of e-SAF. With its own network of biogas plants, the new joint venture will also be able to supply the necessary biomass-derived carbon dioxide efficiently and cost-effectively.

The collaboration aligns with the Sumitomo Corporation Group’s wider commitment to achieving carbon neutrality across its operations by 2050. The group is already active in other bioenergy projects globally, including the MORISORA Project in Japan for domestic SAF production, and a partnership with Malaysian firm reNIKOLA to explore biomethane opportunities in Southeast Asia.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/skorsgaard.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 06:02:42.202114

About Otto Otto Aviation is an advanced aerospace company committed to transforming private and regional aviation through innovative aircraft design.","PARIS, June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otto Aviation, a pioneering force in sustainable aviation, held a press briefing today at the Paris Air Show where CEO Paul Touw announced the company would achieve net-zero carbon emissions with its Phantom 3500 aircraft when it enters service around 2030 – two decades ahead of the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon goal.

The aviation industry has set a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal, adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and supported by organizations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aims to mitigate the industry's impact on climate change by balancing CO2 emissions with equivalent amounts sequestered or offset.

Touw’s remarks took the assembled journalists and industry leaders behind the scenes of Otto’s groundbreaking aircraft, the Phantom 3500, the first true aircraft of the sustainability era. With an AI-supported clean sheet design, transonic super-laminar flow architecture, and cutting-edge aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 is a lightweight, ultra-low-drag aircraft that burns 60 percent less fuel than similar-sized jets and reduces emissions by 90 percent when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Phantom 3500 is the result of relentless innovation and bold thinking,” said CEO Touw during his remarks. “By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations—Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation. It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

On the inside, the Phantom 3500 provides space for nine passengers and has a cabin height of 6 and a half feet. In place of traditional porthole-style windows along the fuselage, the Phantom 3500 includes high-definition digital displays called Super Natural Vision™, which provides passengers with views of the sky and scenery while also enjoying increased efficiency thanks to the streamlined design.

Otto Aviation plans to manufacture the Phantom 3500 at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, an announcement made yesterday at the Paris Air Show by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The company will invest approximately $430 million and move its headquarters to the city. Otto’s plan is to establish initial operations in an available hangar, then build a new plant to manufacture the Phantom 3500 on land at the airfield. The company plans to begin flight tests by early 2027, and aims to achieve certification and enter service in 2030.

The roadmap spans seven fuels—bioethanol, compressed biogas (CBG), biodiesel, bio-pellets, green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and bio-methanol—with a production target of 2.2 exajoules (EJ) by 2029-30. Bio-pellets and green hydrogen will dominate, with ethanol, biodiesel, and CBG also playing vital roles. While often derived from organic waste and considered sustainable, these fuels lose credibility when food crops are diverted, or land is repurposed—raising hard questions about food security, land use, and fairness.

The food-fuel-feed tradeoff is a concern. Meeting the 2025-26 ethanol target (10.16 billion litres) may require 275 million tonnes (MT) of sugarcane, 6.1 MT of maize, and 5.5 MT of rice—using up to seven million hectares of cropland. This diverts resources from food and poultry feed, threatening nutrition security and rural livelihoods.

Another aspect is subsidisation of fuel via food subsidy. In Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2024-25, 5.2 MT of rice from the Food Corporation of India was sold for ethanol production at Rs 22.5/kilogram (kg). This was well below the economic cost of producing a kg of rice at Rs 42. The price gap was absorbed through the national food subsidy. This raises concerns about the use of grains from public stocks for fuel, especially when surpluses are driven by minimum support price-linked bonuses.

There is also the impact on meal markets. Ethanol by-product Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles or DDGS is displacing soybean meal in animal feed, depressing soybean prices and discouraging domestic crushing. Despite surplus soybean, edible oil imports continue, undermining farmer incomes and India’s self-reliance goals.

And what of energy efficiency? Producing a kg of green hydrogen requires 60-70 kWh of power but yields only 33-37 kWh, raising concerns about efficiency and energy returns.

Biofuels can support India’s green transition—especially when waste-based. But using food crops or subsidies for fuel creates difficult trade-offs. Just as an EV powered by coal isn’t truly green, fuel at the cost of food security isn’t sustainable. A lifecycle- and equity-based approach is essential to ensure India’s biofuel future is truly fair and green.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-06-17%2Fnudmag3i%2FEthanol.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-06-17 08:06:46.720214

According to the EU’s own published fuel cost data, the average SAF price is around 2.8 times higher than conventional jet fuel.
Blending just 4.8% SAF and 1.2% RFNBO into the fuel mix raises total airline fuel costs by approximately 21%, which translates to an 8% increase in overall flight costs.
And it exemplifies a wider trend in EU policy—one where symbolic targets take precedence over system-wide efficiency and cost-benefit logic.
As it stands, ReFuelEU appears less like a climate win and more like a cautionary tale in how not to design sustainable policy.","When the European Commission quietly authored an aviation industry declaration on sustainable fuels, later sent to airline lobbyists for sign-off, it wasn’t just a bureaucratic misstep—it was a symptom of a deeper issue with the EU’s climate policy design. Behind the symbolic push for greener skies lies a regulation—ReFuelEU—that risks imposing real costs on businesses and travelers while delivering negligible climate benefits.

Under ReFuelEU, the EU mandates that by 2030, all flights departing from EU airports must use at least 6% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with 1.2% of that consisting of Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), such as hydrogen-derived e-kerosene. On paper, the policy aims to decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate sectors. In practice, the arithmetic paints a different picture.

According to the EU’s own published fuel cost data, the average SAF price is around 2.8 times higher than conventional jet fuel. RFNBOs—still in early development and production—come in at an eye-watering 11.5 times the cost. Blending just 4.8% SAF and 1.2% RFNBO into the fuel mix raises total airline fuel costs by approximately 21%, which translates to an 8% increase in overall flight costs. In a sector already wrestling with razor-thin margins and post-pandemic volatility, the mandate risks pricing out consumers while subsidizing inefficiency.

Critically, the environmental return on this regulatory investment is dismal. The 1.2% RFNBO blend would reduce EU emissions by an estimated 0.02%—a number so small it’s statistically negligible. And it gets worse. The renewable electricity used to produce e-kerosene could yield emissions reductions nine times higher if redirected to sectors like residential heating (via heat pumps), electric vehicles, or displacing coal in the power grid. In other words, the SAF mandate not only misallocates scarce green energy, it does so in a way that ultimately increases overall climate inefficiency.

While the ReFuelEU policy does not rely on direct subsidies, its costs are very real. They are embedded in consumer airfares and the operating costs of freight and business travel, feeding directly into inflation. At a time when the EU faces populist backlash over the cost of living, this kind of opaque climate policymaking—where high costs produce negligible results—undermines public trust and provides ammunition for political opponents of the energy transition.

The RFNBO quota in particular seems emblematic of what Michael Liebreich calls “badly-designed net zero policy”: expensive, ineffective, and politically convenient. It shifts wealth toward favored industrial players while failing to deliver meaningful environmental progress. And it exemplifies a wider trend in EU policy—one where symbolic targets take precedence over system-wide efficiency and cost-benefit logic.

However, this significant milestone still represents just 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption, highlighting the substantial journey ahead for complete aviation decarbonisation and the massive scale required for meaningful environmental impact.

SAF costs approximately five times more than conventional jet fuel due to complex production processes and limited availability of sustainable raw materials. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates minimum 2% SAF supply in Europe starting 2025, progressively increasing to 70% by 2050, with sub-mandates for synthetic e-fuels beginning at 0.7% in 2030. Airlines face additional US$4.4 billion in global fuel costs, with European carriers potentially spending an extra US$1.7 billion for regulatory compliance, raising concerns about cost pass-through to passengers.

Despite implementation challenges and elevated costs, industry leaders maintain optimism about SAF’s long-term potential for aviation transformation. SAF could contribute approximately 65% of emission reductions needed for aviation’s ambitious 2050 net-zero target, requiring massive production increases primarily in the 2030s when policy support becomes global and SAF achieves cost parity with fossil kerosene. Current production predominantly utilises the HEFA method using cooking oils and animal fats, but diversification into Alcohol-to-Jet and Fischer-Tropsch processes using biological and agricultural wastes could significantly boost volumes.

To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, IATA estimates between 3,000 to 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be required globally, demanding annual investment of US$128 billion over thirty years. Co-processing existing refineries with renewable feedstocks could save US$347 billion in capital expenditure by 2050.

Australia’s private aviation sector increasingly embraces SAF adoption for charter flights operations. Industry leaders advocate for government support through production incentives rather than punitive mandates that raise operational costs. Book-and-claim systems allow Australian charter operators to access SAF credits globally whilst local infrastructure develops, supporting environmental commitments without operational disruption.

Conclusion Safran and Saft's collaboration is a masterclass in strategic alignment, combining technological prowess with regulatory know-how to tackle aviation's toughest challenges.","The aviation industry's race to decarbonize is intensifying, and Safran and Saft—two French powerhouses in aerospace and battery technology—are positioning themselves to lead the charge. Their collaboration to develop an 800V high-voltage battery system for hybrid and fully electric aircraft represents a critical milestone in aviation electrification. By combining Safran's expertise in aircraft systems integration with Saft's cutting-edge battery chemistry, the partnership aims to redefine sustainable aviation while capturing market share in a sector projected to grow exponentially.

A Strategic Play for Technological Leadership

The aviation industry faces a dual challenge: reducing emissions while maintaining the performance and safety standards demanded by regulators and passengers. Electrification is the clear path forward, but progress has been hampered by battery limitations in energy density, safety, and scalability. Safran and Saft's partnership addresses these pain points head-on. Their modular 800V battery system, initially using lithium manganese ferro phosphate (LMFP) chemistry, is designed to be adaptable to aircraft ranging from 9-seat commuter planes to narrowbody jets like future A320 variants. This scalability is a game-changer, as it allows the system to serve both hybrid and fully electric architectures, appealing to manufacturers of all sizes.

The partnership's roadmap, however, is even more ambitious. By 2029, they aim to transition to solid-state batteries—a leap that could double energy density and enhance safety by eliminating flammable liquid electrolytes. Solid-state technology, already being pursued by automotive giants like Toyota and CATL, is still in its infancy for aviation. Safran and Saft's goal to flight-test their system by 2029—reaching Technology Readiness Level 6—could put them years ahead of competitors. This timeline aligns with broader industry trends: .

Safety and Certification: The Critical Edge

Aviation's stringent safety standards make certification a major barrier for new technologies. Here, Safran's decades of experience in thermal management and system integration are invaluable. The battery's advanced thermal runaway containment and proprietary safety algorithms are engineered to meet the rigorous requirements of CS-25-category aircraft—the regulatory class covering large commercial planes. This expertise, combined with Saft's leadership in battery chemistry, reduces the risk of costly delays.

The collaboration also benefits from French government support through the DGAC-funded aviation battery consortium, ensuring alignment with certification bodies. This institutional backing underscores the project's strategic importance for Europe's green aviation goals, potentially unlocking public-private funding streams.

Market Opportunity and Catalysts for Growth

The electric aircraft market is nascent but rapidly expanding. Regional and commuter airlines are early adopters, but the real prize is the $500 billion market for narrowbody and single-aisle jets. Safran and Saft's modular system positions them to dominate both tiers. Their ability to scale from 9 to 100+ seats without redesigning the core battery architecture gives them a cost and time-to-market advantage over rivals like Siemens or MagniX, which focus on smaller segments.

The 2029 flight-test milestone is a pivotal catalyst. Success here would validate the system's readiness for commercialization, attracting aircraft manufacturers like Airbus or Embraer to partner on development programs. Meanwhile, the transition to solid-state batteries post-2029 could solidify their leadership as energy density improves, enabling longer ranges and larger aircraft.

Risks and Investment Considerations

Investors should weigh the risks. Competitors in battery tech—such as CATL's aviation division or Tesla's rumored forays into aerospace—are formidable. Delays in certification or solid-state technology development could erode margins. Additionally, geopolitical tensions over battery raw materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt) pose supply chain challenges.

However, the partnership's near-term focus on LMFP-based systems mitigates some of these risks. LMFP is proven, cost-effective, and aligns with existing supply chains. By targeting hybrid-electric regional aircraft first, Safran and Saft can generate revenue and data while scaling up toward solid-state adoption.

The Investment Thesis

Safran's stock () has historically been a stable play on aerospace recovery, but its battery venture offers a secular growth catalyst. The partnership's 2029 milestone, if achieved, could accelerate adoption of their systems by manufacturers, driving recurring revenue streams from battery sales, servicing, and upgrades.

For investors, this is a “buy the dip” opportunity in a sector poised for long-term growth. Safran's valuation currently trades at 15x forward earnings—below its 5-year average—despite its electrification tailwinds. Meanwhile, Saft's parent, TotalEnergies (TTE.F), has been divesting fossil fuel assets to fund green initiatives, suggesting sustained investment in the venture.

Conclusion

Safran and Saft's collaboration is a masterclass in strategic alignment, combining technological prowess with regulatory know-how to tackle aviation's toughest challenges. Their roadmap—LMFP now, solid-state later—positions them as pioneers in a $2 trillion electrification market. For investors, backing this partnership means betting on a future where sustainable flight isn't just possible but profitable. The 2029 flight test will be a litmus test, but the groundwork is already laid for leadership in the skies of tomorrow.

Without urgent action, Europe risks losing its pioneering position in e-kerosene, a critical technology to drastically cut aviation emissions and lead the transition to sustainable air travel.","A new Transport & Environment (T&E) study warns that Europe could lose its first-mover advantage in producing e-kerosene, the most scalable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Europe leads in announcements but lags in implementation

T&E’s analysis reveals that Europe holds more than half of the world’s announced e-kerosene production capacity, with around 40 large-scale projects planned that could produce close to 3 million tonnes annually — about 5% of the fuel needed by Europe’s aviation sector. This fuel could reduce aviation CO? emissions by up to 90%, making it vital for decarbonizing the emission-intensive industry.

However, despite this leadership in announced projects, none are yet under construction. Only four projects are at an advanced stage, and no final investment decisions (FID) have been made. The biggest barriers are financing challenges, high energy costs, infrastructure issues, CO? sourcing difficulties, and the notable absence of major oil companies, which continue to invest heavily in fossil fuels rather than e-kerosene.

Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential. Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

Global competition and calls for stronger EU support

While Europe currently leads, other regions are gaining ground. China hosts about 10 large-scale projects, accounting for roughly 20% of global capacity. The United States is accelerating as well, with the first large-scale plant FID recently secured by US startups.

Funding bottlenecks and oil majors are hampering progress

T&E calls on EU leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the existing ReFuelEU targets ahead of the 2027 legislative review and to prioritize e-kerosene in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). The organization also recommends establishing a European market intermediary with a double-sided auction mechanism to solve current financing bottlenecks.

""We're kind of the leader of developing it as a winter crop,"" said Ott.

Farmers across the state are piloting the product right now. Some tell us they use it as a cover crop and love that they can grow a second crop on the same land during the same season.

""Soybean can be planted directly in the camelina. They grow together just for a few weeks, and the camelina pods can be harvested over the top of the soybean seedlings,"" said Ott.

The results provide critical insights for aerospace leaders transitioning to sustainable, low-emission fuels, while ensuring safety and reliability.

As the aerospace industry focuses on decarbonization, SAFs offer substantial CO2 reductions of over 65% compared to traditional jet fuels. Nevertheless, challenges like seal compatibility remain. To address this, Greene Tweed conducted rigorous testing to ensure its seals perform effectively with these advanced fuels.

""Sustainable aviation fuels offer a practical path to reducing emissions, particularly for long-haul flights, where batteries and hydrogen remain less feasible,” said Shawn McCloskey, Greene Tweed Chief Commercial Officer. “Our study ensures aerospace customers have reliable seal solutions for SAF adoption without compromising safety or performance.”

Greene Tweed collaborated with multiple suppliers to evaluate SAF blends and their effects on the physical properties of fluorine-based elastomers FKM and FVMQ. The study assessed performance in SAF blends, including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), following ASTM D7566 standards. Testing simulated extreme aerospace environments, including temperatures up to 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure.

Key findings from the study include:

Consistent Performance: FKM compounds (731, 772, 665) maintained performance across blends, including three SPKs, 50/50 blends with control fluid, and 20% SAK with 80% SPKs.

Material Properties: FKM elastomers showed strong compatibility with harsh SAF conditions, including fluid aging and dry-out scenarios.

Aromatic Content Impact: Aromatic content in SAF formulations, particularly SAK blends, is critical for maintaining material performance.

Advanced Testing Protocols: Testing under accelerated aging conditions confirmed long-term reliability.

“By analyzing the effects of chemical interactions between SAF blends and advanced elastomers, we have developed a robust data set that established long-term reliability and compatibility in extreme aerospace conditions,” noted Ronald Campbell, PhD, Senior Technical Advisor.

As the aviation industry works toward carbon-neutral growth, with U.S. airlines targeting a 50% CO2 reduction by 2050, SAFs are vital. Greene Tweed’s findings support these goals, ensuring component compatibility with SAF while maintaining safety and operational performance. These results were highlighted in a recent Aviation Week webinar, where Greene Tweed detailed its testing process. Representatives will also discuss these solutions at the Paris Air Show 2025.

This summer, Delta Air Lines is making it easier for commercial fliers to get to hard-to-reach destinations like these with the option to connect international Delta flights to “last leg” jet charters via Wheels Up, a private aviation company (of which Delta is a major shareholder).

Here's how it works. If you purchase a flight in Delta One, the airline's business class cabin, to Athens, Barcelona, Naples, Nice, or Rome this summer, you'll receive an email or mobile app prompt notifying you of the ability to book your onward travel plans—perhaps to St. Tropez, the Amalfi Coast, Mykonos, or Ibiza—through Wheels Up. Click from there and you'll be directed to the Wheels Up website, where you can charter a private aircraft for the final leg of your journey.

A real-life itinerary includes a Delta One flight between New York-JFK and London Heathrow, followed by a charter plane from Farnborough Airport to Toulon Hyères Airport in France, ending with a helicopter ride or car transfer to St. Tropez. Between each leg, Wheels Up arranges a private transfer service that can pick you up directly from the tarmac, when permitted.

While the details—and pricing—will vary depending on the trip, the whole idea is to get you as close to your final destination in as little amount of time as possible. Thanks to its 2022 acquisition of the UK-based private aviation company Air Partner, Wheels Up's charter business now has access to 7,000 aircraft around the world, including seaplanes, helicopters, and private jets of varying sizes, such as the Bombardier Challenger 300 jet and Embraer Phenom 300 (both can seat up to 9 passengers). The vast network means both the aircraft type and destinations are incredibly customizable.

“Delta has a huge global network, they fly to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of airports,” George Mattson, CEO of Wheels Up and former member of Delta's Board of Directors, tells Condé Nast Traveler. “But if you connect it now to Wheels Up, it's every airport—it's infinite.”

For travelers concerned about the environmental impact of private jet travel, Wheels Up customers have the option to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through Delta’s SAF program, something that is not typically available to private fliers due to the fuel’s limited availability. (In 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it’s not yet widely available at the majority of airports.)

The integration between the Delta and Wheels Up also includes loyalty program incentives: Wheels Up Members who spend $100,000 over a one-year period receive Diamond Medallion Status with Delta, and Delta SkyMiles members with Diamond or Platinum Medallion status can select a Wheels Up private flight credit as one of their annual Choice Benefits (Diamond members receive a $2,000 credit, while Platinum members receive a $1,500 credit).

Greenwashing is when companies use deceptive claims to convince the public that their products or operations are environmentally friendly.","The European aviation industry is awash with misleading climate-related claims, consumer groups said Tuesday, over a year after the EU launched a probe into airlines' greenwashing.

An analysis of 17 air carriers found many misled passengers by suggesting that flying was more eco-friendly than it really is -- a breach of EU rules -- pan-European consumers organisation BEUC said.

""Travellers are lulled into believing they are choosing a sustainable transportation rather than a highly polluting one,"" said BEUC director general Agustin Reyna.

Aviation accounts for up to four percent of all the European Union's greenhouse gas emissions, according to Brussels.

In 2023 BEUC filed a complaint with the European Commission, accusing European airlines of greenwashing and unfair commercial practices for inflating their green credentials.

A year later, the commission opened a probe, which is still ongoing, into 20 firms over misleading green claims.

In a report published to coincide with the Paris Air Show, a major trade fair, BEUC said Tuesday that little has since changed.

Some of the airlines analysed have removed or amended their climate-related marketing claims.

Norwegian airlines for example removed all climate-related claims during the booking process and Wizz Air similarly did away with an option touted as offsetting carbon emissions.

But other changes have often been light, such as the choice of words or colour codes.

""These improvements should not hide that greenwashing is still widespread,"" said Reyna.

Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry association, said it did not have any comment beyond what it said last year.

After the EU probe was launched, the group said it recognised the importance of clear, transparent information about sustainability -- and it was engaging in discussions with EU bodies to that end.

BEUC Tuesday said that many of the companies analysed, which included Air France and Lufthansa, still offered ""green"" fares, charging passengers more to purchase carbon credits or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Yet, the former did little to offset a flight's climate impact, and the latter were not widely available.

EU rules currently require carriers to include only two percent of SAF in their fuel mix.

Airlines also often oversold their long-term sustainability goals, BEUC said.

Greenwashing is when companies use deceptive claims to convince the public that their products or operations are environmentally friendly.

The New Rise Reno facility initially produced renewable diesel but was later converted to SAF production.

New Rise Renewables in April 2024 announced that work was underway to convert its existing renewable diesel plant located near Reno, Nevada, to SAF production. The 3,200 barrel per day (49.06 MMgy) renewable diesel plant originally began operations in mid-2022.

Development of the facility was supported by loan guarantee awarded through the USDA’s 9003, Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical and Biodiesel Production Manufacturing Assistance Program, according to Greater Commercial Lending, which helped assemble the loan package that made the project possible. According to a 2017 USDA announcement, the facility at that time was being developed under the name Ryze Renewables Reno LLC.

The plant was the subject of at least two acquisition agreements that were eventually cancelled before XCF completed the acquisition of the facility earlier this year.

The bill, AB 839, was initially introduced in February. Following its passage in the Assembly, the bill was transferred to the California Senate, where it is currently under review by the Committee on Environmental Quality and the Committee on Judiciary.

If signed into law, the legislation would provide for expedited California Environmental Quality Act review for up to three SAF projects that do not use fossil fuels in the production process and meet specified environmental and labor requirements.

CEQA, signed into law in 1970, established statewide regulations for the environmental review of discretionary projects and a process for mitigating or avoiding potential environmental impacts. The review process aims to inform the public, local agencies and decision makers about the potential environmental impacts associated with certain planning approvals.

Separate bills signed into law in 2021 and 2023 allow the California Governors Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation to certify eligible infrastructure projects to benefit from expedited judicial review of lawsuits challenging the projects under CEQA. According to the office, the certification can reduce lawsuit-related delays from 3-5 years to approximately 270 days. Certified projects may also have improved access to financing and be more competitive for federal funding. AB 839 would allow up to three SAF projects to qualify for this expedited judicial review as “infrastructure projects.”

The bill defines SAF projects to include projects to manufacture, process, store, distribute or transport SAF or feedstock used for the production of SAF. If the project involves the conversion or replacement of an existing major source of air pollution, such as a refinery, the project must reduce emissions of air pollutants compared to the baseline environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project. Projects that do not involve the conversion or replacement of an existing major source of air pollution must not cause a significant effect on the environment attributable to any air pollutant.

Through direct meetings with senators, representatives and congressional staff, members from GBTA’s 38 U.S. chapters shared insights and championed policies to advance business travel’s impact as an economic driver and to create a more connected and resilient travel ecosystem.

Held June 10-12, the summit provided industry professionals with the opportunity to network, learn and engage directly with legislators to underscore the value of business travel in the U.S. economy. GBTA also advocated for streamlined international travel, including policies that enhance the traveler experience and restore confidence in U.S. entry processes. GBTA participants also discussed the need to modernize the U.S. air traffic system, support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and improve passenger rail to provide viable travel alternatives.

“For more than two decades, GBTA has hosted legislative fly-ins to connect business travel experts with U.S. policymakers to foster understanding, advocate for priority issues and facilitate a better experience for business travelers,” said Suzanne Neufang, CEO, GBTA. “By promoting the strategic role of business travel in driving economies, innovation, jobs and strategic collaboration, we foster a more resilient future for business travelers and those who support them.”

Summit attendees heard perspectives directly from members of Congress, including Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada) and Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington), as well as from various experts on critical topics, including air traffic system modernization, the evolution of SAF and improving U.S. passenger rail travel.

In close to 150 meetings with legislators, attendees shared GBTA’s policy priorities for U.S. business travel. Based on these priorities, GBTA constituents asked legislators to:

Support the modernization of the air traffic system

Improve business travel at U.S. borders

Support funding for the hiring of 5,000 additional Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers

Reject efforts to extend the diversion of the 9/11 Passenger Security Fee

Support additional resources for CBP’s implementation of the Entry and Exit Program in order to accelerate the safe facilitation of business travelers at the nation’s points of entry

Support the inclusion of the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031

Support future funding for U.S. rail improvements

Summit attendees also shared with Congressional members key takeaways from the “GBTA U.S. Economic Impact Study: Business Travel’s Impact on Jobs and the U.S. Economy” outlining how U.S. business travel contributes $484.4 billion annually, or 1.9% of the U.S. gross domestic product. They also showcased GBTA’s recent poll results reflecting industry concern about the potential negative impact of U.S. government actions on business travel.

GBTA presented Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) as the 2025 recipients of its GBTA Navigator Award. The award is presented to elected officials who have been strong advocates for issues integral to the business travel industry and recognizes them for championing the needs of business travelers and the broader travel sector.

Rep. Larsen is the Ranking Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and in his role, he has advocated for safety and efficiency for aviation. Last year, he worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the Federal Aviation Administration Re-Authorization Bill, which included several GBTA-supported priorities such as safety improvements to the National Airspace System, studies to improve accessibility concerns and workforce investments to train more pilots and air traffic controllers. This year, Rep. Larsen has worked with the Department of Transportation to make improvements to our nation’s air traffic control system, strategically enhance the workforce for long-term success, and foster innovation to improve aviation safety.

Sen. Moran has championed increasing the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Late last year, he formed the bipartisan SAF Caucus to find ways to promote technologically innovative solutions to create a sustainable aviation industry and increase U.S. competitiveness in the domestic production of SAF. Sen. Moran is actively involved in promoting aviation safety through legislative efforts and oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

On Friday, India’s civil aviation minister confirmed that the aircraft’s black boxes had been found at the crash site.
Scheibner said: “This puts the dual-engine failure theory in first place.
“It must be said that the 787 Dreamliner has a very good safety record.
It had a very long certification period with the FAA.” Boeing has not had the best safety track record of late.","Early speculations on the fatal crash in India last week of the Air India-operated Boeing 787 Dreamliner point to possible dual-engine failure.

On Thursday (12 June), the aeroplane crashed into a residential area shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick.

Of the 242 passengers and crew onboard only one person survived, and an additional 38 fatalities occurred on the ground. This makes it the deadliest aviation disaster in India in nearly two decades.

On Friday, India’s civil aviation minister confirmed that the aircraft’s black boxes had been found at the crash site. Flight data, including all the cockpit conversations, will be crucial in determining the cause of the crash.

While the facts around the crash will only be known once a full analysis of this data is complete, there has been some speculation as to the possible cause of the crash.

For instance, Captain Steve Scheibner, a former US Navy pilot, told US broadcaster CNBC that, having scrutinised video footage of the flight, he could see what looked to be the deployment of the ram air turbine (RAT), which activates automatically in the event of a massive electrical, hydraulic or dual-engine failure.

Scheibner said: “This puts the dual-engine failure theory in first place. But we’re still at square one. We don’t know why both engines on a 787 flamed out after take-off. It’s a real head-scratcher.”

However, the crash may not be the result of a single factor.

Ali Elham, professor of multidisciplinary design optimisation in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the University of Southampton, told The Conversation that often these sorts of crashes involved a “chain of problems”.

According to The Times of India, a team of officials from Boeing and the FAA have arrived on site to assist in the inquiry, which is being led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.

As these organisations work together to establish the facts around the crash, no doubt questions will be raised about Boeing's safety record, albeit this is the first fatal crash of a Dreamliner.

Elham said: “Unless investigators identify a recurring technical problem that poses an immediate risk to other 787s, a fleet-wide grounding would be unlikely. Safety is always the top priority, but regulatory responses typically depend on whether an issue appears to be isolated or part of a broader pattern.

“It must be said that the 787 Dreamliner has a very good safety record. It had a very long certification period with the FAA.”

Boeing has not had the best safety track record of late. In 2020, the US-based aircraft manufacturer saw the grounding of its 737 Max planes following two fatal crashes caused by faulty flight control systems.

There have also been incidents of engine parts falling off soon after take-off in 2021 and again in April 2024 .

In January 2024, an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 suffered a mid-flight blowout of a plug filling an unused emergency exit, causing rapid decompression of the aircraft.

ADR’s latest Call4Startups initiative in 2024 attracted significant global interest, with 389 applications and 716 project proposals. The response was truly international, with 40% coming from Italian startups and 60% from companies worldwide.

Through its innovation acceleration program, ADR has been partnering with promising startups to deliver tangible business results across four key areas:

Enhancing Operational Efficiency: “We tested with SeeTrue, a revolutionary AI-powered security screening solution that transforms threat detection capabilities. By integrating seamlessly with existing X-ray and CT scanning systems, SeeTrue enhances airport security with unprecedented accuracy while reducing human error and increasing screening efficiency.”

Improving Customer Experience: “Our collaboration with Outsight brought groundbreaking LiDAR-based technology to people flow monitoring. This advanced spatial intelligence solution tracks and analyses human movement patterns in real-time, enabling airports to optimise space utilisation, improve crowd management, and enhance security protocols for more efficient operations.”

Boosting Commercial Performance: “We selected Aindo to develop sophisticated predictive models using synthetic data. These models forecast how external factors – such as passenger flow changes, route adjustments, or extraordinary events – impact retail and food & beverage sales within airport environments.”

Advancing Sustainability Goals: “Our support for FlyOro focused on conducting a comprehensive feasibility study for establishing blending stations that combine Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) with conventional JetA1 fuel. This initiative specifically targets crucial endpoints in the aviation fuel supply chain, with Rome Airport as a key focus.”

The report shows Trafalgar achieved seven of its sustainability goals while working to address overtourism, carbon emissions and more.

The brand, part of The Travel Corporation, reports that 85% of its itineraries now include at least one local dining experience. These experiences support local agriculture and businesses through initiatives such as Be My Guest experiences, where travelers dine with local families. Examples include lunch with a tea plantation farmer's family in Japan's Nara area and visits to a 17th-century goat cheese farm in France.

""As travelers return in greater numbers, the conversation must shift from growth to balance, a change we have been advocating for at The Travel Corporation,"" said Shannon Guihan, chief sustainability officer for The Travel Corporation and Head of its TreadRight Foundation. ""That is why, across our brands, we are taking meaningful steps to reduce pressure on overcrowded destinations and to ensure our trips bring benefit, not burden.""

Trafalgar made progress toward its 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target. The Travel Corporation reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 23% and Scope 3 emissions by 20%, from a 2019 baseline year. The company invested $353,307 in decarbonization projects through its Carbon Fund in 2024, bringing total investments to more than $2.23 million since 2023.

RELATED: How Ensemble Hospitality Is Committed to Sustainability

The company also reports that 98% of Trafalgar itineraries include at least one Make Travel Matter experience. These experiences are designed to advance United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and provide social or environmental benefits to destinations and communities. Examples include visits to an organic vineyard in Portugal and conservation education at Scotland's Dundreggan Rewilding Centre.

""What we need is a systemic approach, and so, I'd like to be clear: We support destination-led approaches,” Guihan said. “We believe that thoughtful, community-informed policies are essential to preserving the very qualities that draw travelers in the first place.”

The 2024 Impact Report tracks progress across The Travel Corporation's 18 brands against 11 measurable goals outlined in its How We Tread Right sustainability strategy. The company launched a Partner Sustainability Hub in 2024 to provide guidance and tools for supply chain partners.

""I understand the value that tourism can bring to communities when managed in partnership with key stakeholders,” Guihan said. “Ultimately, tourism shouldn't happen to a community; it should happen with them. And so, we not only welcome collaboration with governments, destination management organizations and local leaders to build smart frameworks that ensure tourism delivers real value, limits harm and supports communities, we are seeking it out. If the past few years have taught us anything, it's that tourism must evolve proactively, transparently and together.""",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TAW/uploadedImages/Content-Travel_Types/Tour_Ops/Features/TrafalgarImpactReport.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-06-16 17:03:16.884714

The A220 will begin replacing LOT’s existing regional jets starting in 2027.

LOT’s adoption of the A220 Family, known for its low fuel burn and noise footprint, marks a key step in modernizing its fleet.

The A220’s range of up to 3,600 nm enables LOT to open new intra-European and medium-haul routes from Warsaw Chopin Airport (WAW), supporting its strategic growth plan.

Technology, Efficiency, and Sustainability at the Core

All aircraft ordered—A350F, A350-1000, A320neo, A321XLR, and A220—are optimized for reduced fuel consumption and emissions.

Airbus’ entire portfolio is certified to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a goal of 100% SAF compatibility by 2030.

The company cites increasing jet fuel demand and decreasing gasoline demand as the reason for the project.

Carbon sequestration is key to producing low-carbon jet fuel and increasing profitability.

Gevo is also considering expanding the ethanol plant and adding wind turbines.

WEST FARGO, N.D. — The demand for jet fuel is going up. The demand for gasoline is going down.

That’s the simple explanation from Chris Ryan, the president and chief operating officer of Gevo, on why the company plans to add a sustainable aviation fuel plant to the corn-based ethanol plant it purchased at Richardton in southwest North Dakota.

Ryan said the low-carbon jet fuel won’t come cheap – throwing out a ballpark figure of $500 million for a potential project still years down the road.

Ryan spoke Tuesday in Fargo at the Midwest Agriculture Summit hosted by The Chamber of Fargo, Moorhead and West Fargo.

Colorado-based Gevo bought the Red Trail Energy ethanol plant at Richardton last year.

The Red Trail plant was the first ethanol producer in the country to implement carbon sequestration — capturing carbon dioxide from the plant’s corn fermentation tanks and pumping it into permanent underground storage.

The CO2 sequestration is key in lowering the carbon intensity score of the plant and for sustainable jet fuel production. Low-carbon fuels can fetch a higher price than traditional liquid fuels.

“We could make gasoline, but it’s a diminishing market,” Ryan said. “So jet fuel is a kind of sexy thing to talk about these days.”

In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Ryan said there is plenty of room to add a jet fuel plant at the 500-acre Richardton site. He said the plant would add about 50 jobs, about the same number that the ethanol plant employs.

Expanding the ethanol plant also is a possibility, Ryan said.

The company also is considering adding wind turbines at Richardton to provide power and lower the carbon score even further, he said. Even though renewable energy tax credits are a possible target for budget cuts under President Donald Trump, he said wind energy at the site still makes good economic sense.

Gevo also has plans for a sustainable aviation fuel plant at Lake Preston in southeast South Dakota.

The future of that plant depends in large part on the five-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project that would take carbon emissions from ethanol plants to western North Dakota for underground storage.

Ryan said when the South Dakota project was conceived, it did not include carbon capture. But as construction costs soared with the COVID-19 pandemic, he said it became necessary to sign on to the Summit pipeline project. He said the federal tax credits for carbon sequestration would help offset the higher building costs.

The project has stalled as Summit has run into permitting challenges and a new state law giving landowners more power in easement negotiations.

“We really need the pipeline,” Ryan said.

He added that Gevo bought more land than it needed for the project. That is allowing for other projects at the site, benefiting Gevo and the Lake Preston area, he said.

The Summit delays spurred the purchase of Red Trail, which had the advantage of sitting almost on top of an area suitable for underground carbon storage.

“We had to take our destiny into our own hands,” Ryan said, and not be dependent on the Summit pipeline.

He said Gevo can “copy and paste” the engineering work done for the South Dakota site to the Richardton site.

While the carbon dioxide from the Richardton plant is being pumped underground, Ryan said Gevo recognizes that it has a potential for use in North Dakota’s oilfields, making oil wells more productive through what is called enhanced oil recovery.

North Dakota leaders have been trumpeting the economic benefits of enhanced oil recovery.

Ryan said if the oil industry is willing to pay for carbon dioxide to use in enhanced oil recovery, Gevo would sell the CO2 rather than pump it underground.

“We don’t care where the revenue comes from, right? Today, we sequester it for a tax credit, and we can sell carbon credits,” Ryan said. “Or you can sell it to somebody for enhanced oil recovery.”

He said he sees it as another advantage of doing business in North Dakota.

“People in North Dakota get that, they understand the value of that,” Ryan said.

A new initiative aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from domestically grown canola, potentially transforming both the energy and agriculture sectors, reports ACB.Net.

Aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions and is among the hardest industries to decarbonise. The growing global demand for SAF is now positioning Australian-grown canola—long valued for its oil and pretty yellow flowers—as a potential solution.

Currently, most Australian canola is exported to Europe, where it is processed into biofuel. Now, a local plan led by fuel company Ampol, agribusiness GrainCorp, and investment firm IFM Investors is exploring how to refine canola oil within Australia for use in aviation.

GrainCorp is planning a new canola crushing facility capable of processing 1 million tonnes of canola each year—almost double the capacity of its existing plant in Numurkah, Victoria. Although a site hasn’t been finalized, options include Western Australia and New South Wales. The by-product, canola meal, would be used for livestock feed, while the oil would be transported to Ampol’s Brisbane refinery to be converted into renewable diesel and SAF.

Brent Merrick from Ampol described the project as a major opportunity, with engineering already underway and a target production date around 2030. “This is a rare chance to make a real change in how Australia produces and uses energy,” he said.

However, the companies involved say they’ll need government support to get the SAF sector off the ground. Don Campbell from GrainCorp said that while SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel, financial assistance could help bridge the gap.

“We’re still figuring out how much support we need,” said Campbell, adding that temporary subsidies, start-up funding, and government mandates for airlines to use SAF could all be part of the package.

Australian airlines are already showing interest. Qantas recently imported nearly 2 million litres of SAF from Malaysia—enough to power about 900 Sydney-to-Auckland flights once blended.

The federal government has committed over $30 million toward building an SAF industry in Australia, including $8 million for Ampol and $6 million for GrainCorp. In addition, a $250 million fund has been announced to accelerate local low-carbon liquid fuel production.

Speaking at a GrainCorp facility, Transport Minister Catherine King emphasized the importance of keeping value-added production within Australia. “It doesn’t make sense to keep sending our feedstock overseas to make low-carbon fuels,” she said. “We should be doing this here—for our farmers, our manufacturing sector, and the broader economy.”

The national science agency CSIRO estimates that a domestic SAF industry could contribute up to $12 billion annually to the Australian economy. GrainGrowers spokesperson Zach Whale said regional areas would benefit the most, with added fuel security and more market options for farmers.

“We don’t expect farmers to abandon other crops, but canola could see stronger domestic demand and better prices,” Whale noted.

CSIRO scientist Dr. Cathryn O’Sullivan highlighted the importance of sustainability checks to ensure food systems aren’t negatively affected. “This isn’t a roadblock, but we do need strong measures to balance food production and fuel use,” she said.

Canola, she added, is a good example of a dual-purpose crop: its oil can be used for either food or fuel, and the remaining meal supports the livestock industry.

Whale agreed, stressing the dual benefits: “It’s not about choosing between food and fuel—it’s about producing both.”

This year, Australian grain growers are expected to harvest 5.7 million tonnes of canola from 3.4 million hectares, indicating that the crop’s future could be as prominent in energy as it is in agriculture.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-06-16 15:04:45.802515

The so-called Le Bourget Declaration backs the Commission’s targets for increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which are included in the ReFuelEU legislation, starkly contrasting with the recent request from major European airlines to delay.

It is set to be presented to Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas during the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport, which starts on Monday.

“This didn’t come from us; this came from DG MOVE,” a lobby representative told POLITICO, speaking on condition of anonymity. DG MOVE is the Commission’s department for mobility and transport.

“A couple of weeks ago, DG MOVE contacted us and said, ‘We want you to sign this and give it to the Commissioner,’” the lobbyist said. “Officially, it’s our initiative, but unofficially it came from the Commission, which is highly unusual.”

The Commission did not respond to a request for comment.

Other lobbyists confirmed they received the document from DG MOVE weeks ago. They responded by asking that the draft be integrated with actual industry requests, such as introducing a tradability system for SAF called book-and-claim, which the Commission has so far opposed.

A draft of the document, seen by POLITICO, includes this request.

“Now it’s basically a Frankenstein that carries all sorts of different messages,” said another lobbyist.

“In the end, it’s probably not going to achieve anything because the main message has been diluted,” the sector representative added.

The industry paper of dubious origin recommends various “calls for immediate action” to be included in the upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, which Tzitzikostas will announce later this year.

According to an airline representative, the Commission’s efforts to influence the message of the aviation industry are an attempt to repair the communication damage inflicted on ReFuelEU — the EU’s flagship legislation to decarbonize aviation — at the Airlines for Europe summit in late March.

On that occasion, the CEOs of major airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Ryanair and British Airways’ parent company, IAG, called for a delay in what they called “not realistic” mandates aimed at increasing the role of SAF — which is currently mainly made from used cooking oil — in the jet fuel mix.

The first SAF mandate to include at least 2 percent SAF in the jet fuel mix sold to airlines took effect on Jan. 1. But airlines are complaining that they are paying twice the expected price as suppliers are charging them additional “compliance fees” in addition to SAF, which already costs three times the price of fossil kerosene.

In 2030, fuel suppliers will be requested to provide jet fuel that is at least 6 percent SAF, including 1.2 percent of synthetic e-SAF made from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2. No final investment decisions have been made on any e-SAF projects in Europe.

“The Commissioner doesn’t want to replicate the disaster of the automotive sector,” said the carrier lobbyist, referring to the ban on selling new gas and diesel vehicles from 2035, a measure openly opposed by many in the car industry. “He wants to ensure that airlines continue to support the measures adopted” with regard to aviation.

The declaration proposes several actions, including the joint creation of a revenue certainty instrument by the Commission and member countries to overcome the mismatch between the long-term production and short-term use of e-SAF.

This mechanism could take the form of contracts for difference, demand aggregation mechanisms, or double-sided auctions, and it should be operational by the end of 2026 to reduce the risk of investing in e-SAF.

Another recommendation is to introduce targeted simplification measures for early movers and small-to-medium businesses investing in SAF to reduce the administrative burden.

Representatives from the lobby groups who received the document told POLITICO they intend to sign it.

Ely’s team focused, in particular, in bringing down the cost of green hydrogen production.
Green hydrogen costs maybe four or five times as much as hydrogen created from fossil fuels,” says Ely.
The pair generated the idea for the company during their long commute while working as colleagues at a West Sussex-based firm developing clean energy technology.
“The standard way of making green ammonia is making hydrogen, then feeding it into a Haber-Bosch reactor, combining it there and then creating green hydrogen.","While there is no shortage of investment in alternative energy sources like hydrogen, sustainable batteries, ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel — about twice as much will be invested in these fields this year as well as into fossil fuel-related developments according to projections by the International Energy Agency. But bringing costs down has been a key hurdle.

A number of startups, backed by SETsquared, a UK enterprise partnership and collaboration between six leading research-led UK universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey, are making progress in tackling the cost problem. They are among the 14 startups that will be exhibiting at the GCV Symposium in London this week.

Avena Fuels

Founded: 2024

Located: Shannon, Ireland

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

Mark Currass (pictured left), CEO and director of Avena Fuels, came up with the idea for the sustainable aviation fuel startup while discussing some of the challenges of traditional fuel refineries with friends at Shannon Airport Group in Ireland.

The concept focused on a decentralised sustainable aviation fuel refinery, without heavy capital expenditure, suitable to be placed near the source of feedstock or integrated directly into airports.

“Then we started some commercial feasibility studies, working with [UK research institute for manufacturing innovation] The Manufacturing Technology Centre, engaging with universities, talking to some really bright people, and it transpired that not only is it possible, it’s feasible. And we have the capability to reduce the capital investment costs from hundreds of millions to 10s of millions and reduce the time it takes to build these facilities from six-seven years to 12-18 months,” Currass says.

With an experienced team of British airline captains in aviation, sitting on aviation boards, Avena Fuels is currently at a technology readiness level (TRL) 2 or 3, meaning it has a ready proof of concept. It is also working with technologies at an advanced TRL 9 where the technology has qualified through successful operations, and integrating them all into a modular system.

Having gone through a feasibility study and currently fundraising in a seed round for £4.7m, the team is estimating to be at production capacity before 2030.

Avena Fuels has also secured a 10-year contractual agreement from a global purchaser of fuels which has committed to buying an initial 10 million litres of fuel a year. “So that tells us once we’re producing fuels, we can sell them into the marketplace immediately,” Currass says.

In the short term, the company is developing a digital twin of its refinery – a digital physics-based environment which will represent the real-world model with artificial intelligence.

The team is working in collaboration with Siemens to develop the digital twin, with all components, from the size of the pipelines to the pressure valves, as well as adding a virtual feedstock and demonstrating the production of virtual aviation fuel.

Latent Drive

Founded: 2020

Located: Winfrith Newburgh, Dorset, UK

Funding raised to date: $2.2m

The idea for this green hydrogen startup came during the pandemic when there was a shortage of oxygen for the treatment of covid-19 patients. Responding to a UK government call for technologies to help with the shortage, Frazer Ely (pictured left) and his son proposed a device that would extract oxygen from the atmosphere and compress it for use in hospitals.

“We were doing electrochemistry. I’d already been working on electrochemical devices, energy harvesting, and we were splitting and rejoining water molecules within stacks of cells like this. Basically, the same technology as fuel cells and electrolysers,” Ely, CEO of Latent Drive, says.

Following the pandemic, when their help wasn’t needed for oxygen production, they pivoted to focus on green hydrogen.

Ely’s team focused, in particular, in bringing down the cost of green hydrogen production. They engineered their own catalysed electrodes – called catrodes — using industrial stainless steel instead of the much more expensive platinum-coated version.

“The fundamental problem is that green hydrogen is too expensive. People don’t talk about that enough. Green hydrogen costs maybe four or five times as much as hydrogen created from fossil fuels,” says Ely. So the potential of the proprietary technology bringing the cost down is key.

With electricity supply also attaching significant costs to the production of green hydrogen, the team came up with the idea of getting their electrolysers to the source of energy, in this case offshore wind farms in the North Sea.

That’s how they created SeaStack, the first commercial electrolyser designed to go offshore to the wind farm and harvest the energy directly. Latent Drive also designed the technology to run with sea water, instead of having to purify it first.

Being developed side by side, the two technologies are at different stages. “The catrodes are at an advanced stage as we’re now setting up manufacturing facilities for catrodes and getting orders and inquiries in. But SeaStack is at an early stage and it’s going to be a few years before this is ready to go to market,” Ely says.

As a next step in the development of the technologies, Latent Drive is doing a demonstration project, called Hydroport, funded by Innovate UK, at the underused Portland Port in the south of England, powering the harbour patrol boat with hydrogen while developing its prototype SeaStacks.

Rhizo PTX

Founded: 2024

Located: Guildford, Surrey, UK

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

Ash Stott and Ben Kyffin are co-founders of green ammonia startup Rhizo PTX, which recently came out of stealth mode. The pair generated the idea for the company during their long commute while working as colleagues at a West Sussex-based firm developing clean energy technology.

As senior electrochemist and materials chemist, Stott and Kyffin were musing about the next generation of fuel, which led them to develop an electrochemical system that directly converts nitrogen, water and electricity into carbon-free green ammonia.

“The standard way of making green ammonia is making hydrogen, then feeding it into a Haber-Bosch reactor, combining it there and then creating green hydrogen. But we’re doing it in a one-step electrochemical way,” Kyffin, now CTO of Rhizo PTX, says.

The main goal of the business is to reduce the cost of green ammonia. The traditional approach of first making green hydrogen and then converting it into green ammonia is not cost competitive with gray ammonia (produced with fossil fuels), because of the longer process it requires.

“Our system is a direct single-step process, which allows us to also unlock the use of intermittent renewable energy, because our system can ramp up and ramp down very quickly with intermittent power,” Stott explains.

In addition to lower costs, the company can use cheaper materials as the technology doesn’t require the use of expensive materials, such as platinum or iridium, increasing the potential for a much more cost competitive green ammonia.

The company just raised a pre-seed round from a venture capital investor, helping it purchase specialised equipment, and has set up a laboratory space in Guildford, south England.

Rhizo PTX is currently at TRL 3, meaning it has completed a proof of concept as it aims to reach commercial scale within the next five years.

The founders are looking to partner with people in the commodity and chemicals trade of ammonia willing to try out a new business model for green ammonia.

“We are considering a new type of business model where instead of selling intellectual property or selling electrochemical systems, we sell the product of our electrochemical system – green ammonia,” Stott says.

There still aren’t many ecosystems in place for selling green ammonia, says Stott. “There’s a lot of interest in creating these systems. The main drivers are new emerging markets and the fact that ammonia can be used as a shipping fuel and as a hydrogen carrier – it’s easier to move ammonia than it is to move hydrogen and you can very easily convert it into hydrogen,” he says.

Its use is also rising in countries like South Korea whose government plans to import 9.27 million tons of ammonia produced from renewable energy and gas by 2030.

Global Nano Network

Founded: 2018

Located: Coventry, West Midlands, UK

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

Ravi Daswani (pictured left), founding partner and CEO of Global Nano Network (GNN), says the team started with the motivation to reduce toxic chemicals required to produce lithium-ion batteries.

The wet chemical process used to make these batteries involves liquefying materials with solvents in an extremely toxic process that uses a great deal of energy as the materials are re-dried afterwards.

“That’s exactly what we fixed at GNN. We got rid of the requirement to use toxic solvent by transitioning from a wet to a dry chemical process. So, what that means is we can go straight from powder to producing the cathode, which means you can reduce your energy intensity,” Daswani, says.

The dry materials manufacturing process has historically had a higher failure rate, but GNN developed a novel step using a technology called hyper foil, which improved efficiency.

This patented technology allows the company to reduce the cost of one specific component in a battery by close to 20% and reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by close to 50%.

The startup is currently at TRL 5 or 6, meaning it is scaling up and starting to work with large organisations, both as suppliers and potential customers. Meanwhile, it is looking to build the first manufacturing plant for its hyper foil core technology.

With current market pressures and high costs of producing batteries outside the already established manufacturing supply chains in East Asia, competing against those producers doesn’t just involve setting up more businesses elsewhere, “the only real opportunity [to compete] is using technologies that can help reduce costs automation, and this is really what we’re focusing on,” Daswani says.

“This means leapfrogging completely what they’re doing in China today. Instead of using wet chemical processes, let’s focus on the environment. Let’s make ESG a priority and then let’s provide the right technologies that are going to help not only reduce costs but meet the CO2 emission targets.”

Volador Energy

Founded: 2023

Located: Mildenhall, Suffolk, UK

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

The idea for this battery startup emerged while Sachin Ramesh (pictured left) was developing an electric aircraft at aerospace company Volador FlyTech.

“We faced significant limitations with existing battery technologies – especially in safety, reliability and performance. As interest grew specifically in our battery innovations, we spun off the battery division into a dedicated, independent company to focus on scalable, sustainable energy storage for diverse sectors,” says Ramesh, now director and CEO of the spin-out, Volador Energy.

The battery startup aims to bridge critical gaps in the energy storage market by offering batteries that are modular, repairable at the cell level and free from toxic adhesives or welds.

Its proprietary press-fit casing aims to simplify maintenance and extend lifecycle while optional immersion cooling can enhance safety for high-demand or sensitive environments. This can contribute to grid resilience, off-grid applications and decarbonisation goals.

Immersion-cooled battery systems are gaining traction for their superior thermal management and safety, especially in high-performance sectors like off-road electric vehicles, aviation and industrial energy.

While the market for such batteries is niche and complexity and cost currently remain as adoption barriers, “our modular approach and use-case adaptability help overcome these challenges,” Ramesh adds.

The startup is currently focused on completing certifications, scaling manufacturing and commercialising minimum viable product. “With pilot projects in the UK and India, and strong interest from energy and infrastructure firms globally, we aim to enter new markets by late 2026,” Ramesh says.

These energy startups are part of 14 emerging companies that will be at the GCV Symposium in London on June 18 and 19. This is the full list of startups at the event:",https://globalventuring.com//content/uploads/2025/06/Energy-startups1.png,N,,2025-06-16 12:16:30.574467

G700 demand is growing

Satisfying demand for high-speed, long-range jets, the ultra large-cabin G700 entered service in April 2024. Since then over 50 of the business jets have already been delivered to customers worldwide.

Equipped with Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines and Gulfstream-designed advanced aerodynamic wing and high-speed winglet, the G700 has a range of 77,50nm and can be configured with up to five living areas for up to 19 passengers.

Qatar Executive was the Savannah-based OEMs first international customer and is this year showcasing the business jet on the static.

Gulfstream is also showcasing the jet, alongside the G600, with Burns saying he is looking forward to “showcasing the compelling combination of advanced technology, performance and comfort as increased demand for our next-generation aircraft continues in Europe.”

The spacious cabin featuring the Gulfstream Cabin Experience with 100% fresh air and the industry’s lowest cabin altitude also benefits from natural light flooding the interior from 20 panoramic oval windows.

With certification for the G800 “having gone smoothly,” Gulfstream is now gearing up for the first deliveries of its G800, which are “expected to be announced imminently.”

Marking the end of an era Gulfstream’s final G650 is due to be delivered this summer. As production winds down, the G800 will build on the G650s legacy with even greater range, advanced technology and enhanced efficiency.

300th delivery of G280

With orders ramping up for its larger business jets, Gulfstream’s super-midsize jet, the G280 is also in strong demand with the 300th delivery recently completed at the OEMs Dallas-Fort Worth area facility in Texas.

The milestone delivery is achieved just 13 years after the G280 first entered service in 2012.

“Achieving this milestone reinforces the continued strong demand for the G280,” said Burns. “Known for its unique combination of speed, performance and cabin flexibility, the G280 remains top of the super-midsize class.”

Powered by twin Honeywell HTF7250G engines, the G280 has a range of 3,600nm at its long-range cruise speed of Mach 0.80. It has achieved 87 city-pair speed records to date, while its steep-approach capabilities make it a convenient choice for some of the world’s most challenging airports.

Seating up to 10 with a four-place conference table and featuring Gulfstream’s cabin management and high-definition entertainment systems with high-speed Ka-band satellite systems, the G280 fills the gap between light jets and large cabin aircraft.

The declaration “didn’t come from us; this came from DG MOVE (the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport),” the EU Commission’s transport department, the lobbyist explained.
Still, the EU Commission wants to push on, eyeing to increase the mandated volume to 6% by 2030, including 1.2% synthetic ‘e-SAF’ made from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, which would further increase costs.
So, the Commission drafted a document to practically lobby itself, justifying moving forward with these measures.
According to the first anonymous aviation lobbyist, the goal is to manufacture a public perception of industry support in the absence of a real one.","If you still didn’t know how the lawmaking process in the EU works exactly, here’s a perfect example to sum it up.

A new lobby declaration from aviation industry executives in support of the EU’s sustainable jet fuel initiative was revealed to have been drafted by the EU Commission itself and merely sent to the industry to be signed, and then to present it to Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas during the Paris Air Show on Monday, June 16th.

The so-called ‘Le Bourget Declaration’ was fishy from the start, since it endorsed the same decarbonization targets, via gradually increasing the ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ (SAF) contents in their fuel mix, that major airlines heavily criticized as recently as March, slamming them as “unrealistic.”

And in fact, according to an anonymous aviation lobbyist, the industry didn’t make a U-turn overnight. The declaration “didn’t come from us; this came from DG MOVE (the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport),” the EU Commission’s transport department, the lobbyist explained.

“A couple of weeks ago, DG MOVE contacted us and said, ‘We want you to sign this and give it to the Commissioner,” he said. “Officially, it’s our initiative, but unofficially it came from the Commission, which is highly unusual.”

According to Politico, other lobbyists involved in the drafting also confirmed the story, stating that they’ve received the same document and request. They eventually agreed to include it in the declaration only after integrating it with actual industry requests, such as a specific emission trading system for SAF, which Brussels keeps opposing.

The end result, however, is a heavily diluted and self-contradictory document that no one really wanted. “Now it’s basically a Frankenstein that carries all sorts of different messages,” another lobbyist said.

The green dispute between the EU and the aviation industry has escalated since the implementation of the first SAF mandate in January, which requires them to add at least 2% sustainable fuel—mainly made from used cooking oil—in their fuel mix.

Airlines have been complaining ever since that they’ve been paying twice as much for SAF as expected, since there’s not enough produced globally to ensure compliance, and its price is already three times as high as kerosene’s. That’s why back in March, the CEOs of several major airlines (including Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France-KLM, and Ryanair) all signed a joint letter callingl for an “urgent review” of the rules, and demand a delay in implementation until the SAF market becomes affordable.

Still, the EU Commission wants to push on, eyeing to increase the mandated volume to 6% by 2030, including 1.2% synthetic ‘e-SAF’ made from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, which would further increase costs. And that’s just an intermediary goal before reaching “net zero” by 2050.

So, the Commission drafted a document to practically lobby itself, justifying moving forward with these measures. According to the first anonymous aviation lobbyist, the goal is to manufacture a public perception of industry support in the absence of a real one.

“The Commissioner doesn’t want to replicate the disaster of the automotive sector,” he explained, referring to the 2035 fossil fuel ban and other climate targets, which caused the European car industry to loudly push back with severe public criticism.

“He wants to ensure that airlines continue to support the measures adopted,” even if only on paper, in the hope of getting other, long-wanted concessions, he said.

The story is reminiscent of the Green Deal lobby scandal—also known as the ‘Timmermans Gate’—which revealed that the Commission paid over €700,000 from taxpayer funds to environmental NGOs to lobby EU and national lawmakers to adopt the flagship decarbonization package with its disastrous consequences to Europe’s energy security, industry, and competitiveness.",https://europeanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/eu-commissioner-for-transport.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 12:16:48.904546

With the A220’s advanced fuel efficiency and future compatibility with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, LOT is setting a new industry benchmark for green innovation and operational excellence.

LOT Polish Airlines Embraces Airbus A220 in Ambitious Fleet Modernisation Drive

LOT Polish Airlines has taken a major step toward the next generation of air travel by confirming an order for 40 Airbus A220 aircraft, comprising 20 A220-100s and 20 A220-300s. Unveiled during the 2025 Paris Air Show, this landmark decision marks the first instance of Poland’s flag carrier incorporating Airbus aircraft into its fleet. The move represents a pivotal change in LOT’s fleet strategy and forms a core element of its broader plan to revamp regional operations while boosting fuel efficiency and advancing environmental sustainability amid intensifying global aviation competition.

Importantly, the deal includes provisions for future expansion, with options that could increase LOT’s A220 fleet to as many as 84 aircraft. Such a scale of investment underscores the airline’s confidence in the long-term capabilities of the A220 family and its suitability for a variety of regional and medium-haul missions.

“Today’s decision is about the future. The Airbus A220 family aircraft, which will start joining our fleet in 2027, open up new opportunities for development and growth – key pillars of our strategy. These modern, efficient, and passenger-focused aircraft will allow us to compete effectively in the European skies, strengthen our position as the preferred carrier in Central and Eastern Europe, and prepare LOT for its role as a leading airline at the Central Communication Port,” said Michał Fijoł, LOT Executive Officer.

“This order for 40 Airbus A220s marks a historic milestone as we officially welcome LOT Polish Airlines into the Airbus family. The A220 Family will be instrumental in LOT’s fleet modernisation and network expansion strategy with the A220-100 and A220-300 being the ideal combination for their needs. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with LOT, leveraging Airbus global expertise to support its renewal program and ensure the A220’s seamless integration,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business.

A Landmark Shift in Fleet Strategy

Historically, LOT Polish Airlines has operated a fleet dominated by Boeing and Embraer aircraft. The decision to turn to Airbus for its latest fleet renewal is not merely a change in aircraft supplier—it represents a larger shift in operational thinking. As airlines globally prioritize sustainability, cost efficiency, and flexibility, LOT’s adoption of the A220 reflects a calculated move toward modern, eco-friendly aviation solutions that meet both current and future needs.

The A220s will serve as replacements for LOT’s existing regional aircraft, many of which are approaching the end of their optimal service life. With this new fleet, LOT is positioning itself to capitalize on evolving market demands, including increased regional mobility, better connectivity across Europe, and a growing emphasis on environmentally sustainable operations.

The Versatility and Strengths of the A220

The Airbus A220 is widely regarded as the most advanced narrow-body aircraft in its class. Capable of seating between 100 and 160 passengers, depending on the variant and cabin configuration, the A220 brings with it a host of advantages that make it ideal for regional and medium-haul operations. The A220-100 is well-suited for routes requiring 100 to 135 seats, while the A220-300 efficiently serves markets that need between 120 to 160 seats.

One of the aircraft’s most compelling attributes is its impressive range—up to 3,600 nautical miles or 6,700 kilometers—enabling airlines like LOT to serve new destinations without the need for larger aircraft. This opens up new route possibilities, particularly for underserved secondary cities and direct international links, which previously may have been economically unfeasible.

Engine Innovation and Noise Reduction

A standout feature of the A220 is its propulsion system. The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines. These engines have been designed with both performance and sustainability in mind. They reduce fuel burn by up to 25% compared to older models, and significantly cut down emissions.

Additionally, the PW1500G engines contribute to a dramatically quieter cabin and environmental footprint, with the A220 boasting a noise footprint 50% smaller than that of previous-generation aircraft. This makes the A220 not only an environmentally responsible choice but also a passenger-friendly one—especially for noise-sensitive urban airports and communities.

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

LOT’s decision to incorporate the A220 into its fleet highlights its strong commitment to environmentally responsible aviation. The A220 is already approved to operate with blends containing up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), positioning it as a forward-looking choice for greener flying. Airbus, the aircraft’s manufacturer, has also outlined an ambitious roadmap to ensure that the entire A220 family—and all Airbus models—will be fully compatible with 100% SAF by the year 2030.

For LOT Polish Airlines, this aligns well with broader European Union climate goals and the airline’s internal drive to reduce carbon emissions. As regulators, investors, and travelers increasingly expect environmental accountability from air carriers, LOT’s fleet renewal with the A220 positions the airline as a forward-thinking, sustainability-focused operator.

A220’s Growing Global Footprint

The A220’s growing success globally further validates LOT’s decision. By May 2025, the Airbus A220 had attracted over 900 confirmed orders from a global base of more than 30 airline customers. With over 415 aircraft already delivered, the A220 is in active service with 24 airlines, operating across more than 1,600 routes and connecting over 470 destinations.

These figures highlight the A220’s adaptability and global appeal. From North America to Asia and now Central Europe, airlines are increasingly relying on the A220 to meet rising passenger demand, cut costs, and achieve sustainability targets. LOT’s entry into this expanding community of A220 operators ensures that the airline remains competitive and current in an evolving aviation landscape.

Boosting LOT’s Regional and International Connectivity

The integration of the A220 into LOT’s fleet is expected to have an immediate and transformative impact on the airline’s route network. With increased efficiency and range, LOT will be able to expand frequencies on existing European routes, introduce new point-to-point connections, and improve feeder traffic into its long-haul network via Warsaw Chopin Airport and other regional hubs.

This operational flexibility is essential for LOT as it navigates the complex post-pandemic travel environment. The ability to serve thinner markets with right-sized aircraft allows for greater profitability and improved passenger load factors. It also enhances connectivity for both business and leisure travelers, supporting tourism, trade, and economic activity across Poland and neighboring regions.

LOT Polish Airlines has placed its first-ever order for forty Airbus A220 jets to modernize its fleet, enhance passenger comfort, and advance long-term sustainable aviation.

A Vision for the Future of Polish Aviation

LOT Polish Airlines’ choice to collaborate with Airbus on the groundbreaking A220 acquisition goes beyond merely adding new aircraft—it reflects a bold declaration of the airline’s future vision. It signals the airline’s readiness to compete in a fast-changing aviation industry that demands innovation, responsibility, and resilience.

By embracing one of the most modern aircraft in the world, LOT is not only modernizing its fleet but also reimagining the role it can play in connecting Central and Eastern Europe with the rest of the world. With sustainability, passenger comfort, and efficiency as guiding principles, the future of LOT looks more dynamic and competitive than ever.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LOT-Polish-Airlines-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 12:17:00.475756

On shore, passengers should aim to spend generously in local communities and avoid tours herded in large groups.

We have the opportunity to distribute wealth through travel and to empower communities that need it the most.” And what about Antarctica?
Look closely at its marketing and storytelling, and how it engages with local communities and the environment, says Destination Queenstown’s Woods.","Hauf says the best practice is for carbon emissions to be removed or reduced where they are generated, if possible. If we must fly, “carbon removal through carbon-offset projects is a crucial part of the global emissions reduction journey, not least because for some industries, like aviation, the technologies to get to zero emissions do not yet exist commercially”. However, she believes it’s essential to have “a robust and transparent national carbon accounting system”. It’s worth checking your airline’s carbon offset program to see where your money is going and whether it aligns with your values.

I love cruising but realise it’s another form of travel with a big environmental footprint. How do I choose the right cruise line and what can I possibly do to help the planet while I’m on board and on shore?

Natalie Cherry, owner of Queensland’s Noosa Cruise & Travel, a member of the Virtuoso (virtuoso.com) group of luxury travel advisers, says today’s concerned cruisers have the option of choosing a cruise line based on how proactive it is in reducing its impact on the environment. “You could look to see [the nature of] their investment and implementation of sustainable practices. Consider choosing a smaller vessel both for the environment and to reduce the over-tourism in ports. Ideally, a ship that uses LNG and battery power in places like Antarctica and the Arctic.”

It’s not just engine power that travellers should consider. It’s the kind of basic things nowadays such as food waste management and whether single-use plastics have been eliminated. Does the company partner with local suppliers to support local economies? How does it manage its excursions so as not to disrupt host communities? Does it give back to communities and climate science through foundations it has initiated, such as those run by upscale cruise lines Ponant and Hurtigruten? On shore, passengers should aim to spend generously in local communities and avoid tours herded in large groups. While the ship itself may not tread lightly, you still can.

Everyone says travelling by train is the way to go to help save the planet, but how clean is rail really? Aren’t plenty of trains around the world propelled by diesel rather than electricity?

“Rail travel has a much lower fuel consumption and emissions profile than other modes of transport,” says Liam Davies, associate director of the Melbourne-based Institute for Sensible Transport. “While electric trains can be zero emission, when run on renewables, diesel trains do have an emissions impact. However, this is much lower than planes. The single biggest thing we can do to reduce our emissions when travelling is to use trains wherever possible. Trains have a small fraction of the emissions profile of planes; in France, high-speed trains emit just 2 per cent of the CO2 of a plane travelling the same route.” Even though Australians wishing to see the world have no option but to fly overseas, once there, “popular destinations like Europe, Japan and China all have great rail networks, with many high-speed rail options, and some incredibly scenic regular-speed rail too. Taking the train sometimes takes a little bit longer, but you can sit back and enjoy the view, knowing you are reducing your personal emissions by travelling in a lower impact way”.

I’m considering a visit to Saudi Arabia. Should I go?

“Everywhere we travel comes with risks and considerations,” says Sean Martin, managing director of Australia, Asia and New Zealand at G Adventures. “Saudi Arabia is open to tourism, but I’d encourage each traveller to make an informed decision for themselves before going. If you do choose to go, there are so many incredible female-owned businesses there that you can choose to support, and you can put your tourism dollar into businesses and communities that are marginalised. We shouldn’t underestimate the force for good that tourism presents. We have the opportunity to distribute wealth through travel and to empower communities that need it the most.”

And what about Antarctica?

Denise Sablone, executive vice-president of tour development at US-based escorted journeys operator Collette, advises travellers worried about their personal impact on the White Continent to choose companies regulated by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) and the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO). “A less harmful way to visit the most precious and important places on our planet includes small ships with teams of naturalists and scientists on board that can positively educate and influence their guests,” says G Adventures’ Martin. Expedition cruise ships can play a crucial role in monitoring the fragile ecosystems of the polar regions. “We see our travellers as ambassadors, who we know will come back with even more respect and interest in caring for the planet than what they left with.”

US President Donald Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement for a second time. Does it mean I shouldn’t visit the US?

As of early January, only three countries had not ratified the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change – Iran, Libya and Yemen. However, Trump withdrew the US from the agreement soon after inauguration, meaning the US is no longer required to provide annual updates on its greenhouse gas emissions. But is the only ethical path for the environmentally conscious traveller to boycott the country? We note the US government doesn’t necessarily reflect the feelings of its people on this issue. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have come out in recent times to protest the present administration on many grounds, from tariffs to immigration and environmental policies. The issue for travellers now is also one of personal safety and stringent border control. Are we welcome as visitors to the US? This is a yardstick the thinking traveller should apply to every country they wish to visit.

Tipping has become a big issue, even for some Americans. If I do visit the States, should I resist tipping? Isn’t it just another kind of tariff?

“When visiting any destination, we know we should be mindful and considerate of the local norms and ways of life,” says Roland Howlett, owner of Virtuoso member travel agency Frontier Travel. “Tipping in the US is no different. It is deeply embedded in the culture and is a critical part of how many service workers earn their income. Embrace it, and you’ll find you enjoy travelling around the US a lot more.” Noosa Cruise & Travel’s Natalie Cherry says travellers should always check their bills first as there may already be a tip included. “Be mindful that their wages are incredibly low, so they rely on a service fee. In general, because of this, they do give exceptional service, so be kind and grateful for this and show your appreciation.”

Are there any truly ethical hotel brands I can choose? And how do we know the difference? What do we look for?

“When it comes to ethics, the best thing to look for is always a business that really invests in its people, and the local community,” says sustainable luxury travel expert Juliet Kinsman. “For me, economic sustainability is what’s key. Seek out an independent hotel where the owners have a meaningful connection to that place and are quite literally invested; you know your cash is more likely contributing to them looking after all that’s on their doorstep.” Kinsman recommends resources such as The Long Run, Regenerative Travel as well as her own list, Bouteco Loves.

Does replacing small plastic water bottles and straws in hotels really make much difference?

“The collective impact of the movement away from single-use plastic in hotels is really powerful and does make a difference,” says Elissa Keenan, chief executive of Ecotourism Australia. “If people don’t think small changes make a difference, I challenge their thinking.” As she points out, one of the single biggest risks to the three species of turtles listed as endangered and three species listed as vulnerable in Australia is plastic pollution. “Plastic pollution is deadly to sea turtles through ingestion leading to starvation, internal injuries or entanglement resulting in life-threatening injuries. For anyone who has snorkelled or swum with these majestic creatures, or who has dreams of doing so, making small changes cannot be undervalued.”

How much so-called greenwashing is really going on, and how can we call it out?

“Yes, there’s impact-washing galore,” Kinsman says. “But dig a little deeper, or to really do your due diligence, give the hotel a call (when did anyone last do that?) and you’ll soon get a sense of whether their good work is the real deal or if their virtue signalling is a load of blarney.” She’s all for calling out “greenshifting” (when a hotel doesn’t take responsibility for its failings, such as plastic water bottles, and they shift the blame, saying guests insist on single use) and “greenrinsing” (when they keep changing their targets before achieving them, such as declaring net zero by 2025 but still running on diesel generators). But she’s also supportive of “greenlighting”, which she defines as spotlighting the good of an operator, even if it’s not “eco through and through”.

Do hotels that want you to keep the white towels and not change the sheets really want to help save the world or just their own bottom line?

“What we definitely need is fewer expressions of being conscious or sustainable without substantiated facts,” says luxury travel expert Kinsman. If a hotel is going to claim a “nature positive” or “ocean-friendly” label, they need to back it up with hard evidence. “Considering laundry gobbles up a huge part of their energy and water budgets, I don’t care if they’re cutting their turnover for economic benefits, as long as the end result is that they can actually reduce the amount of towels and sheets and all the detergents they use and the fibres they release into our waterways.”

How do you know the money you donate to a social enterprise is really going to the right cause?

Collette’s Sablone says social enterprises typically measure their impact through monitoring and evaluation, tracking the outcomes of their activities to confirm they are making a positive difference in their communities. Resources such as annual reports and partnership pages can be utilised to verify that donations are being used correctly. Transparency and trust are key when supporting social enterprises. “Don’t be afraid to ask many questions and to demand the details, and to see accountability being practised,” says G Adventures’ Martin.

How can it be overtourism when so many locals say they depend on tourism for their livelihoods?

“Overtourism occurs when too many visitors flock to a destination, exceeding the local capacity to manage them sustainably,” says Mat Woods, chief executive of New Zealand’s Destination Queenstown. “This can lead to overcrowding, environmental degradation, strained infrastructure, reduced quality of life for residents and a diminished visitor experience.” But places can have both healthy tourist numbers and a happy community if tourism is managed correctly. Queenstown, says Woods, is a good example due to its destination management plan, which outlines a vision for regenerative tourism, with local community input to ensure the region thrives not just economically, but also socially, culturally and environmentally. “A great place to holiday is a great place to live, so balance is the key,” Keenan adds.

What can I do personally to help combat overtourism? Should I just skip places such as Paris, Rome and Venice?

When people think of overtourism, they instantly think of “bucket-list” hotspots such as Paris and Venice, G Adventures’ Martin says. “But what many don’t think about is the idea that overtourism can affect small, remote communities as well. Travel should be seen as a force for good, and we shouldn’t react to overtourism by turning our back on any one place, city or town. You don’t need to rule out a tourist favourite to combat overtourism; you just need to be mindful and conscious about the best way and time to see it.” You can help ease the pressure on a destination by travelling more mindfully, staying longer, travelling off-peak and exploring alternative destinations and second cities. Consider holidaying at home as well, says Keenan, of Ecotourism Australia. “We are so lucky in Australia to have so many incredible places to go with virtually no crowds. Travellers are increasingly looking for immersive and untouched experiences – we have these in spades right here.”

How can I tell if a destination really is doing the right thing?

Look closely at its marketing and storytelling, and how it engages with local communities and the environment, says Destination Queenstown’s Woods. “Look for initiatives that both strengthen the economic resilience of the destination and foster connections between visitors, community and those which protect the environment.”

I know you shouldn’t ride elephants, so is it still OK to ride other animals like camels?

“Whatever the activity, ensure the animal’s mental as well as physical needs are provided for,” says John Roberts, group director of sustainability and conservation at the Minor Hotels group. The most important message is to look for science-based welfare certification from any animal excursion, no matter the species, to guarantee the best of care.

Is there any way I can pack for a trip that’s better for the planet?

Packing light reduces your carbon footprint and makes it easier to use trains and buses and not rely on less environmentally forgiving private transportation, says Ecotourism Australia’s Keenan. “Consider whether you really need to buy certain items before you go. If you really want to [do so], purchase them from small businesses or markets in your destination, helping the money stay in that local community.”

What’s the feeling these days about visiting and supporting zoos around the world?

There’s still a place for zoos, says Minor Hotels’ Roberts, since it’s still not possible for everyone to travel to view creatures in the wild and to be inspired to care for the natural world. A licensed and well-regulated zoo, for instance a member of the World Association of Zoos & Aquaria, will be providing the best possible care and, most importantly, will be prevented from being part of the illegal wildlife trade and other anti-conservation measures.”

How can I choose an ethical safari, as wild animals can be crowded on some tours?

Travel with a company that plays a part in conservation or pays extra for exclusivity, ideally with a local community as benefactors, says Roberts. “Certainly, it’s better for the animals’ wellbeing not to be overcrowded, and for conservation in general, but it does come at a price point that excludes the vast majority of people. But overcrowding problems come when the experience is too convenient and cheap.”

In addition to being Britain’s head of state, Charles is the head of the Commonwealth, an organization of independent states that includes India and Canada.

The monarch’s annual birthday parade, known as Trooping the Colour, is a historic ceremony filled with pageantry and military bands in which the king reviews his troops on Horse Guards Parade adjacent to St. James’ Park in central London.

The military ceremony dates back to a time when flags of the battalion, known as colours, were “trooped,″ or shown, to soldiers in the ranks so they could recognize them.

Charles, wearing a scarlet military uniform, traveled to Horse Guards Parade in an open-topped, horse-drawn carriage accompanied by Queen Camilla.

Prince William and other uniformed members of the royal family rode behind the king on horseback, followed by Kate, the princess of Wales, and her three children in another open-topped carriage.

The festivities featured 1,338 soldiers, including 244 musicians, who paraded past the king following the moment of silence for those affected by the Air India disaster.

The royal family then returned to Buckingham Palace, where they appeared on the balcony to wave to the crowd and watch a flyover of military aircraft.

The finale of the flyover was an appearance by the Royal Air Force aerobatic display team, known as the Red Arrows, which for the first time used a blend of sustainable aviation fuel to power their aircraft and generate their signature red, white and blue smoke trails.

Airbus and Riyadh Air partnership

The A350-1000 is widely regarded as the world’s most modern and fuel-efficient widebody airliner, offering the longest range capability among commercial aircraft in production today.

It also supports Airbus’ sustainability ambitions by being capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with plans for all Airbus aircraft to be fully SAF-capable by 2030.

Adam Boukadida, Chief Financial Officer of Riyadh Air, said, “This order marks a significant step forward in building a world-class airline that reflects the ambitions of Vision 2030.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business, added, “As the long-range leader, the A350-1000 will provide unrivalled efficiency, range and passenger comfort, making it the ideal choice to support the airline’s ambitious growth plans.”

Multiple orders announced

As of May 2025, the A350 Family has amassed over 1,390 firm orders from more than 60 customers globally, with 657 aircraft already in service operating on a variety of routes worldwide.

On a busy day for Saudi Arabia’s aviation sector, aircraft lessor AviLease also announced a first order for 10 A350F freighters and 30 A320neo Family aircraft

These markets will represent over 50 percent of the global commercial fleet in 2044, up from nearly 40 percent in 2024.

Ahead of the Paris Air Show, Boeing released its 2025 Commercial Market Outlook (CMO), which also predicts airplane supply will catch up with market demand around the end of the decade, enabling carriers to increasingly renew and grow their fleets.

“Throughout the first quarter of this century, passenger air traffic tripled and the global airplane fleet more than doubled as the commercial aviation industry navigated significant challenges,” said Brad McMullen, Boeing senior vice-president of Commercial Sales and Marketing.

“Resilience will remain a hallmark of this growing industry as we continue to see strong demand for new airplanes with commercial aviation returning to its pre-pandemic growth trajectory.”

CMO forecast highlights through 2044:

Passenger traffic is forecast to grow 4.2 percent annually ─ more than doubling in size as it continues to outpace global economic growth.

The global fleet will nearly double to more than 49,600 commercial airplanes as airlines add capacity to meet travel demand.

About 80% of in-service airplanes will be replaced with more than 21,000 deliveries, improving fleet efficiency and capability.

Single-aisle airplanes will make up 72 percent of the global fleet, up from 66 percent in 2024, driven largely by short-haul travel and low-cost carriers in emerging markets.

• The global passenger widebody fleet will increase to approximately 8,320 airplanes, up from roughly 4,400 in 2024 ─ growth increasingly driven by carriers in emerging markets expanding their long-haul fleets. Supply chain diversification and expanding express cargo networks will drive a nearly two-thirds expansion of the global freighter fleet and the need for 2,900 production and converted freighters.

Air travel trends:

Airline networks serve about 30 percent more airport pairs than a decade ago, providing more convenient non-stop flight options.

As a share of discretionary expenses, travel spending has returned to pre- pandemic levels as consumers prioritize air travel.

Boeing has published the CMO annually since 1961. As the longest-running forecast of its kind, the CMO is regarded as the most comprehensive analysis of the commercial aviation industry. The complete outlook is available at: boeing.com/cmo.

TotalEnergies, pioneering SAF production

The Grandpuits biorefinery: Thanks to a €500 million investment, TotalEnergies transforms its site into a zero-crude platform, including a biorefinery with a production capacity of 230,000 tons a year of SAF in 2026. TotalEnergies has joined force with SARIA, the European leader in the collection and recovery of organic materials, which will supply the majority of the feedstock supply.

The La Mède biorefinery: This year, La Mède will produce 15,000 tons of SAF for distribution to airports in the south of France.

The Normandy refinery: TotalEnergies has begun coprocessing SAF at its Normandy platform. Coprocessing involves the treatment of both fossil jet fuel and biomass in a standard refining unit. The site's annual production capacity is 160,000 tons

The Antwerp refinery in Belgium: An initial project to coprocess 50,000 tons a year of SAF was launched this year. Annual production capacity will subsequently be increased to 80,000 tons a year

The Leuna refinery in Germany: A coprocessing project for 50,000 tons a year is planned for 2026.

TotalEnergies, supplying SAF to customers in the air industry

TotalEnergies supplies aviation fuels including SAF, in line with blending mandates and the needs of its customers. Those customers include several airlines:

Air France-KLM, with whom the Company has signed a major deal to deliver up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over ten years. This is one of the Group's largest SAF supply contracts.

Volotea, which has also signed to buy SAF from TotalEnergies until 2029, in order to reduce the emissions of its flights out of several French airports.

TotalEnergies also supplies SAF-blended aviation fuel to several French airports, including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris-Le Bourget, Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Nazaire

TotalEnergies, a partner committed to SAF research

TotalEnergies is also forging partnerships with aerospace groups to accelerate the sector's decarbonization. Those partnerships are playing a critical role in understanding the impact of sustainable aviation fuel composition on aircraft, especially for blends of over 50%. They include:

A partnership with Airbus, signed in 2024, to supply over half the company's needs in Europe, and conduct a shared R&D program to develop fully sustainable fuels.

A partnership with Safran, begun in 2021, that led to the formulation of a SAF that was completely compatible with current aircraft and was used to power a flight by a military helicopter in February 2023.

TotalEnergies is also stepping up its R&D effort, especially in feedstock, which remains one of the challenges to increasing SAF production. The Solaize research center in Lyon has specialist teams coordinating this work.

,,2025-06-15 23:01:57+00:00,T&E,"Europe risks losing its early e-fuels lead for aviation, study warns - Transport & Environment",Not Available,,,,,https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/europe-risks-losing-its-early-e-fuels-lead-for-aviation-study-warns,"A new T&E study shows that Europe can be a leader in e-kerosene (also called e-SAF), housing more than half of the world’s announced production capacity.
Europe’s early lead in the e-kerosene market has been driven by the EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels, ReFuelEU, which set specific targets for using e-fuels in aviation.
Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential.
Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail.
Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs.","A new T&E study shows that Europe can be a leader in e-kerosene (also called e-SAF), housing more than half of the world’s announced production capacity. Around 40 large-scale projects [1] are planned in Europe, with a potential e-kerosene production capacity of close to 3 million tonnes (Mt) per year – roughly 5% of the fuel that Europe’s aviation sector needs to operate.

Europe’s early lead in the e-kerosene market has been driven by the EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels, ReFuelEU, which set specific targets for using e-fuels in aviation. If all the announced projects were built, the EU could meet these targets – but none of the large-scale plants identified in this report are even under construction. Only four are at an advanced stage [2], and none have reached a final investment decision (FID). This slow progress is due to an array of challenges, with financing posing the biggest barrier, and traditional fuel suppliers being notably absent from the conversation.

Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential. Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

Despite favourable conditions, e-kerosene projects continue to face significant hurdles in Europe, including challenges related to energy costs, infrastructure, and CO₂ sourcing. Regulatory uncertainty is also in the mix, brought about by industry pressure [6] to delay ReFuelEU’s SAF targets in anticipation of the scheduled review of the legislation in 2027

Financing poses the biggest barrier, with each plant requiring €1–2 billion in capital, bringing total capital requirements to €10 - 20 billion by 2030. EU funding mechanisms for e-kerosene are not strong enough to support the level of investment needed to get these projects off the ground, and traditional fuel suppliers are notably absent from the conversation. To date, major oil companies have made negligible contributions to e-kerosene, while continuing to spend billions on fossil fuels.

“Despite their huge financial capacity, major oil companies are largely absent from the e-kerosene market,” Camile Mutrelle acknowledged. “Startups have taken the lead, but lack the internal resources to finance the capital-intensive infrastructure that is urgently needed. Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs. The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a chance to set the right flight path by prioritising e-SAF, providing a comprehensive mechanism to address the challenges EU projects face.”

T&E urges EU leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the existing ReFuelEU targets, especially in the run-up to the legislation’s scheduled review, and prioritise e-kerosene in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). It also calls for a European market intermediary using a double-sided auction mechanism to be established to address the current issues around financing.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/header-images-te-1.png?mtime=1749716016,N,,2025-06-15 19:59:08.522798

Charles requested the symbolic moves “as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy,” Buckingham Palace said.

An Air India flight from the northwestern city of Ahmedabad to London crashed shortly after takeoff on Thursday, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. The plane was carrying 169 Indians, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian. One man survived.

In addition to being Britain’s head of state, Charles is the head of the Commonwealth, an organization of independent states that includes India and Canada.

The monarch’s annual birthday parade, known as Trooping the Colour, is a historic ceremony filled with pageantry and military bands in which the king reviews his troops on Horse Guards Parade adjacent to St. James’ Park in central London.

The military ceremony dates back to a time when flags of the battalion, known as colours, were ""trooped,'' or shown, to soldiers in the ranks so they could recognize them.

Charles, wearing a scarlet military uniform, traveled to Horse Guards Parade in an open-topped, horse-drawn carriage accompanied by Queen Camilla.

Aviation accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions and is difficult to decarbonise.

A push to replace fossil fuel with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is raising the prospect of a new market for the Australian-grown oilseed.

Canola, known for its pretty yellow flowers, is harvested in grain-growing regions around the country, with the majority exported to Europe for biofuel production.

Liquid fuel made from canola

Australian-owned fuel company Ampol, publicly-listed GrainCorp, and industry super fund IFM Investors are working on a plan to refine canola oil in Australia for use in the aviation industry.

Subject to a feasibility study, GrainCorp expects to establish a canola crush with capacity to process 1 million tonnes a year, almost twice the capacity of its existing crush at Numurkah in northern Victoria.

It hasn't identified a site for the prospective crush yet, but Western Australia or New South Wales are the more likely options.

Canola meal would be extracted for use as livestock feed and the oil transported to Ampol's Brisbane refinery, to be manufactured into a renewable diesel and processed into SAF.

Brent Merrick, a general manager at Ampol, said the project would require a multi-billion-dollar investment but could come to market relatively quickly.

""Our plan is to aim for the sort of 2030 time range for production, and engineering is well underway,"" Mr Merrick said.

""It is a big deal, it is exciting,"" he said.

Industry seeks assistance

Before the canola-fed fuel business gets the green light, project managers are seeking federal government assistance.

""The cost of SAF today is more expensive than jet fuel, so we need some temporary support to stand up this industry and get it going,"" GrainCorp general manager nutrition and energy, Don Campbell, told Landline.

""How much? That's what we're working on.""

Assistance could include mandates for airlines to use a certain percentage of renewable fuel, subsidies for start-up costs associated with manufacturing, and help to ensure the final product meets global emissions reduction certification standards.

Australian airlines already using SAF

Last month Qantas imported close to 2 million litres of SAF from Malaysia, enough so that once it is blended it will fly the equivalent of 900 flights between Sydney and Auckland.

Last year the federal government committed more than $30 million for the development of an SAF industry using renewable feedstock.

It included $8 million for Ampol and $6 million for GrainCorp.

Speaking at GrainCorp's Newcastle port facility at the time of the funding announcement, Transport Minister Catherine King said establishing a low-carbon liquid fuel industry in Australia made sense.

""These are things we should be making here in Australia. It's good for farmers, it's good for our manufacturing sector, it's good for sectors like GrainCorp.""

Earlier this year, the government also announced $250 million from its Future Made in Australia Fund would be provided as grants to accelerate a domestic low-carbon liquid fuels industry.

SAF would boost economy, fuel security

The CSIRO has estimated an Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry, reliant on a variety of technologies and feedstock, could contribute up to $12 billion a year to the economy.

Zach Whale, a spokesperson for the farm lobby group GrainGrowers, believes much of that benefit would be felt in regional communities.

""If demand does really spike, we don't anticipate every farmer turning away from wheat and chickpeas and barley.

""We think canola will just remain a mainstay, but with greater domestic demand and hopefully favourable pricing for our growers.""

Food and fuel, or food vs fuel

CSIRO senior research scientist Cathryn O'Sullivan said SAF made from a variety of feedstock, including tallow, sugar and canola, needed to be certified to ensure any carbon abatement stacked up.

""We need really strong sustainability measures and metrics to make sure that we get that balance right between food and fuel and carbon abatement in these systems,"" Dr O'Sullivan said.

""I don't really consider [it] a roadblock, but it's a factor that needs to be considered in making sure these things are sustainable, and they don't compete with our food system.""

She said canola was a good example as it produced fuel and food.

""Our canola gets crushed and the oil can go into human consumption or it can go into fuel production, and the remaining canola meal that's left over goes into animal feed, so from one product you're getting both food and fuel,"" Dr O'Sullivan said.

Mr Whale said a canola-fed SAF sector would not come at the detriment of food production.

Noticeably absent are any pictures of King Charles with his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry.

Prince Harry recently pleaded for a reconciliation with his estranged father during an interview with the BBC after losing a legal battle to regain security for his family in the U.K.

In that interview, Prince Harry said, “I would love reconciliation with my family. There’s no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious. I don’t know how much longer my father has.”

Prince William’s Father’s Day Post Shows Lighter Side

Despite ongoing tension with his estranged brother, Prince William’s Instagram post celebrating Father’s Day showed his family’s lighter side.

The post starts with a posed family photo with the prince and his children, Prince George (11), Princess Charlotte (10), and Prince Louis (7). But the second photo shows all three kids piled on top of their laughing father.

The caption reads, “Happy Father’s Day, Papa (before and after!) We love you! G, C & L 💖”

Royal Family Celebrated King Charles’ Official Birthday

The British Royal Family had more to celebrate on Father’s Day weekend.

They also turned out for the annual official celebration of the monarch’s birthday called “Trooping of Color” on Saturday, June 14.

King Charles’ actual birthday is November 14, but Trooping of the Color has always been held in June.

For the third year in a row, Prince Harry and his family were absent from the event.

Prince William and Princess Catherine put up a family picture from the day on their Instagram account, writing, “Another brilliant day at Trooping the Colour for His Majesty’s Birthday Parade. Thank you to everybody who came, and to all those who took part.”

The Royal Family Instagram account also posted a video of the day, but made no mention of Harry and Meghan’s absence. The caption reads, “👏 A huge thank you to our Military personnel for a truly triumphant Trooping today!

Over 1,000 soldiers, around 200 horses and approximately 300 musicians came together in a display of Military precision, horsemanship and fanfare to mark The King’s official birthday.",https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-92.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 18:59:05.897885

CFM LEAP-1A The LEAP engine was first introduced in 2016 with the -1A variant that has been used exclusively for the Airbus A320neo family (including the A321XLR).
Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM The Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM is part of the PW1000G family.
Boeing did not need such a powerful LEAP family engine as the A321XLR because the aircraft has a much lower range and is smaller across all variants.
The greater weight means the 757-200 is powered by the more powerful Rolls-Royce RB211-535-E4(B) or Pratt & Whitney PW2000-37/40/43, producing up to 43,500 lbf.","Developed from the A321neo, the A321XLR is an upgraded aircraft that delivers a range of up to 4,700 nautical miles, allowing for non-stop flights of up to 11 hours. It can carry up to 244 passengers. This range is 1,200 nautical miles more than the A321neo and 700 nautical miles more than the A321LR.

The increased range requires the A321XLR to have substantially larger fuel tanks than the other aircraft in its family. It can carry up to 8,700 US gallons (32,940 liters) of fuel compared to the A321neo's 6,205–8,679 US gallons (23,490–32,853 liters). As a result, this aircraft has the highest maximum takeoff weight of its family at 223,000 lbs. However, it uses the same engines as the A321neo and A321LR. Discover in this article how much power output this aircraft's powerplant can achieve.

The Airbus A321XLR's Powerplant

The A321XLR is powered by the same engines as the rest of the A321neo family. Carriers can choose between the CFM LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM. These engines mean that the A321XLR has access to between 32,160–33,110 lbf (143.05–147.28 kN) of thrust.

The two engines achieve similar levels of thrust and facilitate the A321neo family's fuel burn efficiency enhancements. However, they emerge from different philosophies on how to achieve over 30,000 lbf efficiently. The table below breaks down the A321XLR's key specifications:

Pratt & Whitney's innovative technologies have been utilized to develop an efficient engine architecture for enhanced propulsive efficiency. This centers on their use of a geared turbofan, allowing the fan and turbine to operate at different speeds. In a conventional turbofan, they are locked at the same speed, while it is often more efficient for the fan to rotate more slowly.

Meanwhile, CFM's LEAP family of engines focuses on improving thermal efficiency, allowing them to operate at a more optimal temperature. The following sections give further details on the A321XLR's engine options.

CFM LEAP-1A

The LEAP engine was first introduced in 2016 with the -1A variant that has been used exclusively for the Airbus A320neo family (including the A321XLR). A year later, CFM International introduced the -1B used as the exclusive engine option for the Boeing 737 MAX. The final variant is the -1C, used as the exclusive option for the Comac C919. This variant was introduced in May 2023, with the engine family the result of a long-running joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines.

The family is the successor to the CFM56, and it has leveraged modern advancements to enhance the engine's efficiency and reduce emissions. Architecturally, the engine uses a scaled-down version of the low-pressure turbine developed for the GE GEnx (787 Dreamliner and 747-8). CFM International has used composite materials for the fan blades that untwist under load for enhanced aerodynamic efficiency, and ceramic matrix composites that achieve high temperature resistance at a lower weight.

This combination of design decisions and materials technology advancements has led to a 16% fuel consumption reduction compared with eCFM56 engines. When announcing the LEAP family, Eric Bachelet (CFM president and CEO), said:

""When we launched the LEAP56 technology development program in 2005, fuel was at $1.30 a gallon. Today, airlines are paying nearly $4.00 a gallon. Our customers are hurting and we are responding. We have set aggressive targets for this engine, and the technology plan is in place to achieve them.""

Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM

The Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM is part of the PW1000G family. Other variants, including active and proposed engines, include the PW14000G (Yakovlev MC-21, but exports halted due to the War in Ukraine), PW1500G (A220 family), PW1900G (E-Jet E2), and the experimental but canceled PW102XG (Boeing X-66).

The PW1000G family's innovation focuses on the concept of a geared turbofan. The large front fan can rotate slower than the turbine, improving efficiency. Pratt & Whitney claims this advancement is a 16% improvement in fuel efficiency and a 75% reduction in noise pollution. The table below outlines the PW1100G engine family's key specifications:

Geared turbofans could revolutionize the aviation industry. Research conducted by Kevin Cullinane for his book Airline Economics in Europe found that a Pratt & Whitney GTF-powered turbofan would result in savings of $29 million over 12 years compared to the Boeing 737-800. The drastic noise reductions offered by geared turbofans may also challenge the necessity of flying curfews at busy airports like Sydney Kingsford Smith and London Heathrow.

How Do Boeing's Aircraft Compare?

There is not currently a directly comparable Boeing aircraft that combines next-gen efficiency advancements with a relatively long range for a narrow-body aircraft. The 737 MAX and 757 offer potential points of comparison in terms of powerplant output. The 737 MAX is noteworthy in this discussion because it also uses an engine from the CFM International Leap family. It uses a similar but smaller LEAP-1B powerplant. This engine has a fan diameter of 69.4 inches and can produce 26,786–29,317 lbf (119–130 kN).

Boeing did not need such a powerful LEAP family engine as the A321XLR because the aircraft has a much lower range and is smaller across all variants. This means that even the largest variant (737 MAX 10) has a lower maximum takeoff weight of 197,900 lb (89,800 kg) compared to the A321XLR's 213,800–222,700 lb. The table below compares key statistics for the LEAP-1A (A321XLR) and LEAP-1B (737 MAX).

The A321XLR may also compete with the Boeing 757, a narrowbody airliner. The 757-200 variant has a range of 3,915 nautical miles, far less than the A321XLR, but more than the 737 MAX and enough to compete in the medium-to long-haul market. This aircraft is larger, with a length of 155ft 3 in to the A321XLR's 146 ft. Moreover, its less efficient engines require more fuel-per-mile. The 757-200's fuel capacity is 11,489 US gal (43,490 L) compared to the A321XLR's 9,613 US gal - 10,437 US gal (36,390-39,511 L).

Therefore, the 757-200s maximum takeoff weight is 255,000 lb compared to the A321XLR's 213,800–222,700 lbs. The greater weight means the 757-200 is powered by the more powerful Rolls-Royce RB211-535-E4(B) or Pratt & Whitney PW2000-37/40/43, producing up to 43,500 lbf.

A Modestly Successful Variant

According to Reuters, Airbus has sold over 500 A321XLRs, constituting a modest success, showing that the choice of Pratt & Whitney and CFM International engines for the powerplant was a good one. It has exceeded the expectations of some detractors who were concerned that narrow-bodied aircraft would not be comfortable enough for long-haul flying. Carsten Spohr, the Lufthansa CEO, named the A321XLR a ""niche"" product, arguing that passengers should not be asked to sit in a narrowbody aircraft for over four hours.

It certainly isn't only ""niche"" airlines that have invested heavily in the A321XLR. United Airlines made a firm order for 50 A321XLRs in December 2019. This purchase was valued at $7.1 billion ($142 million per aircraft) before the inevitable discounts are applied. Speaking to CNBC, Scott Kirby, United's CEO, teased what destinations might be served by the aircraft:

""Smaller cities in Europe and North Africa that we’ll be able to fly the airplane [to] out of Newark.""

However, the A321XLR is still relatively new to the market. The aircraft received its type certificate from the EASA on 19 July 2024 and the FAA on 2 October 2024. The aircraft conducted its first revenue flight on 6 November 2024 and first long-haul flight with passengers on 14 November 2024.

Furthermore, only a handful of the hundreds of ordered A321XLRs have been delivered, with Iberia being the first airline to receive the jet. All this points to an aircraft that will be interesting to watch over the coming years to see how the airlines that have invested hundreds of millions into it will perform. It will also be fascinating to see whether the Pratt & Whitney or CFM International engine option becomes more popular.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/this-is-how-powerful-the-airbus-a321xlr-is.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 18:00:33.962633

Despite manufacturing delays, Algeria’s national airline prepares to modernize its fleet, expand global routes, and lead regional sustainability efforts through a bold strategic transition in aviation.

─────────────◆─────────────

Algiers, Algeria | June 15th, 2025 — In a major announcement that underscores a transformative phase for Algeria’s aviation sector, Air Algérie CEO Hamza Benhamouda confirmed on Saturday that the airline will begin receiving new aircraft starting September 2025. The delivery, initially expected in June, was delayed due to supply chain disruptions and global manufacturing setbacks largely attributed to the post-COVID aviation crisis.

Speaking on the sidelines of the International Conference on Sustainability in Civil Aviation in Algiers, Benhamouda reaffirmed the airline’s strategic objective to become a regional aviation hub, in line with President Abdelmadjid Tebboune’s vision. The fleet expansion plan—comprising 15 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus—is designed to bolster the national carrier’s international competitiveness and operational capacity.

Global Supply Crisis Delays Delivery Timeline

Benhamouda attributed the delay to international bottlenecks affecting both aircraft manufacturers and interior equipment suppliers. Despite the setbacks, the CEO assured that the revised delivery schedule will not derail Air Algérie’s expansion goals.

The delivery plan is expected to unlock a wave of new air routes across Africa, Asia, and Europe throughout 2025 and 2026, with two new lines to Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Guangzhou (China) expected to launch before the end of 2025.

Commitment to Sustainable Fuel and Carbon Reduction

Air Algérie is simultaneously pushing forward with a bold energy transition strategy, announcing plans to begin operating aircraft using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at selected international airports. The use of SAF within Algerian airports, however, will be contingent upon the completion of local production infrastructure, which is currently under development.

Benhamouda stated: “Air Algérie aims to be a continental leader in aviation energy transition. We are no longer operating under business as usual—we are building a new model centered on carbon efficiency, innovation, and long-term ecological responsibility.”

The airline’s five-axis sustainability roadmap includes:

Modernizing flight operations for greater energy efficiency

Greening its infrastructure and enhancing operational energy performance

Embracing digital transformation to reduce waste and boost transparency

Integrating sustainable fuel alternatives

Implementing circular waste management systems across all service sectors

A Domestic Subsidiary on the Horizon

Benhamouda also revealed plans to launch a new subsidiary dedicated exclusively to domestic air transport, a move aligned with the national transport strategy initiated in 2019. The roadmap for the subsidiary is complete and will be unveiled in the coming weeks. Domestic air traffic has grown by more than 25% between 2019 and 2024, highlighting a renewed focus on regional connectivity.

Geopolitical Tensions and Route Adjustments

Addressing the impact of regional instability, the CEO confirmed the temporary suspension of flights to Amman (Jordan) due to security concerns in the Middle East. However, he clarified that flights to other destinations in the region remain unaffected and will continue as scheduled.

Algeria’s Environmental Leadership Recognized

During the conference, Minister of Environment Nadjiba Djilali praised Air Algérie for being one of the first African airlines to comply with the CORSIA protocol (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), describing the airline as a model of regional climate responsibility.

Hassan Boulfelfel, Director General of the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), called for urgent investments in SAF production, the modernization of the national fleet, and adherence to international environmental standards. He warned that starting in 2027, non-compliance with global sustainability norms will be subject to financial penalties.

The high-level conference—held under the theme “Sustainability in Mindsets for a Greener Sky”—brought together key government officials, including Minister of Transport Saïd Sayoud, Major General Abdelhafidh Bakhouche, Benhamouda, Djilali, and Boulfelfel, alongside international experts and aviation executives.

Scientific panels and expert-led workshops provided a platform for showcasing innovative solutions and actionable strategies, reinforcing a collective resolve to institutionalize sustainability across all facets of Algerian air transport.

It wasn’t always pretty, but the Minnesota Legislature managed to do just that, holding a special session June 9-10 to sign off on a state budget, a few weeks after the session formally adjourned. Lawmakers had their work cut out for them during a 21-hour special session, debating and passing 14 key bills before the deadline to avoid a partial July 1 government shutdown. With a tied House (67 Republicans, 67 Democrats) and a one-seat Democratic majority in the Senate, negotiations were particularly sensitive, requiring bipartisan cooperation.

Despite the partisan gridlock, lawmakers ultimately reached a compromise, passing a $66 billion budget that significantly cut a projected $6 billion deficit for future years. While the budget addressed immediate financial concerns, it also set the stage for ongoing debates over health care, taxation and economic policy in the 2026 Minnesota Legislative Session before the November 2026 elections.

The passage of the bills Monday caps a year that started with a power struggle and Democratic boycott in the House, and ended with missed deadlines that necessitated the Legislature needing to return to the Capitol to finish the job.

The Minnesota Soybean Growers Association celebrated legislative wins, including protecting crop inputs, but lamented missed policy opportunities that could’ve boosted a struggling ag economy.

“This session was a bit of a mixed bag,” said Joe Smentek, MSGA executive director. “We’re frustrated by the inability for lawmakers to work together to better the environment for Minnesota soybean farmers. However, we were pleased to see many of our priorities included in the ag bill and we extend our appreciation to Ag Committee leaders on both sides of the aisle for working in good faith to help farmers, who contribute to one of Minnesota’s top economic industries.”

Special session takeaways

Environmental and Natural Resources Omnibus Bill (2025 Legislative Special Session)

Following a strong advocacy push throughout the session by MSGA and fellow ag groups, the 2025 Minnesota legislative special session did not include any new restrictions or bans on pesticides, fertilizers or seeds, despite discussions on environmental policy. While some lawmakers pushed for stronger regulations on pesticide-treated seeds and groundwater contamination, the final bill maintained existing agricultural policies without imposing additional limitations.

The session focused primarily on budget negotiations, tax adjustments and infrastructure funding, leaving agricultural regulations unchanged. This decision reflects a balance between environmental concerns and industry interests, ensuring farmers can continue using current agricultural practices without new legislative hurdles.

“We’re very pleased to see that our advocacy efforts to protect those tools were successful,” said Darin Johnson, who delivered a “State of Soy” report to the Senate Ag Committee early in the session.

Bonding (2025 Legislative Special Session)

The agreements, which focused on transportation and water infrastructure, would fund those projects and more with about a net $700 million, including more than $646 million in proceeds from bond sales, $73 million from the transportation fund and $6.5 million in cash. Cancellations from previous appropriations help lower the overall total.

• $44 million for natural resources purposes, including $33 million for asset preservation and $9 million for flood hazard mitigation

• $60 million in asset preservation for both Minnesota State and the University of Minnesota

The Legislature last passed a bonding bill in 2023 to the tune of $2.6 billion. The House approved a $71 million cash-only bill in 2024, but the Senate did not.

Tax Bill (2025 Legislative Special Session): MSGA earns partial SAF win

One of the top priorities in the biofuels space for MSGA during the 2025 legislative session, including during Hill Visits, was the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) tax incentive program, which would boost demand for Minnesota soybeans. Executive Director Joe Smentek testified in multiple hearings about not only the need to extend and expand the program, but even more importantly, get the details right on how SAF is incentivized to be produced.

MSGA and others helped build a strong bipartisan coalition of supporters, including Gov. Walz, Senate Tax Chair Ann Rest, House GOP Tax Co-Chair Greg Davids and all four legislative caucus leaders. This work showed in the release of the Senate Omnibus Tax Bill, which included the following SAF-related provisions:

• Modifies the definition of SAF to further specify how biomass must be produced

• Moves the effective date of the previous funding for SAF

• Allows qualifying taxpayers to claim a supplemental tax credit equal to 2 cents per gallon for each additional whole percentage of carbon intensity reduction beyond 50 percent, up to 50 cents per gallon

• Increased the allocation limits for credit certificates in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 from $2.1 million to $7.4 million and extends the credit through 2035

• Allows unallocated funds from each fiscal year to be available in the following fiscal year

• Extends the expiration date from 2030 to 2035

As budget negotiations continued, opposition in the House DFL caucus meant that the majority of these provisions had to be taken out. In the initial leadership agreement, every SAF tax provision was removed. MSGA and others worked hard to at least get the carry forward of the previous appropriation included in the final special session deal. While we are disappointed that we did not get any of the expanded language that Joe Smentek and others worked so hard to negotiate, getting the carry forward language saved the program and allows us to fight another day.

The bills now await Gov. Walz’s signature. With the special session completed, MSGA and its lobbying team will continue engaging with lawmakers and agency leaders on our policy priorities.

“We look forward to meeting at Farmfest with lawmakers and candidates to continue promoting our priorities, from SAF to tax reform to diversifying our markets,” Johnson said.

The 2026 session begins Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026.

3 minutes ago

The King has celebrated his official birthday with an eco-friendly flypast by the Red Arrows and remembered all those killed in the Air India plane disaster.

Trooping the Colour was a display of military pomp and pageantry but Charles asked for the traditional programme to include a minute’s silence, and for senior royals and officers taking part to wear black armbands as a mark of respect.

When the royal family gathered later on Buckingham Palace’s balcony they acknowledged the crowds and watched an aerial display of vintage and modern aircraft with the Red Arrows’ finale powered by a blend of sustainable aviation fuel.

The world-famous aerobatic team also used vegetable oil to produce their trademark red, white and blue vapour trails over the royal residence – believed to be a first.

Trooping, also known as the King’s Birthday Parade, fell silent after Charles had inspected hundreds of troops on Whitehall’s Horse Guards Parade from a carriage with the Queen by his side.

The moment of reflection acknowledged the aviation disaster on Thursday that killed 241 passengers and crew, including more than 50 British nationals, and around 30 people on the ground.

Charles led the royal colonels in wearing black armbands, with the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, Princess Royal, Colonel Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Colonel Scots Guards, all wearing bands on their left arms.

Young royals delighted monarchy fans by making an appearance, with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis riding in a carriage with their mother Kate.

George, Charlotte and Louis joined other members of the royal family, including the Duchess of Edinburgh in the former office of the Duke of Wellington, to watch the spectacle in honour of their grandfather the King.

Kate took her place next to the King and Queen on the dais, in her role as Colonel of the Irish Guards – a symbolic position and one she was unable to take up last year because she was receiving cancer treatment, and instead watched the ceremony with her children.

Trooping the Colour is as much a social occasion as a ceremonial celebration, and stands around Horse Guards Parade were filled with around 8,000 wives, girlfriends and parents of the guardsmen and officers on parade.

The colour – or regimental flag – being trooped this year was the King’s Colour of Number 7 Company, Coldstream Guards, also known as the sovereign’s bodyguard, which is celebrating its 375th anniversary.

The minute’s silence was observed when Charles and Camilla returned to the dais, following an announcement to the spectators and a bugler sounding the Last Post.

During the pageantry, the colour was first trooped through the ranks of soldiers before the guardsmen marched past the King, first in slow then in quick time, with Charles acknowledging the command of “eyes right” with a salute.

Lieutenant Max Martin, 24, who carried the regimental flag at the heart of the ceremony, said: “The King’s Colour emphasises and symbolises everything that has ever gone before in the Coldstream Guards.

“The gold embroidered silk of the flag is physically heavy, especially in the flourish, but the symbolic weight is heavier still.

“It bears 44 of our 113 battle honours: the achievements and sacrifices of countless generations of our forebears.”

Thousands lined the royal procession route from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade where Trooping was staged.

A group of activists from the anti-monarchy group Republic staged a “not my King” protest.

During the fly-past Louis, who was dressed in an identical red tie and suit outfit as older brother George, was seen chatting to his father, William, and waving to the crowds.

The sustainable display be the Red Arrows is in keeping with Charles decades long support for sustainability and climate action.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was not involved in the decision but was “delighted” because he has been encouraging use of the fuel on royal flights where practical and hopes the example will lead to wider use across the aviation sector.

In the sweet snap posted on Instagram, Prince Wiliam and Catherine pose with their three children George, 11, Charlotte, ten and Louis, seven.

'Another brilliant day at Trooping the Colour for His Majesty's Birthday Parade,' the caption read. 'Thank you to everybody who came, and to all those that took part.'

Catherine, 43, looked resplendent in an aquamarine coat dress from her late mother-in-law Princess Diana's favourite designer Catherine Walker - complete with a wide-brimmed hat by Juliette Botterill.

The mother-of-three accessorised with the Irish Guards regimental brooch as well as the Bahrain Pearl Drop earrings in a sweet tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II.

They were crafted from pearls gifted to the Queen and Philip from the ruler of Bahrain at the time of their wedding in 1947.

Her mini-me daughter Charlotte also paid tribute to the late monarch by rewearing the Diamond Horseshoe brooch she wore to her great-grandmother's funeral.

The brooch, which has been in the Royal Family for generations, had been a gift from her 'Gan-Gan' the Queen, and was a fitting nod to Her Majesty's love of horses.

Meanwhile, the boys, George and Louis, wore matching suits with striking red ties to match their father's scarlet military tunic.

The King, 76, and Queen Camilla, 77, led the royal appearances on Saturday as they watched a flypast involving aircraft including the Red Arrows, Chinook helicopters and a Lancaster bomber, a model that was used during World War II.

But it was the Wales Family - particularly little Prince Louis - who stole the show on the Buckingham Palace balcony where they were joined by the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, as well as the Princess Royal and Sir Timothy Laurence.

The late Queen's cousin the Duke of Gloucester and his wife also watched the flypast, alongside Prince Michael of Kent.

Cheeky Prince Louis captured the hearts of the nation once again as he waved to the gathered crowds with a large beaming smile.

Earlier, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were seen bowing their heads in respect as the royal family led a minute's silence to remember the 270 people so far known to have been killed in the Air India disaster.

Prince William and Catherine's children watched on from a nearby balcony after taking part in the Trooping the Colour parade from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard's Parade while their parents carried out official roles during the ceremony.

Led by a regal Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, the youngsters joined the rest of the royals in a quiet moment of reflection to remember the lives lost in the disaster.

Fans gathered early on the Mall on Saturday and braved the rain while hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal family. A small group of protesters carrying placards reading 'Not my King' was also in attendance.

The procession was led by a carriage carrying the Duchess of Edinburgh and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, ahead of a second in which the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will travel.

The Prince of Wales, Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh followed behind on horseback.

It is the first time Princess Anne has ridden in public since she suffered a head injury, thought to be caused by a horse, at her home last year.

While Prince William rode on horseback, the Princess of Wales travelled down the Mall in an Ascot Landau seated beside her daughter Princess Charlotte, while Prince George and Prince Louis sat opposite.

Alongside the Princess Royal, Colonel Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Colonel Scots Guards, the Prince of Wales wore a black armband in remembrance of those killed in the Air India plane crash on Thursday.

King Charles requested a minute's silence to be held during the ceremony in tribute to the 241 passengers and crew killed when a Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for Gatwick Airport came down on Thursday in the Indian city of Ahmedabad.

Some 53 Brits were onboard the doomed flight - all but one are believed to have been killed, along with dozens on the ground bringing the final death toll to at least 270.

Following the procession, the King, who is receiving cancer treatment, and Queen were seen waving and smiling as they made their way down the Mall in an open-top carriage before the national anthem was played.

Camilla wore a white silk crepe dress with silver embroidery by Anna Valentine with a hat by Philip Treacy and a Grenadier Guards brooch.

After arriving at Horse Guard Parade, Catherine took her place next to the King and Queen on the dais, in her role as Colonel of the Irish Guards - a symbolic position and one she was unable to take up last year because she was receiving cancer treatment and instead watched the ceremony with her children.

A minute's silence was then held to remember all the victims of this week's Air India disaster.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Charles requested amendments to the Trooping the Colour programme 'as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy'.

The King issued a written message soon after the plane crash, saying he was 'desperately shocked by the terrible events' and expressed his 'deepest possible sympathy'.

Posting on social media ahead of the ceremony this morning, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: 'Sending my best wishes to His Majesty The King today at Trooping the Colour. God Save The King.'

The occasion transforms the Mall as crowds line up the streets waving flags as 1400 soldiers parade alongside 200 horses and 400 musicians from Horse Guards Parade to Buckingham Palace.

After the Trooping ceremony is over, the Royal Family made their group appearance on the Palace balcony before the day concluded with a flypast.

Today, the Red Arrows made history when they used sustainable fuel and vegetable oil for their flypast over London for The King's birthday.

Jets from the world-famous aerobatic display team were powered by a blend of sustainable aviation fuel, and used the vegetable oil to produce their trademark vapour trails.

It follows groundbreaking trials by RAF engineers and logisticians.

All nine of the team's British-built Hawk fast-jets were topped up with a high-ratio blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the team's home base of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, before they set off, in what is thought to be a world's first.

Charles has been championing sustainability and climate action since before he ascended the throne.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was not involved in the decision but was 'delighted' because he has been encouraging use of the fuel on royal flights where practical and hopes the example will lead to wider use across the aviation sector.

Squadron leader Andy King, the Red Arrows' senior engineering officer who led the project, said: 'Ever since the Red Arrows' first display in 1965, the team has aimed to inspire future generations and represent the best of British. Using this technology is the latest example of our relentless pursuit of excellence.'

He continued: 'The flypast for His Majesty The King is the perfect opportunity to showcase this innovation.

'The vibrant vapour trails that we generate is what sets the Red Arrows apart and so to be the first aerobatic team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.'

Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard, said: 'The iconic Red Arrows are one of the world's premier aerobatic display teams and by adopting a more environmentally friendly sustainable aviation fuel, the Royal Air Force is blazing a trail as part of our work to combat climate change.'

The Red Arrows' 2025 season runs until October, with 60 shows planned across the UK and mainland Europe.

As a former polo player and one of the Royal Family's most accomplished equestrians, King Charles rode for years in the parade - both for his mother's official birthday celebrations and then for his own.

But he did not appear on horseback at the event this weekend and instead travelled in a carriage for the procession from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade and back.

Trooping the Colour is a centuries-old tradition that marks the Sovereign's official birthday.

It dates back to the 17th century and is rooted in battlefield custom, when regimental flags, or 'colours,' were trooped in front of soldiers to ensure they could be recognised amid the smoke of combat.

Last week a full-dress rehearsal, known as The Colonel's Review, took place serving as the final run-through before the King's official celebration.

This year, the honour of trooping the Colour falls to the Coldstream Guards, who will officially present their regimental flag, known as the Colour, to King Charles.

As expected, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle did not attend this year's celebrations.

Having chosen to walk away from being working royals, they have not been present at Trooping the Colour since 2019.

The other notable absentee was Prince Andrew, who remains exiled from public royal events amid the fallout from his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein and the claims made by late accuser Virginia Giuffre.

Andrew's daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are not expected to be there either amid Charles' desire for a slimmed-down monarchy and to keep the focus on working royals.

Queen Elizabeth attended all but two of her Trooping the Colours, missing it in 1955 when a national rail strike resulted in the event being cancelled and in 2020 due to lockdown restrictions.

In 2017, Trooping was held a few days days after the Grenfell Tower blaze and the loss of life was marked by a minute's silence, a decision taken by Queen Elizabeth II.

The parade is open to members of the public through an online ballot with ticketing ranging from £10 to £30 and is broadcast live on the BBC.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/14/19/99379035-0-image-m-18_1749926229636.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 14:01:16.923846

But in 2025, the tradition-steeped spectacle brought with it a series of firsts, farewells and subtle shifts that signalled changing times for both the royal family and the institution itself.

Princess Catherine’s look is reminiscent of Princess Diana’s

While not her first public appearance since confirming her cancer diagnosis in March, Princess Catherine’s attendance at Trooping the Colour marked her return to high-profile ceremonial duties. She rode in a carriage with her three children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis — and later appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony with the wider family.

She wore a turquoise Catherine Walker coatdress with white collar detailing and a matching Philip Tracy hat. This outfit was reminiscent of Princess Diana’s ensemble at the same event in 1988, highlighting Kate’s ongoing tradition of honouring Diana’s legacy through fashion. Complementing her attire, Kate wore the Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings, originally a wedding gift to Queen Elizabeth II and previously worn by Princess Diana. Her daughter, Princess Charlotte, matched her mother’s ensemble, echoing the coordinated appearance of Diana and a young Prince Harry in 1988.

The Wales family shared a lovely image on their Instagram account with the caption:

“Another brilliant day at Trooping the Colour for His Majesty’s Birthday Parade. Thank you to everybody who came, and to all those who took part.”

King Charles attends despite ongoing treatment

The King, who is also receiving cancer treatment, opted for a carriage procession rather than riding on horseback as he did last year. Royal Correspondent Juliet Rieden remarked on ABC News Breakfast that he may have been advised against horse riding as usual due to his cancer. Queen Camilla accompanied him in the carriage.

She chose a refined ensemble that paid homage to her military role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. She wore a white silk dress previously seen during a recent state visit to France for D-Day commemorations

RAF Flypast goes green

In a first for the event, the iconic Red Arrows flypast used a 40 per cent blend of sustainable aviation fuel, marking a rare but meaningful climate-conscious shift for one of Britain’s most-watched public spectacles. The move echoed King Charles’s long-standing environmental interests and was framed by some as a gesture toward modernising the monarchy’s approach to tradition.

A moment of silence for Air India victims

The ceremony also included a sombre pause. Members of the military and royal family wore black armbands and observed a minute’s silence for the victims of Air India Flight 171, which recently crashed en route to the UK. The tribute added a poignant note to what is typically a celebratory occasion.

Notable absences and attendances

While the crowd outside Buckingham Palace numbered in the thousands, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were again absent, marking the third consecutive year they’ve missed the event. Additionally, Lady Louise Windsor and James, Earl of Wessex, children of Prince Edward and Sophie, were not present, reportedly due to academic commitments.

The senior royals who did attend included Princess Anne, the King’s sister, who participated on horseback, Sir Timothy Laurence, Princess Anne’s husband, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, who also rode on horseback, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the King’s first cousin, Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester, Prince Richard’s wife, and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the King’s first cousin.

What felt different

While much of the choreography remained familiar, this year’s Trooping felt more pared-back. Royal watchers noted fewer horses, a shorter procession, and a less theatrical tone overall. Whether due to the King and Princess’s health issues or a broader shift in tone, 2025’s edition stood out for its quieter, more reflective mood.",https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/aww-digi-42-684e481336344.png?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-06-15 17:01:47.346649

Back in January 2020, Boeing put plans on hold for the Boeing 797, as well as a full-scale reevaluation of the project's potential.","Two massive planemakers dominate the global market for jet-powered airliners. In the United States, there is Boeing, a legacy manufacturer that emerged from multiple mergers of different massive aircraft manufacturing conglomerates over the years. Despite ongoing difficulties related to its troubled Boeing 737 MAX program, the manufacturer remains America's largest exporter and one of the nation's most important companies. Across the Atlantic in Europe, there is Airbus, a significantly younger manufacturer, but today it stands as the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry's most important player.

The next two major aircraft to hit the market will be the Boeing 797 and the Airbus A390, aircraft which will be so named to fall in line with the two manufacturers' naming conventions. At the end of the day, these will be the most important aircraft to enter service with airlines next, and each could have a vastly different impact on the market. Let's take a look at these two future development concepts and evaluate what Boeing and Airbus might be about to build next.

What Is The Story Behind The Boeing 797?

Let's start by taking a deeper look at the Boeing 797. US-based planemaker Boeing made an error a couple of decades ago when it ended production of the Boeing 757, an aircraft that perfectly bridged the gap between smaller narrowbody jets and large widebody aircraft. To address this capacity gap in its lineup, Boeing began to develop the New Midsize Airplane (NMA), an aircraft that was unofficially referred to as the Boeing 797. The principal purpose of this aircraft type would be to fill the middle-of-the-market segment, which had until that point been mostly unserved by Boeing aircraft.

Back in 2015, Boeing's research analysts determined that this market was large enough to be lucrative enough to support a new clean-sheet aircraft. Boeing quickly got to work designing the aircraft and attempting to find potential buyers for the jet. By 2017, multiple different international airlines had expressed their interest in purchasing a composite, seven-abreast twin-engine airliner that featured an elliptical cross-section. This new jet would be named the Boeing 797 to fall in line with the airline's current naming conventions, according to Popular Mechanics.

This aircraft would be offered in two different variants. The first of these would seat 225 passengers and would offer an extended range of 5,000 nautical miles. A 275-seat variant that could fly up to 4,500 nautical miles would also be available. Multiple third parties attempted to determine the potential size of this kind of market, and most settled upon a size of roughly 2,000-4,000 jets. Boeing forecasts indicated that the demand would likely lie towards the top of this range.

A Deeper Look At Everything The 797 Will Bring To The Table

The Boeing 797 promised to bridge a capacity gap that global air carriers were desperate to fill. The jet would come along with a purchase price of between $65 and $75 million, meaning that it could comfortably be worth the investment for many global carriers. The NMA promised to generate more than 30% more revenue in comparison to narrowbody jets on the market today, while also offering 40% lower overall trip costs in comparison to widebody jets like the Boeing 767, according to Flight Global.

The jet was to be one of the most powerful on the market, with a new ultra-efficient engine set to be designed for the jet. This engine was rumored to be a turbofan designed by GE Aviation or Pratt & Whitney, and it would be rated at 50,000 pounds of thrust. In order to offer airlines maximum operational efficiency, this engine would have a bypass ratio of 10:1 or more while also having an overall pressure ratio that exceeded 50:1.

Back in January 2020, Boeing put plans on hold for the Boeing 797, as well as a full-scale reevaluation of the project's potential. The aircraft manufacturer noted that it would be focusing on the Boeing 737 MAX, which had multiple fatal accidents take place in the years leading up to the pandemic. In February 2021, it appeared that the company had plans to develop a shorter variant of the Boeing 797 that would enter service in the late 2020s. However, these plans were put on hold in June 2022 pending the development of more advanced engines.

Airbus Also Has Plans To Develop A New Aircraft

The next Airbus jet to hit the market will most likely be called the Airbus A390, although some industry analysts have suggested that it could be called the Airbus A360. This likely stems from the fact that there is no Airbus A360 or A370 in the company's lineup despite there being an obvious hole in the organization's nomenclature.

Nonetheless, Airbus has its sights on something very bold for its next-generation aircraft, one which will be conceived from scratch and based on no preexisting designs. This aircraft will not simply be a larger or smaller variant of something that the company already operates.

Airbus already has jets that fill pretty much the entire capacity range airlines would be willing to serve. It sells low-capacity narrowbodies like the A220, and it offers something for pretty much every customer up to the Airbus A350-1000.

What Is Airbus' New Plane Going To Be?

Airbus is currently in the process of developing a next-generation single-aisle jet that is intended to replace the airline's current Airbus A320 lineup in about 15 years. This jet will include advanced sustainable technologies that will improve fuel efficiency and reduce the aircraft's carbon emissions. There are a number of specific design features under evaluation, but the company has already decided that the new model will be powered by an open-fan engine, one which will be developed by legacy engine manufacturer CFM International. This new engine promises to offer an improved fuel burn of around 20% on account of a much higher bypass ratio.

This new plane will also feature a ""Wing of Tomorrow,"" a longer and more slender wing that will fold at the tips to make sure that the aircraft remains compatible with gates that are already designed to serve existing narrowbody aircraft. The aircraft development program's principal objectives include reducing emissions and maximizing aerodynamic efficiencies. The jet is also going to be fully compatible with the use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), something that will set it apart from existing jets that are limited to a 50% SAF blend.

These latest developments serve as a major bridge for Airbus as the company pursues its ambitious hydrogen-powered aircraft project, one that looks further off than ever. The new propfan-powered aircraft that is currently being evaluated by Airbus will be representative of the company's large-scale strategic shift towards the development of high-efficiency, lower-emission aircraft. The flight testing process for many of these advanced technologies is set to begin later in the decade.

What Market Would This New Airbus Plane Serve?

This new Airbus single-aisle aircraft is designed to play the same role in global fleets that aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 currently play. This will include domestic flights and transcontinental services, as well as regional international flights within certain markets. The aircraft is expected to compete directly with whatever Boeing decides to replace the Boeing 737 MAX with, meaning that it will serve airlines that operate dense, high-volume routes and seek to minimize both fuel and operational expenses as much as possible.

The aircraft is expected to offer an enhanced range, meaning that it will be able to serve similar markets to a jet like the Airbus A321XLR. The plane could potentially open up more thin long-haul routes due to its impressive operating economics. This could further increase the number of transatlantic routes where current operations are deemed economically infeasible. The anticipated efficiency of the aircraft's new open-fan engine will make it one of the most sustainable aircraft to ever take to the skies.

Furthermore, the aircraft's full compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel makes it extremely attractive to airlines that are looking to develop fleets that will not be targeted by stricter emissions restrictions, something especially true in Europe. Low-cost airlines and legacy carriers, alongside other kinds of non-traditional carriers, are all expected to have an interest in the jet.

What Is Different About How Boeing And Airbus Are Developing Future Aircraft?

Airbus and Boeing are both approaching the development of future aircraft in different ways. Boeing is taking what most would think of as the natural route, as the company is looking to fill a gap in its lineup.

This is the safer way forward, but it is also likely to be less lucrative than developing a completely new kind of flying machine. There are only so many carriers that would want this kind of jet, so its potential is somewhat limited.

Airbus is definitely a bit more ambitious when it comes to the future of its commercial lineup, and it also likely has much more interest in ensuring the development of sustainable jets. However, we will simply have to see which of these two development programs more adequately addresses the needs of the market.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/airbus.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 12:05:36.806923

Jetstar’s exit leaves Scoot the sole Singapore-based budget carrier and closes a chapter on the once high-flying budget carrier scene.","[SINGAPORE] News of the impending shutdown of Jetstar Asia, with the loss of more than 500 jobs, has sent shockwaves through the aviation sector.

Comments on social media site Reddit lamented the budget carrier’s closure as it was the only airline that plied between Singapore and the holiday destinations of Okinawa in Japan, Wuxi in China, Labuan Bajo in Indonesia and Broome in Australia.

On Wednesday (Jun 11) the Qantas unit announced its closure and said that its last day of operations would be Jul 31.

Budget flights have become a staple of the travel industry, accounting for one-third of the 49.8 million passengers who passed through Changi Airport in the first nine months of 2024.

As the low-cost carrier scene continues to battle stiff competition, rising fuel costs, price wars and the entry of new players, The Business Times takes a look back at the Singapore budget carrier landscape.

Early 2000s: Budget airlines take off

Budget airlines made their appearance in the Singapore aviation sector in the early 2000s, bringing cheap fares and new destinations to an emerging class of cost-conscious travellers.

With their trademark low fees and no-frills offerings, they revolutionised travel and made flying – once considered a luxury – much more affordable and accessible.

South-east Asia underwent a budget travel boom after Malaysia’s Tony Fernandes pioneered the low-cost carrier model in the region with AirAsia in 2002.

Singapore’s first low-cost carrier Valuair took flight in May 2004, ferrying 162 passengers on its maiden trip from Changi Airport to Bangkok.

The privately owned startup was co-founded by former SIA deputy chairman Lim Chin Beng, alongside other investors.

With fares at a fraction of those offered by full-service airlines – up to 40 to 50 per cent lower – it became a competitor to SIA’s now-defunct subsidiary SilkAir, which plied regional routes.

That same year, SIA Group launched Tiger Airways with state investor Temasek and the founders of Irish budget carrier Ryanair while Australia’s flag carrier Qantas established Jetstar Asia.

The year 2005 proved to be a rocky one for low-cost carriers as fuel costs rose and full-service carriers slashed prices to never-seen-before levels to compete with and undercut their budget rivals.

Governments in the region, such as Indonesia, also shut their doors to foreign budget carriers. This left Singapore-based airlines with only a few crowded regional routes to compete in.

That year, Jetstar Asia and Valuair merged under the holding company Orangestar, with both retaining their original names. Amid challenging conditions, the two carriers struggled to make money.

Still, there was no stopping travellers’ wanderlust. In 2007, Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways featured on a list of Changi Airport’s top 10 carriers by passenger numbers.

In January 2010, Tiger Airways listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (SGX).

Entrances and exits: Players scoot in and out

Over the years, Singapore’s budget carrier market expanded by 21 per cent from 2004 to 2024, outpacing that of full-service airlines, which grew 1.4 per cent, according to Alton Aviation Consultancy.

The number of budget flights from Changi Airport also soared with the expansion of low-cost airlines.

From just 1,705 flights in 2004, the number of budget flights from the airport climbed to 16,798 in 2009 and hit a peak in 2018 with 64,618 flights to more than 100 cities.

But as air fares and earnings fell, carriers scaled back on operations, causing a string of consolidations and exits.

Indonesian budget airline Tigerair Mandala ceased operations in 2014, when its shareholders pulled the plug on funding. Tiger Airways owned a 35.8 per cent stake in the loss-making carrier, which had contributed to it racking up hefty losses for the financial year ended March 2014.

During this time, SIA launched a new and second low-cost carrier, Scoot, in 2012, in response to growing competition with brands such as Jetstar and AirAsia. It made its inaugural voyage to Sydney in June that year.

Scoot was meant to capture the medium- and long-haul market, while Tiger Airways would focus on short-haul flights.

Tiger Airways, which had been renamed Tigerair, struggled with consecutive full-year operating losses for FY2014 and FY2015.

The airline began to scale back its regional ambitions amid fierce competition, exiting the markets of Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan. Eventually, SIA took it private in 2016.

Tigerair was then folded into Scoot in 2017 as SIA consolidated its two budget carriers under the holding company Budget Aviation Holdings, to operate them under the Scoot brand, which fared better in market perception on issues such as comfort, safety and service quality.

The merger also aimed to boost cooperation between the two carriers and cut costs.

Meanwhile, Jetstar Asia enjoyed growth in the early part of the 2010s, as higher passenger numbers and an expanded regional network brought its earnings to S$18 million for the financial year ended June 2011.

However, its growth slowed near the end of the decade.

As at 2018, its share of Singapore’s low-cost carrier market shrank to less than 20 per cent from over a quarter in 2010, a Centre for Aviation report showed. By then, its rival carrier Scoot had grown rapidly.

Pandemic turbulence and recovery

Covid-19 dealt the aviation sector a heavy blow with the curbs on travel. The inevitable result was that Changi Airport’s budget flight numbers dived and remained below 50,000 for 2020, 2021 and 2022.

In 2020, Jetstar Asia grounded its entire fleet, retired five aircraft and trimmed 26 per cent of its headcount or 180 staff.

Scoot suspended most of its flights and pivoted to chartering cargo as its parent company SIA Group cut some 4,300 positions across its airlines

By 2024, as the pandemic eased and travel recovered – with Changi Airport’s budget airline passenger traffic reaching 101.6 per cent of 2019 levels between January and September of 2024 – low-cost carrier operators were poised to resume growth.

Scoot added new destinations to its network, ramped up flights and expanded its fleet.

In comparison, Jetstar’s recovery was slower. Analysts observed that its 2024 capacity and traffic was only around half of pre-pandemic levels.

Meanwhile, despite a surge in “revenge travel”, low-cost carriers continued facing headwinds. These included stiff regional competition, volatile fuel prices and geopolitical tensions.

Challenges such as supply chain snags also delayed new plane deliveries and grounded existing ones, while sustainable aviation fuel mandates pushed costs up.

Airlines cited rising costs – including the fees charged by Changi Airport – as a challenge to operating in Singapore.

The Republic in November 2024 had announced airport fee hikes to fund upgrades to Changi Airport.

The move was lamented by Jetstar Asia’s chief executive John Simeone, who said it could affect the airline’s ability to sell tickets under S$100 – which comprised around two-thirds of the carrier’s flights as at December 2024.

Jetstar Asia grounded

When Jetstar Asia announced its exit – citing cost pressures as threatening its ability to offer the low fares that are key to its business – passengers and staff were shocked, but industry experts said the move was unsurprising, albeit unfortunate.

They pointed to how the Singapore-based carrier had struggled to turn a profit even before the pandemic, and was in the black for only six years in more than two decades of operations.

Jetstar Asia lacked the scale, local dominance and margin buffers of its stronger rivals, analysts said.

Moreover, its 2023 shift to Terminal 4 from Terminal 1, where its parent Qantas operates, severed the seamless connectivity between the two airlines and lengthened connecting times, which likely worsened its problems, analysts added.

However Qantas itself has displayed a respectable performance.

Qantas Airways in February announced an underlying profit before tax of A$1.39 billion (S$1.17 billion) for its first half ended December. It also declared its first special dividend in more than two decades and its first final dividend since September 2019.

What does Jetstar’s departure mean?

Jetstar’s exit leaves Scoot the sole Singapore-based budget carrier and closes a chapter on the once high-flying budget carrier scene.

As Changi Airport Group works with other carriers to plug connectivity gaps in the dust of Jetstar Asia’s departure, one thing is for certain: There will always be a demand for budget travel – but whether it is a profitable business remains to be seen.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/28a48a3c6123b9006feb820ae31fd52f20cb679b58e8c292aa1e635474235fbb?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-06-15 12:05:40.783797

The company raised $50 million in June 2024.","Business-to-business tech platforms are still leading the way in terms of travel startup funding.

As Skift has reported, that’s where the money is: Platforms that promise to modernize travel sectors that have aging tech.

Funding has been slow this year, but it picked up slightly in recent weeks with three significant raises in the B2B category for hotels and vacation rentals. Hotel tech company Canary Technologies just raised $80 million, one of the largest rounds of the year for a travel software company. Holidu and Wander, both offering operations management tech for vacation rentals, each raised around $50 million.

Kolet, an eSIM app that raised $10 million, also promotes its B2B offering for travel companies. It’s likely a more significant revenue driver compared to individual consumer sales.

SkyNRG, a renewable jet fuel producer, had the biggest raise, $285.7 million, for any travel startup so far this year. Companies of that type follow a different set of funding rules compared to software startups, which often have to prove a strong business model to raise that level. Renewable jet fuel companies need a lot of money to develop their tech in line with the airline industry’s zero-carbon goal by 2050.

Seven travel startups announced raises totaling over $560 million in the last four weeks.

SkyNRG: $346.8 Million

SkyNRG, which produces and distributes renewable jet fuel, has raised $346.8 million (€300 million).

Pension management company APG committed $285.7 million (€250 million) to the round on behalf of ABP, a pension fund in the Netherlands. The other ($57.1 million) €50 million comes from Macquarie Asset Management, which led SkyNRG’s $191 million round in 2023.

Amsterdam-based SkyNRG says it sources the feedstocks used to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The company produces SAF in its plants and then distributes it to airline clients. SkyNRG says it has supplied SAF to more than 50 airlines worldwide.

The company has facilities in Washington state, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

The company plans to use the funding to help construct facilities in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.S. It will also support research and development, advisory services, and client projects.

Canary Technologies: $80 Million

Canary Technologies, a platform for hotel guest management, has raised $80 million in series D funding.

Brighton Park Capital led the round, with support from Insight Partners, F-Prime Capital, Thayer Ventures, Y-Combinator, and Commerce Ventures.

Canary said that the latest round brings its valuation to about $600 million.

The company raised $50 million in June 2024.

‍The platform by San Francisco-based Canary includes products for mobile check-in and checkout, upselling, guest messaging, and digital tipping.

Canary last year added a generative AI chatbot for guest messaging, which is meant to answer specific property questions and sell add-ons like late check-out, without disrupting front desk staff.

The company has since released an AI voicebot product to handle guest phone calls, as well as an AI chatbot for hotel websites, meant to drive direct bookings.

The company said its tech supports more than 20,000 hotels for clients including Best Western, Aimbridge Hospitality, Marriott, Wyndham, TUI Hotels & Resorts, and others.

The funding will go toward strengthening its products and expanding business.

Holidu: $52.8 Million

Holidu, a vacation rental management platform, has raised $52.8 million (€46 million).

Key1 Capital led the round, with support from Vintage Investment Partners, Prime Ventures, 83North, and others.

The tech by Germany-based Holidu primarily targets hosts who own one property. Holidu now manages nearly 50,000 properties, which drives 70% of the company’s revenue. The company said that the number of properties has tripled, and revenue from that business has grown 3.5 times, since it raised $102 million of debt and equity in 2022.

Holidu also owns Bookiply, which helps owners generate more bookings.

The funding will go toward accelerating AI integration, expanding the property management business, and moving into new geographic markets. The company said its first AI chatbot for guests “reduced simple support tickets by 70% and complex ones by 30%.”

The company also said it acquired Cybevasion, operator of French vacation rental booking sites gites.fr and chambres-hotes.fr. Their more than 35,000 properties now have access to Holidu’s tech. Cybevasion employees will be integrated into the Holidu organization. Jean-Louis Desouche, founder of Cybevasion, will stay on to lead the business.

This is Holidu’s eighth acquisition, which it said is part of a strategy for “bolt-on growth across Europe.”

Wander: $50 Million

Wander, a property management platform for luxury short-term rentals, has raised $50 million in series B funding.

QED and Fifth Wall led the round, with support from Redpoint, Uncork, Starwood, Authentic, Breyer, Alumni, Hakluyt, Activant, Soma, and others.

The company last raised a $20 million series A round in 2022.

San Francisco-based Wander says its AI-powered operating system manages a variety of tasks for short-term rental logistics and guest needs. That includes listing creation, maintenance coordination, guest communication, check-in, and more. “Wander is on track to automate 95% of operational tasks within the next 18 months,” the company said. Wander also has a booking platform for travelers.

Wander said that more than 1,000 homes use the service. As of the second quarter of 2025, the company has logged more than 35,000 nights booked and a repeat customer booking rate of 27%.

Wander says it focuses on recruiting the top 5% of properties, those that already drive 30% of the industry's revenue. The company looks for properties that include amenities like WiFi, gyms, pools, and saunas. It estimates that there are more than 300,000 potential clients worldwide.

The funding will go toward expanding into new markets, strengthening the tech system, and building the brand.

Qashio: $19.8 Million

Qashio, an expense management platform, has raised $19.8 million in equity and debt.

Rocketship VC led the round, with participation from MoreThan Capital, regional banks, and family offices.

Dubai-based Qashio says its expensive management products and services include corporate cards, custom approvals based on client policies, reimbursement, AI-powered receipt matching, analytics, and more.

The company also offers a loyalty program, enabling users to earn air miles and hotel points. Partners on the loyalty program include Emirates, Air France, KLM, Avios (British Airways, Iberia, Finnair), Jumeirah One, Accor, and IHG Hotels & Resorts.

The company said that it generated $1.2 million in profit in the first quarter of 2025. Its revenue has grown over 800% year-over-year for three consecutive years, the company said.

The funding will go toward expansion in Saudi Arabia.

Kolet: $10 Million

Kolet, an eSIM app, has raised $10 million in series A funding.

Daphni led the round, with support from former Expedia CEO Peter Kern and Jon Gieselman, chief growth officer for Comcast and former exec for Apple and Expedia.

The round includes €1 million in non-dilutive funding from investment bank Bpifrance.

Kern and Gieselman are joining the board, along with Certares managing director Philippe Chérèque.

The company last year raised €5 million in seed funding.

Besides the consumer product, Paris-based Kolet provides the eSIM app as a product that travel companies can offer to customers. Clients include Air France-KLM, Evaneos, Kiwi.com, Exoticca, and Wego.

Kolet says the app includes “instant” eSIM activation and the ability to use unused data on a future trip. Pricing starts at €3.99 for one gigabyte.

The company said it has gained more than 300,000 users since it launched a year ago, and it’s on track to reach 1 million users by the end of the year.

The funding will go toward strengthening the mobile app, simplifying the installation experience, and hiring.

Truely: $2 Million

Truely, an eSIM app, has raised $2 million.

Investors included DG Daiwa Ventures, Goodwater Capital, Disrupt.com, Beenext.

The company last raised $3.5 million in 2024.

Singapore-based Truely says users download only one eSIM, eliminating the need to download new eSIMs for different countries or regions. The service is usable in more than 190 countries, the company said.

The pricing for most countries starts at $2.50 per day when purchasing 30 days, according to the website. The fewer days the user purchases at one time, the higher the daily price. The highest daily price for the U.S. is $5.52, while the lowest is $2.50.

The funding will go toward network scaling for lower latency, localized pricing and payments, and new tools for business travelers.

Travaras: $1.5 Million

Travaras, an experience booking marketplace focused on sustainable tourism, has raised $1.5 million in a pre-seed round.

The funding comes from Techstars following the startup’s completion of its accelerator program.

San Francisco-based Travaras says it curates ticketed experiences based on a proprietary ranking system. All the experiences at this point are based on four Hawaii islands.

The funding will go toward strengthening the tech and user experience, along with marketing.

The Tarzan Way: $234,000

The Tarzan Way, an AI-powered trip planner website, has raised $234,000 (20 million Indian rupees).

Inflection Point Ventures led the round, with support from Your Trips Limited and a group of angel investors that includes Prateek Maheshwari, founder of education tech company PhysicsWallah.

The Tarzan Way, based in India, says its site includes AI-powered itinerary creation, a booking engine, and 24/7 live concierge support. The company says it has facilitated a total of $1.6 million (135 million Indian rupees) in bookings.

The funding will go toward product development, operations, marketing, admin, and launching a new mobile app.","https://skift.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/img-e1749671394754.webp?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-06-15 11:01:43.221664

Airbus is preparing a major upgrade to its A330neo series, giving both the A330-900 and A330-800 variants a significant performance boost. This planned upgrade, set to roll out by mid-2026, aims to provide airlines with greater range, payload capacity, and operational flexibility. But what exactly does this mean for the future of long-haul air travel?

The A330neo series has already made waves in the aviation world since its entry into service in 2018. Now, with enhanced capabilities on the horizon, Airbus is answering airlines’ calls for more performance without sacrificing efficiency.

What’s Changing: A Higher Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW)

The star of this upgrade is the increased maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), which will allow the aircraft to carry more weight while flying longer distances. For the A330-900, the MTOW will climb from 251 tons to 257 tons—an increase of six tons. While this might seem like a small number on paper, in aviation, even slight increases can make a significant impact.

This change means the A330-900 will be able to carry more passengers and cargo or travel farther without compromising on fuel efficiency. Airlines operating in challenging environments, such as hot and high airports, or those running ultra-long-haul routes, will benefit the most from this performance enhancement.

The A330-800 variant, while not as widely used, will also receive a similar upgrade. Though it’s a smaller player in the global fleet, the A330-800’s new capabilities will make it a more versatile option for airlines with specific needs.

A330neo’s Success So Far

The A330neo series has carved out a significant niche in the long-haul market, particularly as a more cost-effective alternative to larger aircraft like the Boeing 787. Thanks to its Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and aerodynamic improvements over the previous A330ceo model, the A330neo delivers up to 25% better fuel efficiency per seat.

Airlines have taken notice of the A330neo’s balance between affordability and efficiency. With a lower acquisition cost than the Boeing 787, the A330neo has become a popular choice for airlines seeking to keep long-haul operations affordable while maintaining high levels of performance.

Responding to Airline Needs: More Range and Flexibility

The move to increase the A330neo’s MTOW shows Airbus’s responsiveness to airline feedback. Many carriers are asking for aircraft that can do more—whether it’s flying longer distances, carrying heavier payloads, or handling operations in more demanding environments. This upgrade is Airbus’s direct response to those needs.

One of the key benefits of the A330neo is its fuel efficiency. The additional range and payload capacity will allow airlines to expand their route networks without having to worry about higher fuel consumption or operational costs. This makes the A330neo an even more attractive option for carriers, especially in regions like Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific, where long-haul travel is booming.

Airbus vs. Boeing: A Stronger Competitive Edge

With this upgrade, Airbus is tightening its grip on the widebody market, especially in the face of competition from Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. The A330neo already has a pricing and operational cost advantage over the Dreamliner, and this MTOW increase strengthens Airbus’s competitive edge.

Airlines looking for more efficient aircraft without breaking the bank are likely to see the A330neo as the smarter choice, especially when operating in regions where every extra kilogram of payload or additional nautical mile of range counts. The fuel-efficient design, coupled with a lower price tag, makes the A330neo a powerful contender in the long-haul market.

Enhancements in Passenger Comfort and Sustainability

While the numbers matter, the A330neo is also designed with passengers in mind. Airbus’s Airspace cabin concept introduces larger overhead bins, quieter interiors, modern mood lighting, and wider seats—making the flight experience more comfortable for travelers.

For airlines, this emphasis on passenger comfort adds a layer of differentiation, especially in competitive long-haul markets. As airlines continue to differentiate their products, the A330neo’s improved cabin features could provide a competitive edge, particularly in markets where passenger satisfaction is key.

In addition to its performance improvements, the A330neo is also certified for up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with Airbus actively working to increase this number as part of its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This focus on sustainability ensures that the A330neo will remain relevant as the aviation industry shifts towards greener technologies.

A330neo’s Future: What’s Next?

With an enhanced MTOW, the A330neo is poised to serve airlines even more effectively, especially on routes where passenger and cargo volumes are both high. Airlines like Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, and Etihad, who are already planning to purchase the A330neo, will benefit greatly from the upcoming upgrades.

Airbus’s efforts to streamline production with automated assembly and lighter materials ensure that the A330neo remains cost-competitive in a demanding market. These enhancements, combined with the new MTOW and improved fuel efficiency, make the A330neo a smart long-term investment for airlines looking to future-proof their fleets.

Conclusion: The A330neo is More Than Just a Sensible Option

With its new upgrades, the A330neo is no longer just a cost-effective option—it’s quickly becoming the smart one. Airbus’s decision to increase the aircraft’s range and payload reflects both industry trends and airline demands for more versatile, high-performance aircraft. The A330neo will continue to be a strong competitor against Boeing’s 787, offering airlines greater flexibility, improved performance, and a more comfortable passenger experience.

As the aviation industry moves towards more sustainable and efficient operations, the A330neo is proving that it’s ready for the future. With these enhancements on the horizon, the A330neo is set to solidify its position as a leading choice for airlines worldwide.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__86177-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 11:01:47.493414

At 13:00 twenty-nine aircraft took to the skies above the crowds on The Mall and over Buckingham Palace, watched over by Their Majesties’ The King and Queen, alongside other members of the Royal family.

The stunning formation was led by four Chinook helicopters from No 18 & 27 Squadrons of RAF Odiham, following the King’s Birthday Parade (Trooping the Colour).

The aircraft came from nine different RAF stations, many of whom flew in the VE80 celebrations in May this year.

It is an enormous privilege to be part of His Majesty The King’s Birthday celebrations, where the Flypast is an opportunity for the Royal Air Force to honour His Majesty The King, our Commander-in-Chief, on the occasion of his Official Birthday.

This year, the flypast will comprise twenty-nine aircraft, including the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, rotary wing assets from the Joint Aviation Command, training aircraft from No.22 Group and front-line aircraft from across No.1 Group representing the Air Mobility, Combat Air and ISTAR Forces; as always the flypast will conclude with the iconic Red Arrows.""

The aircraft, whose main purpose is to secure our skies and protect our citizens at home and abroad have a broad range of uses. These include training, air transport, lift capabilities, air-to-air refuelling, maritime, humanitarian missions, and fast jet combat.

It is a great honour to be part of an event that will bolster our national pride, and to be part of something much greater than myself. My role will include coordinating with civil air traffic and assisting the safe passage of all the aircraft back to their bases.""

Other aircraft in the formation included a Phenom, Typhoon, an F35 and a C17 Globemaster.

The flypast is also thought to be the first time anywhere in the world that a national aerobatic squadron has switched to both a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend for propulsion and a renewable biofuel - known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). This is a premium quality fuel, with a chemical structure almost identical to the regular diesel traditionally used by the aerobatic team for its vapour trails.

In addition to reducing its carbon footprint, the move demonstrates the RAF's commitment to new technology as well as becoming more energy secure and less reliant on fossil fuels.

The event culminated in a spectacular show of red, white and blue from the pilots of the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows.

It is a privilege to be a member of the Red Arrows. To me, the Red Arrows are an icon of the United Kingdom - so knowing that you had a key role to play in them bringing joy and excitement to thousands of people as they fly over the Mall is something I am incredibly proud of.

As head of all engineering and logistics on the team, I am even more proud to lead the amazing and diverse team of over one hundred ‘Blues’ that not only make major flypasts happen, but work tirelessly for twelve months a year, every year, to deliver a colourful and dynamic aerobatic show.

Working with the smoke generation system is the most unique part of the job. The vibrant vapour that we generate is what sets the team apart and so to be the first team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.”

The aircraft of the Armed Forces have a long and proud history of taking part in this occasion, with the first King’s Birthday Flypast taking place in 1913 and most recently formed part of Their Majesties’ Coronation in 2023 and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee in 2022.

The flypast has much poignancy for one of the Chinook pilots, Master Aircrew (MACr) Ruffles. The King’s Birthday Flypast was one of MACr Ruffles’ last flights as he leaves the RAF after forty years’ service and nine thousand hours flying with helicopters.

Being part of the King's Birthday Flypast after forty years of service especially on the 80th anniversary of VE Day is an honour I'll carry with me for many years to come. It's been a test of resilience, teamwork and dedication. But through it all, the bond with my fellow crew members, the sense of purpose and the pride in serving at such a high level has made every moment worthwhile.""

With a legion of helpers at hand, and access to an extensive photographic historical record, if a royal wears something that immediately arouses a sense of nostalgia, that's very likely a deliberate move on their part to pay tribute to tradition.

And no-one does that better than the Princess of Wales.

For her appearance at Trooping the Colour overnight – also known as the King's birthday parade – Catherine wore an outfit that has drawn comparisons to that worn by her late mother-in-law, Diana at the same event in 1988.

Both outfits are Catherine Walker designs and feature wide, white contrasting cuffs and collars set against deep aquamarine (in Kate's outfit) and green (as seen on Diana).

We all remember the late Princess of Wales in that look because it was also the year when Prince Harry, who was three at the time, poked his tongue out while being held by his mother on the balcony, much to the delight of the world's watching media.

Royal women, in comparison to their male counterparts, know their sartorial choices for events, great and small, get scrutinised down to every minute detail.

And there is no bigger event on the royal calendar than Trooping the Colour, bar a coronation.

For the woman who currently holds the title of Princess of Wales, Kate's decision to wear an outfit that bears such resemblance to Diana's iconic 1988 look is absolutely deliberate.

Rather than being custom-made for Kate, the style is on the British designer's website and is known as the 'Bria'. It also comes in red and black.

Some may wonder, why wear something so similar to that seen on Diana more than 30 years ago?

Surely such an obviously-similar outfit will just invite the Diana-Kate comparisons, something which the 43-year-old has had to live with since marrying into the royal family in 2011.

The simple answer is tradition.

As the King walked out onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the culmination of Trooping the Colour – the part of the day most of us really want to see – he was joined by his family.

The 14 of them in total represented what many believe is the result of the King's slimmed-down monarchy, an attempt to modernise the 1200-year-old institution by involving only those working in service of the Crown, or those in the direct line of succession (as the Wales children are).

They were the King and Queen standing besides Prince William and Kate and their children Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, seven.

They were joined by the Princess Royal and her husband Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.

Absent from this year's balcony line up were the two children of Prince Edward and Sophie: Lady Louise, 21, and James, Earl of Wessex, 17. Lady Louise was included in last year's Trooping the Colour, including the carriage ride to Horse Guards Parade, while her younger brother last took part in 2022.

It was the late Queen Elizabeth II who used to include her wider family on the palace balcony at Trooping the Colour, though in 2022 – which coincided with her Platinum Jubilee – the line-up was noticeably smaller than in previous years.

Many took it as a sign of the 96-year-old monarch paving the way for her son and heir's hopes for a more streamlined royal family.

In recent years, other royal families across Europe have been scaling down their list of working members, notably the Danish royals and the Swedish royals.

This year's Trooping saw another attempt at modernisation by Charles III: the Red Arrows who took part in the fly past used a blend of sustainable aviation fuel and normal jet fuel for propulsion and a renewable biofuel for its smoke trails.

It is thought to be the first time anywhere in the world that two environmentally-friendly fuels have been used for such a spectacle.

The King, who has long talked about the need to be greener, was said to ""obviously be delighted"" about the use of sustainable aviation fuel, an aide said.

All the best photos from Trooping the Colour 2025

As Charles moves to propel the royal family into more modern times, it is the Prince and Princess of Wales who are determined to show the world that tradition still matters.

And a small, and non-threatening, way to do this is through fashion.

It was just months ago that Kensington Palace said there would be ""no change in our approach to sharing information"" about Kate's clothes after reports emerged that the princess wanted the focus to be on her work and not her wardrobe.

What followed were many appearances by Kate wearing repeat outfits (of which, she should be commended for) or clothes in darker, muted colours. Hardly inspiring for her legion of fashion followers and fashion writers, though.

Fast forward to now with this Diana-esque look at Trooping the Colour.

Much like Diana in 1988, when she matched her outfit to Prince Harry's green and white ensemble, Kate and her daughter Princess Charlotte were mirroring each other with similar hued dresses.

While there are countless examples of Kate wearing similar outfits to Diana, the most recent example (apart from Trooping) came earlier this month when the princess wore a navy and white Suzannah coat dress to christen a ship in Scotland.

It was nearly uncanny to a navy and white Catherine Walker outfit Diana wore to a nautical event in 1993.

Trooping the Colour has always been a family affair and children, and their parents, are at the heat of the celebrations.

King Charles attended his first Trooping aged three in 1951.

In 2015, Prince George made his balcony debut at the event wearing a recreation of the same outfit his father Prince William wore for his first Trooping the Colour appearance way back in 1984, just weeks shy of his second birthday.

When Prince Louis made his balcony debut in 2019, his outfit was a recreation of the one his uncle Prince Harry wore in 1986.

These fashion choices are not coincidence and any mother in charge of their children's wardrobe at such crucial family events knows all too well the importance of looking unified and looking smart.

Every year there is debate about the relevance of the royal family and their place in modern society, yet the key players in the House of Windsor know that what their public really want is a continuation of tradition.

Trooping the Colour is the most popular – and loved – royal event because it is one that is a throwback to times gone by.

The centuries-old parade attracts tourists from around the world, many coming from outside the UK to get a taste of the royal family's pomp and pageantry.

Seeing Kate wearing an outfit that is so remarkably like one of Diana's is exactly what nostalgic-loving royal watchers want to see.

Mr Shanks said the investment, announced by the Prime Minister at the Scottish Labour conference earlier this year, will help provide a “long-term, sustainable future” for the site.

More than 400 jobs were lost at the oil refinery as owners Petroineos transitioned it to a fuel import terminal.

The company said the facility was losing large amounts of money every day.

Speaking on BBC Scotland’s The Sunday Show, the energy minister said his Government was engaging with businesses on new projects for the area.

“We’ve had some really positive meetings around potential investors,” he said.

“In fact, there’s more than 80 potential investors come forward.

“Scottish Enterprise is driving forward due diligence on that.

“There’s a number of really credible projects that we’re developing at the moment.

“We hope we’ll have some really positive announcements to say soon.”

Mr Shanks said the “unprecedented” £200 million investment from the National Wealth Fund would help “create the jobs of the future” while providing the security of long-term investment.

He added: “I’m hopeful we will have announcements soon.

“I’m not involved in the due diligence, as you wouldn’t expect, but there are some really exciting, viable projects coming forward that will deliver jobs in Grangemouth long into the future.”

Following the announcement by Petroineos to close the plant, the Scottish and UK governments funded Project Willow, a report which laid out the potential future of the site in areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Earlier this week, Jan Robertson, Grangemouth director for Scottish Enterprise, said he had received a “mixture of inquiries” from businesses, including those interested in the site as well as some which “have a good opportunity to become projects in the relatively near-term”.

Scotland’s Net Zero Secretary Gillian Martin said at the committee that the “door’s not closed” to companies and inquiries could still be made about working at Grangemouth, adding that Petroineos had also received approaches.

Ms Martin said she was hopeful for the future of Grangemouth.

“We could look back five years and start pointing fingers, but the most important thing is that in the last year – actually the last six months – Project Willow and the task force have moved things along in a way that’s been swift, agile, focused,” she said.

“I am feeling so much more confident than I did this time last year in the prospects for that site.”

Ms Martin added that she hoped, with approval from the cabinet, a just transition plan for Grangemouth would be published next week.

To date, the only SSTs to see regular service have been Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144.

Concorde is a British-French supersonic airliner. Concorde began scheduled flights with British Airways and Air France in January 1976. The Concorde had a top cruising speed of 2.179 km/h, or Mach 2.04, more than twice the speed of sound, allowing the aircraft to reduce the flight time between London and New York to about 3 hours. AF flew its last commercial flight on 30 May 2003, and BA retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003.

One aircraft was scrapped in 1994, and another was destroyed in the Air France Flight 4590 crash shortly after taking off, with all 109 occupants and four on the ground killed 2000. And it was the end of the Concorde era.

Tupolev Tu-144, a Soviet supersonic passenger airliner designed by Tupolev, was in operation from 1968 to 1999. The Tu-144 was the world's first commercial supersonic transport aircraft, with a top speed of 2,430 km/h, Mach 2.35. The Tu-144 was bigger and faster than Concorde. Tupolev-144 crash... The incident at the 1973 Paris Air Show happened when the Tu-144 swerved to avoid a French Mirage IIIR fighter jet, which had taken off before the accident.

The flights were expensive, mainly shuttling business people and the rich and famous. Concorde was a product of the analog era when the idea of flying to London or New York for the day for an important business meeting seemed like a necessary thing. Today, in a world of remote work and video meetings, maybe for that reason, we don't need the supersonic flights. Cheaper, larger, and more efficient airliners (the Boeing 747 entered commercial service in 1970) blew Concorde out. Concorde may be gone, but that doesn't mean that supersonic passenger flights are over. The US is determined to restore supersonic air travel for all, and aerospace agencies and manufacturers are proceeding along this course. 14, 16, and more flight hours are awful.

Cutting it down to 4 will be great. SS doesn't make sense for short distances, but for trans-Pacific and Atlantic, it does. SS needs to climb to a very high altitude to make it practical. Eliminating the sonic boom and reducing costs are problems. Concorde was extremely fuel inefficient when taking off and accelerating. If those problems could be solved, a return to supersonic flight would become a definite possibility. Noise is a real problem for supersonic flight. A supersonic plane causes disturbances called 'sonic booms.' In 1970, sonic boom concerns led the United States government to ban supersonic passenger flight over land in the U.S.

Safety concerns, deafening sonic booms, high prices, and a crash in France in July 2000 spelled the end for Concorde. A future for supersonic travel relies on solving some or all of the issues Concorde faced. Endeavors by Boom Supersonic, Exosonic, Spike Aerospace, and several major airlines are putting the possibility of supersonic back in the game. American company Boom Supersonic has an ambitious goal to have supersonic airliners carrying passengers by 2029. Boom Aviation completed the production of its Overture passenger jet in the facility in Greensboro, NC. Deliveries are scheduled for 2027, supposedly.

The plane will be much improved over the Concorde in fuel efficiency and 50% longer range. In terms of gas guzzling (Boom Supersonic Overture), they plan to use up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel to reduce emissions and their carbon footprint.

Modern design methods and modern aerospace materials such as titanium and carbon fiber should allow Overture to weigh much less than Concorde, improving efficiency. An airliner called Overture can fly at Mach 1.7, and flying supersonically can drastically decrease flight times. The Boom company claims a trip from New York to Rome on Overture could take just four hours, cutting journey times to as little as half of their subsonic equivalents. Boom Supersonic XB-1 became the first civilian aircraft to fly supersonically since Concorde. The plane speed (with Mach numbers greater than 1) is faster than the speed of sound (meaning 'to break the sound barrier'). As the plane flies, it disturbs the air in front of it, and in supersonic flights, these disturbances combine to form shock waves around the vehicle.

The only manned aircraft to fly in the low hypersonic regime were the X-15 and the Space Shuttle during re-entry. The X-15 used a rocket propulsion system to achieve sustained Mach 6 flight. For Mach numbers greater than 5, the frictional heating of the airframe by the air becomes so high that very special nickel alloys are required for the structure.

With modern technological advances, supersonic passenger travel will become a reality, and the technology will build an ambitious aircraft that will be available in the foreseeable future. The hypersonic jet concept...is one of them, designed to travel at an incredible speed of 5-10 Mach. This conceptual supersonic aircraft (Paradoxal hypersonic) looks like a futuristic version of the B-2 stealth bomber. The paradoxical hypersonic jet has a flat fuselage with integrated delta wings. The Paradoxal is powered by a dual-engine system called the R4E, which delivers a two-stage journey. In the first stage, the hypersonic aircraft can accelerate to Mach 3.0 and climb to 60,000 feet using air-breathing engines. And in the second stage kicks in, introducing liquid oxygen into the propulsion system, which turns it into the rocket engine.

This will propel aircraft to Mach 5 and beyond, taking them to the edge of space. The hypersonic military jet (the fictional Darkstar jet) in the actor Tom Cruise's film Top Gun: Maverick had a top speed of Mach 10. Many scenes in the movie break numerous laws of physics. Flying at such speed and altitude would have dire consequences on the human body. The Stratolaunch aircraft is being used to test high-speed hypersonic flight research vehicles. Stratolaunch recently completed two successful test flights of its new hypersonic plane. The Talon-A2 autonomous plane flew faster than Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, before landing at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

It was the first time a hypersonic test aircraft was flown in the United States since NASA left the X-15 program in 1968. Other companies in California and Georgia are also working on hypersonic engines and airframes. China, Russia, and the U.S. have been working on hypersonic aircraft for decades. Hypersonic flight is flight through the atmosphere below altitudes of about 90 km at speeds greater than Mach 5. The idea of hypersonic aviation is becoming more and more clear every year. On the civil side, hypersonic flight remains a long-term ambition, with research targeting Mach 5 passenger aircraft that could drastically reduce intercontinental travel times. China revealed a new hypersonic fighter jet that reaches the speed of light, surpassing Mach 5 and setting records in ways we could only imagine.

The Soviet hypersonic fighter MIG-15 achieved greater speed, a higher service ceiling, and heavier armament. With the creation of the 6th generation of hypersonic fighter concepts and its powerful and lethal air fighters, Russia is ready to dominate the world with its unrivaled military technology. Russia has created the ultimate weapon, the Sukhoi-57, designed with stealth technology. Northrop Grumman has successfully demonstrated GPS-independent navigation using a cutting-edge inertial measurement unit aboard its hypersonic test vehicle. The fastest jet in the world is NASA’s X-43 hypersonic experimental plane. Three of these were built in total. Thanks to its scramjet design, it was able to reach a speed of Mach 9.9, or 11,854 km/h. This is the future of air combat.

The hypersonic weapons are capable of traveling at hypersonic speed, defined as above Mach 5 (hypersonic missiles, hypersonic glide vehicles). Most supersonic military fighter aircraft are designed to fly at subsonic speeds and only to exceed the speed of sound for short periods, such as when intercepting an enemy aircraft. Supersonic military aircraft continue to be developed, focusing on enhancing speed, agility, and stealth capabilities. Programs like the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation air dominance and other international projects are focused on the requirements for the next generation of supersonic fighter jets. Key research areas include improving supersonic cruise efficiency, maneuverability at high speeds, and minimizing radar signatures. Hypersonic technologies may also be poised to revolutionize military systems by enabling vehicles that travel above Mach 5 with high maneuverability, making them nearly impossible to intercept.

Technology can be developed rapidly... The question is, do we need to go so fast?

Elon Musk debuts revolutionary hypersonic aircraft, which could be nearing the speed of light, which has sparked global shock waves. And it can use microwave energy. Concorde needed as much as eight times more fuel compared to a Boeing 747. The cost of developing, building, and testing a plane is pretty high. Development of modern jetliners runs into multiple billions of dollars, and maybe there will not be sufficient demand for a large production. Engineers take years and years of development, and a brand new one costs billions of dollars. Whether the issue of the sonic noise can be overcome remains to be seen. Prohibitively high costs are among the reasons both Soviet Union and the United States abandoned their quest for supersonic passenger flight.

The commercial aviation supersonic market is currently not a priority. But if it does ever take off again, we are more likely to see success in the business aviation market rather than with large-scale commercial planes. Of course, there is still hope that we could one day be whizzing around the world in a few hours. If the NASA project is successful and operational costs can somehow be lowered, supersonic jets can cover longer distances in a few hours. But we might have to wait a little longer. With modern technological advances, it will be interesting to see whether supersonic passenger travel once again becomes a reality or even goes mainstream. Only time will tell. The only possible way supersonic flights could return would be if someone like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos decided to bankroll the entire project and were fine with the massive overhead costs.",https://media.meer.com/attachments/274a03d71f3e6d75acfc3a40e87e0ded77f2f337/store/fill/860/645/92149f88ebc68636cf65ffa92b743058fb888a3cd7f7578de29ed9b211b0/Talon-A-An-autonomous-reusable-testbed-that-makes-flight-testing-more-accessible-and-affordable.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 13:02:13.562696

The European Commission is rolling out a major SAF subsidy scheme to accelerate the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel, offering up to €6 ($7) per litre to narrow the yawning cost gap between green fuels and conventional jet kerosene.

Funded through the auctioning of 20 million carbon permits under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the support package could underwrite around 216 million litres of SAF. Airlines will be able to apply for funding later this year.

Under the scheme, airlines can claim the maximum €6 for synthetic e-fuel, widely considered cleaner and more sustainable than alternatives. For bio-based SAF, just €0.50 would be claimable.

The heavy emphasis on e-fuels in this package reflects the EU’s desire to back a scalable, feedstock-light solution. But only a handful of e-fuel plants are operational, with some like INERATEC in Frankfurt producing their first litres in the last few weeks.

It’s the boldest financial intervention yet in Europe’s quest to decarbonise aviation. But despite its headline-grabbing size, the subsidy may not be enough to get sustainable fuels off the ground at the scale regulators hope for.

SAF subsidies don’t solve the issue of supply

Even at its upper limit, the fund would account for just a fraction of the SAF volumes needed to meet upcoming blending mandates.

Under the ReFuelEU mandate, the EU’s targets ramp up quickly. The currently mandated 2% will increase to 6% by 2030, and 70% by 2050. Within this, there’s also a sub-target for a proportion to be e-fuels: 1.2% by 2030, and 35% by 2050.

Global SAF production stood at only around 1.3 billion litres in 2024, while airline fuel consumption rose to an estimated 99 billion gallons – around 450 billion litres. Available SAF was less than 0.3% of airline fuel demand, and none of it was e-SAF.

A handful of e-SAF plants are underdevelopment or have recently come online, but to reach the ambitions of ReFuelEU and aviation’s net zero goal, more are needed. In Europe alone, dozens more have been proposed, but are yet to break ground due to a lack of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).

For fuel producers and project developers, the announcement provides a stronger business case, but not a bankable one. Without longer-term guarantees or revenue certainty mechanisms, few will risk FIDs on new SAF facilities, particularly for costlier synthetic e-fuels.

Do SAF mandates really work?

While more is needed to get the fledgling e-SAF industry off the ground, the EU’s commitment is a good start.

For airlines faced with increasingly demanding mandates, the promise of financial help will be a welcome relief. Current SAF supplies cost between three and five times more than conventional jet fuel.

IATA has said that SAF production in 2025 could reach 2.5 billion litres, or around 0.7% of airline total fuel consumption. However, it warns that this could cost the industry dearly.

“Even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill,” says Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

The Association further warns that mandates are only serving to artificially inflate the price of SAF. The expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased in 2025 to meet European mandates should cost $1.2 billion at market prices.

However, producers, who are liable to fines if they don’t meet blending mandates, are now passing on compliance fees to customers. IATA estimates this will add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices to the SAF purchased in Europe this year.

“Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel,” IATA warns.

While airlines may welcome the news that some funding will be available to help offset the cost of SAF purchases, it’s not all good news.

:The global push for sustainable energy and carbon-neutral fuels has accelerated the innovation in biomass-to-energy conversion. Traditional methods like combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion are being enhanced with cutting-edge technologies to improve efficiency, scalability, and environmental performance. People are now talking about next-generation thermochemical conversion.

Advanced gasification with carbon capture is generating much interest. The integrated gasification combined cycle now incorporates carbon capture and storage (CCS), enabling bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Plasma gasification using high-temperature plasma arcs improves syngas purity and handles diverse feedstocks including agricultural waste, and sludge. Whilst catalytic gasification using Ni, Fe, or Ru catalysts enhances hydrogen yield while reducing tar formation is entering the market.

Pyrolysis technology has seen advancement. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis provides faster, more uniform heating, increasing bio-oil yields. Whilst the ex-situ catalytic upgrading using zeolites like HZSM-5 converts bio-oil into drop-in biofuels such as renewable diesel and jet fuel. Co-pyrolysis with plastics improves energy density and reduces waste. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) for wet biomass converts algae, sewage sludge, and food waste into biocrude without drying. And supercritical water gasification (SCWG) breaks down biomass at high pressure/temperature, producing clean syngas.

We have also witnessed breakthroughs in biochemical and hybrid conversion. These include anaerobic digestion, AD, fermentation, and microbial electrolysis. A two-stage AD systems separate hydrolysis and methanogenesis, boosting biogas yields by 20-30%. Co-digestion with food waste, manure, or algae optimizes nutrient balance and methane production.

Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) use microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) to convert organic matter into hydrogen plus electricity. The consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) for cellulosic ethanol capitalises on engineered microbes such as clostridium thermocellum to simultaneously break down cellulose and ferment sugars, thereby reducing enzyme costs. Whereas CRISPR-edited yeast and bacteria improve ethanol tolerance and yield. Algae-to-biofuel innovations have made progress. The genetic modification of algae strains (Chlorella, Nannochloropsis) produces higher lipid content. Whilst photobioreactors with AI-controlled lighting and CO₂ dosing can maximize growth rates.

The emerging technologies and hybrid systems include Waste-to-Energy (WtE) with advanced sorting. AI-powered waste sorting robots improve feedstock quality for gasification. Whilst the pyrolysis of non-recyclable plastics plus biomass creates high-energy synfuels. AI and machine learning enables real-time monitoring of gasification and pyrolysis reactors using IoT sensors. And predictive algorithms adjust temperature, pressure, and catalysts for maximum efficiency. Biorefineries co-produce biofuels, biochemicals, and fertilizers. Carbon-negative systems (biochar sequestration) enhance sustainability.

What then are the challenges and future outlook? The key barriers include high capital costs for advanced systems, feedstock variability affecting conversion efficiency, and policy and market incentives needed for scaling. Future trends include small-scale modular gasifiers and digesters for decentralized energy, solar-powered biomass conversion for net-zero operations, hydrogen production from biomass via supercritical water gasification, and bio-aviation fuels (SAF) from lignocellulosic waste.

Biomass-to-energy technology is clearly rapidly evolving beyond traditional combustion and anaerobic digestion. Catalytic processes, AI-driven optimization, and hybrid systems are pushing efficiencies to new heights while enabling carbon-negative energy solutions. The next decade will likely see commercial-scale BECCS, waste-integrated biorefineries, and cost-competitive biofuels dominating the sector.

Plasma gasification, a cutting-edge thermochemical process that uses extremely high temperatures (3,000–7,000°C) generated by an electrical plasma arc to convert biomass into syngas and heat is set to make heads turn. Unlike conventional gasification, plasma torches provide precise, ultra-high-temperature conditions, enabling near-complete breakdown of complex feedstocks with minimal tar or char formation.

Plasma torch ionizes gas into plasma using an electric arc. In the gasification chamber, biomass is exposed to plasma heat, breaking their molecular bonds. The syngas cleanup system removes particulates, acids (HCl, H₂S), and trace contaminants. The vitrification unit makes inorganic residues melt into inert, glass-like non-leachable slag.

The future should potentially see green hydrogen production using plasma gasification plus electrolysis. Machine learning would adjust torch parameters in real-time. Plasma gasification represents a paradigm shift in waste-to-energy and biomass conversion, offering unmatched feedstock flexibility, near-zero emissions, and high-value outputs including syngas, hydrogen, and vitrified slag.

While energy costs and scale-up challenges remain, advancements in renewable-powered plasma, hybrid catalysis, and modular systems are driving commercialization. The next frontier technologies would include plasma-assisted bioenergy carbon capture for carbon-negative energy. And plasma gasification of algae for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With all such technology developments on the horizon, it is pertinent for biomass-rich Malaysia to plan a coordinated investment in the relevant R&D.

After the planes tore down The Mall and over Buckingham Palace — leaving their famous red, white and blue smoke trails — details were released of the historic moment.

The Red Arrows used a 40 per cent blend of sustainable aviation fuel and normal jet fuel.

Sustainable aviation fuel is typically made from waste cooking oils.

A renewable biofuel, made from hydro-treated vegetable oil that does not release new carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, was used to create smoke trails.

It is thought to be the first time anywhere in the world that the two environmentally friendly fuels were used at the same time by a national aerobatic team.

“His Majesty hopes to be an early adopter whose example will encourage wider use across the aviation sector.”

Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales took a front row royal seat as she returned to full participation in Trooping the Colour — while also keeping a watchful eye on her three children.

Kate, 43, shared a dais at Horse Guards Parade with the King, 76, and Queen Camilla, 77, after being forced to watch much of last year’s event backstage as she was recovering from cancer.

She could not resist tapping her feet to the military music on parade and glancing over at hubby Prince William, 42, who was on horseback alongside Prince Edward and Princess Anne.

On the eve of last year’s bash, she apologised to the Irish Guards — who were trooping their colour — for not being able to represent them.

The family waved at adoring crowds who had camped out for hours to see their favourite royals as they were taken in an open-top Ascot Landau carriage from Buckingham Palace up The Mall to the parade ground.

Louis had to be held back by an aide as he tried to scamper into the Major General’s Office to watch proceedings from a second floor window.

Executive Summary

The aviation sector is in a critical position where it must switch to environmentally friendly alternatives in order to lessen its impact on the environment. The implementation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in airline business models is thoroughly examined in this thesis, which uses the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas (TLBMC) as its primary conceptual frameworks. A thorough examination of the airlines' SAF pricing tactics and business models has been conducted, considering the sustainability of the environment, the economy, and society. This has made it possible to identify strategies that will effectively encourage the use of sustainable jet fuel. Through the examination and evaluation of aviation industry dynamics, legislation, and technical advancements, this research provides useful information to help direct strategic planning and decision-making within the aviation industry. The findings indicate that innovation, sustainability, and cooperation are essential for industry players to embrace in order to steer the aviation sector toward a more resilient and environmentally friendly future.

The integration of sustainable aviation fuel within the airlines' business models represents a decisive step towards sustainability in the aviation industry. In this thesis, the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas TLBMC has been used to complement the traditional Business Model Canvas BMC. Using these frameworks together offers a holistic analysis of the environmental, economic and social impacts of SAF implementation on airlines such as Scandinavian Airlines SAS and BRA Braathens Regional Airlines. Sustainable jet fuel is used as a temporary solution to reduce the aviation industry's environmental impact. However, analysis and review of the sustainable fuel's life cycle from production to consumption is needed to be able to evaluate its environmental and social benefits. From an economic perspective, sustainable jet fuel production and availability is a major challenge for airlines. In order to overcome this challenge, innovative pricing strategies and cost-sharing initiatives are required in which various stakeholders from the aviation industry are involved.

In summary, this thesis contributes to increased knowledge in changing business models in the aviation industry as well as an analysis of current price strategies for sustainable aviation fuel. Leveraging the insights from the TLBMC analysis of business models and pricing strategies for SAF integration, this research aims to inform strategic decision-making in the aviation sector and accelerate the industry's transition towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.

This financial backing was instrumental in the construction of the LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, widely recognized as the world’s first commercial ethanol-to-SAF plant.

Microsoft’s role has since expanded from financier to commercial partner, committing to off-take agreements for both renewable diesel and SAF certificates (SAFc). These commitments support Microsoft’s own ambitious sustainability goals, notably its quest to become carbon negative by 2030, a target detailed in Microsoft’s corporate sustainability reports and widely cited within the industry. Today’s announcement moves the partnership into a new phase: digital infrastructure. By standardizing on Azure, LanzaJet aims to streamline mission-critical domains—from plant performance analytics to global supply chain optimization and real-time emissions tracking.

Harnessing Azure for Operational Excellence and Growth​

The selection of Microsoft Azure as LanzaJet’s preferred cloud platform offers key, verifiable strengths:

Scalability Across Continents: Azure’s global reach enables LanzaJet to unify its operations in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America, supporting new projects and joint ventures as SAF demand accelerates.

Security and Resilience: Enterprise-grade cybersecurity is built into Azure’s offering—a critical consideration as SAF supply chains become more complex and data privacy risks mount.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Azure delivers robust analytics, machine learning, and AI capabilities. LanzaJet’s ability to monitor feedstock origin, optimize plant throughput, and generate precise emissions accounting reports is enhanced considerably with cloud-native solutions.

Sustainability Alignment: Azure’s own sustainability tools, such as the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability suite, can be directly leveraged to track and optimize environmental impact across the value chain.

Anne Sidio, LanzaJet’s Chief Transformation Officer, emphasized the importance of long-term partners in the high-stakes, innovation-heavy world of early-stage cleantech: ""This agreement builds on a multi-level relationship with Microsoft, from early investment in our company to renewable fuel offtake agreements and now digital infrastructure, reflecting the kind of collaboration needed to accelerate innovation, scale operations, and build a secure and resilient global platform."" Her comments reveal a nuanced understanding: in a sector where timelines for scale are tight and capital-intensive, the right technology and capital partners can make or break an enterprise.

Accelerating Climate Impact and Clean Energy Transitions​

LanzaJet’s core mission aligns with urgent climate imperatives facing aviation—a sector responsible for up to 3% of global carbon emissions and projected to grow despite incremental operational efficiencies. The company’s technology, based on patented ethanol-to-jet (ATJ) processes, is widely regarded as a leading contender for decarbonizing air travel at scale. By converting widely available ethanol into SAF, LanzaJet presents a viable pathway for legacy carriers and new entrants alike to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with traditional jet fuels—a claim substantiated by industry reviews and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Microsoft’s participation adds credibility. The company’s own sustainability strategy, which includes direct investment in SAF projects and pioneering commitments to procurement of SAF certificates, exemplifies the emerging model of “climate-aligned capital plus commercial demand.” By integrating LanzaJet’s output into its own supply chain and emissions calculations, Microsoft is not only hedging operational risk but also sending a clear market signal about the viability and necessity of low-carbon fuels for business travel and logistics.

Recent Milestones and Industry Recognition​

LanzaJet’s progress has not gone unnoticed. The company’s inclusion in the 2024 TIME100 Most Influential Companies list, alongside recognition from S&P Global and Reuters, underscores both its technological leadership and its role as a bellwether for the clean energy transition. These accolades are backed by the deployment of LanzaJet’s technology at commercial scale, as evidenced at Freedom Pines Fuels and with expansion projects in Europe and Asia reportedly underway, according to both public statements and independent industry sources.

LanzaJet’s continued expansion coincides with a broader surge in SAF project investment, government policy support (such as tax credits and blending requirements in the U.S. and EU), and the formation of public-private alliances designed to accelerate net-zero targets by 2050. Within this context, early-mover advantage, robust IP (intellectual property), and effective partnerships provide critical differentiation.

Risk Assessment: Scaling Complexity and Market Realities​

Despite its notable strengths, LanzaJet’s path is not without challenges. Several potential risks merit scrutiny:

Feedstock Availability and Pricing: SAF scalability depends on the adequate, sustainable, and competitively priced supply of ethanol feedstock. Disruptions in agricultural markets, commodity price volatility, or increased competition from bio-based plastics and chemicals could constrain supply and drive up costs.

Market Adoption and Policy Risk: While corporate demand for SAF is increasing, supported by airline sustainability mandates and voluntary corporate procurement, price premiums and regulatory uncertainty persist. The future of policy incentives (e.g., tax credits under U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, EU mandates) remains subject to change with shifting political climates.

Technology Risk: Though LanzaJet’s ATJ pathway is already commercialized, continued innovation is vital for maintaining competitiveness with other SAF production routes, such as Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA-based (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) fuels. Further R&D and strategic alliances are required to fend off both incremental and disruptive competition.

Digital Integration Challenges: Migrating mission-critical systems to Azure offers clear security and operational advantages, but also carries integration risks, including data migration, staff retraining, and the need for ongoing cybersecurity vigilance.

LanzaJet appears acutely aware of these risks, focusing on digital resilience and supply chain transparency as key mitigants—a stance supported by their adoption of Azure’s federated data platform and advanced analytics toolsets.

The Next Frontier: Merging Digital Transformation with Climate Action​

The convergence of digital transformation and sustainable fuel production represents an emerging paradigm in clean tech. As LanzaJet scales its SAF projects and supply chain, Azure enables a single pane-of-glass visibility into plant operations worldwide, while automating complex reporting for regulators, partners, and customers alike. Cloud-based IoT edge computing, real-time anomaly detection, and secure blockchain-backed emissions accounting are all now within reach.

This infrastructure not only drives LanzaJet’s internal efficiency but also facilitates external collaboration with airlines, logistics providers, and government entities that demand—and increasingly legislate—end-to-end data transparency and chain-of-custody assurances for renewable fuels. As regulatory bodies in the EU and North America tighten requirements on emissions verification and SAF blending thresholds, integrated digital solutions become prerequisites for commercial success.

Market Impact: A Blueprint for the Sector​

By aligning with a global technology partner like Microsoft, LanzaJet establishes an operational template for SAF innovators and adjacent clean energy ventures. The partnership is also instructive for established airlines, logistics firms, and corporate sustainability leaders seeking to integrate decarbonization into their procurement and travel programs.

For Microsoft, continued support of LanzaJet strengthens its reputation not only as a technology provider but as an active participant in the circular carbon economy. The company’s willingness to commit capital, serve as an early SAF offtaker, and provide digital infrastructure signals a new model of enterprise engagement on climate—one that goes beyond marketing to drive sectoral change.

Looking Ahead: The Stakes for 2030 and Beyond​

The sustainable fuels sector is bracing for a steep growth curve over the next five years, fueled by escalating regulatory mandates, investor pressure, and corporate net-zero pledges. LanzaJet’s ability to rapidly scale production, ensure feedstock traceability, and build digital trust with partners and regulators may determine its long-term competitiveness in a market projected to reach $131 billion globally by 2030, according to multiple market research firms.

As of today, LanzaJet’s Azure-powered global platform is positioned to deliver:

Rapid project onboarding and cross-region expansion

Real-time performance monitoring and adaptive optimization

Robust audit trails for emissions and feedstock sustainability

Secure, scalable infrastructure capable of accommodating future innovations in advanced fuels and digital services

These outcomes are not guaranteed, but the blueprint provided by the LanzaJet-Microsoft alliance is widely viewed as one of the most promising in sustainable aviation.

Critical Analysis: A Promising Partnership, Real-World Hurdles​

The LanzaJet-Microsoft partnership stands as a compelling case study in sectoral innovation, with both measurable strengths and persistent uncertainties. The integration of capital, commercial offtake, and digital infrastructure represents a “triple-layer” partnership model that enhances resilience and accelerates climate impact.

Nevertheless, the path ahead will require deft navigation of feedstock, policy, and technological risks. The conversion of cloud-native insights into bottom-line operational efficiency and regulatory compliance will be tested as LanzaJet moves from project demonstration to high-volume, global deployments. Any expansion of this model must contend with mounting scrutiny over the true sustainability of feedstocks and the ongoing threat of greenwashing, particularly as the SAF market matures.

For WindowsForum.com readers—many of whom shape technology strategy, manage hybrid infrastructure, or advise on enterprise cloud and sustainability integrations—the lessons are clear: digital platforms are not only enablers of business transformation but are now inextricably linked to the delivery of global climate solutions. Partner selection, data transparency, and security must be prioritized just as highly as production efficiency.

Conclusion​

The expansion of LanzaJet’s partnership with Microsoft, underscored by the adoption of Azure as the core digital backbone, is both a validation of SAF’s commercial momentum and a signpost for the future merger of cleantech and cloud. If successfully scaled, LanzaJet’s integrated approach could redefine standards for transparency, accountability, and climate stewardship across the global aviation industry.

As climate deadlines loom and investment in sustainable infrastructure accelerates, the lessons from this multi-leveled collaboration offer practical insight—and a touchstone for what works—in the race to decarbonize critical sectors while maintaining operational integrity and digital trust.

The European plane maker has announced plans to increase the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of both the A330-900 and A330-800 variants. This will provide airlines with increased range, payload, and flexibility.

Revealed at a recent industry event, the upgrade is expected to roll out by mid-2026. The A330-900, the more popular of the two variants, will see the MTOW increase from 251 to 257 tons. That will be approximately six tons higher than the earlier maximum takeoff weight.

That six-ton bump may sound modest on paper, but in practice, it means the aircraft can fly farther or carry more passengers and cargo, without compromise. The A330-800 will also get a similar upgrade, expanding its capability despite its more limited presence in global fleets.

Airbus A330neo New Variant

The A330neo series entered service in 2018. The A330neo has carved out a niche as a cost-effective and fuel-efficient widebody ever since its existence. It often served as a bridge between the single-aisle and the larger A350.

A330neos are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and feature aerodynamic improvements over the older A330ceo.

The A330neo burns up to 25% less fuel per seat. That efficiency, paired with a lower acquisition cost than the Boeing 787, has made it a favorite for airlines looking to manage long-haul ops without overspending.

With the MTOW upgrade, Airbus is clearly responding to airline feedback. Carriers are looking for aircraft that can do more: operate ultra-long-haul flights, handle freight-heavy missions, or serve hot-and-high airports where takeoff performance is a challenge.

The A330neo isn’t just about numbers and fuel burn. Its Airspace cabin concept brings in larger overhead bins, modern mood lighting, quieter interiors, and wider seats, giving passengers a smoother, more comfortable ride.

And for airlines, that comfort is part of the competitive edge, especially in markets like Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where product differentiation on long-haul routes is crucial.

Positioned for a Broader Market Battle

This move also sharpens Airbus’s position against Boeing’s 787, especially in areas where every extra kilogram of payload or every nautical mile of range counts.

The A330neo already undercuts the Dreamliner in terms of list price and operational costs. Now, with better performance, the aircraft becomes an even more attractive package, particularly for carriers operating in challenging environments.

Airlines planning to buy the A330neo aircraft—like Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, and Etihad—stand to benefit from the improved MTOW. This is especially true on routes where passenger and cargo volumes are both high. The Asia-Pacific and Gulf regions, in particular, could see a lot more A330neo activity in the coming years.

Beyond the performance bump, Airbus continues to optimize the A330neo’s production line. The use of automated assembly and lighter-weight materials ensures the aircraft stays efficient and cost-competitive.

The A330neo is also certified for up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with Airbus actively exploring ways to push that number higher as the industry aims for net-zero emissions by 2050.

Bottom line

In a market where widebody aircraft are expected to do more with less, Airbus’s decision to upgrade the A330neo is both timely and strategic.

The A330neo will have increased payload and range, lower fuel consumption, and strong passenger appeal. Airbus is proving that the A330 is not just a stopgap—it’s a serious contender for airlines looking to future-proof their fleets.

And with these enhancements on the horizon, the A330neo is no longer just the sensible option—it’s becoming the smart one.
