The Strategy commits up to $170 million in funding for renewable fuel and biomethane production and expands the Renewable Fuel Scheme – which was previously focused on green hydrogen – to include biomethane.
Bioenergy Australia chief executive officer Shahana McKenzie said the Strategy provides much-needed policy direction.
“Renewable fuels are no longer a future ambition for NSW,” she said.
The WA Government announced in mid-October that it would commit $1.2 million towards the development of an Advanced Biofuels Strategy.","The NSW Government late last week released its Renewable Fuel Strategy. What’s involved in the strategy, and how are other states prioritising biofuels?

The Strategy commits up to $170 million in funding for renewable fuel and biomethane production and expands the Renewable Fuel Scheme – which was previously focused on green hydrogen – to include biomethane.

Up to $130 million funding will be provided through the Net Zero Manufacturing Initiative to support emerging technologies and build local manufacturing capacity.

Renewable diesel trials will also be carried out in transport, construction, mining and agriculture sectors, along with crop research and development trials to test and demonstrate biomass production.

Bioenergy Australia chief executive officer Shahana McKenzie said the Strategy provides much-needed policy direction.

“Renewable fuels are no longer a future ambition for NSW,” she said. “Today’s announcement moves them into the mainstream of the state’s clean energy transition and provides the certainty needed for investment, construction and new regional jobs.”

McKenzie said this policy would help build “capability at scale” and be especially critical for sectors unable to electrify quickly.

“Heavy transport, mining fleets, manufacturing, maritime and aviation all need viable low carbon alternatives right now,” she said. “Renewable fuels and biomethane offer immediate, scalable solutions for these sectors, and NSW is positioning itself to meet that demand.”

An Australia-wide commitment

NSW is being praised as a national leader by launching a dedicated renewable fuels strategy, so how is the rest of Australia tracking in its commitment to bioenergy?

The Federal Government announced its $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program in mid-September, forming part of the Future Made in Australia initiative. This is focused on low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) such as waste materials, biomass, and renewable hydrogen.

Submissions for comment are open until December 19, with the Federal Government seeking input for the framework and key design principles of the program.

The Federal Government launched its National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy soon after, which will be focused on developing clear, coordinated direction to support sustainable production of bioenergy feedstock.

The WA Government announced in mid-October that it would commit $1.2 million towards the development of an Advanced Biofuels Strategy.

Churchill Capital Consulting and GHD will partner to deliver the Advanced Biofuels Strategy, which will look to leverage WA’s vast supplies of oat, wheat and barley stubble to explore the production of bioethanol and other biofuels.

A comprehensive economic analysis into WA’s biomass feedstocks, supply chains and technology pathways will be conducted as part of preparations.

Queensland has a goal to be an Asia-Pacific hub for biorefining in an effort to enhance fuel security, support economic diversification, and create high value jobs. At the same time, the state is supporting local agriculture to become a $30 billion industry by 2030.

Queensland has also launched biofuels mandates as part of the Liquid Fuel Supply Act 1984 that requires fuel sellers in the state to sell minimum amounts of bio-based fuels such as E10.

Tasmania aims to launch its Future Clean Fuels Strategy in late 2025, while Victoria and South Australia don’t have dedicated biofuels strategies in play. The Northern Territory, on the other hand, is eager to become a leader in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, which blends with conventional jet fuel to decarbonise the aviation industry.

Ernst and Young was engaged by the NT Government in 2024 to undertake a feasibility study into the development of a SAF industry in the NT.

Australia has demonstrated its commitment to biofuels in various shapes and forms, with NSW the clear bellwether in this space. With this nascent industry proving to be a low-hanging fruit for industrial decarbonisation, expect plenty more biofuels developments on a national and state scale.",https://www.energymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_353266785-750x492-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 19:56:13.178135

Indeed, according to new analysis by WorldACD, demand from Southeast Asia (SEA) origins to the US was up by +40%, YoY, in October, the highest YoY full-month growth figure this year.
For the first ten months of this year, tonnages from Southeast Asia to the US were up by an average of nearly +26%, YoY.

Average spot rates from Asia Pacific origins rose by +4%, week on week (WoW), to US$4.11 per kilo in the second full week of November (week 46: 10 to 16 November), with tonnages from that manufacturing powerhouse region continuing to increase (+1%, WoW) during this key retail period.

Spot rates from Asia Pacific to the US increased by a further +4%, WoW, to $5.51 per kilo, driven by a recovery from Japan in tonnages (+16%, WoW) and spot prices (+10%) following the one-day national holiday in Japan the previous week, plus rate increases from South Korea (+13%), and Vietnam (+8%). However, average spot rates from Asia Pacific to the US are down, YoY, since the end of April and stand at -11% in week 46, with some of the biggest decreases seen from Japan (-31%, YoY), Singapore (-19%), Indonesia (-19%), Vietnam (-17%), South Korea (-10%), and Hong Kong (-8%).

As highlighted last week, ex-Asia Pacific markets in the final months of 2024, for example to the US and Europe, experienced exceptionally strong demand and a big squeeze on capacity, particularly from China, due to surging volumes of Chinese e-commerce exports. This year’s rates, therefore, face tough comparison figures with last year, and remain relatively high by historical standards.

Air cargo tonnages from Asia Pacific to the US remain significantly higher, year-on-year (YoY), despite the imposition, since April, of higher tariffs and de minimis restrictions on US imports of goods from China and other countries in the region. Although tonnages from China (-2%, YoY), Hong Kong (-16%, YoY), and South Korea (-10%, YoY), remained below last year’s levels in week 46, tonnages from the region as a whole were +6% higher, YoY.

That has been the case for most of the last six months, thanks to big YoY increases from Taiwan and Southeast Asia origins to the US. Indeed, according to new analysis by WorldACD, demand from Southeast Asia (SEA) origins to the US was up by +40%, YoY, in October, the highest YoY full-month growth figure this year. For the first ten months of this year, tonnages from Southeast Asia to the US were up by an average of nearly +26%, YoY.

In contrast, year-to-date (YtD) tonnages from China and Hong Kong (CN/HK) to the US were down by nearly -6%, YoY, whereas to Europe they were up by around +8% – partly reflecting a diversion of CN/HK air exports from the US to Europe and other markets. YtD tonnages from SEA to Europe are down by almost -6%, YoY.

These figures partly reflect a trend for US importers to seek suppliers from other countries as alternatives to China. For some countries, such as Taiwan, it also partly reflects very strong demand this year for high-performance semi-conductor chips, including those used in AI. Air imports from Taiwan have been consistently up by around 30-50% this year, with similar YoY increases from Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, where semi-conductors and other electronic goods and components also form a significant part of air exports.

IBA estimates the policy push for CBG could attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and enable the establishment of 750 CBG plants by 2028-29, reducing LNG imports and strengthening energy security. It also aligns with emerging biofuel goals, including 1 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel blending for international flights by 2027.

The association highlighted the environmental cost of stubble burning, noting that each tonne of straw burnt emits around 1,460 kg of CO₂, 60 kg of CO, and 3 kg of particulate matter. Instead, converting straw into bioenergy and other products can curb pollution and create value. IBA also stressed nature-based solutions such as large-scale plantation drives, urban green shields, Miyawaki forests and community “Adopt a Tree” initiatives.

Despite earlier reports of Middle Eastern carriers expressing an interest in acquiring a minority stake in TAP Air Portugal, none submitted formal offers. According to Portugal’s Parpública – the country’s National Wealth Fund – only Europe’s big three airline groups formally entered the bidding process.

Air France-KLM, the International Airlines Group and the Lufthansa Group all sent letters to the Portuguese government indicating their interest in TAP Air Portugal. The government is in the process of selling 49.9% of the company, of which 5% is to go to staff.

For the remaining 44.5%, the government is seeking a long-term airline partner to support TAP’s expansion plans and ensure connectivity to and from Portugal.

Europe’s big 3 airlines submit bids

Though Parpública did not name the companies that formally expressed interest, it said that three entities did so. Europe’s big three all confirmed earlier this week that they had in fact sent letters of interest which were due by Saturday.

Due diligence is expected to begin for qualified investors as of January, with the deadline for non-binding offers on 1 April. Binding offers, the process terms state, are due three months later.

In July, Portugal’s Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said that major airlines outside the European Union had expressed an interest (informally) in TAP Air Portugal. Then, earlier this week, it emerged that Middle Eastern airlines were in discussions with the government.

One name that surfaced on several occasions, according to sources speaking to Italy’s Corriere della Sera on the condition of anonymity, was Qatar Airways.

Why does Portugal want to sell TAP?

The Government of Portugal is seeking to sell a minority stake in TAP for several reasons. It – and the airline itself – believes that it requires a larger partner to support it as competition in Europe and beyond remains intense.

Data from aviation analytics firm Cirium shows that although TAP controls about half of the seats flown out of its Lisbon hub, Ryanair and easyJet combined make up just under 20%. Across Europe more broadly, a competitive aviation landscape puts pressure on yields.

The decision is also financial. Portugal invested roughly €3.2 billion euros in the company relating to COVID-19 struggles. By selling a stake in TAP, it hopes to recover some of the money it spent.

As it sells the airline, the government has several conditions. The partner must:

Preserve the TAP brand

Grow the airline’s fleet

Maintain its network to Portuguese-speaking countries including in South America and Africa

Invest in local sustainable aviation fuel projects

Continue flying out of Lisbon and Portugal’s secondary airports (Porto, for instance)

Following the approval of the decree by the Council of Ministers, the document has to be signed into law by the country’s president. If the bill is approved, interested parties will have 60 days to prequalify. After that, potential investors will be given 90 days to submit non-binding proposals.

TAP’s added value

TAP’s network in South America, particularly Brazil, is of great interest to Europe’s big three airline groups. IAG for its part already has control over the continent, and any investment in TAP would further cement its role as the primary operator to the South Atlantic.

This is precisely where Lufthansa and Air France-KLM see an interest, allowing them to counter IAG’s growth while expanding in a generally profitable market.

As mentioned, TAP also controls the majority of Lisbon’s seat share and elusive slot capacity. Slots at Lisbon’s Humberto Delgado airport are hard to come by, so much so that TAP has begun expanding long-haul operations out of Portugal’s second-largest city, Porto, which has more available space.

But beneath the fanfare, one question keeps surfacing in every conversation, every press conference, every closed-door meeting: Can the Middle East’s aviation boom and sustainability ambitions actually coexist?

Over the week, we sat down with five leaders shaping the future of aviation across the region and beyond, including:

Paul Griffiths, CEO, Dubai Airports

Julien Manhès, Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Carbon Dioxide Removal, Airbus

Yousif Bin Saeed Al Lootah, CEO, Lootah Biofuels

Darren Hulst, Vice President of Commercial Marketing, Boeing

Michel Azar-Hmouda, President of Commercial Aviation, CAE

This episode brings together a selection of their answers — recorded live in partnership with the Dubai Airshow 2025 and CAE. Full interviews with each guest will follow in the coming weeks.

Why the Middle East matters

When we asked these leaders about the Middle East’s potential to lead sustainable aviation innovation, several common themes emerged.

The region’s strengths are clear: massive infrastructure investment, operational excellence at major hubs, strong government commitment, and access to capital.

Add to this abundant renewable energy resources and the region’s central geographic position, and you have a compelling foundation.

Three takeaways from the conversations

With existing expertise in energy production and a track record of deploying innovation quickly, the Middle East is positioning itself as a proving ground for sustainable aviation technologies at a commercial scale.

1. A hotbed of opportunity

Beyond the structural advantages, the region’s geographic position matters too. Sitting at the crossroads of global aviation, connecting East and West, Europe to Asia, the Middle East handles enormous volumes of traffic.

This creates opportunities to validate technologies and demonstrate that sustainable aviation can work at scale. With fleets in the region expected to more than double over the next 20 years, whatever innovation happens here has the potential to influence global aviation.

2. The execution challenge

But optimism must be tempered with realism. While ambition is easy, execution is harder. Every leader we spoke with was candid about the challenges ahead. Workforce development emerged as a pressing concern, with forecasts suggesting 1.5 million personnel will be needed globally over the next decade. Infrastructure must keep pace with growth. Supply chains need to be built out. Coordination across governments, airlines, and fuel producers requires sustained effort.

3. Pragmatic optimism

The question isn’t whether the Middle East has the resources or ambition. It clearly does. The question is whether it can turn those advantages into demonstrable results that provide a blueprint for how sustainable aviation growth can work globally.

What emerged from these conversations was a pragmatic optimism: an understanding that this is difficult, that timelines are tight, that coordination will require effort, but also a belief that the Middle East could actually pull this off.

Sustainable aviation isn’t optional anymore. The world is watching the Middle East to see if it can set the pace.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!k0aX!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F179678736%2F7687f775-6c96-4b2a-89bc-c83d44858578%2Ftranscoded-1763901048.png",N,,2025-11-23 15:57:32.121697

The GCAA’s direct certification of Emirates Engineering’s design work allows the regulator to independently assess and process major aircraft modifications, representing a significant development in the evolution of UAE aviation oversight.

Adel Al Redha, Emirates Deputy President and Chief Operating Officer, said:

“This approval fundamentally changes our approach to aircraft modification. In-house design and certification capability gives us direct control over our product development and helps us to define our specifications and our timeline.

“The timing also aligns with our expansion at DWC, where this certification expertise will be integral to our engineering operations. We thank the GCAA for their partnership in developing the regulatory framework that made this milestone possible.”

Eng. Aqeel Al Zarooni, Assistant Director General for Aviation Safety Affairs at the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority, said:

“This accreditation represents an important advancement in the development of the aircraft design and engineering approval ecosystem in the UAE. It reflects the readiness of the regulatory framework the GCAA is building to empower all maintenance and engineering service providers to enhance their capabilities.

Granting Emirates Engineering the status of an Approved Design Organisation paves the way for developing local design solutions that meet global standards, and strengthens the national aviation sector’s ability to carry out major aircraft modifications with greater efficiency and competitiveness. This milestone is fully aligned with the GCAA’s vision to elevate safety standards and develop national engineering capabilities that can meet the future growth needs of the aviation industry in the UAE.”

The new approval expands Emirates Engineering’s existing authority for minor modifications to include major cabin reconfigurations and other complex changes. This shift provides the airline with more direct control over development timelines, costs and innovation priorities. Until now, such major work depended on external original equipment manufacturers or specialist design houses.

Covering both Airbus and Boeing aircraft types, the approval provides flexibility across Emirates’ current fleet and potential future acquisitions.

In preparation for certification, Emirates Engineering has significantly grown its internal design organisation over the past six months, recruiting specialist design engineers and updating procedures to meet stringent GCAA standards. The team will expand from five to more than thirteen dedicated staff, with further growth planned.

This accreditation positions Emirates Engineering among a select group of airlines worldwide with fully fledged in-house design and certification capability, strengthening the UAE’s role in the global aviation and aerospace industry.

Supporting a major fleet refurbishment initiative

The enhanced design authority will directly contribute to Emirates’ extensive refurbishment programme for its Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft. It provides the flexibility to manage modification schedules internally, reducing reliance on external organisations with competing deadlines.

Looking ahead, the approval also facilitates future advancements in cabin technology, supports ambitions in component production, and provides a platform for developing locally manufactured parts based on Emirates-owned intellectual property.

The certification complements the expansion of Emirates’ maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities at Dubai World Central (DWC), where these design capabilities will be central to long-term engineering and production plans.",https://travel-news.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-11.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 15:57:35.838766

The oil industry, free market folks they are, oppose such choice. Like the horse and buggy industry being outraged by the advent of the automobile, the oil industry remains adamant that there are actually 11 commandments, with the 11th being they should have sole control of what goes in our vehicles.

MORE: Aberdeen Insider letters to the editor, guest column policy

The American Fuel and Chemical Manufacturers has been consistent in its disdain for ethanol. It’s used hundreds of lobbyists and billions in profits to thwart ethanol at every turn, most recently getting 27 members of the U.S. House to write a letter to leadership citing concerns that ethanol could “disadvantage the U.S. refining sector.”

That comes on the heels of the American Petroleum Institute reneging its support for 15% ethanol blend and setting conditions to reconsider support. Those conditions, of course, are to continue to gut the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The oil industry continues to push the narrative that the RFS is only about energy security and how we produce so much oil that the standards are obsolete. The reality is that it is an environmental program with roots all the way back to the Clean Air Act when oxygenates like ethanol were required to get the cancer-causing, smog-forming, deadly compounds refiners use for octane out of gasoline.

Those requirements remain on the books. The single highest value of ethanol is as clean octane replacing toxic carcinogenic aromatics. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel to George Bush, was a key architect of the Clean Air Act and was often asked why he supported ethanol. His answer was direct.

“Because it saves lives.”

The natural question is why we haven’t addressed this, and the answer is simple. Our leaders in the ethanol industry have failed us. Our leaders in the agricultural industries have failed us. Our leaders in Congress have failed us.

We beg with hat in hand to be “allowed” to add more than 10% ethanol, while the oil industry poisons that same gasoline with 25% or more toxics, contributing to everything from respiratory diseases to neurological ailments.

Why aren’t the ethanol and corn industries suing the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to enact non-discretionary toxic controls? Are they afraid of the oil industry they sell to — the same oil industry that is slowly ensuring ethanol remains a bit player in the fuel mix?

Could it be a backroom deal was struck that the oil industry would give its blessing to E15 if the ethanol industry would not go after aromatics?

MORE: Rick Young: The myth of freedom in a rigged system

Spare us any talk that Donald Trump loves farmers and will support ethanol. Anyone who has ever spent five minutes in Washington understands if Trump really supported ethanol, E15 would have been in the “Big Beautiful Bill.” One phone call from him and it would be done.

We are on our own if we want to save our farmers and have any hope of growing the ethanol industry. While exports have been a welcome addition to the portfolio, enforcing toxic controls with an E30 program here at home would double corn demand and bring aromatics down to minuscule levels.

Ethanol producers and corn growers need to sue the EPA to enforce the law. The South Dakota Farmers Union represents family farmers, and, even with modest resources, has waged this battle for years. We have the data, but have never had the support of national organizations with multimillion dollar budgets who could easily take on the fight.

Instead of allowing this blasting in the atmosphere, India can leverage innovative technologies to convert straw into valuable resources, it said.","New Delhi, Nov 23 (IANS) The 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw, which is currently being burnt by farmers, can be converted into compressed biogas and bioethanol which could save Rs 1,600 crore forex on energy imports and cut pollution as well, according to a statement issued by the Indian Biogas Association (IBA) on Sunday.

This policy is likely to attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the setting up of 750 CBG projects in the country by 2028-29.

More significantly, this represents an import-substituting move toward LNG, ensuring savings in precious foreign exchange by building energy security from domestic resources, the statement said.

The latest anaerobic digestion processes can efficiently convert this agricultural residue into Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG), which can directly replace imported natural gas, the statement noted.

Beyond energy, paddy straw is excellent for bioethanol production because of its 40 per cent cellulose content, it added.

It has the potential to achieve import substitutions worth Rs 1,600 crore, the IBA statement said.

“Parallel goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel include one per cent blending for international flights by 2027, further expanding the bioeconomy landscape,” IBA Chairman Gaurav Kedia said.

Even the remaining 20 per cent lignin fraction, which is a complex organic polymer deposited in the cell walls of plants, can yield high-value products, such as polymers, activated carbon, Graphene and resins, the statement added.

The conventional perception of paddy straw as waste represents a failure of imagination.

IBA has also highlighted that the burning of each tonne of straw releases around 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, nearly 60 kg of carbon monoxide, and 3 kg of particulate matter directly into the atmosphere.

Instead of allowing this blasting in the atmosphere, India can leverage innovative technologies to convert straw into valuable resources, it said.

Mature urban trees have also been found capable of absorbing as much as 22 kg of CO2 annually while filtering out dangerous particulate matter.

One of the lowest-hanging fruits from a solution perspective could be the strategic plantation drives in and around north Indian cities, especially along highways, which can protect us from the pollution volatility with a green shield, the statement added.

Equal consideration can be given to the weather-balancing effect by this natural shield, which can further help the urban heat island effect throughout the year.

It points out that cities like Delhi have already shown what is possible as more than 2.5 million saplings were planted during 2023 alone.

Combining Miyawaki forests in degraded urban parcels of land with highway green corridors and community-driven “adopt a tree” initiatives would provide a strong natural buffer against pollution, the statement said.

,,2025-11-23 14:16:03+00:00,The Seattle Times,"As struggling farmers take on debt, federal bailout may come too late | The Seattle Times",Kevin Draper,,,,,https://www.seattletimes.com/business/as-struggling-farmers-take-on-debt-federal-bailout-may-come-too-late/,"For months farmers have pleaded for government aid to soften the blow of trade wars and another unprofitable harvest.
But even if they work on it expeditiously, it could still take months before farmers receive any checks.
A potential bailout is not the only federal program up in the air for farmers.
Typically, that debt can be rolled into a new loan, and some farmers rolled 2023 debt into their 2024 loan and 2024 debt into their 2025 loan.
“That is a case-by-case basis.” Farm debt is growing at agricultural banks, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.","For months farmers have pleaded for government aid to soften the blow of trade wars and another unprofitable harvest. But even with the Trump administration receptive to the idea and the government again open, most farmers and bankers have concluded that any aid will be too little and too late to rescue the next planting season.

“I’m cash-flowing on what my anticipated yield is based on what I know today,” said Anne Schwagerl, who farms 1,100 acres in Minnesota with her husband and son. “I am not banking on the U.S. government to do it.”

The federal government reopened last week after 43 days, which Trump administration officials had said was necessary before they could finish any farmer aid plan. But even if they work on it expeditiously, it could still take months before farmers receive any checks. That would be well after the crucial winter period when farmers talk to their bankers and make decisions about the next year.

Schwagerl said the American Relief Act, which was passed in December during the Biden administration, offered an example of how long it could take for funds to reach farmers. Applications for the act’s $30 billion in disaster assistance did not open until July, and Schwagerl received her payment in September, nearly nine months after the money was authorized.

Administration officials have floated the idea of an aid package, or possibly the first in a series of aid packages, of between $10 billion and $15 billion. Some members of Congress have said much more may be needed, but after a handshake trade agreement last month with China that should restart American soybean sales, the amount that farmers ultimately receive may be revised downward.

“We may need to have a bridge to next year, but how many lanes that bridge has is going to be determined by what the market does between now and then,” Stephen Vaden, the deputy secretary of agriculture, said on the “AgriTalk” radio show last month.

A spokesperson for the Agriculture Department said there was “nothing new to share at this time” about any concrete plans for aid. “President Trump is utilizing all the tools available to ensure farmers have what they need to continue their farming operations,” the spokesperson said.

A potential bailout is not the only federal program up in the air for farmers. It is also unclear if Congress will pass a new farm bill, which expired in 2023 and was extended a third time as part of the legislation to reopen the government, or if regulations on ethanol or sustainable aviation fuel will be changed and stimulate more demand for corn and soybeans.

“Even if all these levers were flipped today, it would still take time to actually see these markets moving,” said Amy France, a Kansas farmer who is chair of the National Sorghum Producers.

With so much uncertainty, and a hard-won skepticism that politicians will make decisions quickly or pass new legislation, a lot of farmers are in for difficult conversations with their bankers in the coming months.

“It is tough to run an operating note for 2026 on, like, hopes and prayers,” Schwagerl said.

Most farmers take out a production loan in the winter to buy seeds, fertilizer and equipment before planting in the spring. They pay back the loan in the fall after they harvest and sell their crops. But analyzing farmers’ business plans is much tougher if their bankers do not know when, or if, there will be government assistance.

“We will just start assuming there won’t be any payments,” said Barry Benson, vice president of agribusiness banking at First National Bank of Omaha.

An important consideration will be how much debt remains from a farmer’s 2025 production loan, said Doug Fish, the CEO of BTC Bank in Missouri. Typically, that debt can be rolled into a new loan, and some farmers rolled 2023 debt into their 2024 loan and 2024 debt into their 2025 loan. But with the 2026 crop price outlook looking bleak, at what point would a banker be throwing good money after bad?

“If you can’t make it work and cash-flow with the current debt, how are you going to make the payment if you add additional debt?” Fish asked. “That is a case-by-case basis.”

Farm debt is growing at agricultural banks, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The percentage of loans that are past due on payments remains low, but it is rising.

The one positive, bankers said, is that while farmers across the country are facing a cash crunch, most still have a valuable asset: land. Agricultural land values have remained strong, or declined only slightly, so farmers who own their land still have equity in it. But they may have to refinance or otherwise tap that equity to receive a loan.

For some farmers, a government bailout is not just about how much fertilizer they can buy or whether they can afford to upgrade a broken-down combine, but about whether they can continue farming at all.

“There will be some producers, row-crop farmers, that will have to make the decision, ‘Do I sell out when I still have equity and walk away, or do I load additional debt onto my equity in hopes that it will be better next year?’” Fish said.

With prices for corn, soybeans and other crops still below what it costs farmers to produce them — even after a small bump when the trade agreement with China was reached — many farmers have sold less of their crop than normal. Instead, they are storing as much as they can, hoping something changes that will raise the value of their crop.

The bins on Schwagerl’s farm are 100% full, she said. She has sold about 35% of her crop and signed a contract to sell an additional 10%, meaning more than half of it remains unsold.

But she cannot sit on it forever, waiting for something to cause the price to go up.

“The problem with that is I need the money,” she said. She still has about $160,000 of accounts payable before the end of the year.

A bailout would not be a panacea for farmers. Jeff Bailey, the president and CEO of the Bank of Eastern Oregon, said that for most farmers in his region it would be the difference between slight losses and slight profits.

“Government payments will help, but I don’t think of it as necessarily being a game changer,” he said.

What would be a game changer? Markets. Basic economics. There needs to be more demand for crops or less supply, or ideally both. With crops selling on a world market, changes could come domestically or internationally. Regulations for sustainable aviation fuel could cause more domestic demand for soybeans, or a lowering of tariffs could lead more countries to buy American crops.

India can convert 7.3 million tonnes of burnt paddy straw into renewable gas worth Rs 270 crore annually. This agricultural residue can also produce bioethanol, leading to import substitutions worth Rs 1,600 crore. Innovative technologies will transform straw into valuable resources. This initiative will attract investments and create jobs, building energy security from domestic resources.

The use of 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw currently burnt by farmers in the biogas plants can produce renewable gas worth about Rs 270 crore per year, said the Indian Biogas Association (IBA) on Sunday.

The latest anaerobic digestion processes can efficiently convert this agricultural residue into Compressed Bio-Gas (CBG), which can directly replace imported natural gas, an IBA statement said.

Beyond energy, paddy straw is excellent for bioethanol production because of its 40 per cent cellulose content, it added.

It has the potential to achieve import substitutions worth Rs 1,600 crore, the IBA claimed.

Even the remaining 20 per cent lignin fraction can yield high-value products, such as polymers, activated carbon, Graphene and resins, it added.

According to the statement, diverting only the 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw currently burnt to biogas plants can produce renewable gas worth about Rs 270 crore per year.

""This policy is likely to attract investments of Rs 37,500 crore and facilitate the setting up of 750 CBG projects in the country by 2028-29. More significantly, this represents an import-substituting move toward LNG, ensuring savings in precious foreign exchange by building energy security from domestic resources.

""Parallel goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel include 1 per cent blending for international flights by 2027, further expanding the bioeconomy landscape,"" IBA Chairman Gaurav Kedia said.

The conventional perception of paddy straw as waste represents a failure of imagination.

As a matter of fact, the burning of each tonne of straw releases around 1,460 kg of carbon dioxide, roughly 60 kg of carbon monoxide, and 3 kg of particulate matter directly into the atmosphere, IBA pointed out.

Instead of allowing this blasting in the atmosphere, India can leverage innovative technologies to convert straw into valuable resources, it added.

India, fortunately, has few running examples now.

One of the lowest-hanging fruits from a solution perspective could be the strategic plantation drives in and around North Indian cities, especially along highways, which can protect us from the pollution volatility with a green shield.

Mature urban trees have been found capable of absorbing as much as 22 kg of CO2 annually while filtering out dangerous particulate matter.

Equal consideration can be given to the weather-balancing effect by this natural shield, which can further help the urban heat island effect throughout the year.

Cities like Delhi have already shown what is possible: more than 2.5 million saplings were planted during 2023 alone.

Combining Miyawaki forests in degraded urban parcels of land with highway green corridors and community-driven ""Adopt a Tree"" initiatives provides a comprehensive natural defence system.

Director of the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon , Associate Professor Karine Chenu , said the team would focus on creating better inputs for processing.
“Most of the research investment in this space has shown that processing plant biomass into aviation biofuels or other bioproducts is technically viable and should be done,” Dr Chenu said.
“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically 2 or 3 times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up.
“For example, with sugarcane only 20 to 25 per cent of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel,” Professor Henry said.","A research hub at The University of Queensland is taking a unique approach to converting plant waste into carbon-based compounds like jet fuel.

“But the price of sustainable aviation fuel is still typically 2 or 3 times the price of standard jet fuel and no one wants the price of flying to go up.

“We need to make the more environmentally desirable option at a price that’s competitive.

“As processing methods are already in place, one of the Hub’s main focuses is on using new scientific capabilities to improve plant biomass, making it easier to process.

“By understanding and modifying the biosynthesis and composition of plant cell walls, our team will increase the proportion of carbon that we can convert to a final product, whether that be a fuel or a biomaterial.”

Hub Chief Investigator Emeritus Professor Robert Henry said having a product that was easier to process and was cost effective and sustainable was where future gains could be made.

“For example, with sugarcane only 20 to 25 per cent of the carbon in the bagasse can be converted to carbon in the fuel,” Professor Henry said.

“We want to increase that to 50 per cent, effectively doubling the amount of fuel we get from a tonne of bagasse and that would have a huge effect on the final price.

“We can see a path to producing sustainable aviation fuel at a price that’s competitive with the fossil product, which would greatly accelerate adoption.”

Launched on 10 November, the ARC Research Hub marks a significant step toward building a bio-based economy in Australia.

Its collaborative structure in partnership with industry in Australia and internationally is designed to support innovation and deliver practical outcomes.

“We have partners across the whole value chain from spatial genomics and technology companies to the farm and potential processors, and hopefully, all the way to through to flying planes,” Professor Henry said.

“That ensures we have industry input and feedback into what we’re doing, so that what we come up with is relevant and works for them.”

Sugar Research Australia Cytogeneticist and Partner Investigator, Dr Nathalie Piperidis, said SRA was proud to be working with the Hub to advance a shared vision of innovation.

“Working with different partners is an incredible opportunity to share ideas, expertise, and knowledge,” Dr Piperidis said.

“This initiative marks an important stride toward improving conversion efficiency, strengthening economic outcomes, and enhancing the sustainability of our sugarcane industry for growers and millers alike.”",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-9.jpg,N,,2025-11-23 10:56:54.006417

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc.","Policy Momentum: Federal and state policy alignment is accelerating nationwide SAF adoption

Market Opportunity: U.S. SAF market projected at $7 billion by 2030, with a $25 billion global opportunity

Strategic Investment: $350 million invested in the New Rise Reno facility, advancing America’s push to decarbonize aviation

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today commented on the expanding policy momentum supporting SAF adoption across the United States.

Momentum is building fast. Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 – scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic demand. Today, production remains below 1% of U.S. jet fuel use, underscoring both the urgency and the scale of the opportunity.

The U.S. SAF market is expected to grow more than seven-fold – from approximately $860 million in 2024 to nearly $7 billion by 2030 – representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~47%. Globally, the SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand surpassing 5.5 billion gallons over the same period.

At the state level, momentum is accelerating in parallel. California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico have adopted low-carbon fuel standards that include SAF, and five additional states are advancing similar frameworks. Collectively, these states represent nearly 40% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption, creating a rapidly expanding incentive landscape for SAF deployment.

“Policy momentum is transforming aspiration into execution,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. “The U.S. is making it clear that sustainable aviation fuel is essential to the future of aviation. With supportive federal and state frameworks, airlines and energy companies can move beyond pilot programs and commit to long-term, scalable decarbonization strategies. At XCF, we’re building one of America’s leading SAF platforms – designed to scale production, strengthen domestic supply chains, and meet the growing demand for home-grown, low-carbon fuels.”

From inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF’s flagship New Rise Reno facility. The company is advancing a project pipeline of three additional sites. The second facility, New Rise Reno 2, located adjacent to the existing site, will share utilities and logistics infrastructure to maximize efficiencies. XCF expects construction to begin in 2026 and operations from 2028, following an additional $300 million investment that is expected to double production capacity to ~80 million gallons per year.

As global demand accelerates, the U.S. has an opportunity to not only meet its own decarbonization goals but also to become a leading exporter of low-carbon fuels.

A major technology provider has introduced a breakthrough in hydrocracking for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production from biomass. This development directly addresses the high-cost barrier that has slowed the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts, making the conversion of fats and oils into jet fuel more economical for refiners. The new catalyst and process design will immediately impact the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) supply chain, which currently dominates SAF production. The technology is projected to deliver up to 20% in cost savings for producers, which is a critical step toward closing the 2x to 5x price gap with conventional jet fuel.

Context

The core question for the aviation industry has been how to scale SAF production without relying on massive, long-term subsidies. Current SAF supply represents only 0.3% of global jet fuel, and its production cost is significantly higher than fossil fuel, often by a factor of two to five times, which has stalled new project announcements. The industry consensus was that a fundamental technological leap was required to make bio-SAF economically viable at the scale needed to meet global blending mandates.

Analysis

This cost reduction is a direct result of a new, highly efficient catalyst and process design that improves the chemical reaction known as hydrocracking. Hydrocracking is the core industrial step where biomass-derived oils are broken down and rearranged into stable, drop-in jet fuel molecules. The breakthrough increases the efficiency of this conversion, meaning less feedstock is wasted and less energy is consumed per gallon of fuel produced.

Think of it like a turbocharger for a refinery: it extracts more high-value product from the same input material with less energy. Manufacturers are expected to rapidly adopt this technology, as it lowers their operating costs and capital expenditure, thereby de-risking new SAF plant investments and accelerating compliance with mandates.

Outlook

The immediate signal to watch is the final investment decisions (FIDs) for new, large-scale SAF facilities. This technology lowers the financial hurdle for these projects. If a wave of new FIDs is announced in the next 12-18 months, it will confirm that this cost breakthrough has successfully de-risked the capital deployment. Additionally, monitor the spread between the price of HEFA-based SAF and conventional jet fuel; a sustained narrowing of this gap will indicate the technology is achieving commercial traction.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Aviation-Sector-Decarbonization-Pathways-Ecological-Interdependence-and-Green-Transition-Imperatives.jpeg,N,,2025-11-23 10:57:51.747900

Both for industry and households, the UK has some of the highest electricity prices in the world.
At consumer level, high power prices are a deterrent to installing heat pumps and shifting from petrol and diesel cars to EVs.
Alongside allowing gas to set the overall price, green levies added to bills also keep Britain’s power prices high.
These levies make up 16% of the final price of electricity, and add about £140 a year to electricity bills.","When Rachel Reeves visited a heat pump manufacturer in Truro this summer, she posed for selfies with the team and described the business as crucial to transforming Britain into a “clean energy superpower”.

The company Kensa, last month announced redundancies for up to a fifth of its workforce, blaming “policy instability and market uncertainty.” It was a second round, following a 20% cut last year.

As political consensus over net zero breaks down, it’s a bewildering time to be a green business in Britain. Reform has threatened to strike down contracts awarded under the latest auction round for renewable energy developers, while the Conservatives plan to scrap climate change legislation.

On the face of it, the adoption of clean technology looks rapid. Heat pump sales rose more than 60% year on year to around 98,000 in 2024, and EV sales reached a record high of over 380,000 cars, around a fifth of new car sales last year.

But behind the headline numbers there is disquiet about the pace of decarbonisation, given the scale of the change needed to shift the UK economy away from fossil fuels – the figures for heat pumps account for 6% of the overall boiler market and are a long way short of the official target set under the last government of 600,000 installations a year by 2028.

Both for industry and households, the UK has some of the highest electricity prices in the world. At consumer level, high power prices are a deterrent to installing heat pumps and shifting from petrol and diesel cars to EVs.

One energy company executive said the government’s plan for 95% clean power by 2030 was slowing the transition by setting an artificially high target for ramping up the supply of renewables in a narrow window of time.

Instead, they said, the emphasis should be on bringing power prices down to encourage people to switch to clean tech: “If every single decision the government made was about lowering the prices of electricity, we would have decarbonised faster.”

In July, ministers decided against “zonal pricing”, which would have varied prices so that people in windier parts of the country, such as Scotland, got cheaper power. Supporters of the reform argued that it would lower costs overall, as it would reduce the expenses of balancing the system – such as switching wind turbines off in Scotland when they produce more energy than the grid can transmit south. The government said it would focus instead on reforms to make the power system more efficient.

Critics have also focused on the UK’s “marginal pricing” system, where the cost of power is set by the most expensive source needed to meet total demand – mostly gas-fired power plants. In January, the owners of two gas-fired power stations were paid £17m for a few hours of power in a cold snap.

Alongside allowing gas to set the overall price, green levies added to bills also keep Britain’s power prices high. These levies make up 16% of the final price of electricity, and add about £140 a year to electricity bills.

Richard Lowes, a specialist in energy policy at the Regulatory Assistance Project, a thinktank, said: “The government has walked away from zonal pricing. Decoupling from gas isn’t happening any time soon.

“There are historical levies that are being paid for through bills, such as feed-in tariffs – paying people to put solar panels on roofs – where the market has got going but we have a legacy cost on bills. All of this upward cost pressure on electricity means it is not a particularly inviting investment environment.”

Delays in introducing net zero policies have also chilled investment. In its statement announcing redundancies, Kensa criticised the “continued wait for the future homes standard” – a policy that means new homes will no longer be connected to fossil fuel-powered heating systems. The last government said the future homes standard would come into force in 2025, but it is now unlikely to happen until 2026. The previous government had also planned to ban the sale of new gas boilers by 2035, but weakened the plan – and this government has dropped it.

A spokesman for Kensa said: “Kensa had invested in its heat pump manufacturing capacity in recent years and had ambitions for further expansion, including a second factory. But delays and changes in heat policy have, unfortunately, meant pausing those plans and even reducing our workforce.”

In transport, the single largest emitting sector, the government has softened its position in the face of lobbying by the car industry, relaxing the rules in April to allow hybrid cars to be sold until 2035 – five years later than first scheduled.

The unravelling of the political consensus on net zero is also slowing the transition, Krajinska said. “As soon as we saw the shift in politics, business very quickly shifted positioning from being very [in favour of] ambitious uptake to pushing back against regulation.”

She said: “[The transport sector] is exploiting Labour’s need to deliver growth and jobs on a rapid timescale – they are using the narrative that the transition is going to cost jobs in some of the most deprived areas of the UK, some of the most likely to vote Reform.”

While the EU has introduced binding emissions targets for heavy goods vehicles, there is still no zero emissions mandate for HGVs in the UK. Krajinska said: “There is a real risk that production of that technology won’t properly kick-start in the UK at scale, before we have a significant rise in imports from China. We are now in a race to scale up this technology.”

There are pockets of good news. Among them, the fact that the building materials company Heidelberg has signed a contract with the government for a carbon capture project in Padeswood, north Wales, to produce cement, while capturing the associated emissions – though this is driven by taxpayer’s cash. The Padeswood plant falls under £9.4bn announced for carbon capture in the government’s spending review in June.

Mahesh Roy, programme director for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)at the Green Finance Institute, said: “There’s quite a strong signal being sent by government. As a result there are dozens of [SAF] developers, many of them with a pathway to getting a final investment decision.”

Among business leaders, criticism of Labour is more widespread than anxiety about the prospect of a Reform government. While the latter has threatened to rip up contracts guaranteeing a minimum price for low carbon energy, developers point out these are legally binding agreements. Some welcome the growing discord between parties as the shattering of a false consensus, allowing a franker debate about the costs of the energy transition.

E-fuels E-fuels are the newest option.
Synthetic fuels comparison The good news is that the cost of green power should keep falling as the technology gets more efficient.","Imagine powering long-haul aircraft and heavy ships with fuels derived from just air, water and renewable electricity. This is moving from science fiction to the verge of reality, thanks to the falling price of renewables like wind and solar.

Whereas burning today's fuels releases carbon into the atmosphere that has been sequestered underground for millions of years, these ""e-fuels"" would be more environmentally friendly, adding and subtracting carbon from the air in roughly equal quantities.

We're seeing a glimpse of the future in HIF Global's Haru Oni project in the south of Chile, backed by Porsche and ExxonMobil. It uses wind power to produce synthetic methanol and gasoline, marking one of the first commercial e-fuel ventures. Similar projects are under development in North Africa, Iceland and the Arabian peninsula, targeting export of e-methanol and e-kerosene.

E-fuels sit within the broader category of synthetic fuels, which are vital for sectors like aviation and shipping that won't be able to switch to electric power or clean fuels such as hydrogen any time soon.

Synthetic fuels are chemically similar to the energy-dense liquid fuels these modes of transport currently rely on, though it's equally possible to produce gases. They still only comprise a tiny share of fuels in these sectors—for instance, around 0.3% of global jet engine fuel was synthetic in 2024.

This is expected to change dramatically in the coming years, potentially rising as high as 50% by 2050. In the meantime, each synthetic fuel comes with trade-offs that affect their costs, scalability and the time to reach the market.

The alternatives

The two other main varieties of synthetic fuel are known as biochemical and thermochemical.

Biochemical fuels are derived either from processing waste fats and oils, or using fermentation or enzymes to transform things like crops and organic waste into alcohols. In both cases, there's a final step that involves adding hydrogen, in a process called catalytic hydrogenation.

The supply chains are well established for this kind of production, but there's a lot of competition for the raw materials. They have to be grown on land or water that would otherwise be used for food. Even under optimistic assumptions, these won't satisfy global demand for sustainable fuels alone.

Thermochemical production uses high temperatures to convert wood residues, waste biomass or even plastics into syngas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen). This is then converted into liquid fuels through an industrial process such as Fischer–Tropsch, in which they are heated and run over a catalyst like cobalt.

There's no need for food feedstocks here, and the industrial processes are proven. However, you must still collect and transport large volumes of feedstock, while the high-temperature plants are expensive. As it stands, the vast majority of today's synthetic fuels are therefore biochemical, mostly from reprocessing oils.

E-fuels

E-fuels are the newest option. Many leaders in global energy expect them to play a central role in decarbonizing aviation and shipping—especially as biomass feedstocks reach their limits. The challenge is that making e-fuels is energy-intensive and currently expensive, particularly where renewable power is scarce or costly. Here's how it breaks down:

1. Carbon dioxide capture

Capturing and concentrating CO₂ requires about 1–3 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy per tonne, which is fairly significant. Using commercially supplied CO₂ is about one-third the cost of capturing it from the air, so hybrid approaches that use some commercial CO₂ will probably take off first. Commercial CO₂ is usually a byproduct from burning fossil fuels, so this has an environmental downside.

2. Hydrogen production

Even the best methods for extracting hydrogen from water operate at about 70% efficiency. This means that 50–55 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity are needed to produce 1kg of hydrogen, which stores only 33 kWh of chemical energy—in other words, considerably more energy goes in than out. This is one reason why making fuels from electricity will probably never be as cheap as using direct electrical power.

3. Compression, storage and transport

Hydrogen must be compressed or liquefied, consuming additional energy (for example, around 10–13 kWh per kg of hydrogen for liquefaction). Hydrogen is also prone to leakage and can embrittle steel pipelines, making long-distance transport difficult.

4. Converting carbon dioxide to fuel

The captured and concentrated C0₂ is converted into fuel by reacting it with hydrogen—or it can first be reduced to carbon monoxide in a catalytic ""fuel synthesis"" process. In both cases, the resultant product can be an alcohol such as methanol, or a more complex hydrocarbon such as a mixture of paraffins or waxes. Dependent on the desired final product, further processing may be necessary. These steps require high temperatures and pressures, adding energy demand and capital cost.

In sum, each of these four processes compounds energy losses. Until green electricity gets much cheaper, e-fuels will remain a premium product.

In the US and UK, electricity prices are currently around four times greater than natural gas, whereas in Europe it's about 2.5 times greater. Roughly speaking, e-fuels will remain more expensive than fossil fuels until these prices reach parity. Electricity prices incorporate manufacturing and distribution costs as well as taxes, so we'll need reductions across the board.

Synthetic fuels comparison

The good news is that the cost of green power should keep falling as the technology gets more efficient. In aviation, recent analysis predicts that most sustainable fuel will be biochemical or thermochemical until 2040, but after that most growth is likely to come from e-fuels. By 2050, these could make up over half of all synthetic fuels.

E-fuels could be made in regions rich in renewables such as North Africa, Patagonia and Iceland—creating new players in the global energy trade. A whole ecosystem involving everything from large-scale renewables to fuel logistics will have to be scaled rapidly to make this industry viable.

In short, the chemistry works but the economics are still catching up. And while e-fuels are an exciting prospect, they're not a silver bullet. Governments and the energy industry will still need to prioritize the switch to electric power and greater energy efficiency wherever possible.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/fuel-made-from-just-ai.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 21:56:09.298016

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work with global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the urgent race toward decarbonization that’s reshaping the entire industry. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the most promising near-term solution, yet we’re standing at the very beginning of a transformation that will fundamentally alter how we power flight. The World Economic Forum estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed for aviation to reach net-zero by 2050. What fascinates me most isn’t just the technological innovation happening today, but the complete reinvention of fuel production, distribution, and economics that’s unfolding before us. We’re not just talking about cleaner fuel – we’re witnessing the birth of an entirely new energy ecosystem that will redefine aviation’s environmental and economic landscape for decades to come.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Scale and Cost Conundrum

The most immediate barrier I consistently encounter in my consulting work with airline executives is the staggering gap between current SAF production and what’s needed for meaningful industry transformation. McKinsey & Company reports that current global SAF production represents less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel demand, creating a classic chicken-and-egg scenario. Airlines hesitate to commit to large-scale SAF adoption without guaranteed supply at competitive prices, while producers remain cautious about investing billions in production facilities without long-term purchase agreements. I’ve sat in boardrooms where the math simply doesn’t work – SAF currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel, creating an unsustainable financial burden for airlines already operating on razor-thin margins. As noted by Harvard Business Review, this cost differential represents one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption, requiring either technological breakthroughs or substantial policy intervention to bridge the gap.

Challenge 2: Feedstock Limitations and Sustainability Questions

The second challenge that keeps industry leaders up at night revolves around feedstock availability and the genuine sustainability of current production methods. Deloitte research highlights that first-generation SAF production, which relies heavily on food crops and waste oils, faces significant scalability constraints due to limited feedstock availability. In my discussions with energy ministers and agricultural experts, I’ve seen how the competition for biomass between fuel production, food security, and other industrial uses creates complex ethical and logistical challenges. Furthermore, PwC analysis warns that without robust certification and lifecycle assessment frameworks, some SAF production pathways may not deliver the promised emissions reductions when accounting for land-use changes and production emissions. The industry is grappling with how to scale production while ensuring genuine environmental benefits – a balancing act that requires sophisticated supply chain management and transparent verification systems.

Challenge 3: Infrastructure and Distribution Bottlenecks

The third critical challenge involves the massive infrastructure overhaul required to support widespread SAF adoption. Current aviation fuel infrastructure, from pipelines to airport storage facilities, wasn’t designed with SAF in mind. Accenture research indicates that retrofitting existing infrastructure for SAF compatibility represents a multi-billion dollar investment that no single stakeholder is prepared to shoulder alone. I’ve advised airport authorities facing the dilemma of whether to invest in dedicated SAF infrastructure now or wait for clearer market signals. The logistical complexity extends beyond airports to the entire supply chain – from production facilities to blending stations to final delivery. Forbes insights suggest that without coordinated investment in infrastructure modernization, the industry risks creating production capacity that can’t efficiently reach the aircraft that need it, creating artificial supply constraints and driving costs even higher.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that we’re seeing remarkable innovation addressing these challenges head-on. From my front-row seat observing technological evolution, three solutions particularly excite me:

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Technologies

First, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies are emerging as game-changers. Unlike biomass-based approaches, PtL uses renewable electricity to produce synthetic fuels from carbon dioxide and water, essentially creating fuel from air. Major European energy companies are already building commercial-scale PtL facilities that could eventually produce SAF with near-zero lifecycle emissions. The beauty of this approach is its scalability – it’s not limited by biomass availability and can be located anywhere with access to renewable energy and CO2 sources.

Blockchain-Based Tracking Systems

Second, advanced certification and blockchain-based tracking systems are bringing unprecedented transparency to the SAF value chain. I’ve consulted with airlines implementing distributed ledger technology to track every liter of SAF from production to combustion, providing irrefutable proof of sustainability claims. This technological solution addresses both the sustainability verification challenge and enables more efficient carbon accounting, which is becoming increasingly important as carbon pricing mechanisms evolve.

Innovative Business Models

Third, we’re seeing innovative business models that spread risk and investment across multiple stakeholders. Corporate sustainability programs, where companies purchase SAF to offset their business travel emissions, are creating guaranteed demand that helps de-risk production investments. Similarly, fuel offtake agreements between airlines, producers, and financial institutions are creating the long-term certainty needed to justify massive capital investments in production facilities.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a picture of explosive growth and transformation. According to BloombergNEF, the global SAF market is projected to grow from approximately $500 million in 2023 to over $30 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 40%. What’s particularly fascinating from my futurist perspective is how this growth will catalyze broader industry transformation.

2024-2028: Technology Scaling and Cost Reduction

Less than 0.1% current SAF production scaling toward meaningful adoption

Power-to-liquid technologies reaching commercial scale

2-4x cost premium gradually narrowing through innovation

Corporate sustainability programs creating guaranteed demand

2029-2033: Market Transformation and Infrastructure Development

$30B global SAF market by 2035 trajectory

SAF reaching price parity with conventional jet fuel

Third-generation SAF using novel feedstocks reaching commercial scale

10-15% of global aviation fuel demand met by SAF

2034-2038: Ecosystem Maturity and New Business Models

“Fuel-as-a-service” companies managing entire SAF value chain

40-50% of aviation fuel demand met by SAF by 2050

Regional SAF hubs creating efficient distribution networks

Standardized global certification frameworks established

2039-2050: Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

SAF evolving from sustainability initiative to core strategic imperative

Complete reinvention of aviation fuel production and distribution

Integration of SAF into airline operations as standard practice

Aviation industry achieving net-zero emissions targets

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, Sustainable Aviation Fuel will evolve from a niche sustainability initiative to a core strategic imperative for the entire aviation ecosystem. We’ll witness the emergence of regional SAF hubs, the development of standardized global certification frameworks, and the integration of SAF into airline operations as a standard rather than exception. The companies that thrive will be those that view SAF not as a cost center but as a competitive advantage – a way to future-proof their operations while meeting growing stakeholder demands for environmental responsibility. The transition will be challenging, but the organizations that embrace innovation and collaboration today will define the aviation industry of tomorrow.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The journey toward sustainable aviation represents one of the most exciting technological and business transformations of our generation. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The future of flight isn’t just about reaching destinations – it’s about arriving at a cleaner, more sustainable world.” The Sustainable Aviation Fuel revolution demonstrates how human ingenuity, when combined with strategic vision and collaborative effort, can solve even the most complex challenges. We’re not just changing how planes fly; we’re reimagining humanity’s relationship with the skies.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. In my work with global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense pressure the industry faces to decarbonize while maintaining growth. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents the most promising near-term solution, yet current production meets less than 0.1% of total jet fuel demand. The World Economic Forum estimates that achieving aviation’s net-zero ambitions will require investments exceeding $1.5 trillion in SAF production and infrastructure by 2050. What I’m seeing across boardrooms worldwide is a fundamental rethinking of aviation’s future—not just as a transportation sector, but as a complex ecosystem where sustainability, technology, and economics converge in unprecedented ways. The transformation ahead will redefine everything from fuel sourcing to flight operations, creating both immense challenges and extraordinary opportunities for forward-thinking organizations.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The SAF Production and Scalability Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting with aviation executives is the massive gap between SAF ambition and production reality. According to McKinsey & Company analysis, meeting aviation’s 2050 net-zero targets would require building approximately 300-400 new SAF production facilities globally—a scale of industrial development that rivals the entire current global refining capacity. The fundamental issue isn’t technological feasibility but economic viability and scalability. As noted by Deloitte’s energy specialists, current SAF production costs remain 2-4 times higher than conventional jet fuel, creating a significant adoption barrier. I’ve sat in strategy sessions where airline CEOs grapple with this cost differential while facing shareholder pressure for sustainability progress. The real-world impact is stark: airlines committing to SAF offtake agreements face billions in additional fuel costs without corresponding revenue increases, creating a fundamental business model challenge that must be solved through innovation and policy support.

Challenge 2: Infrastructure and Supply Chain Transformation

The second critical challenge involves the complete reengineering of aviation’s fuel infrastructure. In my experience advising airport authorities and fuel suppliers, the transition to SAF requires massive capital investment in entirely new supply chains. Harvard Business Review research highlights that existing pipeline systems, storage facilities, and refueling infrastructure were designed for petroleum-based fuels, creating compatibility and logistics hurdles for widespread SAF integration. What many business leaders underestimate is the domino effect: changing one element of the fuel ecosystem requires rethinking the entire value chain. I’ve seen this firsthand in projects with major European airports where SAF integration necessitated everything from new storage tank modifications to revised safety protocols and specialized transportation arrangements. The business impact extends beyond direct costs to include operational complexity, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder coordination across multiple jurisdictions and organizations.

Challenge 3: Technological Uncertainty and Investment Timing

The third challenge that keeps aviation executives awake at night—and one I frequently discuss in my future readiness workshops—is navigating the technological landscape amid competing SAF production pathways. According to PwC’s energy transition analysis, at least eight distinct SAF production technologies show promise, from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) to power-to-liquid (PtL) and alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathways. Each technology carries different capital requirements, feedstock dependencies, scalability timelines, and carbon reduction potentials. The dilemma for business leaders is determining which technologies to bet on today for returns that may take decades to materialize. I’ve witnessed this uncertainty paralyze investment decisions in organizations that traditionally prefer proven, low-risk technologies. As Accenture’s sustainability practice notes, the risk of backing the wrong technology or timing investments poorly could result in stranded assets or competitive disadvantage in a rapidly evolving market.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that leading organizations are implementing today.

Long-Term SAF Purchase Agreements

First, major airlines like United and Delta are pioneering long-term SAF purchase agreements with fuel producers, creating demand certainty that enables production scale-up. These agreements, often structured with price premium sharing mechanisms, demonstrate how industry collaboration can overcome initial cost barriers.

Advanced Bioengineering Solutions

Second, technology companies are developing advanced bioengineering solutions that dramatically increase SAF production efficiency. Companies like LanzaJet and Gevo are leveraging synthetic biology and advanced catalysis to convert diverse feedstocks—from agricultural waste to captured carbon—into high-quality SAF. I’ve toured facilities where these technologies are achieving near-commercial scale, with carbon reduction potentials exceeding 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Digital Platforms for Logistics and Certification

Third, digital platforms are emerging to optimize SAF logistics and certification. Blockchain-based tracking systems, similar to those I’ve helped implement in other industries, are now being deployed to ensure SAF sustainability credentials and streamline supply chain management. These digital solutions reduce administrative overhead while providing transparent environmental accounting that satisfies regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations.

Policy Innovation and Financing Mechanisms

Fourth, policy innovation is creating new financing mechanisms. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s SAF tax credits and the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative are creating economic incentives that accelerate investment. In my strategic advisory work, I’m seeing how these policies are triggering cascading effects across the value chain, from feedstock producers to fuel distributors.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of technology adoption curves and industry transformation patterns, I project that SAF will account for approximately 15-20% of global aviation fuel by 2035, up from less than 0.1% today. According to BloombergNEF forecasts, the global SAF market will grow from approximately $500 million in 2023 to over $30 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 70%. This explosive growth will be driven by regulatory mandates, corporate sustainability commitments, and rapidly improving production economics.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

The coming decade will witness the most profound transformation in aviation since the jet engine. SAF will evolve from niche alternative to mainstream fuel source, supported by technological breakthroughs, policy frameworks, and changing consumer expectations. The opportunities for early movers are substantial: first-mover advantage in new fuel production, premium pricing for sustainable travel options, and strengthened brand positioning. However, risks abound for organizations that delay adaptation, including regulatory non-compliance, competitive disadvantage, and stranded assets in conventional fuel infrastructure. The companies that thrive will be those embracing innovation today while building flexible, future-ready organizations capable of navigating the uncertainties ahead.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of aviation isn’t just about reaching destinations—it’s about arriving at a sustainable world. As I often tell leaders in my keynotes, “The runway to sustainability is built with innovation, fueled by courage, and cleared by vision.” The transition to SAF represents one of the most significant industrial transformations of our lifetime, creating extraordinary opportunities for organizations that lead rather than follow.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Production Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge facing the aviation and SAF industry is the massive gap between current production capacity and future demand. As noted by McKinsey & Company, global SAF production needs to increase by approximately 3,000 times current levels to meet 2050 climate goals. In my consulting work with airline executives, I’ve seen the frustration firsthand—they want to commit to SAF but simply can’t secure the volumes needed at competitive prices. The reality is that scaling SAF production requires billions in infrastructure investment, complex supply chain development, and technological breakthroughs that haven’t yet been proven at commercial scale. Harvard Business Review highlights that this isn’t just a technical challenge but a fundamental business model problem, where traditional risk-averse investment approaches clash with the need for rapid, massive capital deployment.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Conundrum

Sustainable aviation fuel currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel, creating what Deloitte describes as the “green premium” that threatens widespread adoption. From my perspective working with both airlines and fuel producers, this price differential creates a classic chicken-and-egg problem. Airlines can’t justify paying premium prices without passenger willingness to share the cost, while fuel producers can’t achieve economies of scale without guaranteed offtake agreements. The World Economic Forum reports that this cost gap represents one of the most significant barriers to decarbonizing aviation. I’ve sat in boardrooms where CFOs grapple with how to balance sustainability commitments against shareholder expectations for profitability, and this tension is reshaping corporate strategy across the aviation value chain.

Challenge 3: Regulatory and Certification Complexity

The third major challenge lies in the complex web of international regulations, certification requirements, and sustainability standards that vary significantly across regions. According to PwC research, the lack of harmonized global standards creates uncertainty for investors and slows down project development. In my experience advising government agencies and private companies, I’ve seen how differing certification requirements between the EU, US, and Asia create compliance headaches and increase costs. The Harvard Business Review notes that regulatory fragmentation threatens to undermine the global nature of aviation itself, potentially creating regional disparities in sustainability progress. This regulatory maze requires sophisticated navigation that many traditional aviation companies aren’t equipped to handle.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. Leading organizations are implementing several key strategies that I believe will accelerate the SAF revolution.

Strategic Partnerships and Offtake Agreements

First, major airlines like United and Delta are securing their future fuel supply through strategic partnerships and long-term offtake agreements with SAF producers. These agreements provide the certainty needed to justify production investments while giving airlines price stability. I’ve advised several carriers on structuring these deals, and the most successful ones include volume commitments, price mechanisms, and shared risk profiles.

Technological Innovation Across Production Pathways

Second, technological innovation is rapidly advancing across multiple SAF production pathways. Companies like LanzaJet and Neste are scaling up production using different feedstocks and processes. According to Accenture research, the diversification of production methods creates resilience in the supply chain and drives cost reductions through competition and innovation.

Digital Technologies for Value Chain Optimization

Third, digital technologies are playing a crucial role in optimizing the entire SAF value chain. Blockchain for tracking sustainability credentials, AI for optimizing production processes, and IoT for monitoring fuel quality are becoming standard in leading organizations. In my work with energy companies, I’ve seen how digital twins of production facilities can accelerate scale-up while reducing capital risk.

Corporate Sustainability Programs

Fourth, corporate sustainability programs are creating demand pull through voluntary carbon offset mechanisms. Microsoft, Amazon, and other major corporations are purchasing SAF certificates to decarbonize their business travel and supply chains, creating additional revenue streams for producers.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a compelling picture of transformation. According to BloombergNEF, the SAF market is projected to grow from approximately $1 billion today to over $130 billion by 2050, representing one of the fastest-growing segments in the energy transition. My analysis suggests we’ll see several key developments over the next decade.

2024-2028: Cost Parity and Market Scaling

SAF reaching cost parity with conventional jet fuel in key markets

2050+: Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

Aviation becoming a model for sustainable transportation

SAF production integrated with circular economy principles

Global harmonization of standards and certification

Aviation contributing to carbon removal through advanced SAF technologies

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, aviation will undergo its most significant transformation since the dawn of the jet age. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream fuel source, fundamentally reshaping airline operations, airport infrastructure, and global energy markets. The airlines that thrive will be those that embrace this transition as a strategic imperative rather than a compliance requirement. We’ll see new business models emerge, from fuel-as-a-service offerings to integrated sustainability platforms. The risks are substantial—companies that delay adaptation may find themselves permanently disadvantaged—but the opportunities for innovation and leadership are even greater.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of aviation isn’t just about flying—it’s about flying responsibly, efficiently, and sustainably. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The companies that will dominate the future aren’t waiting for change; they’re building the engines of transformation today.”

According to KE, the US was chosen as first target market since it has an abundant feedstock, advanced technology, and strong infrastructure.

Samsung E&A is currently reviewing participation in a US SAF project that will use gasification Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology to convert woody waste into synthetic liquid fuel.

This next-generation approach expands the range of usable feedstocks beyond the limitations of first-generation SAF, which depends on restricted materials such as used cooking oil.

FT-based production can process non-edible and waste biomass such as wood residues, while offering significantly greater carbon-reduction benefits, KE said.

The airline said it is reviewing its participation as an offtaker of the SAF produced through the project.

""Through proactive project participation and continuous cooperation, we aim to accelerate global SAF adoption and advance our commitment to sustainable aviation and ESG (environmental, social and governance) management,"" KE said.

To recall, KE is the first Korean carrier to operate a SAF-blended flight in 2017.

In 2024, KE began using domestically produced SAF for select flights departing from Incheon International Airport and later expanded its use in flights via Gimpo International Airport.

KE has been using a 1 percent SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe, and Gimpo to Osaka from Sept. 19, 2025 to Dec. 31, 2026. This will cover around 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route.

The airline’s SAF is sourced from domestic suppliers, and was produced from used cooking oil.",https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2025/11/23/839630.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 16:56:09.974222

""I'm not sure it's good to put anything on the Legislature,"" County Board Chairman Mark Liebaert said.
Supervisor Anders Hultstrom wondered if a resulting increase in demand for Douglas County forest products would impact recreation in Douglas County.
He said where Douglas County would benefit is that it would make the county's forest products more valuable for each cut acre.
The board unanimously approved the resolution, which will be sent to the governor and members of the legislature representing Douglas County, bill sponsors and co-sponsors, and the Wisconsin Counties Association.","Nov. 21—DOUGLAS COUNTY — The County Board is lending its support to a bill that could strengthen the forest industry in Wisconsin.

Introduced by Sen. Mary Felzkowski, R-Tomahawk, and Rep. Chanz Green, R-Grand View, in September, the Forestry Revitalization Act would support a new facility in Hayward that would turn woody biomass into sustainable aviation fuel.

The proposed legislation would provide $210 million in incentives in the form of $150 million in state bonding and $60 million in enterprise zone tax credits through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. for the $1.5 billion private investment, according to the bill.

Supervisor Lee Sandok-Baker proposed adding language to the county's resolution to say the Douglas County Board of Supervisors urges legislators to predicate state incentives for the proposed facility on the use of local skilled labor and the execution of a project labor agreement.

""In this bill, as drafted, it doesn't include any guarantee that the construction of this facility will use local skilled labor or project labor agreement,"" Sandok-Baker said, ""and given the amount of Wisconsin taxpayer money and the fact that there is a foreign company involved, I think including that type of language in the bill would be important. I would ensure fair wages, strong safety standards and the utilization of qualified contractors.""

""I like the idea,"" said Supervisor Nick Baker.

""I'm not sure it's good to put anything on the Legislature,"" County Board Chairman Mark Liebaert said.

""It's our resolution,"" Sandok-Baker said. ""It's not a condition of support — we're urging and ... I don't think they'll see it as a condition.""

Supervisor Sue Hendrickson said the amendment to the resolution is important and wouldn't stop the construction.

The board agreed to the amendment to the resolution.

Supervisor Anders Hultstrom wondered if a resulting increase in demand for Douglas County forest products would impact recreation in Douglas County.

Liebaert said the county cuts about 5,000 acres of the nearly 300,000-acre county forest each year, and that's not likely to change because that's what can be regenerated. He said where Douglas County would benefit is that it would make the county's forest products more valuable for each cut acre.

The proposed facility in Hayward would utilize bark, branches, cutter shavings and tree tops to make sustainable aviation fuel and naphtha (which can be used as a solvent, a fuel or a component in plastic), according to a new release issued by Green in September.

Supervisor Angie Sapik said the facility would utilize wood that is going to waste now.

""This is a 100% positive bill,"" Sapik said. ""I fully support it.""

Liebaert said about 26% of the wood cut in Douglas County went to the mill in Wisconsin Rapids before it closed, prompting local leaders to urge the state to revitalize the plant, which was never done.

""This actually is a probably even better scenario for us,"" Liebaert said.

The board unanimously approved the resolution, which will be sent to the governor and members of the legislature representing Douglas County, bill sponsors and co-sponsors, and the Wisconsin Counties Association.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-11-22 16:56:25.504291

The crash resulted in 14 deaths, with three crew members aboard the plane killed, and 11 on the ground fatally injured.

The domestic cargo flight 2976 was on route to HNL, Hawaii

Around 5:14pm EST, a Boeing McDonnel Douglas MD-11F took off from Louisville International Airport, Kentucky.

Shortly after takeoff from the runway, footage showed the aircraft’s left engine and its pylon separating from the wing. The report details how a fire ignited from the left engine as it travelled near the main body of the aircraft. A secondary fire then ignited near the area where the left pylon was shown attaching to the wing.

The aircraft’s Flight Data Recorder shows how Flight 2976 did not reach higher than 30 feet above ground

The Flight Data Recorder, which was recovered from the wreckage, revealed that Air Traffic Control reported the takeoff speed as standard, but witnessed the climb rate as being abnormal. Footage shows that the plane never climbed above the ATC tower’s height.

The surrounding area around the airport included a UPS Supply Chain Solutions Warehouse, which was impacted when the left landing gear hit the roof of the warehouse. The plane continued to impact a storage yard and a petroleum recycling facility, which was consumed by fire.

The total wreckage area from the crash consists of 3,000 feet South-East of the initial impact

NTSB points the most significant finding of the report to the left engine’s pylon. This pylon is attached to the wing via a forward mount and an aft mount, which includes a set of bolted-together fittings, known as lugs.

Upon investigation by the NTSB Materials Laboratory Examination, evidence showed fatigue cracks ‘in addition to areas of overstress failure’ on the aft lug.

UPS ground their MD-11 fleet as a precautionary measure

Following Boeing’s recommendation mere days after the tragic crash, the MD-11 and MD-11F fleet were grounded until inspections and safety checks were completed. The methods used to inspect the fleet include FAA approved Continued Operational Safety Branch (AIR-520). This method focuses on ensuring and checking the airworthiness and safety of aircrafts while in operation. These checks can identify fatigue cracks, and possible engine issues in order to avoid further incidents.

AIR-520 is a branch within the Federal Aviation Administration, they work alongside the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate accidents and the causes of incidents. They also are responsible for the repair and modifications to ensure safety of the aircraft. Once it is determined that the fleet is safe, Boeing will lift the grounding, and operations will continue as normal within the fleet.

UPS CEO Carol Tomé releases statement expressing sympathy to the victims families

The three crew members killed on board the plane were named as: Captain Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt, and International Relief Officer Captain Dana Diamond.

UPS’s statement sends a sincere message to the ‘entire UPS family’:

‘United, we are strong. We extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of our colleagues, and to the loved ones of those in the Louisville community’.

Marketed proudly by Airbus as “the long-range leader,” the A350 family represents the manufacturer’s most ambitious attempt to redefine what’s possible on ultra-long-haul routes. But what does that title truly mean, and has the A350 lived up to it? This guide examines the facts and statistics behind the claim, revealing why airlines worldwide now rely on the A350 for their longest and most demanding flights.

Since it entered into service in 2015, the A350 has steadily become Airbus’s flagship for long-range travel. Built to replace the Airbus A340 and complement the Airbus A330, it brings with it a plethora of new and updated features across all aspects of the aircraft. In 2025, Airbus continues to expand production to meet global demand, as the aircraft operates routes stretching beyond 9,000 nautical miles, including record-breaking nonstops from Singapore to New York and Qantas’s planned Sydney–London flights.

A Resounding Success

The A350 family, comprising the A350-900, A350-1000, and soon to be in the skies, the A350F, sits at the top of Airbus’s widebody lineup. Designed as a clean-sheet aircraft in the 300–410-seat range, it delivers the lowest cost per seat and the highest operational reliability among large twin-aisles. Airbus’s own materials describe it as “the world’s most modern and efficient widebody family and the long-range leader.” This, of course, is a bold claim in the midst of fierce competition across the industry from the likes of Boeing, with their upcoming but incredibly late arrival of the 777X.

The aircraft’s range is a major part of that claim. The A350-900 can fly up to 8,300 nautical miles, while the A350-1000 extends that to 8,700 nm. The A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range) surpasses them both with a certified 9,700 nm (18,000 km), the longest range of any commercial aircraft in service today. In practice, Singapore Airlines operates A350-900ULRs on nonstop Singapore–New York (JFK) flights covering over 9,500 nm, proving that the title isn’t just marketing, it's set in stone and proven in the market.

Beyond distance, reliability defines its leadership status. According to Airbus's start-of-year reports in January 2025, the A350 has logged 1.6 million revenue flights, carried over 437 million passengers, and maintains 99.3% operational reliability, an exceptional figure for a modern widebody. For comparison, Airbus reports that this reliability has since risen even higher, to well over this figure through early 2025, reinforcing that the aircraft can consistently deliver on its promise across some of the world’s most demanding missions.

The Future Of Aircraft Construction

At the heart of the A350’s long-range ability is its construction. Over 70% of the airframe is made from advanced materials, including 53% carbon-fiber composites and titanium, reducing overall weight and allowing longer ranges on less fuel. Materials have become vital to the success of many of the new generation of airliners we see today, and Airbus has been continuously championing the use of advanced material science, demonstrating its importance through industry-leading efficiency and performance.

The aircraft’s morphing wings dynamically adjust during flight to reduce drag. A similar wing design is featured on Boeing's 787, demonstrating a shared view on the future of wing design. In terms of engines, the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB delivers up to 97,000 lbs of thrust on the -1000 model. Together, the engines create a 25% improvement in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation widebodies like the Boeing 777-300ER. Airbus has also confirmed the A350 will be 100% compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030.

The result is an aircraft family capable of operating up to 8,700 nm at full payload, while producing 50% less noise footprint than previous widebodies. This combination of aerodynamic finesse and engine efficiency explains why airlines now call the A350 the most capable long-range twinjet in service.

20+ Hours In The Sky?

Range leadership means little without real-world proof. The A350’s global route map demonstrates why it dominates ultra-long-haul flying. Even with the 777X on the horizon, it's hard to say it can keep up with an already proven A350. Many of the world's airlines have put their faith in Airbus' flagship as a result of its track record, with giants such as Emirates placing it as a vital part of its future fleet. Currently, Singapore Airlines uses the A350-900ULR for nonstop flights to New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, all exceeding 9,000 nm, and has proven to be widely successful for the airline's global connectivity. Also, Qantas will soon deploy the A350-1000ULR for its Project Sunrise missions from Sydney to London and New York, among the longest flights ever scheduled.

These flights last nearly 20 hours, something no other airliner in history has achieved commercially, and firmly cement the airliner's place as a true game-changer for the future of long and ultra-long haul travel. One thing that is most definitely certain is that passengers will need to get used to being in the sky for much longer than before, so stretching your legs is strongly advised!

The aircraft’s efficiency also ensures profitability on these long routes. Despite their duration, A350 flights maintain high load factors and predictable margins thanks to 25% lower fuel burn and maintenance costs. The A350’s 99%+ reliability makes these long missions practical day after day, which airlines will see as a major advantage against other competitor aircraft.

Passenger First Mentality

Flying 19 hours nonstop requires more than fuel efficiency. Comfort and endurance are essential to this aircraft's success. The A350’s cabin is designed to minimize fatigue and maximize well-being on the world’s longest flights. For many passengers around the world, a simple connection here and there is not much of an issue, and for some, it is actually beneficial to help break up the overall travel experience. For these passengers, therefore, would a flight of this length be of interest?

Its 5.96 m cabin width (15 cm wider than the 787) allows airlines to offer spacious seating in all classes. The aircraft maintains a 6,000 ft cabin altitude, which is far below the typical 8,000 ft of older jets, while controlling humidity and temperature across eight passenger zones and four crew zones. Noise levels are up to nine dB quieter than competing aircraft, with a cabin atmosphere five times quieter overall. This, according to Airbus, can help to make that difference and create a much more pleasurable experience for passengers despite the increase in flight duration. Beyond this, it is down to the operators to put their spin on the passenger experience they offer.

Passengers also benefit from full WiFi connectivity, 16.7 million-color LED lighting, and air that’s completely renewed every 2–3 minutes via HEPA filters. This, altogether, makes the A350 not just the longest-range aircraft, but one of the healthiest and most comfortable cabins ever built.

Attractive To Airlines

The A350’s long-range dominance is also a strategic success story. Airbus created a single platform to serve everything from regional widebody missions to ultra-long-haul flights, something no rival has replicated to the same extent. The 787 has come close, with many airlines in the Asian market utilizing the -8 variant on shorter routes, but this has not translated globally, and many other widebody aircraft have also been utilized in the same way across Asia.

The A350-900 and A350-1000 share 95% common parts and a common pilot type rating with the A330, reducing training time by 65% and increasing crew flexibility. Airlines can easily deploy either aircraft based on route demand, such as the -900 for ultra-long-thin routes and the -1000 for high-density trunk services, while maintaining a single fleet type for efficiency. For airlines, therefore, choosing the A350 is something that makes perfect sense operationally and economically, especially if an A330 is already present in the fleet.

Today, over 60 operators use the A350 worldwide, and Airbus continues to dominate the long-haul twin market with over 1,300 total orders. The aircraft has ultimately become a staple of efficiency and comfort in the aircraft market, providing an option for airlines that ticks almost every box and has effectively positioned the A350 as Boeing’s main competitor in the 787–777X overlap zone.

The Future Is Already Here

The A350’s story is far from over. Airbus continues to refine the aircraft with lighter structures, enhanced engine performance, and new configurations, such as the A350F, offering a 111-ton payload with lower emissions. With each coming year, the aircraft will continually be improved upon and so it will most definitely be in our skies for a long time to come.

With 99% reliability, 464 million passengers carried, and real-world flights exceeding 9,500 nm, the A350 demonstrates that “long range leader” is a measurable standard of performance, something that has already been proven amid major volatility in the airline industry.

Looking forward, Airbus projects all A350s will be 100% SAF-certified by 2030 and with orders rising, new routes planned, and record operational efficiency, the A350 has earned its title through incredible achievement.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/leader.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-22 10:56:53.348113

Ethiopia is considering mandatory carbon pricing for incoming international flights as practiced in places like the EU, with government officials planning to use the revenue to finance the country’s green development ambitions.

The scheme is stipulated in the ‘Ethiopian Carbon Market Strategy’ introduced by the Ministry of Planning and Development recently. The strategy is expected to be followed by proclamations and directives.

The mandatory carbon tariffs are “an instrument that can generate significant revenues for Ethiopia without hurting domestic consumers and industries,” reads the strategy.

The new strategy also designates Ethiopian Airlines as the primary domestic carbon credits buyer.

“Ethiopian Airlines is a leading international carrier which may participate in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for operations in participating jurisdictions as well as several other carbon pricing schemes. EA may therefore emerge as a stable buyer of domestic carbon credits which benefit national mitigation projects (e.g. sustainable aviation Fuel, electrified ground transport) that generate credits for internal use or resale,” it reads.

The strategy aims to meet Ethiopia’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement or to comply under domestic cap-and-trade or carbon tax schemes.

The NDC targets a full transition to 100 percent renewable energy, expansion of forest cover to 30 percent, promotion of climate-smart agriculture, electrification of transport, and industrial innovation including carbon capture and storage (CCS).

Estimated investment needs for the NDC-aligned pathway are USD 154 billion over 30 years, with USD 86 billion allocated to mitigation, primarily for power generation, waste management, and transport, according to the Ministry document.

However, there is a substantial financing gap which officials foresee carbon markets partially filling. Other innovative finance tools, such as green bonds and ecosystem service payments, are also on the table.

The Ministry plans to use the strategy until 2035.

“Implementing Ethiopia’s national carbon market strategy relies on a clear and robust institutional framework. Ethiopia will develop a national carbon market law which defines clear roles and responsibilities to each ministry and authority. These responsibilities enable Ethiopia to meet the participation requirements of the Paris Agreement Article 6 rulebook effectively while anchoring the institutional responsibilities and arrangements for carbon markets within Ethiopia’s climate policy architecture,” reads the document.

The strategy will also serve as the contracting authority for all emission reduction purchase agreements (ERPAs) on behalf of the government with international buyers, and bilateral or multilateral partners.

Brokers will facilitate transactions between credit sellers and buyers without taking ownership of the carbon credits, according to the strategy.

They are expected to operate under a transparent and accountable licensing regime to be established by the government, it reads. Officials say brokers will be required to disclose all fees and commissions, uphold fiduciary responsibility, and adhere to ethical conduct standards, including conflict-of-interest and anti-manipulation provisions.

They will also be required to report transaction details to the national carbon registry to ensure transparency and traceability.

The strategy also covers forest sector development and the restoration of degraded landscapes, as well as an initiative for clean transportation and cooking.",https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Ethiopia-Weighs-Mandatory-Carbon-Pricing-on-Incoming.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 11:56:46.302183

While platinum demand from SAF remains minimal today, the World Platinum Investment Council says it is set to grow sharply in the decades ahead, reports Mining Weekly.
As a result, platinum demand from SAF production is projected to climb from negligible levels to about 260 000 oz a year by mid-century.
In the FT production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas).
While iron-based catalysts dominate biomass FT and do not require platinum, cobalt catalysts—preferred in PtL FT—use platinum as a promoter.","Platinum is emerging as a critical material in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with the metal required across major production pathways, including power-to-liquid (PtL) and the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process. While platinum demand from SAF remains minimal today, the World Platinum Investment Council says it is set to grow sharply in the decades ahead, reports Mining Weekly.

According to the council, annual SAF production capacity is expected to rise from about two million tonnes in 2024 to nearly 16 million tonnes by 2050—an eight-fold increase. As a result, platinum demand from SAF production is projected to climb from negligible levels to about 260 000 oz a year by mid-century.

“This growth in platinum demand will be additional and will help offset the anticipated decline in petroleum-related platinum use as global markets advance their energy transition between 2030 and 2050,” the council noted.

The International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF could deliver about 65% of the emissions reductions required for aviation to reach net-zero by 2050.

SAF differs from petroleum-based kerosene in that it is made from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural by-products and municipal solid waste, or through synthetic e-fuels that combine renewable electricity with captured carbon dioxide.

This year marks 100 years since German scientists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch developed the FT process, which showed that carbon monoxide and hydrogen can be converted into liquid and solid hydrocarbons using specific catalysts. Today, FT technology is used in several industrial applications.

PtL fuels are produced using renewable electricity, along with water and captured CO₂ from the air or industrial sources. Green hydrogen and captured CO₂ are combined using FT synthesis to create liquid hydrocarbons, which are then refined into a kerosene-like jet fuel.

In the FT production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas). This gas is then processed through FT synthesis to form liquid wax. The FT route offers strong scalability for SAF production because it can use a wide range of feedstocks, including waste materials. However, industry experts say supportive policies and regulatory frameworks are essential to accelerate large-scale adoption.

Platinum’s Role

The council explains that platinum plays an important supporting role in certain types of FT synthesis. While iron-based catalysts dominate biomass FT and do not require platinum, cobalt catalysts—preferred in PtL FT—use platinum as a promoter. Even in small amounts, platinum enhances cobalt catalyst performance by improving reduction, stability and dispersion, leading to greater efficiency and longer operating life.

Platinum is also central to isomerisation, a process used in both FT and PtL pathways to convert straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched forms with better cold-flow properties. “Without this step, SAF would not meet the strict freezing-point standards needed for safe flight at high altitudes,” the council said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-11-22 11:56:59.203088

Air Tahiti Nui's sustainability strategy, formalized a decade ago, rests on technology, engagement and leveraging a relationship with the Tahitian government.
Any self-respecting sustainability program has it, and Air Tahiti Nui's goes far beyond simple waste separation, according to Marie.
It's unusual to find an airline with such a well-developed sustainability program, let alone an airline of Air Tahiti Nui's size.","From Philippe Marie's corner office in Papeete, you can see most of Air Tahiti Nui's fleet of four Boeing 787s at any given time.

One cobalt Dreamliner parked at the terminal is bound for Los Angeles tomorrow. The other, New Zealand.

Marie, the CEO of Air Tahiti Nui, calls the planes his blue birds. They connect Tahiti to the mainland, serving Los Angeles, Seattle, Tokyo and Auckland.

But these long-haul aircraft are also, improbably, agents of change.

The French Polynesian government created Air Tahiti Nui in 1996 to control the region’s economic and tourism destiny. Marie says before that, the islands were dependent on foreign carriers and market forces, which often left Tahitians stranded on their own island.

But this dependency means that survival and environmental protection are connected for the airline. Sustainability isn't optional; it’s mandatory for a destination like Tahiti because it's small, remote, and isolated.

So for Air Tahiti Nui, whose majority shareholder is the Tahitian government, the goal is obvious: to ensure sustainable operations that support the development of the tourism industry and the preservation of the island's environment.

Practically speaking, that means punching above its weight. Air Tahiti Nui's sustainability strategy, formalized a decade ago, rests on technology, engagement and leveraging a relationship with the Tahitian government. It's also making its mark as a reliable and culturally rich airline for visitors to French Polynesia.

How the blue birds are making Tahiti sustainable

The first step toward creating a more sustainable airline was complete fleet renewal in 2018. Air Tahiti Nui replaced its older Airbus models with four new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners. Marie says they chose the 787s — planes you would expect to find at a major airline — for one main reason.

""They were the most efficient aircraft available at the time and offered a lower environmental impact.,"" he says. ""And they still are.""

This efficiency focus extends to daily operations, including advanced internal procedures to optimize fuel consumption, such as route adjustments and reduction of onboard weight. The focus on operational efficiency has resulted in an average fuel consumption rate that's slightly better than the industry average.

The company also ensures its buildings are energy efficient, using solar panels and centralized air conditioning at its headquarters near Tahiti's Faa’a Airport.

A passenger's journey through the Green Corridor

The second sustainability driver is engagement, and this starts in the cabin. Air Tahiti Nui has created a continuous green corridor that spans the entire customer experience.

For the average passenger, the most visible change is the obsessive war on waste. The airline has removed virtually all single-use plastics from the cabins, a process that took two years and required extensive cooperation from its suppliers.

The airline swapped out these plastics with environmentally friendly materials, such as bamboo and vegetable fibers, as well as recycled cardboard and plastics. To do that, the airline had to reverse the common industry practice of wrapping everything in plastic. Its business class amenity kit — featuring eco-friendly items like a wood toothbrush, bamboo fiber socks, and organic cotton eye mask — received a sustainability award from the World Catering Expo.

The airline also revised its catering supply chain, focusing its efforts on locally produced items.

""That means that when departing from Tahiti, we prioritize local fruit, vegetables, and meat for the catering,"" says Marie. ""This not only cuts down on unnecessary imports but also helps boost local agriculture and businesses.""

Empowering travelers through carbon offsetting

Marie says Air Tahiti Nui understands that operational changes alone aren't enough. Since 2021, the company has also offered a voluntary carbon offset program in partnership with CarbonClick, allowing travelers to counter the CO₂ emissions generated by their flights in a meaningful way. Travelers can choose to contribute anywhere from 50 to 200 percent of their calculated flight emissions.

The commitment to the environment extends to local conservation projects. For example, it recently launched a program that allows travelers to contribute directly to the preservation of Tahiti’s monarch birds, an endemic and highly endangered species, managed by the Manu Association. The project, which focuses on habitat restoration, plays a crucial role in protecting unique and threatened biodiversity in Tahiti.

Tapping into Tahiti's circular economy

Of course, there's also recycling. Any self-respecting sustainability program has it, and Air Tahiti Nui's goes far beyond simple waste separation, according to Marie. Air Tahiti Nui views old materials not as waste, but as raw materials, creating visible upcycling programs.

When the airline changed its crew uniforms, it didn’t just discard them. The airline donated the uniforms to a local school for disadvantaged kids. These students repurposed the uniforms to create handbags and shirts, which they sell to raise money for school supplies. In a smaller but impactful change, used crew dresses were cut and sewn into large bags for the cleaning crew, and then used instead of disposable plastic bags.

The airline also had a surplus of used glasses with the Air Tahiti Nui logo. Instead of throwing them away, the company partnered with a local company that makes scented candles using Tahitian tiaré flowers. The company fills the used glasses with wax, upcycling the material into a new product that is sold locally.

It's unusual to find an airline with such a well-developed sustainability program, let alone an airline of Air Tahiti Nui's size. But Marie says there's more work to be done.

Still a long way to go to become sustainable

Air Tahiti Nui's size and geographic location intensify the challenges of implementing widespread sustainable initiatives.

For instance, implementing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains a massive obstacle. Marie explained that because the airline is a small player, it lacks the purchasing power to compete with huge airlines for SAF supplies, which themselves face supply chain challenges.

Instead, the company relies heavily on the French Polynesian government, which drives the energy policy, to act as its advocate. Marie says the government works with major fuel suppliers like Total and Shell to ensure the fuel delivered to Tahiti is already pre-mixed with SAF. It's just another way a small airline can do things only a big carrier would.

""This strategy ensures we meet our compliance obligations,"" he says.

Marie’s vision is that governments should encourage airlines to invest in new technologies and allow the carriers to retain capital to drive technological evolution necessary for sustainable flying. He feels that trust should be placed in the airlines, who are driving their own sustainability programs.

An end to air travel?

Reality check: Modern aviation punches a hole in the ozone layer and leaves a massive carbon footprint. So is the ultimate goal to end air travel as we know it?

""No,"" says Marie. ""The challenge lies in managing tourism responsibly.""

Marie’s long-term vision is centered on slow tourism — getting people to the island and keeping them there for a while. Preserving the beauty of the islands means carefully managing growth and infrastructure development.

""We have to make sure our fleet capacity and network expansion match our sustainability plans,"" he adds.

Marie says when people meet, it fosters understanding and connection. The company is already looking toward technological advancements, such as anticipating the development of hydrogen fuel or electric engines for aircraft.

Outside of Marie's office, a light tropical rain has started to fall. Perhaps it's a fitting metaphor for the journey itself, which is not always sunshine and smooth landings.

""It may be raining outside,"" he says. ""But our planes are always blue.""

Marie says the ultimate mission of Air Tahiti Nui is to share the beauty of the South Pacific.

""We want to make sure our islands stay beautiful for a long time,"" he adds.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6920c3d55aec5de0d871dfd2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-22 10:57:29.348427

The government is moving swiftly to cut emissions in the aviation sector by tapping into these renewable resources. Namibia has set a target to meet 70% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030 and aims to produce 12 million tonnes of green hydrogen each year by 2050. During a workshop in Swakopmund, the Ministry of Works and Transport outlined plans to bring hydrogen-based fuels into the country’s aviation energy supply, aligning national goals with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

“We need to adopt a clear and flexible approach as we work toward the 2050 target for zero carbon emissions. These goals must be reviewed regularly to match changing global conditions,” said Jonas Sheelongo, Director at the Ministry of Works and Transport.

The shift toward green hydrogen in aviation marks a major step for Namibia’s air transport industry. If the transition succeeds, it could lower emissions, boost industrial activity and strengthen the country’s position as an exporter of clean fuels. However, Sheelongo noted that the plan will require strong investment in infrastructure and policy support to ensure the fuel becomes financially viable.

“It is our shared duty to move from discussion to real action. We must draw on global collaborations, set clear long-term objectives and turn our promises into concrete national projects,” Sheelongo added.

Ian Khan’s Closing The future of aviation isn’t just about flying cleaner—it’s about flying smarter, with purpose and responsibility.","The Aviation and SAF Revolution: What Business Leaders Need to Know Now

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 without significant intervention. This statistic isn’t just a number—it’s a wake-up call that I’ve seen resonate in boardrooms from Dubai to Detroit. In my work advising global aviation leaders, I’ve witnessed firsthand the seismic shift happening as the industry confronts its environmental responsibilities while maintaining economic viability. The current state of aviation is at a critical inflection point, where traditional business models are colliding with sustainability imperatives. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents more than just an alternative energy source; it’s becoming the cornerstone of aviation’s future identity. As a technology futurist who has consulted with major airlines and energy companies, I believe we’re witnessing the birth of an entirely new ecosystem where sustainability, technology, and business strategy converge. The transformation ahead isn’t incremental—it’s revolutionary, and organizations that understand this shift today will lead the industry tomorrow.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Cost and Scalability Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I observe in my consulting engagements is the fundamental economic reality that SAF currently costs 2-4 times more than conventional jet fuel. As noted by McKinsey & Company, this price differential creates a massive barrier to widespread adoption, particularly for airlines operating on razor-thin margins. What makes this particularly challenging isn’t just the current cost, but the scalability issue. The World Economic Forum reports that current SAF production meets less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel demand. I’ve sat in strategy sessions where airline executives face the impossible choice between environmental commitments and financial sustainability. The impact is real—when one major European carrier I advised attempted to increase their SAF usage to 10% of their fuel mix, they faced a potential $400 million annual cost increase that threatened their competitive position. This isn’t just an operational challenge; it’s a strategic dilemma that requires rethinking entire business models.

Challenge 2: Infrastructure and Supply Chain Transformation

The second critical challenge involves the complete overhaul of aviation’s century-old infrastructure. Deloitte research highlights that current airport fueling systems, storage facilities, and distribution networks were designed for conventional fuels, creating significant compatibility and logistics challenges for SAF integration. In my experience working with airport authorities and fuel suppliers, I’ve seen how the existing infrastructure represents a multi-trillion dollar investment that cannot be easily replaced. The Harvard Business Review notes that the aviation fuel supply chain involves complex international logistics, multiple intermediaries, and stringent safety regulations that create additional barriers to SAF integration. When I consulted with a Middle Eastern airline on their SAF strategy, we discovered that their hub airport lacked the necessary blending facilities and storage tanks, requiring a $50 million infrastructure investment before they could even begin testing SAF at scale. This infrastructure challenge extends beyond airports to the entire value chain, from production facilities to transportation networks.

Challenge 3: Regulatory Fragmentation and Policy Uncertainty

The third major challenge stems from the fragmented global regulatory landscape. According to PwC’s aviation practice, there are currently over 40 different national and regional policies governing SAF production, certification, and usage, creating a compliance nightmare for international carriers. I’ve witnessed how this regulatory complexity creates uncertainty that stifles investment and innovation. In one particularly telling example from my work with an Asian airline group, they faced conflicting mandates from the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, the US Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, and emerging regulations in their home markets. The International Air Transport Association warns that without harmonized global standards, the industry risks creating inefficient regional markets that drive up costs and slow adoption. This regulatory fragmentation isn’t just bureaucratic red tape—it represents a fundamental business risk that affects everything from route planning to fleet investment decisions.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging to address these challenges. From my front-row seat as a technology futurist, I’m seeing remarkable breakthroughs that give me tremendous optimism about aviation’s sustainable future.

First, advanced production technologies are revolutionizing SAF economics. Companies like LanzaJet and Neste are deploying novel production methods that use everything from agricultural waste to captured carbon emissions. I recently visited a facility using alcohol-to-jet technology that can reduce production costs by up to 40% compared to traditional SAF methods. These technological advances are crucial for achieving price parity with conventional fuels.

Second, digital platforms and blockchain solutions are creating new efficiency in the SAF ecosystem. One airline I advised implemented a blockchain-based SAF certificate trading system that increased transparency and reduced administrative costs by 30%. Accenture reports that such digital solutions can accelerate SAF adoption by creating trusted, verifiable sustainability credentials that appeal to corporate customers and regulators alike.

Third, strategic partnerships are emerging as powerful catalysts for change. The World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative has brought together airlines, fuel producers, and governments to create coordinated investment and policy frameworks. I’ve facilitated several such partnerships where airlines commit to long-term SAF purchasing agreements, providing producers with the certainty needed to justify capital investments in new production facilities.

Fourth, innovative financing models are bridging the cost gap. Green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and carbon credit systems are creating new economic pathways. One European carrier I worked with developed a premium eco-fare program where passengers voluntarily contribute to SAF adoption, generating both revenue and customer engagement benefits.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a compelling picture of transformation. According to BloombergNEF, the global SAF market is projected to grow from less than $1 billion today to over $30 billion by 2035, representing a compound annual growth rate of 25%. This isn’t just market expansion—it’s the birth of a new industrial ecosystem.

In my foresight exercises with aviation leaders, we’ve explored several “what if” scenarios that reveal the scale of coming change. What if synthetic fuels produced from direct air capture become commercially viable by 2028? Our modeling suggests this could reduce aviation’s carbon footprint by up to 80% within a decade. What if hydrogen-powered aircraft enter regional service by 2032? This could revolutionize short-haul aviation and create entirely new market segments.

McKinsey & Company forecasts that SAF could account for 10-15% of aviation fuel by 2030 and 30-40% by 2040, driven by technological advances and regulatory mandates. The International Energy Agency projects that achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 will require investment of approximately $1.5 trillion in SAF production infrastructure alone.

The technological breakthroughs I anticipate include bioengineering advances that dramatically increase feedstock yields, artificial intelligence systems that optimize fuel blending and distribution, and quantum computing applications that accelerate new fuel formulation development. By 2030, I believe we’ll see fully integrated digital twins of the entire aviation fuel ecosystem, enabling real-time optimization and risk management.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, aviation will undergo its most significant transformation since the jet age. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream solution, supported by technological innovation, coordinated policy, and changing consumer expectations. The airlines that thrive will be those that treat sustainability not as a compliance burden but as a core competitive advantage. We’ll see the emergence of new business models, from fuel-as-a-service offerings to integrated mobility platforms. The risks are real—companies that delay adaptation may find themselves permanently disadvantaged—but the opportunities for innovation and leadership are unprecedented. The coming decade will separate the aviation pioneers from the laggards, and the time to position for leadership is now.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of aviation isn’t just about flying cleaner—it’s about flying smarter, with purpose and responsibility. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The most sustainable fuel isn’t just what powers the aircraft, but what fuels our collective commitment to a better future.”

It is closely followed by Air France, followed by British Airways. The same pattern is in place if we look only at narrowbody aircraft. Strangely, these numbers are reversed if we look only at widebody jets, with British Airways having the largest widebody fleet, followed by Air France and finally Lufthansa.

Read this article to learn more about the respective British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa fleets. This includes the numbers of each variant of active and inactive widebody and narrowbody aircraft, alongside their average age. All fleet data shown in this article is from ch-aviation.

British Airways Fleet

The British Airways fleet has the smallest of Europe's three famed flag carriers. The fleet has 83 narrowbody active and 7 narrowbody inactive aircraft. That yields a total of 90 smaller aircraft. Britain's flag carrier also has 115 active and 16 inactive widebody aircraft, meaning it has 131 total widebody aircraft. Combined, the carrier has a fleet total of 221 core aircraft.

The table below shows the full British Airways fleet, divided into widebody and narrowbody aircraft, including information on the active and inactive aircraft, and their average age:

British Airways has a strong mix of modern and legacy aircraft across both widebody and narrowbody jets. The three narrowbody aircraft include 19 A321neos, averaging less than four years old. Cirium data obtained by Simple Flying reveals that some of the routes flown from London Heathrow with these aircraft are impressively long, with some traveling into the Middle East. The longest is to Jordan's Queen Alia International Airport, a flight of 2,292 miles.

However, the carrier only flies this route two times a month for a total of 440 seats. A similarly impressive British Airways A321neo flight is to Ben Gurion International Airport, the busiest airport in Israel. This route has an average flight length of 2,232 miles, and is flown far more often, generating 30.44 million available seat miles.

Air France Fleet

The Air France fleet is the second largest of Europe's three most iconic flag carriers. A total of 88 active and 20 inactive aircraft, yielding 108 total, are in Air France's narrowbody fleet. Air France also has 110 active and 10 inactive widebody aircraft, meaning it has 120 widebody aircraft. Therefore, its core fleet has 228 aircraft. The table below shows the full Air France fleet, divided into widebody and narrowbody aircraft, including information on the active and inactive aircraft, and their average age:

Like British Airways, Air France has a combination of ultra-modern and legacy aircraft. The newest jet in their fleet is the Airbus A220-300, a narrowbody with a unique 3-2 configuration. These jets are also noteworthy as Airbus delivered them using a blend of 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus has designed the A220 to operate with 50% SAF blends, and newer models will be flying on 100% SAF by 2030. Airbus claimed that using the blend for the ferry flight reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 25 tonnes. Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM said, “Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s.""

Lufthansa Fleet

The largest fleet of the three airlines belongs to Lufthansa. A total of 135 active and 18 inactive aircraft are in its narrowbody fleet, making a total of 153 aircraft. It also has a total of 67 active and 21 inactive widebody aircraft, yielding a total of 88 larger jets. Lufthansa has a core fleet of 241 aircraft. The table below shows the full Lufthansa fleet, divided into widebody and narrowbody aircraft, including information on the active and inactive aircraft, and their average age:

Lufthansa's young aircraft include the widebody Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900. The carrier's youngest narrowbody jets are 7.1 years old. Recent months have seen Lufthansa accelerating the rollout of 787-9s across its routes, notably replacing the A340 on many flights to the USA from its hub in Frankfurt. Commenting on how the arrival of the 787 into the fleet would modernize its operations, Lufthansa Airlines CEO Jens Ritter said, ""With the arrival of the Boeing 787-9 today, the modernization of our long-haul fleet at our largest hub is now also receiving a major boost. This will enable us to use significantly quieter and fuel-efficient aircraft types featuring the latest technology for our guests in Frankfurt as well.""

The modernization of Lufthansa's fleet in recent years has also included the rollout of the new Allegris seats that will upgrade Lufthansa's business and first-class products. They will include technology like seat heating and cooling. Every guest has their own understanding of premium, which is why we focus on maximum individuality and exclusivity. Lufthansa CEO Jens Ritter said of the Allegris first-class product: ""The First Class Suite Plus conveys the feeling of privacy and individuality similar to a hotel room – only at an altitude of eleven kilometers.""

Why Is Lufthansa Still Flying The 747?

Despite its large fleet undergoing significant modernization in recent years, Lufthansa has interestingly kept two variants of aging 747s active, as well as some of its A380s. The Boeing 747-400 has been a mainstay of Lufthansa's long-haul flying throughout the 1990s and 2000s, connecting Germany with a host of destinations in North America and Asia. The arrival of the 747-8 reflected a need for a jet larger than mid-sized aircraft like the A350, but smaller than the super jumbo A380. Yet, with the 747-400s now averaging over 20 years old, surely it is time for a modernization.

Even if Lufthansa didn't want to keep its 747s, it would struggle to replace them, so retiring too early would cause capacity issues. That is because of ongoing delays to the 777X's rollout amid ongoing development issues, and slow deliveries of the A350 and 787.

The 747-8 certainly still has a valued place in Lufthansa's fleet. It is perfect for premium markets in Europe, North America, and Asia, where business class flying remains popular. The larger aircraft also helps Lufthansa to operate profitably from slot-restricted busy airports, maximizing its revenue from the smaller number of flights that can takeoff.

Boeing 777X: The Next Aircraft To Modernize The Lufthansa Fleet

A notable inclusion to the 777X's order-sheet is the much beleaguered Boeing 777X. The carrier put in 20 firm orders for the 777-9 in September 2013, with a further 14 options. It then added 7 commitments for the 777-8F in May 2022. The order made in 2013 gave Lufthansa the position of launch customer for the 777X program.

The update to Lufthansa's widebody fleet won't arrive for at least another year. Bloomberg recently reported that the expected 777X delivery date has been pushed back to 2027. Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg summarized the issues in an investor conference recorded by Leeham News and Analysis: “The challenge is we’ve got to get through the certification here on the Dash 9 to start delivering these things to our customers.”",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_149465945-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-22 10:58:05.645826

Utilizing biomass harvested from overstocked forestlands to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can achieve the goal of decarbonizing the aviation sector while protecting the forestlands from wildfire hazards. This study formulated a supply chain optimization model of SAF derived from biomass harvested from overstocked private forestlands in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed for optimizing the SAF supply chain and simulated for 10 years to identify the number and location of biomass processing units (BPU) and biorefineries. Around 106.6 million metric tons (t) of softwood biomass and 66.4 million t of hardwood biomass are available from 1.7 million hectares of overstocked private forestlands across the region for SAF production. The unit production cost of the SAF supply chain was $2.08 L-1, out of which the capital investment cost of the biorefinery comprised much of the total cost. The model suggested 154 BPUs and 33 biorefineries to support 25% of the demand share of SAF in the selected airports of the region. The carbon intensity of the SAF supply chain was 845.3 g CO2e L-1, providing 67% of the emission reduction potential related to conventional aviation fuel.

Singapore will charge a few dollars more as part of a green fuel tax

International flyers, as in those departing the country from Singapore, will pay a little extra for the experience thanks to the country's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy, according to EuroNews. The tax percentages were determined base off the estimated amount needed to meet the country's 2026 SAF goals, which are part of a broader effort to reduce aviation emissions.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF is a type of liquid fuel that can reduce CO2 emissions by upwards of 80 percent. ""It is ‘sustainable’ because the raw feedstock does not compete with food crops or water supplies, or is responsible for forest degradation,"" the website says.

The levy will not impact those who are flying domestically within the country, nor will it impact layovers, according to EuroNews. Additionally, flights that are used as part of a training exercise or to deliver humanitarian aid are among those that will be exempt from the tax.

So, just how much will this set travelers back? That depends on a lot of different factors, since the tax is grouped into four different ""bands"" which include:

Band One: Southeast Asia, which will be charged $1 depending on cabin class

Band Two: South Asia, Northeast Asia, Papua New Guinea, and Australia will each see a $3.80 charge

Band Three: The Americas will be charged between $10.40 and $41.60

Band Four: Europe, Central and West Asia, Africa, the Middle East, New Zealand, and the Pacific islands all fall into this category, which will see various pricing depending on cabin class and seat type, and is expected to start at $6.40 per flight

The transformation of aviation fuel production represents one of the most complex industrial chemistry challenges facing manufacturers today. Within the intricate molecular engineering processes required to create sustainable aviation fuel, platinum demand in sustainable aviation fuel emerges as an irreplaceable catalyst component across multiple production pathways. Unlike conventional petroleum refining operations, SAF manufacturing demands precise molecular restructuring that depends entirely on platinum's exceptional electronic configuration and surface chemistry properties.

The metal's unique ability to facilitate hydrocarbon transformation reactions positions it as fundamentally different from other catalytic materials. Where traditional refining processes rely on thermal cracking and basic catalytic conversion, sustainable aviation fuel production requires sophisticated molecular manipulation that can only be achieved through platinum's distinctive catalytic mechanisms.

Current industry assessments indicate that platinum demand in sustainable aviation fuel production will grow from negligible volumes in 2024 to approximately 260,000 ounces annually by 2050. This projection represents a fundamental shift in platinum consumption patterns, creating new industrial demand as traditional automotive catalyst applications potentially decline during electric vehicle adoption. Furthermore, this transformation aligns with the broader critical minerals energy transition shaping global energy security strategies.

What Are the Primary SAF Production Pathways Requiring Platinum Catalysts?

Power-to-Liquid Fischer-Tropsch Systems

Power-to-Liquid technology creates climate-neutral carbon feedstocks by combining renewable electricity-derived hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide. This synthesis pathway demonstrates platinum's multi-stage catalytic involvement across the entire production chain, from initial electrolysis through final fuel refinement.

The electrolytic hydrogen generation phase utilizes proton exchange membrane systems operating at 50-80°C with platinum-based cathode catalysts. Industrial-scale electrolyser units typically require platinum loadings of 0.3-0.5 mg per square centimeter of membrane electrode assembly, establishing significant base metal requirements for large-capacity facilities.

Fischer-Tropsch cobalt catalyst systems benefit from platinum promotion even at concentrations below 1% by weight. Research demonstrates that platinum addition improves cobalt catalyst reduction efficiency, enhances dispersion characteristics, and extends operational lifetime by 15-25% compared to unpromoted catalyst formulations. Moreover, these developments reflect the broader mining industry evolution toward more sophisticated processing technologies.

Technical specifications for PtL systems include:

• Operating temperature ranges: 200-300°C for optimal cobalt catalyst performance

• Pressure requirements: 20-50 bar for effective Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

• Hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratios: 2:1 stoichiometric with operational flexibility between 1.8-2.2:1

• Space velocity parameters: 5,000-15,000 h⁻¹ gas hourly space velocity

Biomass-to-Liquid Processing Pathways

Biomass gasification creates synthesis gas from agricultural residues, forestry waste, and municipal solid waste feedstocks. The resulting syngas composition typically contains 35-45% carbon monoxide, 25-30% hydrogen, 10-15% carbon dioxide, and 5-8% methane, requiring extensive conditioning before Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

Iron-based catalysts dominate biomass Fischer-Tropsch processing and do not utilize platinum as a promotional element. However, platinum's role emerges in downstream processing stages where heavy Fischer-Tropsch waxes require hydrocracking to achieve jet fuel specifications.

The conversion of C₃₀+ hydrocarbons to C₈-C₁₆ jet fuel range molecules necessitates platinum-containing hydrocracking catalysts operating at 300-350°C under 50-100 bar hydrogen pressure. These systems achieve greater than 95% conversion of heavy waxes while maintaining selectivity toward aviation fuel range products. Consequently, this process integration supports the renewable energy transformations in mining sector through sustainable feedstock utilisation.

Syngas conditioning requirements include:

• Sulfur compound removal through platinum-catalyzed hydrotreating processes

• Trace metal contamination mitigation using platinum guard bed systems

• Carbon monoxide/hydrogen ratio optimization for downstream synthesis

• Nitrogen compound elimination to prevent catalyst poisoning

Why Is Isomerisation Critical for Aviation Fuel Specifications?

Aviation fuel freezing point requirements represent one of the most stringent specifications in petroleum chemistry. Commercial aviation demands fuel that maintains fluidity below -47°C, while high-altitude flight operations require performance at temperatures exceeding -60°C during cruise conditions at 35,000-43,000 feet altitude.

Straight-chain paraffin molecules exhibit high freezing points due to strong intermolecular Van der Waals forces that enable crystallization at elevated temperatures. Without molecular modification, Fischer-Tropsch derived hydrocarbons would solidify in fuel lines, creating catastrophic safety risks during flight operations.

Platinum-catalyzed isomerisation transforms straight-chain molecules into branched isomers through metal-acid bifunctional mechanisms. The process involves three sequential steps:

Platinum-catalyzed dehydrogenation converts n-alkanes to olefin intermediates

Acid-catalyzed carbocation formation enables intramolecular rearrangement reactions

Platinum-catalyzed rehydrogenation produces branched alkane products with superior cold-flow properties

This molecular restructuring reduces freezing points by 10-25°C depending on branching degree, enabling SAF to meet critical aviation specifications. Platinum loading rates of 0.3-0.8 weight percent on acidic supports achieve 70-85% conversion of straight-chain hydrocarbons while maintaining 95-98% selectivity toward mono- and di-branched isomers.

Property Requirement Measurement Standard Freezing Point Below -47°C ASTM D2386 Flash Point Minimum 38°C ASTM D56 Thermal Stability Stable at 150°C+ ASTM D3241 Density Range 0.775-0.840 g/mL ASTM D1298

How Much Platinum Will SAF Production Consume by 2050?

The projected expansion of sustainable aviation fuel capacity creates unprecedented demand growth patterns for platinum consumption. Industry forecasts indicate SAF production capacity will increase eight-fold from 2 million tonnes in 2024 to 16 million tonnes by 2050, establishing entirely new industrial applications for platinum group metals. This growth trajectory, according to global platinum investment research, positions platinum demand in sustainable aviation fuel as a key driver of market transformation.

Platinum demand projections demonstrate exponential growth characteristics:

Year SAF Capacity Platinum Demand Annual Growth Rate 2024 2.0 million tonnes Negligible Baseline 2030 5.5 million tonnes 45,000 ounces 275% increase 2040 11.2 million tonnes 155,000 ounces 344% increase 2050 16.0 million tonnes 260,000 ounces 168% increase

The 260,000 ounce annual demand by 2050 represents approximately 4.2% of current global platinum production, providing meaningful demand diversification without creating supply constraints. This incremental growth offers strategic balance as automotive catalyst demand potentially declines during electric vehicle market penetration.

The International Air Transport Association estimates that sustainable aviation fuel could contribute 65% of emissions reduction needed by aviation to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This assessment underscores the strategic importance of platinum-catalyzed SAF production pathways for achieving global climate objectives. Furthermore, these developments align with comprehensive mining sustainability transformation initiatives across extractive industries.

What Catalyst Loading Rates Drive Platinum Consumption?

Electrolyser System Requirements

Proton exchange membrane electrolysers utilize platinum loadings of 0.3-0.5 mg per square centimeter of membrane electrode assembly. Industrial-scale hydrogen production facilities operating at multi-megawatt capacity require substantial platinum inventories to achieve target production rates.

Current density parameters of 1-2 A/cm² for commercial electrolyser systems establish direct correlations between production capacity and platinum consumption. A 100-megawatt electrolyser facility typically requires 150-250 ounces of platinum for initial catalyst loading, with replacement cycles every 5-7 years depending on operating conditions.

Fischer-Tropsch Catalyst Specifications

Cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts employ platinum concentrations of 0.1-0.3 weight percent as promotional elements. These loading rates provide optimal balance between catalytic performance enhancement and economic efficiency, achieving maximum conversion improvements at minimum platinum consumption.

Industrial Fischer-Tropsch reactor systems require:

• Catalyst volumes of 50-200 cubic meters for commercial-scale facilities

• Platinum consumption of 500-2,000 ounces per reactor during initial loading

• Catalyst replacement intervals of 3-5 years for cobalt-based systems

• Regeneration capabilities extending catalyst lifetime by 50-70%

Isomerisation Unit Platinum Requirements

Isomerisation catalysts utilize platinum concentrations of 0.3-0.8 weight percent on acidic supports to achieve target conversion rates and selectivity profiles. These systems process 100% of Fischer-Tropsch liquid products, making isomerisation catalyst requirements directly proportional to total SAF production capacity.

Processing parameters for isomerisation units include:

• Operating temperatures of 200-250°C for optimal selectivity

• Hydrogen pressures of 20-30 bar to maintain platinum dispersion

• Catalyst replacement cycles of 2-4 years depending on feedstock quality

• Platinum recovery rates of 85-95% through recycling processes

Which Feedstock Types Influence Platinum Catalyst Requirements?

Waste Oil Processing Challenges

Waste cooking oil and used vegetable oil feedstocks contain elevated sulfur concentrations, chloride compounds, and trace metals that significantly impact platinum catalyst performance. Sulfur content typically ranges from 10-50 ppm compared to less than 1 ppm in virgin feedstocks, necessitating increased platinum loading rates for effective hydrotreating operations.

Catalyst deactivation rates increase 20-30% when processing waste oils due to contaminant accumulation on platinum active sites. This performance degradation requires more frequent catalyst regeneration cycles and higher replacement platinum consumption compared to virgin feedstock processing.

Waste oil impact factors include:

• Phosphorus compounds causing irreversible platinum catalyst poisoning

• Sodium and potassium salts creating physical catalyst bed plugging

• Free fatty acid content affecting downstream processing efficiency

• Water content requiring additional dehydration processing stages

Municipal Solid Waste Gasification

Municipal solid waste gasification produces synthesis gas containing trace metal contaminants including mercury, cadmium, lead, and zinc compounds. These metals accumulate on platinum catalyst surfaces, gradually reducing catalytic activity and requiring specialized mitigation strategies.

Guard bed catalyst systems consume additional platinum for contaminant removal, increasing total platinum requirements by 15-20% compared to clean feedstock processing. Advanced purification stages utilize platinum-containing catalysts for sulfur compound removal and trace metal capture before synthesis gas enters Fischer-Tropsch reactors. Additionally, these processing challenges highlight the importance of critical minerals recycling initiatives in maintaining supply chain security.

Municipal waste processing complications:

• Chlorine compounds creating corrosive operating environments

• Nitrogen-containing compounds causing reversible catalyst deactivation

• Ash content requiring additional separation equipment

• Variable feedstock composition affecting process optimization

How Do Different SAF Production Scales Affect Platinum Demand?

Small-Scale Distributed Production

Facilities producing 10,000-50,000 tonnes annually demonstrate higher platinum intensity per unit of SAF produced due to less efficient catalyst utilization and more frequent replacement cycles. Small-scale operations typically lack advanced catalyst management systems and regeneration capabilities available at industrial-scale facilities.

Distributed production characteristics include:

• Platinum loading rates 40-60% higher than optimized large-scale systems

• Catalyst replacement frequencies 2-3 times more frequent than industrial facilities

• Limited access to platinum recovery and recycling infrastructure

• Reduced economies of scale for catalyst procurement and management

Large-Scale Centralized Facilities

Production facilities exceeding 200,000 tonnes annual capacity achieve optimized catalyst management through advanced regeneration systems and sophisticated process control. These operations extend catalyst lifetime by 50-70% compared to smaller facilities while maintaining superior conversion efficiency and product quality.

Large-scale operational advantages:

• On-site catalyst regeneration reducing platinum consumption by 30-40%

• Integrated platinum recovery systems achieving 95% metal recovery rates

• Advanced process optimization minimizing catalyst deactivation rates

• Economies of scale enabling platinum inventory management strategies

What Technical Challenges Affect Platinum Catalyst Performance in SAF Production?

Catalyst Poisoning Mechanisms

Sulfur compounds represent the most significant threat to platinum catalyst activity, reducing catalytic efficiency by 30-50% at concentrations above 1 ppm. Hydrogen sulfide and organic sulfur compounds chemically bond to platinum active sites, creating irreversible deactivation that requires catalyst replacement or intensive regeneration procedures.

Nitrogen-containing compounds cause reversible platinum catalyst deactivation through competitive adsorption mechanisms. While this poisoning can be reversed through appropriate regeneration procedures, it reduces instantaneous catalyst activity and affects process economics.

Trace metal accumulation from feedstock impurities:

• Iron compounds depositing on catalyst surfaces reducing accessibility

• Alkali metals (sodium, potassium) disrupting acid-metal balance

• Heavy metals (mercury, cadmium) forming alloys with platinum particles

• Silicon compounds creating physical barriers on catalyst surfaces

Operating Condition Optimization

Platinum catalysts demonstrate optimal activity within specific temperature ranges of 200-350°C depending on reaction type and catalyst formulation. Operations outside these parameters result in reduced conversion efficiency, altered selectivity patterns, and accelerated catalyst deactivation rates.

Pressure optimization requirements:

• Fischer-Tropsch synthesis: 20-50 bar for cobalt-platinum catalysts

• Isomerisation processing: 20-30 bar hydrogen partial pressure

• Hydrotreating operations: 50-100 bar for optimal sulfur removal

• Electrolyser systems: 20-30 bar for PEM stack optimization

Hydrogen partial pressure maintenance becomes critical for preserving platinum dispersion characteristics and preventing sintering-induced activity loss. Insufficient hydrogen pressure leads to platinum particle agglomeration, permanently reducing catalytic surface area and requiring catalyst replacement.

How Does SAF Production Compare to Traditional Petroleum Refining for Platinum Use?

Catalyst Loading Comparisons

Traditional petroleum refining utilizes platinum primarily in catalytic reforming units with loading rates of 0.3-0.6 weight percent and operational lifespans of 2-4 years. SAF isomerisation requirements demand similar or higher platinum concentrations of 0.3-0.8 weight percent but achieve extended catalyst lifespans of 3-5 years due to cleaner feedstock characteristics.

Power-to-Liquid electrolyser applications represent entirely new platinum consumption patterns with loading requirements of 0.4 mg/cm² and operational lifespans extending 5-7 years. This application creates sustained platinum demand independent of traditional petroleum refining cycles.

Application Platinum Loading Catalyst Lifetime Market Trend Petroleum Reforming 0.3-0.6 wt% 2-4 years Declining SAF Isomerisation 0.3-0.8 wt% 3-5 years Rapidly Growing PtL Electrolysis 0.4 mg/cm² 5-7 years Emerging Technology

Industrial Transition Implications

The shift from petroleum-based to sustainable aviation fuel production creates fundamental changes in platinum consumption patterns and geographic distribution. Traditional refining centers may experience reduced platinum demand while new SAF production facilities establish alternative consumption nodes.

Economic transition factors include:

• Petroleum catalyst demand declining 2-4% annually through 2040

• SAF catalyst demand increasing 15-25% annually through 2035

• Geographic redistribution of platinum consumption toward renewable energy centers

• Technology transition creating temporary supply-demand imbalances

What Role Does Catalyst Recycling Play in Platinum Supply Management?

Recovery Technology Capabilities

Modern SAF facilities incorporate platinum recovery systems achieving 85-95% metal recovery rates through sophisticated processing techniques. Spent catalyst treatment involves thermal processing to remove organic deposits, chemical leaching to extract platinum compounds, purification to catalyst-grade specifications, and remanufacturing into fresh catalyst formulations.

Advanced recycling processes include:

• High-temperature oxidation removing carbonaceous deposits

• Selective dissolution extracting platinum from support materials

• Purification achieving 99.95% platinum purity standards

• Remanufacturing into specifications matching virgin catalyst performance

Economic Recovery Analysis

Platinum recycling economics demonstrate favorable returns due to high metal value and efficient recovery rates. Processing costs typically range from 15-25% of virgin platinum value, creating substantial economic incentives for comprehensive recycling program implementation.

Recovery system benefits:

• Reduced fresh platinum requirements by 40-60% over facility lifetime

• Shortened payback periods for recycling infrastructure investment

• Enhanced supply chain security through reduced external platinum dependence

• Environmental benefits through reduced mining pressure and waste generation

How Will Emerging SAF Technologies Affect Future Platinum Demand?

Advanced Electrolyser Development

Solid oxide electrolysers operating at 700-900°C may reduce platinum requirements by 60-70% through alternative electrode materials and improved electrochemical efficiency. These systems utilize ceramic electrolytes enabling non-platinum cathode catalysts while maintaining comparable hydrogen production rates.

Proton ceramic electrolysers represent breakthrough technology potentially eliminating platinum cathode requirements entirely through novel ionic conduction mechanisms. Commercial deployment timelines indicate market availability between 2030-2035, creating potential disruption to platinum demand in sustainable aviation fuel projections.

Novel Catalyst Formulations

Single-atom platinum catalysts demonstrate 3-5x efficiency improvements compared to traditional nanoparticle formulations, potentially reducing total platinum consumption while maintaining superior catalytic performance. These atomically dispersed catalysts maximize platinum utilization through enhanced active site density.

Research initiatives focus on platinum-free alternatives for specific SAF production applications, particularly in isomerisation and hydrotreating processes. Breakthrough developments in zeolite chemistry and metal-free catalyst systems could alter long-term platinum demand scenarios after 2040. However, the hydrogen economy's reliance on platinum group metals suggests sustained demand across multiple energy sectors.

What Investment Implications Emerge from SAF Platinum Demand Growth?

Market Diversification Opportunities

The projected 260,000 ounce annual platinum demand by 2050 creates meaningful diversification away from automotive catalyst applications during electric vehicle market penetration. This transition provides platinum producers with alternative demand sources as traditional markets potentially contract.

Strategic investment considerations include:

• SAF catalyst demand offering 15-20 year visibility compared to automotive volatility

• Geographic concentration creating regional platinum pricing opportunities

• Technology learning curves reducing catalyst loading requirements over time

• Recycling infrastructure development presenting secondary market opportunities

Supply Chain Security Factors

Long catalyst lifecycles in SAF applications create steady replacement demand cycles rather than volatile procurement patterns typical in other industrial applications. This demand stability enables improved supply chain planning and inventory management strategies for platinum producers and consumers.

The development of integrated SAF production and catalyst recycling facilities represents emerging business models combining fuel production with platinum recovery operations. These vertically integrated approaches reduce external platinum dependence while capturing recycling value streams.

Risk management implications:

• Technology transition risks affecting demand projections beyond 2040

• Regulatory policy changes impacting SAF adoption rates and timelines

• Feedstock availability constraints affecting facility development schedules

• Competition from alternative catalyst technologies reducing platinum intensity

Instead, a few minutes later, the Ninth Circuit Court issued an injunction in two short sentences, temporarily blocking one-half of California’s Climate Rule – SB 261.

SB 261, which was set to require covered entities to publish climate risk reports by January 1st, 2026, could now see its timeline pushed slightly back. The other half of the rules, SB 253, was unaffected, and companies will still be required to report emissions by a new extended August 10th, 2026 deadline.

Along with this bombshell, CARB’s workshop dropped a few others, delivering meaningful updates on safe harbors, deadlines, the definition of “doing business in California”, and how companies should determine applicability under SB 253, SB 261, and SB 219, or “the 200s” for short.

So what does this mean for covered entities? And what should they do next? Essentially, keep calm and carry on.

What Happened

The Ninth Circuit has postponed SB 261 until the court completes the appeal process, which is likely to be in early 2026. Meaning, CARB will likely have to announce an updated compliance date. CARB had already given companies until July 1 to upload URLs to its public docket during the Workshop. We expect the required publication date to slip by a month, not quarters.

Along with the lawsuit, CARB’s workshop had its own revelations, mainly around SB 253 emissions reporting, assurance, and the scope of who’s covered.

The first-year deadline for Scope 1 and Scope 2 reporting was pushed back 6 weeks to August 10th. Limited assurance was changed to being strongly advised in 2026, but it will become mandatory in 2027. Companies that had not started collecting data by December 2024 will now be given enforcement leniency if they explain in a letter that they will not be able to report.

However, with the law unchanged, these companies will be in a legal no-man’s land of not following the law but not facing enforcement action. Also, the 2026 submission will form the baseline for all subsequent reporting. Any inconsistency or poor methodology introduced in the first year may create complications or require restatement later once assurance kicks in.

CARB also clarified how companies should determine whether they are “doing business in California.” Coverage applies to companies that are domiciled in the state or financially benefit from California transactions. Owning property or simply running payroll in the state is not enough. Also, new companies must meet the revenue threshold ($500M or $1B) in the lower one of the two preceding years. Finally, not-for-profits, insurers, government entities, and companies whose only California presence is teleworkers are exempt.

What Companies Should Do Now

So what should companies do with this information?

Keep moving forward. A wait-and-see what happens approach only increases risks of non-compliance. Here are four no-regret actions we are advising our clients to take:

Reassess whether you are covered based on updates to “doing business in CA”: Companies should conduct another scoping analysis to determine whether those changes put them in or out of covered entity status.

Prepare climate risk reports for Jan 1st: Most companies will likely already be, or are very close to being prepared to report their climate risks. The best course of action here is to ensure you are ready whenever things pick back up in 2026.

Ensure emissions are audit-ready: Limited assurance may be optional in 2026, but in 2027, it is not. Building the assurance muscle early ensures you know what it takes when the time comes and gives stakeholders confidence that your emissions are accurate.

Start preparing for Scope 3: Along with limited assurance, Scope 3 (value chain emissions) reporting is mandatory in 2027. CARB has yet to finalize its Scope 3 guidance, but it will certainly constitute a much greater challenge than Scopes 1 and 2 in 2026. Building internal muscles around controls, documentation, and audit-ready processes requires time and effort. Getting started early is the best way to prepare.

Building a leading climate reporting engine took some of the most recognizably climate-friendly companies multiple years. So, no one is expecting perfection in year 1. Committing to getting things right in this first year will set you up for success in the coming years as compliance becomes more comprehensive and enforcement more rigorous.

Why Acting Now Matters

CARB is still moving forward with its nation-leading climate disclosure rules and an ambitious timeline.

The CARB updates are not a signal to slow down or to stop preparing for reporting. It’s an opportunity for companies to catch up on their 253 preparation work with urgency to meet the 2026 deadlines.

We have seen substantial changes over the last year, with shifting timelines and coverage thresholds. These are now very close to their year 1 final form, and most companies will have made significant progress toward compliance. Those who have failed are facing contractual issues with customers and an uphill challenge as compliance gets more stringent in 2027 and beyond. This may be the breathing room these companies need to get prepared.

CARB may be taking a ‘give us what you have’ approach in 2026. But, customers, investors, and other stakeholders are watching closely. Companies that keep calm and carry on will be the ones best positioned for compliance as California’s Climate Rules mature.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Andries-Verschelden-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 10:58:32.395635

SAF lessens the carbon footprint in flight operations as this is made up of renewable waste and raw materials.

“This partnership will further contribute to the aviation industry’s Net Zero 2050 goal and enhance our ability to effectively navigate evolving global environmental regulations, including SAF mandates,” KE said in a statement on Friday.

Through its partnership with Samsung E&A, the two will develop a SAF production and supply chain originating in the United States.

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by KE Vice Chair Keehong Woo and Samsung E&A chief executive officer Namkoong Hong at the KE’s headquarters in Seoul on Nov. 20.

KE and Samsung E&A will identify and evaluate overseas SAF production projects, and review long-term SAF opportunities.

They will also explore investments in SAF-related technologies and projects.

According to KE, the US was chosen as first target market since it has an abundant feedstock, advanced technology, and strong infrastructure.

Samsung E&A is currently reviewing participation in a US SAF project that will use gasification Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology to convert woody waste into synthetic liquid fuel.

This next-generation approach expands the range of usable feedstocks beyond the limitations of first-generation SAF, which depends on restricted materials such as used cooking oil.

FT-based production can process non-edible and waste biomass such as wood residues, while offering significantly greater carbon-reduction benefits, KE said.

The airline said it is reviewing its participation as an offtaker of the SAF produced through the project.

“Through proactive project participation and continuous cooperation, we aim to accelerate global SAF adoption and advance our commitment to sustainable aviation and ESG (environmental, social and governance) management,” KE said.

To recall, KE is the first Korean carrier to operate a SAF-blended flight in 2017.

In 2024, KE began using domestically produced SAF for select flights departing from Incheon International Airport and later expanded its use in flights via Gimpo International Airport.

KE has been using a 1 percent SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe, and Gimpo to Osaka from Sept. 19, 2025 to Dec. 31, 2026. This will cover around 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route.

“I’m not sure it’s good to put anything on the Legislature,” County Board Chairman Mark Liebaert said.
Supervisor Anders Hultstrom wondered if a resulting increase in demand for Douglas County forest products would impact recreation in Douglas County.
He said where Douglas County would benefit is that it would make the county’s forest products more valuable for each cut acre.
The board unanimously approved the resolution, which will be sent to the governor and members of the legislature representing Douglas County, bill sponsors and co-sponsors, and the Wisconsin Counties Association.","DOUGLAS COUNTY — The County Board is lending its support to a bill that could strengthen the forest industry in Wisconsin.

Introduced by Sen. Mary Felzkowski, R-Tomahawk, and Rep. Chanz Green, R-Grand View, in September, the Forestry Revitalization Act would support a new facility in Hayward that would turn woody biomass into sustainable aviation fuel.

The proposed legislation would provide $210 million in incentives in the form of $150 million in state bonding and $60 million in enterprise zone tax credits through the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. for the $1.5 billion private investment, according to the bill.

Supervisor Lee Sandok-Baker proposed adding language to the county’s resolution to say the Douglas County Board of Supervisors urges legislators to predicate state incentives for the proposed facility on the use of local skilled labor and the execution of a project labor agreement.

“In this bill, as drafted, it doesn’t include any guarantee that the construction of this facility will use local skilled labor or project labor agreement,” Sandok-Baker said, “and given the amount of Wisconsin taxpayer money and the fact that there is a foreign company involved, I think including that type of language in the bill would be important. I would ensure fair wages, strong safety standards and the utilization of qualified contractors.”

“I like the idea,” said Supervisor Nick Baker.

“I’m not sure it’s good to put anything on the Legislature,” County Board Chairman Mark Liebaert said.

“It’s our resolution,” Sandok-Baker said. “It’s not a condition of support — we’re urging and … I don’t think they’ll see it as a condition.”

Supervisor Sue Hendrickson said the amendment to the resolution is important and wouldn’t stop the construction.

The board agreed to the amendment to the resolution.

Supervisor Anders Hultstrom wondered if a resulting increase in demand for Douglas County forest products would impact recreation in Douglas County.

Liebaert said the county cuts about 5,000 acres of the nearly 300,000-acre county forest each year, and that’s not likely to change because that’s what can be regenerated. He said where Douglas County would benefit is that it would make the county’s forest products more valuable for each cut acre.

The proposed facility in Hayward would utilize bark, branches, cutter shavings and tree tops to make sustainable aviation fuel and naphtha (which can be used as a solvent, a fuel or a component in plastic), according to a new release issued by Green in September.

Supervisor Angie Sapik said the facility would utilize wood that is going to waste now.

“This is a 100% positive bill,” Sapik said. “I fully support it.”

Liebaert said about 26% of the wood cut in Douglas County went to the mill in Wisconsin Rapids before it closed, prompting local leaders to urge the state to revitalize the plant, which was never done.

“This actually is a probably even better scenario for us,” Liebaert said.

The Allied Biofuels project will utilise Ethanol from the 1G process to produce 160,400 tonnes per annum of sustainable aviation fuel and 5,040 tonnes per annum of green diesel, whereas biogenic CO2 from the 1G process will combine together with the Synthesis Gas from Gasification process and Green Hydrogen made from 2,000 Mega Watt of PEM Electrolysers to produce annually 257,000 tonnes of Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF).

The project represents the crucial first step in establishing Central Asia’s first integrated refinery producing SAF, Electro-Synthetic SAF (e-SAF), and green diesel.

Under the agreement, Praj will deploy its proven first-generation ethanol technology, supply proprietary equipment, and provide design, engineering, procurement, and commissioning support.

Sorghum will be used as the primary feedstock for ethanol production, which will in turn serve as the base input for advanced conversion technologies to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

The project is designed to align with Uzbekistan’s climate strategy and directly support the work of the country’s Net Zero Emissions Office, which is driving national policies toward carbon neutrality. By enabling large-scale ethanol-to-SAF conversion, the refinery will help displace fossil-based aviation fuels, reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and advance Uzbekistan’s role as a regional leader in renewable energy.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-22 02:56:16.138718

Dubai Air Navigation Services (DANS), Emirates Airline and Thales have signed a Collaborative Research Agreement (CRA) to pioneer cutting-edge research aimed at reducing holding patterns for all flights arriving at Dubai International, supporting more efficient UAE airspace management. This collaboration for a safer and more efficient UAE airspace management reinforces the UAE’s Net Zero by 2050 target.

Holding patterns provide a safe, orderly system to sequence arriving aircraft during peak traffic and runway congestion. Aircraft fly carefully choreographed racetrack-shaped circuits at designated altitudes to ensure smooth arrivals. While holding patterns are essential for safety and operational flow, minimizing their occurrence reduces fuel consumption and associated carbon emissions.

Under this agreement, the three partners will work together to research innovative ways to optimise aviation traffic management. Central to their efforts will be the integration of advanced AI technologies, which will play a pivotal role in identifying potential congestion areas and providing recommendations to stakeholders. By leveraging these AI-driven insights, the collaboration aims to help air traffic controllers and airlines minimise delays, enhance predictability, and boost operational efficiency throughout the entire airspace network.

“This innovative partnership with Dubai Air Navigation Services and Emirates Airline will allow us to strengthen the UAE’s airspace management technologies. Thales will bring its advanced capabilities in digital technologies, Artificial Intelligence, and air traffic management, to support the UAE’s vision of a more secure, connected, and sustainable aviation sector.” Abdelhafid Mordi, Vice President of Thales in UAE and Iraq, and CEO of Thales Emarat Technologies.

“This research agreement with Thales and DANS represents a practical application of AI to solve a real operational challenge. By predicting congestion and adjusting cruise speeds proactively, we not only reduce fuel burn associated with holding patterns but are also optimising our operational efficiencies. If successful, this solution can benefit other airlines, turning a shared problem into an opportunity for improvement.” Adel Al Redha, Deputy President and Chief Operating Officer Emirates Airline.

This marks a major step in the company’s decarbonization plans and sets the stage for Eni to become a market leader in the production of biofuels for a variety of industries.

Sicily will become the home of European biofuel production thanks to Eni’s ambitious plans

As the world grapples with the transition from conventional energy resource production, such as oil and gas, to the new and exciting world of biofuel production, several exceedingly large energy companies have laid out their plans to expand existing operations or retrofit refineries to produce biofuels.

That has become especially true in Sicily, as Eni, one of Italy’s largest energy companies, has announced its plans to develop a 500,000-metric-ton-per-year biorefinery at its existing industrial site in Priolo, Sicily. The company notes that the facility will produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel and is expected to be operational in 2028.

Eni has officially launched the authorization process for the environmental impact assessment to retrofit the facility in Sicily, and has received the blessing of the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security to begin retrofitting the facility.

The new biorefinery will be developed at an existing ethylene plant in Sicily

Eni has stated that the plan involves developing the project at the current site of Versalis’ ethylene plant. Versalis is a subsidiary of Eni, which focuses on the production of chemicals. The company has stated that the ethylene plant will slowly be phased out and decommissioned to make room for the new biorefinery, marking a turning point for Eni’s vast energy portfolio.

The new facility will serve Eni’s biofuel ambitions as well as produce hydrogen

Eni has noted that the new facility will produce renewable diesel as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), all made from waste, animal fat, and vegetable oil feedstocks. Diversifying the company’s energy portfolio will be the planned biogenic feedstock pretreatment unit and a hydrogen production facility.

The new project will also boast a chemical recycling facility that will make use of Versalis’ proprietary Hoop pyrolysis technology. The all-new chemical recycling facility will have the capacity to process 40,000 metric tons per year of mixed plastic packaging waste, which will enable Eni to produce approximately 32,000 metric tons per year of pyrolysis oil.

Eni previously announced its plans to increase biorefinery capacity over the years to come

The company has stated its plans to increase the capacity of its biorefineries to more than 3 million metric tons in 2028, with ambitions to increase that number even more over the next few years. Other nations have also jumped on board the diversification train, such as Saudi Arabia, which recently revealed its plans to expand petrochemical production.

The entire development aims for LEED Gold certification, a standard usually associated with modern, eco-conscious commercial buildings rather than private aviation terminals.
With tourism investment rising, the new VVIP terminal is designed to strengthen RAK’s global positioning and help deliver an elevated travel experience that matches the Emirate’s growing ambitions.","Ras Al Khaimah International Airport is preparing for a major shift in how it serves private and high-end travellers. The airport has announced an ambitious expansion that adds a luxury VVIP terminal, an 8,000-square-metre multi-purpose hangar and a large, dedicated apron for private and long-range aircraft. The announcement was made at the Dubai Airshow and marks one of the most significant upgrades in the airport's history.

The development is being carried out in partnership with Falcon Executive Aviation, part of Alex Group Investment. The company will design, build and operate the new Fixed Base Operation facility, which sits at the heart of this expansion. For Ras Al Khaimah, it signals a clear push to position the Emirate as a growing hub for high-value tourism, business travel and investment.

The new complex includes a 1,500-square-metre VVIP terminal designed for travellers who expect privacy, speed and personalised service. The facility will offer a set of four VVIP lounges, premium hospitality zones and a dedicated Royal lounge reserved for visiting dignitaries and government guests. Airport officials describe the service experience as the “Falcon Signature Experience”, promising smooth, discreet movement from aircraft to lounge to transport.

The plans reflect not only luxury but also RAK’s attempt to shape the future of private aviation. The expansion includes space for next-generation mobility solutions. A helipad and an area reserved for eVTOL aircraft - electric vertical take-off and landing systems are part of the blueprint. As global aviation slowly moves toward greener and more flexible technology, the airport wants to be ready.

Construction is expected to take about 15 months, with the facility targeted to open in the first quarter of 2027.

Alongside luxury and convenience, the project leans heavily on sustainability. The entire development aims for LEED Gold certification, a standard usually associated with modern, eco-conscious commercial buildings rather than private aviation terminals. The terminal will incorporate rooftop solar systems capable of offsetting roughly 35 percent of the facility’s total energy use. All ground handling at the new FBO will rely on electric vehicles rather than diesel-powered equipment. The terminal will also be equipped to support Sustainable Aviation Fuel, providing an alternative to conventional jet fuel in an industry under pressure to lower emissions. The airport wants to set a new standard for green private aviation in the region.

This expansion fits into a much larger redevelopment plan at RAK International Airport. The airport is also building a 30,000-square-metre passenger terminal that will operate alongside the existing facility, bringing new space for check-in, immigration, baggage systems and security. The idea is to modernise the airport without disrupting current operations, while preparing for a future in which RAK draws more visitors than ever before.

The Emirate’s hospitality and tourism sector has been on an upward trajectory, accelerated by mega-projects such as the Wynn Marjan Island Resort, expected to open in early 2027. As new resorts, entertainment districts and luxury hotels attract international guests, RAK International Airport wants to ensure passengers, whether on scheduled commercial flights or private aircraft, have a seamless and modern experience from the moment they arrive.

Officials estimate that the airport will be able to handle more than 3 million passengers by 2028. With tourism investment rising, the new VVIP terminal is designed to strengthen RAK’s global positioning and help deliver an elevated travel experience that matches the Emirate’s growing ambitions.",https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/122854.ras-al-khaimah.png,N,,2025-11-22 03:56:25.301549

Key highlights from the report for corporate travel programmes to consider include:

Risks and mitigation strategies

In 2026, Oxford Economics believes the world may face its weakest economic growth since 2009 (excluding 2020), hovering at 2.6%. Inflation is expected to ease only slowly, averaging above 3%. In addition to this economic fragility, a broad range of risks may further compound the efforts of organisations to keep their business travellers safe and operations flowing smoothly.

The primary six risks to consider are extreme weather, regional tensions and ongoing conflicts, changing border policies, the rise of cyberattacks and misinformation arising from the use of AI, the continuing threat of illnesses and disease, and limited options for accommodations and ground transportation during large scale events.

“In today’s travel landscape, organisations face unprecedented challenges. But travel managers don’t have to face these alone,” said Jorge Mesa (pictured), senior director of Travel Risk Management at BCD. He recommended his company’s Traveler Security Program Assessment., with real-time incident and destination intelligence and traveller response capabilities designed to help clients stay ahead of these disruptions by providing proactive strategies and advanced travel risk technologies. “Our goal is to ensure business travellers remain safe and operations run smoothly, even in times of uncertainty,” Mesa added.

Airfares

Overall, global airfares should see only limited inflation, primarily stimulated by the intercontinental air travel market as opposed to regional travel.

Globally, average ticket prices (ATPs) should rise by only 1.1% in 2026, the BCD report noted, reflecting weak airfares inflation in North America especially. ATP increases in other regions should be above the global average, with the strongest inflation likely in Africa and Asia, at 2.5% and 2.0%, respectively.

In addition to airfare changes, trends for travel buyers to keep in mind include a reduction in value of airline corporate contracts, rising airline fuel surcharges, blanket NDC offerings, and continued travel programme leakage.

Hotel rates and car rentals

Global hotel rates are forecasted to increase by 4.9% in average daily rates (ADRs). There are many variables behind the variation in rates in different regions, from rising staffing and labor costs in Turkey to robust leisure demand in Japan. Aggregate figures for rate inflation in Africa, Asia and Europe should all lie within a narrow 4-6% range; the strongest rate inflation is expected across the Middle East at 8%. Hotels in Latin America are expected to average 6.4% in 2026. Rate inflation is likely to be weakest in the Southwest Pacific and North America, at 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively.

“With global hotel rates projected to rise nearly 5%, travel managers and buyers need proactive measures to control costs,” said Miriam Moscovici, vice-president of product planning and intelligence at BCD.

Car rental rates will generally continue to rise for corporate customers. A mix of aspects are contributing to this increase, including car rental companies’ acquisition and repair costs, city surcharges and higher parking rates. Corporate travellers are being forced to consider alternative options such as ride-hailing and taxis. In general, BCD expects rate increases in 2026 to be slightly lower than in 2025, sitting in a 2-4% range.

Sustainability

BCD believes that accountability over sustainability will dominate the agenda as companies move from pledges to measurable action.

According to GBTA’s latest benchmark, only 9% of companies apply carbon fees and 15% are investing in sustainable aviation fuel. BCD is promoting its own Sustainability Solution which claims to offer an end-to-end ecosystem that enables credible emissions reporting, traveller engagement, and investment in decarbonisation, all without disrupting operations.

“The GBTA findings show that while companies are committed to sustainable travel, progress in critical areas is lagging,” said Olivia Ruggles-Brise, vice-president of sustainability at BCD and GBTA Climate Leader. “Closing this gap requires practical solutions that make sustainability achievable without disrupting business.”",https://www.c-mw.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/BCD_Jorge-Mesa-2025-crop2.jpg,N,,2025-11-22 06:56:25.864749

Although the Commission's action targets EU airlines, U.S. airlines should review their marketing in the EU accordingly.
In addition, the EU's action provides important insight into how EU authorities view environmental marketing claims more generally.
Train relevant internal teams (e.g., marketing, sustainability, and legal) on EU marketing laws, guidance, and prior decisions affecting green marketing claims and set up pre-clearance for sustainability messaging.","On November 5, 2025, the European Commission (Commission) announced that 21 airlines committed to modifying their environmental marketing practices after EU consumer authorities alleged several common environmental claims could mislead passengers. The airlines agreed they will not claim that paying extra to fund climate protection projects or the use of alternative aviation fuels can directly neutralize or reduce emissions on an individual flight. In addition, the airlines committed to tighter substantiation, clearer disclosures, and more transparent CO₂ calculators, particularly as they relate to their use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). National consumer authorities will monitor implementation and may enforce against carriers that fall short.

Although the Commission's action targets EU airlines, U.S. airlines should review their marketing in the EU accordingly. In addition, the EU's action provides important insight into how EU authorities view environmental marketing claims more generally. Companies in other sectors should review their environmental marketing claims in light of this action, particularly if they have programs that give consumers the option to pay extra fees to fund the use of alternative fuels or support projects that offset emissions.

Legal Framework & Enforcement Posture

The Commission's announcement follows a coordinated review by the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network, a network of authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. The CPC Network can take action under the Consumer Protection Regulation to address cross-border issues at the EU level in coordination with the Commission.

In addition to announcing the commitments from the 21 airlines subject to the review, the Commission also published a table tracking each airline's commitments and timelines; authorities will verify timely implementation and pursue enforcement, if needed. To ensure fair competition and a level playing field in the aviation industry, the Commission's announcement states that the CPC Network will also assess the practices of other airlines operating in the Single Market, and, where necessary, require the same commitments.

The CPC's action stemmed from an alert filed by BEUC (representing consumer organizations across the EU) in June 2023, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Regulation, alleging that 17 European airlines misled consumers by claiming ""green fees"" would render their flights sustainable and, more broadly, by implying ""flying is sustainable."" The complaint alleged that these claims constitute infringements of Directive 2005/29/EC (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive - UCPD).

The UCPD harmonizes national laws governing business-to-consumer practices in the internal market and prohibits unfair commercial practices (Article 5), misleading actions (Article 6), and misleading omissions (Article 7). The European Commission's Guidance Notice on the interpretation and application of the UCPD, though not legally binding, is intended to clarify and facilitate its proper application, and includes guidance on which environmental claims may be considered misleading.

What the 21 Airlines Committed to Change

Clarify that a specific flight's CO₂ emissions cannot be neutralized, offset, or directly reduced by optional passenger payments for climate projects or alternative fuels.

Use ""sustainable aviation fuel"" (SAF) terminology only with appropriate clarifications and substantiation.

Avoid vague ""green"" language or implicit environmental claims.

Provide more detail when stating future climate goals (e.g., net-zero): include timelines, achievable steps, and the types of emissions covered.

Display CO₂ calculations clearly and transparently.

Support claims with sufficient scientific evidence.

Why This Matters in Aviation and Beyond

Although this example targets airlines, it signals how EU enforcers expect environmental marketing to be framed across sectors:

Claims that payment of fees will render products/services ""Carbon-Neutral"" or ""Sustainable"" Require Rigorous Clarification and Substantiation. The CPC's scrutiny of pay-to-offset schemes may serve as a warning to other industries that sell add-ons implying immediate neutrality.

SAF and similar ""transition"" claims need precise context. Claims about cleaner inputs (e.g., SAF) should avoid implying one-for-one emission reductions for a specific transaction and must be properly qualified.

Aspirational goals must be anchored in plans. Claims regarding net-zero or carbon-neutral goals should include timelines, milestones, scope clarity (Scopes 1–3), and methodologies.

CO₂ calculators may be perceived as marketing claims. If you publish route- or product-level emissions figures, expect scrutiny of assumptions, data sources, and presentation.

EU coordination is accelerating. This airline action follows earlier EU-level probes and national rulings that have tightened the bar on ""sustainable flight"" messaging.

Practical Next Steps For EU-facing Marketers

Inventory – and revise if appropriate – green claims and map each to evidence (testing or internationally recognized methodologies), consistent with UCPD guidance and the evolving landscape of green marketing law at the EU-level (e.g., the Empowering Consumers Directive and the pending Green Claims Directive) and member-state level.

Avoid using vague buzzwords (""eco-friendly,"" ""green,"" ""sustainable"") unless defined and substantiated, in alignment with EU law.

Train relevant internal teams (e.g., marketing, sustainability, and legal) on EU marketing laws, guidance, and prior decisions affecting green marketing claims and set up pre-clearance for sustainability messaging.

Continue to closely monitor the rapidly evolving legal and policy developments in green marketing, not just in the EU but in other jurisdictions as well. (see, e.g., Canada Issues Guidelines on Civil Greenwashing Claims One Year After Amendments to the Competition Act).

What to Watch Next

Whether national authorities or the CPC Network widen their focus to other sectors

Continued negotiations over the finalization of the Green Claims Directive and national regulation and guidance on environmental claims and green marketing.

Emerging case law and consumer-protection actions in European jurisdictions targeting broader ""greenwashing"" tactics, including the use of sustainability labels, ""eco-friendly"" branding, and offset claims.

The strategic debate over the use of municipal solid waste in the United Kingdom is entering a critical phase. A report published by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES) finds that energy-from-waste with carbon capture and storage (EfW-CCS) yields a significantly higher net climate benefit than converting the same waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This conclusion highlights growing tension between two pillars of the UK’s climate policy.

Two climate strategies competing for a single resource

The study shows that for one tonne of post-recycled waste, EfW-CCS can eliminate between −1.0 and −1.3 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, primarily through removal of biogenic carbon. In contrast, the MSW-to-SAF pathway delivers a net benefit of between −0.3 and −0.7 tCO₂e, depending on assumptions about avoided emissions. The gap widens when excluding credits for electricity or recycling, with EfW-CCS maintaining a net advantage around −0.6 tCO₂e.

Strategic infrastructure and regulatory tension

EfW facilities are already integrated into major carbon capture and storage clusters such as HyNet, East Coast, and Acorn. Projects like Runcorn (Viridor), Protos (Encyclis), and Ferrybridge (enfinium) are targeting stable CO₂ flows compatible with these networks. At the same time, the UK’s SAF mandate targets 22% by 2040, prompting producers to compete for the same waste streams to convert into aviation fuel.

Impact on the UK’s climate sovereignty

The domestic nature of post-recycled municipal waste enhances its strategic value. Prioritising EfW-CCS would allow the UK to turn an environmental liability into a climate asset, reinforcing its path to net zero. The SAF sector, exposed to transnational dynamics, faces growing risk of dependence on foreign supply chains for feedstocks that are already globally contested.

Economic implications for industry stakeholders

For energy-from-waste operators, integrating CCS could reposition their assets as high-value sources of negative carbon credits. This dynamic could unlock access to the UK’s £21.7bn CCS support scheme. By contrast, SAF producers face a more uncertain economic model, reliant on regulatory certificate value and long-term offtake agreements with airlines.

Regulatory uncertainty and litigation risks

The absence of a clear policy choice between the two uses of waste sustains a regulatory ambiguity. Emissions accounting methods and biogenic carbon measurements remain inconsistent. This lack of clarity increases legal risks, particularly around state aid, public funding, and double counting of emissions reductions.

Geopolitical effects and governance challenges

A clear hierarchy in waste use could reposition the UK as a net exporter of carbon removal credits. Without a unified strategy, the country risks paradoxically supporting SAF projects for international flights while importing carbon credits to meet domestic climate targets. This potential imbalance calls into question the overall coherence of UK energy policy.

“Asia Pacific is not only the largest but also the fastest-growing air cargo market,” Menon noted, emphasising that cargo growth remains 50% above global averages.
IATA Director General Willie Walsh described the Asia Pacific as “the most exciting aviation market in the world,” underpinned by strong demographics and expanding middle-class consumption.
“There is tremendous opportunity for Asia to build the talent and infrastructure needed to support the next wave of aviation growth,” Menon said.
Together, these resolutions reflect a unified commitment to building a resilient, competitive, and future-ready Asia Pacific aviation sector.","Optimism was the prevailing tone as Asia Pacific’s airline leaders convened in Bangkok from 14–15 November 2025 for the 69th Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) Assembly of Presidents. And the confidence is well-founded: the region handles 35% of global air traffic, boasts the world’s fastest cargo growth, and is poised to dominate aviation’s future. Against this backdrop, airline executives outlined strategies to ensure that infrastructure, workforce development, and sustainability progress can keep pace with rising demand.

While global aviation continues to navigate supply chain constraints and evolving regulatory landscapes, discussions at the Assembly underscored strong confidence in the Asia Pacific’s position as the world’s most dynamic and fastest-growing aviation market.

Strong demand anchors growth momentum AAPA Director General Subhas Menon opened the Assembly by highlighting the region’s robust performance in both passenger and cargo markets. Passenger load factors have reached 82%, while cargo load factors remain elevated at 60%, supported by resilient intra-Asia trade and the ongoing expansion of cross-border e-commerce.

“Asia Pacific is not only the largest but also the fastest-growing air cargo market,” Menon noted, emphasising that cargo growth remains 50% above global averages.

The region’s long-term outlook was echoed across the programme. International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Asia Pacific Regional Director Tao Ma noted that Asia Pacific accounts for 35% of global traffic and could reach nearly 50% by 2043, with air cargo expected to rise from 260 billion FTK (Freight Tonne Kilometres) in 2024 to 638 billion FTK by 2050.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh described the Asia Pacific as “the most exciting aviation market in the world,” underpinned by strong demographics and expanding middle-class consumption.

A shared resolve to strengthen global supply chains Supply chain recovery dominated the panel discussions, with OEM leaders acknowledging that airlines across the region continue to face acute shortages of parts, engines, and skilled labour. As GE Aerospace’s Nakul Gupta put it, “We are truly united in that challenge… the airlines don’t have enough parts and engines, and if they can’t get the parts, they can’t fly.”

While no new timelines were announced, panellists emphasised practical fixes and deeper supplier engagement. Boeing highlighted its “boots-on-the-ground” model in Southeast Asia—working directly with suppliers on lean manufacturing, certification, specialised training, and aggregation strategies to strengthen quality and resilience.

Airbus detailed its extensive regional ecosystem, including 1,700 suppliers contributing €7 billion to global production lines. The company also pointed to expanded infrastructure, such as its global flight operations hub in Bangkok, and the deployment of teams into second-, third-, and fourth-tier suppliers to identify vulnerabilities earlier.

Advancing sustainability through regional action Sustainability remained a major focus, with airlines, regulators, and industry partners outlining pathways to reduce emissions and scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Countries such as Malaysia and Thailand have introduced voluntary 1% SAF blending mandates, while Singapore is moving ahead with the world’s first SAF levy on departing passengers beginning in 2026.

Airlines also showcased concrete initiatives underway. Air New Zealand uses AI-driven tools to model onboard consumption and reduce food waste, while Malaysia Aviation Group has eliminated 15.4 million single-use plastic items and is expanding AI-enabled meal planning with a target of 100% pre-order meals by 2030.

Panellists acknowledged that SAF availability remains limited today, but momentum is building as more governments adopt supportive frameworks and producers invest in capacity.

AAPA’s sustainability resolution reaffirmed the region’s commitment to achieving 5% SAF usage by 2030, calling for harmonised policies, SAF accounting systems, and continued innovation.

Building the workforce of the future Talent development emerged as a critical enabler of the Asia Pacific’s long-term growth. According to ICAO, the region will require 300,000 pilots, 300,000 maintenance engineers, and 500,000 cabin crew by 2037 to support its expanding aviation ecosystem.

AAPA’s manpower resilience resolution urged governments and industry partners to deepen investment in aviation education, expand training pathways, and promote diversity and inclusion across the workforce pipeline.

“There is tremendous opportunity for Asia to build the talent and infrastructure needed to support the next wave of aviation growth,” Menon said.

Media programme highlights: A confident outlook from Airbus and Boeing During the media programme, Airbus and Boeing presented aligned forecasts that highlighted the Asia Pacific’s long-term growth trajectory across both passenger and cargo markets.

Airbus projected that the region will require 19,560 new aircraft over the next 20 years, accounting for 46% of global demand. This includes roughly 3,500 widebodies and more than 16,100 single-aisle aircraft to support both long-haul and intra-regional expansion.

Airbus noted that 68% of deliveries will support fleet growth, while 32% will replace older aircraft—contributing to decarbonisation, with next-generation widebodies offering up to 25% fuel-efficiency improvements.

Cargo remains a central pillar of the forecast: Asia Pacific is expected to operate around 850 freighters in the long term, nearly one-third of the global fleet, with 250 new-build widebody freighters entering service over the next two decades. The A350F continues to gain traction among carriers planning next-generation fleet renewals.

“The Asia-Pacific region is entering an exciting phase of growth, fuelled by strong demand for air travel and logistics,” said Anand Stanley, President of Airbus Asia Pacific.

Boeing shared an equally strong outlook, forecasting Southeast Asia’s air travel market to grow by 7% annually, supported by rising disposable income, increased international connectivity, and a solid tourism rebound. Thailand alone is expected to grow by 65% over the next decade.

On the cargo side, Boeing emphasised its dominant position: more than 90% of global air freight is carried on Boeing aircraft. Its freighter portfolio spans from the 737-800BCF for regional operations to the upcoming 777-8F, capable of lifting 118 tonnes. The widely used 777F remains central to global cargo networks as airlines plan long-term fleet renewal.

Together, the Airbus and Boeing briefings delivered a clear message: Asia Pacific remains central to global aviation’s future, with rising demand across both passenger and cargo markets creating opportunities for investment, innovation, and long-term fleet planning.

Looking ahead to 2026 Despite the complexities of today’s operating environment, the sentiment at this year’s Assembly was overwhelmingly positive. As supply chain pressures begin to ease and SAF adoption gathers momentum across the region in 2026, airlines are preparing for what many executives described as a pivotal transition year—one that will set the tone for the next decade of expansion across the world’s fastest-growing aviation market.

“The future is bright for the Asia Pacific,” Menon concluded. “We must continue to work together to seize the opportunities ahead.”

Key resolutions from the 69th AAPA Assembly:

The Assembly concluded with the adoption of four resolutions that underscore the industry’s shared priorities for stability, growth, and long-term sustainability.

Advancing sustainability & SAF adoptionSetting clear direction for SAF development, CORSIA implementation, and the region’s 2030 decarbonisation goals.

Enhancing lithium battery safetyStrengthening harmonised global standards to ensure safer handling and reduce passenger confusion.

Supporting supply chain & MRO developmentEncouraging governments to expand manufacturing capacity, invest in skilled labour, and strengthen the region’s MRO ecosystem.

Promoting fair and sustainable regulationCalling for equitable tax structures, balanced policy frameworks, and collaborative regulatory engagement.

Americas S$10.40 S$41.60

Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, has said:

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”

It’s important to note that the levy will not apply to passengers who are only transiting through Singapore.

This comes after the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set a ‘Long-Term Aspirational Goal’ of net zero carbon emissions for international aviation by 2050.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Skyline_of_the_Central_Business_District_of_Singapore_with_Esplanade_Bridge_in_the_evening.jpg?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-21 17:58:27.041849

Depending on what the margins are at any given time, we may decide to run below our name-plate capacity. This allows us to change to where we are running closer to that.”

The project captures carbon dioxide from ADM’s ethanol plant and transports it through Tallgrass’s Trailblazer pipeline to a secure underground storage site in Wyoming.

Good tells Brownfield the process creates a more sustainable and environmentally healthy product. “What this CO2 sequestration effectively does is it will lower the carbon intensity of our ethanol, and what we hope that will make it more attractive for different end uses.”

As an example, he says it could help produce sustainable aviation fuel. “One pathway to get to SAF is through ethanol. To be able to do that, carbon sequestration is important.”

Aviation is under massive pressure to cut emissions—but jet engines can’t simply be swapped for batteries (at least not yet). That’s where Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) comes in. It’s the most promising near-term solution for reducing aviation’s environmental impact without redesigning aircraft. Here’s the Game-Changer: SAF is a drop-in fuel—meaning it can be blended with traditional Jet A1 and used in existing aircraft without modifications. Yet it can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by 60% to 80% depending on the feedstock and production method. Why SAF Works So Well Advanced Feedstock Sources SAF can be made from: • Waste oils & fats • Agricultural residue • Municipal waste • CO₂ captured from the air • Biomass and algae This makes it renewable, unlike fossil kerosene. Cleaner Combustion Profile SAF burns with lower particulate emissions, reducing contrail formation and improving engine cleanliness over time. Drop-In Compatibility Current aircraft can safely operate on blends up to 50% SAF. Future certification aims for 100% SAF operations. Multiple Production Pathways Techniques like HEFA, Fischer–Tropsch, and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) allow SAF production to scale from different regions and resources. The Real-World Impact Airlines using SAF today (like United, Emirates, KLM, and Qantas) experience: Lower net CO₂ emissions Reduced particulate matter emissions Improved air quality around airports Compliance with strict carbon regulations A realistic pathway to sustainable long-haul travel But the challenge? Cost and supply. SAF is still expensive and represents less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption. The Bottom Line: SAF isn’t a futuristic idea—it’s already flying today. While it can’t eliminate all emissions, it’s the most practical, scalable bridge toward cleaner aviation until next-generation hydrogen and electric aircraft mature.

This article explores the concept of a Green-Edu Fixed Base Operation (FBO) as a comprehensive model for strengthening sustainable general aviation (GA) in Indonesia. By integrating business, education, and environmental functions, the Green-Edu FBO can serve as a living laboratory for the transition toward green aviation, aligned with the global CORSIA and Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programs. By adopting best practices from the United States, Canada, and Australia, Indonesia can build adaptive infrastructure, develop qualified human resources, and formulate responsive policies to the growing trend of sustainable aviation—while unlocking new economic value in secondary airports and national training hubs.

Revisiting Indonesia’s General Aviation Potential

National aviation policy in Indonesia has long focused on scheduled airlines and large commercial networks. Yet, beyond the commercial sector lies the world of general aviation (GA)—non-scheduled and non-commercial flying activities including pilot schools, air taxis, aerial surveys, medical evacuation, and recreational flights.

In advanced economies, GA serves as the foundation for developing aviation human capital and technological innovation. Indonesia, with its vast geography and growing demand, holds great potential in this sector. However, it still faces chronic challenges: limited infrastructure, high operational costs, and the absence of an integrated business model that combines education, research, and operational services.

The Green-Edu FBO concept is designed to close these gaps.

Understanding the FBO: From History to Strategic Meaning

Traditionally, a Fixed Base Operation (FBO) is an airport-based entity that provides a range of services for non-commercial aviation—such as fuelling, light maintenance, flight briefing, and passenger handling for business aviation.

In the United States, over 3,000 FBOs form the backbone of general aviation. Canada and Australia have similarly developed FBOs as aviation hubs supporting technical training and small operators.

Indonesia, by contrast, lacks a mature FBO framework. GA services are scattered across multiple airports without an integrated system, even as demand for pilot training and specialized flight operations continues to rise. A Green-Edu FBO could become the catalyst for renewal, connecting the dots between business, education, and sustainability.

Green-Edu FBO: Integrating Economy, Education, and Environment

The Green-Edu FBO is built upon three strategic pillars:

Green (Environment): Adoption of renewable energy, electric ground handling equipment, and low-carbon fuels such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Edu (Education): Establishment of a training and research centre for pilots, engineers, and aviation students.

FBO (Fixed Base Operation): Provision of professional GA services—fuelling, maintenance, and VIP handling—in an efficient and environmentally responsible manner.

Together, these pillars form a business ecosystem that delivers economic, social, and environmental value simultaneously.

The Business Process of a Green-Edu FBO

The Green-Edu FBO operates through an integrated service chain:

Aircraft Operations & Ground Handling: Coordinating arrivals and departures, apron parking, and light maintenance using low-emission electric equipment.

Maintenance and Inspection: Energy-managed hangars serving as both technical training centres (AMTO) and laboratories for energy efficiency.

Fuelling and SAF Integration: A fuel farm that supplies bioavtur and operates an SAF blending unit—also used as a research facility for green fuels.

Education and Research Centre: Classrooms, simulation rooms, and green laboratories for training in green operations, emission calculations, and aviation management.

Community & Innovation Hub: Acting as an incubator for aviation startups and a public education space for carbon awareness and decarbonization.

Sustainability Reporting & Carbon Monitoring: All energy and emission data are monitored through a digital Monitoring–Reporting–Verification (MRV) system, forming the basis for sustainability reporting and carbon certification.

Hence, the Green-Edu FBO is not merely a service facility—it is a learning ecosystem for green aviation innovation.

Key Infrastructure Requirements

To operate effectively, a Green-Edu FBO requires several essential infrastructure components:

Green Terminal: Energy-efficient design with solar panels, water recycling systems, and eco-lounges.

Multifunction Hangar: Natural ventilation and lighting, energy-efficient maintenance areas.

Green Apron & Fuel Depot: Electric charging points, bioavtur blending facilities, and waste management systems.

Digital Operations Center: A control hub for flight, energy, and carbon MRV systems.

Edu-Tech Campus: Simulation rooms, green fuel laboratories, and startup research corners.

Community Zone: Aviation-themed parks and educational cafés for public engagement.

Secondary airports such as Banyuwangi, Budiarto, Palangkaraya, and Lombok are ideal candidates for pilot projects of this kind.

Learning from International Best Practices

United States: FBOs such as Signature Flight Support and Atlantic Aviation have implemented SAF use, waste recycling systems, and electric vehicle fleets.

Canada: Skyservice FBO integrates technical training with sustainability reporting and green operations.

Australia: FBOs in Perth and Melbourne serve as aviation education hubs, partnering with local universities for clean energy research.

Indonesia can draw lessons from these examples by promoting collaboration among FBOs, universities, and airport authorities.

Relevance of CORSIA and Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA)

CORSIA as the Sky Bridge: The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) established by ICAO mandates MRV-based mechanisms and carbon offsetting for international flights. Local FBOs could adopt similar frameworks for ground operations—measuring, monitoring, and reporting emissions as part of Indonesia’s national decarbonization strategy.

ACA as the Ground Framework: The Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) by Airports Council International (ACI) evaluates airport carbon management across four levels: Mapping, Reduction, Optimization, and Neutrality. Green-Edu FBOs can follow these principles to manage energy use, replace conventional GSE with electric units, and design educational carbon offset projects.

Integrating both systems—CORSIA for the skies and ACA for the ground—positions the FBO at the nexus of air and earth, transforming it into a comprehensive decarbonization lab where Indonesian aviation personnel can learn to apply global sustainability standards in real-life settings.

Valuation and Monetization of the Green-Edu FBO

The monetization of the Green-Edu FBO concept can be approached through a value-based ecosystem model, where its economic worth is derived not only from operational services but also from measurable contributions to decarbonization, education, and clean-energy innovation. Value creation emerges from the integration of three core dimensions—green operations, edu-lab innovation, and carbon economy—which can then be transformed into sustainable revenue streams.

From a valuation standpoint, the Green-Edu FBO holds the potential to generate a green premium value, representing an appreciation in asset worth due to its low-carbon and renewable-energy design. Facilities such as solar-powered hangars, electric ground support equipment (e-GSE), and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending stations can be categorized as green infrastructure assets. These assets carry higher market valuations and qualify for green financing or ESG-linked loans from global financial institutions. This valuation can be further enhanced through a carbon offset credit system, whereby every ton of CO₂ mitigated through efficient FBO operations can be converted into carbon credits tradable in both domestic and international carbon markets.

In terms of revenue generation, the Green-Edu FBO unlocks diverse monetization channels. First, through green aviation services—including sustainable fuel supply, electric aircraft handling, and energy-as-a-service solutions for aviation tenants seeking clean energy adoption. Second, through education and training, by establishing a Green Aviation Academy offering professional programs in sustainable flight operations, carbon management, and green maintenance engineering. These programs could be accredited under ICAO’s TRAINAIR Plus system or equivalent global bodies, expanding the international reach of the education business line.

Third, monetization can arise from research and innovation, particularly through the commercialization of intellectual property (IP) and technology licensing stemming from university–industry collaborations—such as waste-to-fuel conversion or AI-based flight efficiency analytics. Fourth, by developing a digital twin and data analytics center, the FBO can generate data-as-a-service (DaaS) revenue by providing actionable emissions and performance data for airport operators and local governments.

Moreover, positioning the Green-Edu FBO as a regional green economy hub opens pathways to develop green economic clusters, integrating aviation with energy, education, and technology sectors. The FBO thus evolves beyond a service provider into an investment and carbon-trading platform, reinforcing its identity as an impact-driven business where financial profit aligns with national sustainability targets (SDGs and Net Zero Emission 2060).

By combining carbon assets, intellectual capital, and green operational efficiency in its valuation model, the Green-Edu FBO represents not only a financially profitable enterprise but also a strategic showcase of Indonesia’s commitment to pioneering sustainable aviation ecosystems in Southeast Asia.

Strategic Benefits

Economic: Generates new revenue streams from fuelling, training, and carbon services.

Human Resources: Cultivates aviation professionals skilled in sustainability and green technologies.

Environmental: Fosters a low-emission operational culture in the aviation ecosystem.

Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

Regulatory: Legal recognition is needed for FBOs with educational and sustainability functions.

Financing: Development can be supported through Public–Private Partnerships and green financing schemes.

Human Resources: Strengthened collaboration with universities and aviation training centres.

Coordination: Synergy among FBOs, Airport Authorities, and national regulators is crucial.

A Reflection for the Future

The Green-Edu FBO could become a new symbol of Indonesia’s aviation identity—innovative, inclusive, and sustainable.

Beyond supporting general aviation, it strengthens Indonesia’s diplomatic standing within ICAO and ACI as a pioneer of green training and operational hubs in Southeast Asia.

Conclusion

Aviation is not only about aircraft that take to the skies, but also about how wisely we prepare the ground that supports them.

The Green-Edu FBO represents a small step with a profound meaning—a space where business, education, and the environment converge to nurture a generation of aviators who not only fly high but also think green.

Within the same timeframe, Honeywell also plans to reduce absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 23%.
Since 2010, it has initiated more than 6,800 projects focused on efficiency, emissions reduction, water and waste.
In 2025, Honeywell also introduced a new technology designed to convert agricultural waste into renewable fuels suitable for the maritime and aviation sectors.
“Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” explains Ken West, President of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions.","Founded in 1906 and now operating in more than 70 countries, Honeywell, has placed its sustainability guidelines at the core of its operational strategy.

The organisation, which specialises in aerospace building technologies and industrial automation, recently placed 39th in Sustainability Magazine’s Top 250 World’s Most Sustainable Companies 2025, recognising its work in energy and water management. This focus is central to its goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035.

Honeywell’s environmental priorities guide its product and service development as well as its overarching climate strategy. It aims to be carbon neutral in its own facilities and operations by 2035, with emissions goals that have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

These targets include a commitment to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2037 from a 2019 baseline. Within the same timeframe, Honeywell also plans to reduce absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 23%.

Honeywell's path to carbon neutrality

Honeywell's commitment has already yielded positive results. In 2025, Honeywell achieved a more than 90% reduction in the intensity of its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2004 levels.

Since 2010, it has initiated more than 6,800 projects focused on efficiency, emissions reduction, water and waste. Honeywell projects that its technologies could contribute to a cumulative mitigation of two billion metric tons of CO2e between 2023 and 2030.

This figure is 175 times greater than Honeywell’s own projected Scope 1 and 2 emissions over the same period.

Vimal Kapur, Chairman and CEO at Honeywell, says: “From our efforts to increase energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to our work to minimise waste and conserve water, our commitment to environmental responsibility plays an important role in our efforts to drive growth across our operations.

""As a result, we are developing innovative products and solutions that help improve energy efficiency and are advancing offerings that help our customers reach their performance and emissions reduction goals.”

Innovative energy-efficient solutions

With energy efficiency as a key priority, Honeywell actively seeks opportunities to upgrade existing equipment to be more energy efficient.

This includes replacing components such as dryers, compressors and pumps, with newer, more efficient designs.

A large-scale conversion to LED lighting across its facilities is ongoing, and all new construction projects must comply with strict energy standards, incorporating features like LED and occupancy sensors to maximise efficiency.

In 2025, Honeywell also introduced a new technology designed to convert agricultural waste into renewable fuels suitable for the maritime and aviation sectors. This process can produce lower-carbon marine fuel, gasoline and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from widely available biomass sources.

“Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” explains Ken West, President of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions.

“The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost-effective.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0182a5309e88c027d28652e9d0aaa5d9:6ce845ed8ef0828010305a61f58511f9/gettyimages-1411734115.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 13:56:55.120493

The latest developments in Australia’s aviation sustainability efforts include a notable commitment from the federal government, which has earmarked $1.1 billion to promote the production of low-carbon fuels, including a specific Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative.","Passenger and commercial flights operating out of Singapore will see increased ticket prices following the introduction of a groundbreaking Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) announced that this tax will apply to flights booked from April 1, 2026, for departures from Singapore starting October 1, 2026.

Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, emphasized that this initiative is a significant advancement in making Singapore a more sustainable and competitive air hub. He stated that the levy offers aviation users a manageable way to contribute to sustainability efforts. “We need to make a start,” he said, indicating that the authority is providing ample time for industry players, businesses, and the public to adapt to these changes.

The SAF Levy’s implementation aligns with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) goal for net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation sector by 2050. Singapore aims to reduce domestic airport emissions by 20% from 2019 levels by 2030 as part of its sustainable aviation plan.

The CAAS explained that the levy is calculated based on the expected volume of sustainable aviation fuel required to meet a 1% target for 2026 along with the projected price premium of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel. Consequently, the charge will vary depending on the distance of the flight and the fuel consumption anticipated for that route.

Travellers on flights departing Singapore will see a separate tax charge on their ticket receipts. However, those simply transiting through Singapore or transferring between airlines will not incur additional fees. The levy structure categorizes destinations into four geographic groups based on distance, and the fees differ for economy and premium cabin passengers. For example, flights to South-East Asia in economy will see an additional charge of just SGD 1 (approximately $1.18), while economy fare passengers heading to Australia will be charged SGD 3.30, rising to SGD 13.21 for premium cabin seats. Most notably, those flying in business or first class to the Americas will face the highest surcharge of SGD 49.08.

As air travel begins to rebound in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australian statistics indicate a marked increase in visitors from Singapore. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a growth in short-term visitors, with 39,590 entering Australia from Singapore as of September this year, a sharp increase from prior years.

Additionally, the SAF Levy will apply to cargo shipping costs through Singapore. Shipping charges will range from SGD 0.01 to SGD 0.15 per kilogram depending on geographic categories, and private jet operators will face fees between SGD 47.19 and SGD 7,668 based on aircraft type and size.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is recognized for its capacity to significantly reduce carbon emissions—by up to 80%—and can be produced from various renewable sources, ensuring it does not compete with food supply chains. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF utilizes biomass that has absorbed CO2 during its lifecycle, thus recycling carbon rather than adding to overall emissions.

While Australia has not yet adopted a mandatory sustainable fuel tax, the local aviation sector is encouraged to aim for emissions reduction. Qantas, Jetstar, and Virgin Australia currently provide options for passengers to voluntarily offset their carbon emissions but lack enforced sustainability costs. However, industry experts, such as Neil Hansford, predict that the Australian government will closely observe the effectiveness of Singapore’s SAF Levy, potentially paving the way for similar measures in Australia.

The latest developments in Australia’s aviation sustainability efforts include a notable commitment from the federal government, which has earmarked $1.1 billion to promote the production of low-carbon fuels, including a specific Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative. The Australian government foresees the first cleaner fuels produced by 2029, aiming to gradually replace traditional fossil fuels.

In summary, Singapore’s SAF Levy reflects a pioneering approach to aviation sustainability, and as international focus on emission reductions intensifies, Australia must navigate its policies on sustainable aviation to remain competitive while aiming for reduced environmental impact.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Singapore-to-Introduce-World-First-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Tax-for-Flights.jpeg,N,,2025-11-21 12:56:15.038558

Nature is at the heart of who we are in Aotearoa New Zealand – our identity, our whakapapa (genealogy), our economy, our way of life.

Yet, 63% of native ecosystems are under threat and three-quarters of native species are threatened or at risk of extinction. This is a major concern, particularly as much of our nature, from Kākāpo to Pekapeka bats, don’t exist anywhere else in the world.

What’s needed is a grass-roots-led movement.

Deloitte’s Sustainability, Creative, and Hourua Pae Rau teams recently won a game-changing project with the Department of Conservation (DOC) to build a national movement around action for nature, including public, businesses, and community groups.

Our pitch-winning approach demonstrated that yet another advertising campaign isn’t going to drive the scale of change needed. Instead, we combined our creative, sustainability and te ao Māori knowledge to flip the script.

Always Be Naturing is a three-year campaign designed to boost the nation’s connection with nature in new ways. It shows how we can rebalance the way we view and treat nature, from something to consume to something that has rights as New Zealand’s greatest asset.

The connection between land and sea has shaped Aotearoa New Zealand since the arrival of the first waka. Today, shipping plays a vital role in trade, with 99.7% of New Zealand’s goods by volume moving by sea.

But as the importance of protecting nature and shifting towards low-emissions supply chains increasingly becomes a global concern, a key question arises: how can we decarbonise shipping and remain competitive as a trading nation?

Deloitte has a long-standing relationship with The Aotearoa Circle. Together, we developed the Our Future Fit Shipping Report to explore and outline possible pathways and key considerations for establishing a resilient, future-ready maritime economy.

The report explores key considerations for establishing a trans-Tasman green shipping corridor and provides four alternative fuel roadmaps, along with an assessment of the economic risks for New Zealand if action is delayed.

Deloitte is proud to be helping lead the way toward a low-carbon future. As part of our global network, we’ve committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2040, a target validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In FY25, we continued to advance this ambition, with a network-wide Transition Plan underway to guide how we transform our operations, practices and culture. Our strategy also focuses on empowering our people and investing in the transformation needed to embed sustainability into everything we do.

Deloitte New Zealand has voluntarily reported its emissions for eight years (and measured them for eighteen), a reflection of our long-standing commitment to transparency. While not a mandated reporting entity under New Zealand’s climate-related disclosures regime, we remain committed to measuring our impact, setting ambitious targets, and tracking our progress openly.

Our FY25 greenhouse gas inventory includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 business travel emissions. We continue to refine our methodology for Scope 3 emissions from employee commuting and working from home as well as our approach to measuring and managing emissions from purchased goods and services (PG&S), with plans to include these categories in our footprint going forward.

In FY25, we collected data from our employees regarding their commuting and remote working habits, estimating associated emissions at 1,937 tCO2e. Building on these insights, we have developed a strategy aimed at decarbonising employee commuting. As part of this approach, we are introducing benefits that enhance affordable access to public transport and cycling options for our people.

We have made strong progress on Scope 2 emissions, having met our target of sourcing renewable electricity across all tenancies. By purchasing Renewable Electricity Certificates (RECs) for any portion of our energy supply not already certified as renewable, we are able to report zero Scope 2 emissions, in accordance with our Science Based Target for renewable energy. We also continue to work closely with landlords to transition shared spaces to renewable sources and to support efforts to decarbonise our buildings.

Our climate commitments rely on collaboration across our value chain, both locally and globally. Technology (hardware and software), as the main source of our PG&S emissions, remains a key focus for supply chain decarbonisation. Deloitte is recognized as an industry leader in supplier engagement for sustainability, earning an A score in the CDP Supplier Engagement Assessment, which highlights our leadership and transparency in promoting climate action throughout our supply chain.

FY25 marked the third and final year of our BNZ Sustainability-Linked Loan, with KPIs tied to renewable electricity and business travel- both of which were successfully met. These achievements strengthen our position as we work toward our near-term 2030 goals and our net-zero target for 2040.

As a sector with a high reliance on air travel, Deloitte recognises the unique decarbonisation challenges aviation presents. Business travel remains one of our most material sources of emissions, and we’re committed to reducing its impact through intentional choices, firm-wide engagement, and investment in low-emission solutions.

For the past three years, Deloitte New Zealand has implemented business unit-level carbon budgets to ensure visibility and accountability. We’re making more intentional choices about when and how we travel, supported by internal policies that guide decision-making. This approach has delivered excellent results, with gross travel emissions down 30% from our FY19 baseline, and travel emissions per full-time equivalent (FTE) reduced by 48%. These reductions reflect strong engagement across the firm, supported by education, awareness, and regular reporting.

We continue to invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through the purchase of SAF certificates and strategic partnerships across Deloitte’s global network. These efforts are designed to stimulate market demand and accelerate the commercial viability of low-emission aviation fuels. Deloitte also supports global efforts to improve traceability and reporting of SAF certificates and usage.

In FY25, we updated our Sustainable Delivery Framework, providing teams with guidance to estimate engagement-level emissions, communicate these to clients, and work collaboratively to reduce the footprint of each project. This is part of our broader commitment to low-carbon delivery and shared responsibility.

Our near-term 2030 target to reduce travel emissions per FTE by 55% is an emissions intensity goal, enabling us to track performance relative to firm growth. Looking ahead, our long term net-zero by 2040 target will require a 90% reduction in gross emissions – an ambitious goal, but one we’re actively preparing for through innovation, transparency and collective action.",https://media.deloitte.com/is/image/deloitte/NZIR24-WebTopBanner-1920x880-Enviro:1200-x-627,N,,2025-11-21 15:57:14.818089

The second day of IAS2025 explored how airport leaders are navigating turbulence, embracing automation and delivering inclusive, data-driven passenger experiences.

Airport executives share strategies for leading through turbulence and growth

Day two opened with a keynote panel moderated by Chris Woodroofe, Managing Director of Manchester Airport, featuring senior leaders Sigrún Björk Jakobsdóttir, CEOof Isavia Regional Airports Iceland and Laila Odina, CEO of Riga Airport. The discussion explored how airports are adapting to rising passenger volumes, ageing infrastructure and shifting commercial dynamics, including the paradox of increased footfall but declining per-passenger spend.

Speakers highlighted that resilience now depends on organisational agility as much as infrastructure planning. Geopolitical shocks, volatile transfer markets and natural disruptions such as volcanos require flexible horizons rather than rigid masterplans. Both airports noted the complexity of refurbishing legacy terminals, where hidden conditions and outdated documentation often make upgrades more costly and disruptive than new builds.

The panel stressed disciplined asset management, digital documentation and frank dialogue on funding and realistic returns. Leadership through turbulence, they agreed, demands clarity, strong middle-management capability and constant recalibration to keep airports functioning as vital economic engines.

Reinventing check-ins for speed and convenience

In a fireside chat moderated by Mats Berglind, Innovation Manager, Swedavia, Borry Vrieling (Eezeetags) and Doug Wycoff (Tampa International Airport) examined why check-in remains one of the most outdated, friction-heavy parts of the passenger journey and why modernisation is critical for capacity, commercial performance and satisfaction. While technology for biometrics, self-service bag drops and AI queue management exists, adoption has been slow, leaving processes largely unchanged for decades.

Speakers urged airports to design around human behaviour, not technology, noting that most travellers are stressed and want to “exhale” after security. Seamless check-in drives retail engagement and dwell-time opportunities, while clean facilities and intuitive wayfinding boost commercial returns. The vision ahead is decentralised, data-driven and nearly invisible, with remote bag-drop at hotels, stations and curbside. Though regulatory and infrastructure hurdles remain, the business case is strong: fewer staffed desks reshape terminal design and redeploy staff into passenger care, improving experience and revenue.

Net zero aviation powered by game-changing tech

This panel moderated by Maurice Jenkins, Chief Innovation Officer of Miami International brought together Chris Woodroofe, MD of Manchester Airport, Giampiero Goretti, Head of energy Management and Decarbonisation at Aeroporti di Roma and Rachel Gardner-Poole OBE, Sustainable Aviatin Consultant for NATS to examine the technologies shaping aviation’s decarbonisation journey. The discussion focused on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), carbon capture, AI-driven efficiency and the regulatory and investment challenges ahead.

Speakers stressed that airports face a dual challenge: transforming energy systems, fleets and infrastructure while maintaining commercial viability. Aeroporti di Roma outlined its roadmap to net zero, positioning airports as energy producers through renewables and smart grids. Manchester Airport warned that unco-ordinated transitions risk “green bottlenecks”, citing grid constraints during rapid electrification.

The panel agreed there is no single fuel solution: SAF is vital but scarce, hydrogen and electrification have limits, and airspace modernisation offers major carbon savings. Ultimately, decarbonisation demands system-wide change, rapid innovation and collaboration—turning airports into energy hubs and operationally agile leaders in sustainability.

Accessibility revolution: inclusive tech takes centre stage

Al Titterington, Terminal Operations Director, Birmingham Airport moderated a panel featuring Darrell Watson, Senior Vice President & Chief Experience Officer Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport and Michele Parietti, Head of PRM Assistance from SEA Milan Airports, showcasing innovations that transform accessibility from a niche service into a core passenger experience priority. With PRM volumes rising rapidly and encompassing physical, sensory and hidden needs, speakers urged airports to embed accessibility into every design decision rather than retrofitting solutions.

Louisville highlighted its GoodMaps app, which uses LiDAR to deliver precise indoor navigation for blind and low-vision travellers without requiring airport infrastructure—boosting autonomy and reducing assisted-travel costs. Milan discussed autonomous wheelchairs, sensory-friendly spaces and redesigning high-failure touchpoints to meet surging demand.

The panel stressed that technology must enable complete journeys, not partial fixes, and that autonomy is the new benchmark for service quality. Inclusive design and integrated systems, they concluded, will define future terminals and deliver better airports for all passengers.

Carbon-neutral baggage handling systems

In this session experts from Brussels Airport, Heathrow and Forbo explored how airports can cut emissions and energy use in baggage handling systems without compromising performance.

Forbo showcased low-friction conveyor components that reduce mechanical resistance, cutting energy consumption, heat generation and cooling needs, while enabling recycled or bio-based PVC. Heathrow emphasised embedding efficiency at the design stage, moving from legacy systems to demand-driven conveyor flows that operate only when bags are moving. This approach supports waste heat recovery, LED lighting and advanced monitoring to identify energy losses.

The panel agreed that carbon-neutral BHS is achievable through smarter materials, optimised layouts and continuous monitoring. Incremental innovations such as off-site processing and intelligent routing can deliver measurable reductions today, while rising passenger awareness strengthens the commercial case. Collaboration across suppliers, airports and operators will be key to future-proofing baggage infrastructure.

Robotics and autonomy address workforce shortages

A panel moderated by Henk Brandsma Strategic Process Developer Baggage, Airport Operations, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol explored how airports are deploying robotics and AI to tackle labour shortages, improve efficiency and enhance passenger experience. Speakers from Fraport, Aena and Vienna Airport shared real-world applications, including autonomous wheelchairs, ramp inspection robots, document delivery systems and condition-monitoring units.

Aena highlighted autonomous wheelchairs at Madrid-Barajas and ramp inspection robots, while Vienna showcased VR training for ramp staff and robots for interdepartmental document transport. Frankfurt Airport demonstrated wheelchairs capable of announcements and navigation in tight spaces, alongside robots performing terminal checks.

The discussion stressed that automation complements human expertise rather than replacing it. Staff engagement, training and change management are critical for adoption, while passenger trials show strong acceptance. Despite infrastructure challenges, robotics is delivering measurable gains in safety, efficiency and service quality, signalling a future where human-machine collaboration becomes central to airport operations.

AI that sees the future: predictive maintenance in action

This session explored how airports are using AI and real-time sensor data to predict failures, reduce downtime and optimise resources. Doug Wycoff (Tampa International) and Leif Johnson (Bentley) emphasised that the breakthrough lies not in adding sensors but in leveraging existing data for actionable insights.

Tampa International showcased AI-driven crowd management and facility monitoring, which cut staffing needs and improved passenger flow, while predictive smoke detection in car parks now provides 10–15 minutes of extra lead time. Bentley highlighted contextualised data as the key to success, enabling systems to correlate asset history, vibration patterns and energy use to trigger work orders before failures occur.

The panel stressed that predictive maintenance is a cultural shift, requiring trust, phased rollouts and strong data governance. Airports that treat AI as an operational evolution rather than an IT project will see the fastest and most sustainable returns.

Smart tech optimising every inch of the airport

Thomas Romig, COO of Brussels Airport moderated a panel featuring Edmonton, Aeroporti di Roma, +Impact and Synaptic Aviation, focusing on AI-driven tools that deliver measurable gains in airport operations. The discussion highlighted intelligent stand allocation, turnaround optimisation and frontline service enhancements.

+Impact showcased real-time translation and mobile tools that empower staff to resolve passenger queries instantly while generating valuable operational data. Synaptic Aviation demonstrated computer-vision monitoring for turnarounds, reducing delays and improving safety through transparent, unbiased records. Edmonton shared its rollout of generative AI tools across 60 teams, freeing staff from manual tasks and accelerating access to policies and documentation. Rome outlined its dual approach: deploying proven solutions and building in-house systems for apron monitoring and passenger engagement.

The panel concluded that AI’s greatest impact lies in augmenting people, not replacing them. Success depends on robust digital infrastructure, change management and treating AI as a people-centred transformation.

Transforming the passenger experience from curb to gate

This fireside chat with Kerry Skelly (Aerocloud) and Roland Böhm (Berlin Airport) explored how AI and real-time data are reshaping airport operations and passenger experience. The discussion highlighted predictive queue management, dynamic resource planning and the potential for personalised journeys, while addressing GDPR compliance and scalability for smaller airports.

AeroCloud emphasised privacy-by-design in AI flow modelling, while Berlin Brandenburg shared early successes with AI-driven security and turnaround optimisation. Both speakers outlined a future where airports actively “pull” passengers through checkpoints based on real-time capacity and preferences, reducing queues and improving dwell-time opportunities.

The panel stressed that personalisation must remain optional, supported by clear signage and staff assistance. Long-term, digital travel credentials could eliminate check-in entirely, freeing terminal space for revenue-generating uses. The message was clear: AI is becoming a structural enabler of seamless travel, but trust, transparency and robust infrastructure are essential.

Radar technology keeping skies safe

This session explored how advanced radar is transforming wildlife hazard management at Berlin Brandenburg Airport. Sibylle Giraud (Robin Radar Systems) and Christian Miersch (Berlin Airport) highlighted how real-time monitoring and deterrents are reducing bird strike risks and improving operational resilience.

Berlin’s upgrade from Robin Radar’s Flex to Max system delivered a step-change in precision, enabling altitude tracking and faster refresh rates to identify genuine conflicts with aircraft operations. The panel stressed that radar is not a replacement for human expertise but a force multiplier, extending situational awareness across BER’s 1,500-hectare footprint and guiding deterrents with greater accuracy.

Long-term data emerged as a key benefit, allowing airports to analyse seasonal patterns, evaluate habitat strategies and justify safety investments. Looking ahead, sensor fusion combining bird and drone detection promises unified situational awareness. The takeaway: high-fidelity radar is now essential for mitigating wildlife risks and demonstrating due diligence.

Securing the skies with cutting-edge security tech

Moderated by Oliver Braun, Head of Security at Berlin Airport this panel examined how airports are responding to escalating drone threats.

Speakers warned that drone incursions have evolved from hobbyist activity to sophisticated, state-level tactics, with recent incidents at Brussels Airport causing multimillion-euro disruptions. The panel stressed that single-sensor detection is no longer viable; airports need layered systems combining RF, radar, acoustic and camera analytics to confirm threats and restore operations quickly.

Legislative gaps remain a major challenge, with fragmented responsibilities across airports, ANSPs and law enforcement. Panellists called for stronger national coordination and investment in multi-sensor platforms that can also support wildlife monitoring and airfield inspections. The message was clear: counter-drone capability is now essential for operational resilience, requiring proactive planning, clear authority and rapid stakeholder collaboration.

The numbers being discussed speak of staggering growth in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region: tens of thousands of new aircraft needed, trillions in economic value, and growth rates that dwarf every other region.

However, the manufacturers presenting these rosy forecasts are the same ones currently running months or even years behind on deliveries. Adding tens of thousands of orders to already stretched production lines won’t make things any easier.

Boeing: Banking on Southeast Asia’s 7% growth

Dave Schulte, Boeing’s Managing Director for APAC Marketing, emphasized Southeast Asia’s massive potential, reckoning that the region needs 4,885 new aircraft over the next 20 years, split between 3,975 single-aisle jets and 910 widebodies.

“We’re forecasting 7% annual growth—the fastest in the world alongside South Asia,” Schulte explained, noting that the region’s middle class has doubled over 25 years and currently shows no signs of slowing.

But Boeing faces a challenge it readily admits: a global shortfall of 1,500 aircraft that should already have been delivered, but weren’t. “Airlines used to plan five or six years out. Now they have to plan 10, even 15 years into the future,” Schulte observed, highlighting how the supply crunch is reshaping the industry.

The company is betting on its 737 MAX family, claiming that one takes off or lands every 12-13 seconds globally. Recently, new orders have been secured from ANA (18 aircraft), Malaysia Airlines (60), and Japan Airlines (50).

Airbus: betting on APAC’s billion-strong middle class

Airbus President APAC Anand Stanley presented even larger numbers, forecasting nearly 20,000 new passenger aircraft needed across the broader Asia-Pacific region, representing 46% of global demand.

“All of this ends up making Asia Pacific one of the most successful commercial and economic stories, one of the largest consumer markets in the world,” Stanley stated, pointing to GDP growth of 3.4% annually and an expanding middle class of one billion people.

The European manufacturer projects demand for 16,000 single-aisle aircraft and 3,480 widebodies, with the region already operating the world’s largest widebody fleet at 900 units.

Stanley emphasized sustainability as a key differentiator, noting that new Airbus aircraft deliver 25% better fuel efficiency, with the company working toward 100% sustainable aviation fuel capability.

Recent wins include Qantas’s A350-1000 for Project Sunrise, the world’s longest commercial flights, plus new Asian customers such as EVA Air and Korean Air joining the A350 program.

Embraer: building a $10 billion business in the APAC regional market

While Boeing and Airbus battle over large jet orders, Embraer CEO Arjan Meijer sees massive opportunity in the regional segment. The Brazilian manufacturer forecasts APAC and China will need 3,390 aircraft in the up-to-150-seat category, the largest regional requirement globally.

“We hope to climb to a $10 billion company towards the end of the decade,” Meijer revealed, in light of a $50.2 billion commercial backlog.

Embraer’s strategy targets three specific opportunities: penetrating cost-conscious low-cost carriers with the E195-E2’s improved economics; replacing Asia’s 800 aging turboprops (37% of the global fleet); and expanding hub connectivity for major carriers. The company has already notched up wins with Virgin Australia, All Nippon Airways, and LATAM, pushing E2 commitments beyond 250 aircraft.

Unlike its larger rivals, Embraer is building ground-up infrastructure, establishing simulators in Singapore, plus warehouses with $100 million in parts, and strategic partnerships across the region. “Asia Pacific is not by coincidence a focus market,” Meijer emphasized.

Reality check: orders don’t fly, aircraft do

All three aircraft manufacturers are essentially betting their futures on the same forecast: Asia-Pacific is where industry action will be for the next 20 years.

However, the companies are already behind. Boeing admits they’re 1,500 aircraft short of where they should be, airlines are scrambling to lock in slots a decade out, and supply chain issues remain in place.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/11/Untitled-design-20.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 11:56:45.784271

Food transportation bridges food and transportation systems. A study based on “food miles” concept revealed that, when considering the entire food supply chain, emissions from food transportation account for ~19% of global food system emissions2. This underscores the critical need for strategies aimed at mitigating emissions associated with food transportation, contributing co-benefits in decarbonizing both food system and transportation system.

With global population growth and an increasing demand for food, the amount of wastes generated by food system has risen sharply. Proper management of food system wastes has thus become a crucial aspect of controlling or mitigating emissions within food system3,4,5,6,7. The conversion of food system wastes into biofuels for transportation has already seen widespread application. Among food system wastes, used cooking oil (UCO) and crop residues (CRs) demonstrate advantages in collection and treatment efficiency, exhibiting more homogeneous compositions compared with other wastes such as kitchen waste. Additionally, the technologies for their conversion into biofuels are more mature, establishing them as primary feedstocks for biofuel production8,9,10,11. Biodiesel is the most common form of biofuels, primarily used in road, railway & inland waterway, and marine transportation12,13,14.

Established pathways for converting UCO include esterification-hydrogenation and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) processes following hydrolysis15,16. Esterification-hydrogenation yields high-quality biodiesel suitable for road, rail, and inland waterway transport by effectively converting UCO fatty acids. HEFA technology, involving high-pressure hydrogenation, transforms UCO lipids into drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), currently the dominant bio-aviation pathway, achieving higher energy density and combustion performance17,18,19,20. CRs can be converted via fast pyrolysis or gasification-Fischer-Tropsch synthesis21,22. Fast pyrolysis rapidly decomposes solid biomass into liquid bio-oil, while Fischer-Tropsch synthesis produces premium liquid fuels from syngas without requiring specific feedstock chemical structures, making it suitable for producing Fischer-Tropsch aviation fuel from lignocellulosic materials like CRs17,18,19,20. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely employed to compare different fuel technologies, with numerous studies demonstrating that biofuels, when replacing fossil fuels, result in significant emission reduction23,24,25. Regarding the collection and energy potential of CRs and UCO, a large number of research has estimated the amount of CRs available in different regions based on crop yields and residue indices26,27,28,29. When estimating the energy potential of CRs, it is crucial to account for competing uses beyond biofuel production30,31. Contextualized in the diverse ways of CRs utilization, and the influence of climate and dietary habits on their spatial distribution, extant research has conducted analysis of CRs’ competing uses targeting typical countries or regions32,33,34. Studies on UCO recycling predominantly address collection and transportation strategies at the consumption end35,36. Unlike CRs, which have multiple competing uses, the main energy utilization pathway for UCO is biodiesel production34,35,36,37. Various conversion technologies have been examined to explore UCO’s potential for biofuel production38,39,40,41.

Building on studies of food system wastes’ energy potentials, some research has also analyzed the emission reduction benefits of biofuel production from food system wastes in specific regions. Typical studies cover estimates of the emission reduction potential of biodiesel produced from CRs in Europe for use in marine transportation42, assessment of the bioenergy potential and emission reduction contributed by CRs utilization in China43, analysis of the environmental impacts of converting UCO to biodiesel in China44, and evaluation of the emission reduction effect of biodiesel produced from UCO in Iran under specific UCO recycling strategies45. These studies further demonstrate the potential of utilizing wastes-derived biofuels for controlling transportation emissions in practical applications.

While converting food system wastes to biofuels has demonstrated effectiveness in fossil fuel substitution and emission reduction, critical knowledge gaps remain. First, from a food system perspective, the energy and environmental benefits feedback achievable by repurposing such biofuels specifically for food transportation remains unclear. Second, existing research lacks an integrated analytical framework that concurrently addresses global variations in food system wastes availability and disparate food transportation fuel demands across countries. Consequently, the extent to which domestically produced biofuels can offset heterogeneous transportation fossil fuel demands remains unknown, hindering the characterization of individual countries’ contributions to decarbonizing global food and transportation systems.

To address these gaps, this study establishes an internal recycling loop within the food system where food system waste streams are repurposed for food transportation. It aims to quantify national-level biofuel production potentials from such wastes and evaluate the corresponding contribution in decarbonizing food system transportation by substituting fossil fuels. The internal recycling loop within food system is illustrated in Fig. 1, the food system spans five sequential stages: agricultural production, food transportation and trade, processing and transformation, retail and provisioning, and food consumption. UCO and CRs generated from these stages are collected and processed into biofuels. These biofuels then substitute fossil fuels across various transportation modes (road, railway & inland waterway, marine, aviation), providing energy for food transportation while reducing emissions within the food system. Though biofuel utilization may extend beyond food-related transportation in practice, emerging carbon trading mechanisms and global carbon market developments enable the reallocation of environmental benefits to food systems through carbon quota allocations or fiscal incentives46,47. This approach creates synergistic feedback between emission reductions in the transportation sector and sustainability improvements in food production chains.

From the food system internal loop perspective, targeting 130 countries in the world, the availability and biofuel production potentials of CRs and UCO in various countries are accounted, combined with examining country-specific fossil fuel demands of food transportation adopting multiregional input-output model (MRIO). On this basis, four scenarios are designed to analyze the biofuel production and emission reduction contributions under varying food system wastes utilization levels (scenario of sole UCO utilization, scenario of sole CRs utilization, scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, and scenario of maximum biofuel production potential). The life cycle analysis and GREET (greenhouse gases, regulated emissions, and energy use in transportation) model are combined to compare the well-to-wheel/haul/wake (WTW/WTH/WTWa) emissions from typical biofuels and fossil fuels under the four scenarios, including emissions from the production phase (well-to-pump, WTP) and the operation phase (pump-to-wheel/haul/wake, PTW/PTH/PTWa). The findings are expected to provide references for informing global energy utilization strategies of food system wastes, and sustainability of food transportation.

Fossil fuel demand of global food transportation

Analysis of this study reveals that the aggregate food transportation fossil fuel demand across 130 countries amounts to around 3.0 EJ (1 EJ = 1018 J), constituting 3.3% of total transportation fossil fuel demand. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of food transportation fossil fuel demands across various transportation modes. As one of the world’s preeminent food producers and consumers, China exhibits substantially higher food transportation fossil fuel demand compared with other countries. Similarly, other major food-producing countries, including India, Brazil, the United States, and Russia, demonstrate elevated demand, while the African and Middle Eastern countries show comparatively lower demand. Among four transportation modes, road transportation dominates the fossil fuel demand, accounting for ~80.6% of total demand across 130 countries. Aviation and marine transport follow with 8.4% and 7.4% respectively. Railway & inland waterway transportation exhibits significantly lower fossil fuel dependence (3.6% combined), primarily due to the higher electrification levels of railway. Regionally, railway & inland waterway fuel demands are concentrated in China, Latin America, and the Middle East, with China and Russia recording elevated shares of 8.86% and 6.25% respectively. Notably, archipelagic and coastal countries like the Philippines, Brunei, and Indonesia demonstrate exceptional marine fossil fuel intensity, with marine transportation constituting over 20% of their national fossil fuel consumption.

Biofuel production from food system wastes

This study suggests that the theoretically maximum biofuel production from UCO across 130 countries reaches 0.41 EJ (1.03%), while CRs-derived biofuels exhibit an overwhelmingly higher potential of 38.77 EJ (98.97%). This disparity arises because CRs possess inherent advantages in sheer amount, being inevitable agricultural byproducts with broad geographical distribution. While UCO, despite its higher conversion efficiency, is constrained by limited waste oil availability and immature collection infrastructure. These limitations collectively restrict UCO’s total biofuel production potential far below that of CRs. Figure 3 delineates the biofuel production from UCO and CRs across countries, revealing that those with higher food production and consumption demonstrate correspondingly greater potentials. Regionally, for UCO-derived biofuel production, China (106.8 PJ, 1 PJ = 1015 J) and the United States (100.0 PJ) collectively contribute 51.0% of the global total, driven by their extensive food service industries and consumption patterns. Major oilseed-producing countries, including Indonesia (32.6 PJ), Malaysia (29.5 PJ), and India (15.8 PJ), form the secondary tier, contributing 19.2% of the global total and correlating with their expanding vegetable oil utilization in food processing sectors. For CRs-derived biofuel production, major agricultural countries demonstrate overwhelming advantages: China (10.7 EJ), the United States (8.2 EJ), India (7.6 EJ), and Brazil (6.4 EJ) collectively account for 55.2% of the total, supported by vast croplands and high-intensity farming systems. Other leading grain producers such as Russia and Argentina follow, with CRs-derived biofuel production surpassing 2 EJ.

The biofuel production from UCO and CRs varies significantly depending on their utilization rate (especially competing uses for CRs) and energy conversion efficiency. UCO demonstrates superior energy conversion efficiency compared with CRs (Table S5 in Supplementary Information), yielding higher biofuel production per unit of wastes (PJ). Figure 4 presents a comparative result between fossil fuel demand and biofuel production from UCO and CRs across 11 regions (divided according to World Oil Outlook from OPEC48, with clustering of countries by economic parity and geographic proximity) under four scenarios. Table S8 provides detailed country-specific data regarding the fossil fuel demand that could be satisfied by UCO and CRs-derived biofuels. In the scenario of sole UCO utilization, significant biofuel production is seen in Asia, OECD Americas, and Europe. In the scenario of sole CRs utilization, despite a 7% utilization limit, CRs show broader potential, with over a third of 130 countries fully covering their food transportation fossil fuel demand. This performance confirms CRs’ persistently superior biofuel production capacity relative to UCO, attributable to their fundamental advantage in sheer production amount. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization outperforms sole-feedstock scenarios, meeting most food transportation fossil fuel demand except in the Middle East and Russia. In the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, the biofuel production exceeds food transportation fossil fuel demand in most regions, with India and Latin America capable of meeting their entire transportation sector’s fossil fuel demand (Fig. S2).

Emission reductions in food transportation through food system wastes-derived biofuels

Total emissions from the production and use of fossil fuels in food transportation across 130 countries are 256.6 million metric tonnes (Mt) CO2. Figure 5 shows emission distributions across four transportation modes in 11 regions. Road transportation dominates the total emissions, contributing 204.7 Mt CO₂ (80.7% of emissions across four modes), followed by aviation and marine transportation with tied contributions (19.8 Mt CO₂, 7.8%). Railway & inland waterway transportation exhibits the lowest emissions at 9.2 Mt CO₂, accounting for only 3.7%. Regionally, China exhibits the highest emissions across all modes except marine transportation, with road transportation (48.5 Mt CO₂, 23.7% of global road transportation emissions) and railway & inland waterway transportation (4.9 Mt CO₂, 53.5% of global railway & inland waterway transportation emissions) being particularly significant. Other Asian regions, the Middle East, and Latin America collectively account for around half of marine transportation emissions, each exceeding 25 Mt CO₂. In aviation transportation, OECD European countries (31.95 Mt CO₂, 16.12% of global aviation transportation emissions) emerge as major contributors alongside China.

Each country exhibits distinct emission reduction profiles in food transportation by utilizing food system wastes-derived biofuels. Figure 6a–d illustrates country-specific emission reductions across scenarios, with details for 130 countries presented in Table S9. The scenario of sole UCO utilization achieves 28.9 Mt CO₂ reductions (11.4% of food transportation emissions), with emission reduction proportions in high UCO producers like Malaysia and Indonesia being as high as over 95%, while other countries mostly achieve reductions in the 0−20% range in this scenario. The scenario of sole CRs utilization achieves 119.1 Mt CO₂ reductions (47.0%), with China, India, Brazil, and the US contributing above half of total reductions. Approximately half of the analyzed countries attain over 50% reductions in their national emissions. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization achieves 135.0 Mt CO₂ reductions (53.2%), nearly half of the analyzed countries could achieve complete offset of food transportation fossil fuel demand through food system wastes-derived biofuels, achieving 70%−83% emission reductions. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, reductions reach 174.9 Mt CO₂ (69.0%), with only 21 countries’ food transportation fossil fuel demands being incompletely offset by food system wastes-derived biofuels, and nearly 80% of countries achieving an emission reduction proportion over 70%.

For four transportation modes, UCO-derived biofuels excel in reducing emissions from road, railway & inland waterway, while CRs-derived biofuels are more effective for marine and aviation (Table S7). As road transportation accounts for the highest fuel demand among the four modes, UCO-derived biofuels generally achieve greater overall emission reductions per unit when implementing biofuel substitution according to fuel demand shares for four modes. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, road transportation demonstrates global leadership in emission reduction, achieving 130.8 Mt CO₂ reductions, constituting 76.9% of total food transportation emissions mitigation. Aviation and marine transportation follow with 17.3 Mt CO₂ (9.9%) and 16.7 Mt CO₂ (9.5%) reductions respectively, while railway & inland waterway transportation, constrained by existing electrification levels of railway, contribute marginally at 6.46 Mt CO₂ (3.7%). Figure 6e shows emission reduction proportions across regions, transportation modes, and scenarios. All countries exhibit consistent, substantial road transportation reductions, particularly in the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential. Emission reductions in marine transportation are concentrated in coastal and island regions (e.g., the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia), where marine transportation contributes up to 20% of national mitigation totals. Middle Eastern countries and Russia exhibit >30% mitigation enhancement under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential compared to the scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, indicating that elevated

Uncertainty analysis

The calculations of fossil fuel demand, biofuel production, food transportation emissions, and emission reductions are rigorously examined using Monte Carlo analysis. The yield coefficients of CRs, along with the collection coefficients of CRs and UCO, determine the utilizable amount of food system wastes. The energy conversion coefficients of UCO and CRs, combined with their biofuel conversion coefficients, critically influence the amount of biofuel production. The fuel demand shares for four transportation modes directly govern fossil fuel demand across four transportation modes, which is essential for estimating fossil fuel emissions in food transportation. Additionally, WTW emission coefficients of biofuels and fossil fuels serve as pivotal parameters for quantifying emissions and emission reductions in food transportation. These key factors have therefore been incorporated into the uncertainty analysis of calculation outcomes.

The Monte Carlo method employs triangular distributions for parameter estimation, generating 10,000 independent simulations, with results aggregated using statistical indicators. As shown in Fig. 7, road transportation exhibits a broader uncertainty range in fossil fuel demand and emission calculations compared to other transportation modes, primarily due to its higher fuel demand share. The substantially greater utilizable amount of CRs relative to UCO amplifies uncertainty in the CRs derived-biofuel production potentials. Furthermore, the uncertainty ranges of emission reductions across the four scenarios increase incrementally with rising emission reduction levels, with the scenario of sole UCO utilization demonstrating a notably smaller uncertainty range than the other three scenarios.

Research remarks

Building upon the quantified global analysis of fossil fuel demand and emissions in food transportation across multiple countries, this study pioneers an internal recycling loop framework of food system. The study proposes converting food system wastes (UCO and CRs) into biofuels for food transportation, establishing a synchronized decarbonization pathway that simultaneously achieves waste valorization and dual-system (food-transportation) emission mitigation. This study reveals that most countries could completely satisfy their food transportation fuel demands while mitigating 174.9 Mt CO2 emission reductions (around 70%) by utilizing all available UCO and <20% of total CRs. The details of the research remarks are as follows.

Food transportation represents a critical intersection between food system and the transportation sector. The calculations of this study, when compared with the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report49,50,51, show that food transportation contributes 3.34% of food system emissions and 2.95% of transportation sector emissions, representing a shared source of emissions between these two systems. The results may be conservative as the emission calculations solely account for oil fuel and natural gas fuel amenable to substitution with biofuels, without considering electricity consumption in food transportation.

On this basis, this study proposes an internal recycling loop within the food system, whereby food system wastes are repurposed for food transportation applications. This approach offers dual benefits: alleviating the disposal burden and resource wasting associated with substantial food system wastes, while simultaneously reducing fossil fuel dependency in food transportation, thereby propelling food transportation decarbonization. While practical applications may see food system wastes-derived biofuels utilized across various transportation sectors rather than exclusively in food transportation, the evolving global carbon trading policies and carbon markets present opportunities for channeling energy and environmental benefits back to the food system through carbon quotas or economic incentives46,47.

Moving forward beyond previous studies conducted28,29,52, a global analysis comparing the biofuel production potentials is provided from waste streams of UCO and CRs, followed by the assessment of the extent to which these wastes-derived biofuels could meet food transportation fossil fuel demands. Building on this analysis, the potential emission reductions achievable through food system wastes-derived biofuels substitution are calculated and compared across different regions, countries, and transportation modes. This leads to the development of synchronized decarbonization strategies for both food and transportation systems. The findings aim to inform global food wastes utilization strategies, transportation emission mitigation approaches, and sustainable development of food system.

Matching food transportation fossil fuel demands with wastes-derived biofuels

This study reveals that total food transportation fossil fuel demand in 130 countries is 3.03 EJ, accounting for 3.27% of the transportation sector’s total demand. The demand patterns vary significantly across countries and transportation modes, with major food-producing and consuming countries like China, India, Brazil, and the US showing the highest demand. Road transportation dominates, reflecting its central role in food logistics. Regarding food system wastes availability and the biofuel production potential, the analysis indicates that UCO and CRs could theoretically provide 0.41 EJ and 38.77 EJ of energy respectively across 130 countries. Matching each country’s food transportation fossil fuel demand with food system waste-derived biofuels reveals that in the scenario of sole UCO utilization, UCO-derived biofuels could meet 13% of global food transportation fossil fuel demand. Countries rich in oil crops, such as Indonesia and Malaysia, could satisfy over 95% of their food transportation fossil fuel demands through UCO-derived biofuels. Under the scenario of sole CRs utilization, despite limiting availability to 7%, CRs-derived biofuels demonstrate significant potential, capable of meeting 65% of global food transportation fossil fuel demand. Except for the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Russia, most regions could satisfy over 50% of their fossil fuel demands, highlighting CRs’ substantial potential. The scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization improves satisfaction rates of fossil fuel demand, meeting 72% of the global demand by leveraging UCO’s superior energy conversion efficiency and CRs’ yield advantages. Under the scenario of maximum biofuel production potential, most regions could achieve complete coverage of their food transportation fossil fuel demands, demonstrating the theoretical feasibility of food transport energy self-sufficiency within food systems.

Strategizing food transportation emission reductions through wastes-derived biofuels

Across the 130 studied countries, gradient emission reductions of 289, 1203, 1361, and 17490 thousand tonnes of CO2 are achievable under four scenarios, respectively. Road transportation fuel substitution contributes the majority of emission reductions across countries, particularly in those dominated by inland transportation such as the United States, China, and Russia. European and Asia-Pacific regions show greater advantages in marine and aviation transportation emission reductions. Railway emissions reduction potential through biofuel substitution is relatively lower due to increasing electrification. From the perspective of emission reduction from unit biofuel, consistent with existing technologies-focused research23,24,53,54,55, CRs-derived biofuels demonstrate superior performance in marine and aviation applications, while UCO-derived biofuels show advantages in road, railway & inland waterway applications. Ideally, countries should prioritize deploying CRs-derived biofuels in marine and aviation transportation while reserving limited UCO resources for road transportation.

However, considering practical availability, UCO collection systems are more developed and cost-effective than those for CRs. Technically, UCO-derived biofuels production processes like HEFA offer lower cost and higher energy conversion efficiency compared with CRs conversion technologies such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and pyrolysis. This study assumes domestic production and use of wastes-derived biofuels without considering their import and export. However, policy-wise initiatives like the RED II (Renewable Energy Recast)‘s double-counting mechanism for UCO-derived biodiesel in EU, China’s 13% VAT (value added tax) refund on UCO exports, and the United States Biodiesel Tax Credit may foster more stable international supply chains for UCO-derived biofuels in the future. For CRs, due to higher transportation costs, tend toward localized subsidization (e.g. under Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations, biofuel produced from CRs is eligible to receive a low-carbon credit of CAD 0.35 per liter56). Export restrictions in Southeast Asian countries and the EU’s CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) requirements further limit cross-border CRs-derived fuels circulation, leading to predominantly regional usage.

Overall, for resource-limited countries, improving market mechanisms, implementing favorable biofuel import policies, and establishing reliable supply chains is recommended. Countries with abundant resources and mature collection technologies should enhance waste collection and biofuel production capabilities, particularly in China and the United States, where UCO collection and conversion technologies are advanced. These countries should focus on reducing CRs-derived biofuel production costs and enhancing their competitiveness to reduce market dependence on UCO-derived biofuels. Developing countries rich in resources but technically less advanced, such as Southeast Asian and South American countries, should prioritize improving waste collection systems and exporting feedstock to countries with mature biofuel production capabilities, leveraging their own resource advantages. Countries lacking both resources and technologies should promote international cooperation, introduce small-scale biofuel production facilities, and initially focus on local short-distance food transportation to improve local energy self-sufficiency.

From the global food system perspective, the evolution of global carbon trading market mechanisms has facilitated viable pathways for channeling transportation-related emission reduction benefits back into food systems, thereby enhancing the operational feasibility of circular economy approaches. Policymakers should refine and calibrate carbon trading mechanisms pertaining to food system wastes to achieve seamless integration of biofuel emission reduction benefits into food system cycles. Key initiatives include cross-sector offset mechanisms, allocating carbon credits to feedstock providers, and implementing carbon taxes on high-emission food transportation. These measures optimize resource allocation, prevent emission reduction benefits’ concentration, and strengthen global food system resilience. The strategic utilization of carbon markets to achieve internal recycling loop within food system aims to elevate biofuels beyond mere transportation decarbonization tools to become pivotal leverage points in strengthening global food system sustainability, to advance food systems toward an integrated paradigm of sustainable development that harmonizes climate action, food security, and equity.

Limitations and future research perspectives

This study has the following limitations and uncertainties. First, the availability of food system wastes is calculated theoretically by using residual coefficient and collection coefficient according to the type of wastes, without accounting for impacts of national variations in dietary habits and technological capabilities. Second, the allocation of food system wastes for biofuel production in food transportation relies on assumed scenarios, which is a discussion on the possibility of internal loop in food system rather than reflecting real-world application conditions. Third, when modeling fossil fuel substitution by biofuels, in order to reflect the impact of the uniform penetration of biofuels under the existing transportation structure, this study assumes that UCO and CRs prepare biofuels for each transportation mode according to the existing food transportation fuel demand shares. In practical applications, better emission reduction effects may be achieved through the optimization of fuel alternatives (such as priority in the aviation field).

In addition, several problems warrant investigation in future research endeavors. This study has primarily focused on two major pathways for biofuel production from food system wastes. However, additional waste streams within the food system, including kitchen waste and livestock manure, possess potential for conversion into biofuels through various processing technologies serving as additional substitutes for fossil fuels. The expansion of feedstock diversity in biofuel production from food system waste streams could potentially yield enhanced emission reduction outcomes in food transportation applications. Furthermore, a more precise confirmation of the actual utilization of diverse food system wastes will enhance the accuracy of energy supply and emission reduction calculations.

Methodological framework

To quantify the energy and emission reduction benefits of using food system wastes-derived biofuels within food transportation, this study establishes an internal loop within the food system, identifying the primary feedstocks for biofuel production as UCO and CRs generated from agricultural production, food processing and transformation, and food consumption. CRs’ availability is calculated based on crop production data from the FAO database, combined with yield coefficients and collection coefficients of CRs from existing studies (Table S3). UCO’s availability is estimated using edible vegetable oil consumption data derived from the FAO database and region-specific statistics on UCO collection (Table S4).

After determining the maximum availability of CRs and UCO, their total energy potentials are calculated using crop-specific energy conversion coefficients for CRs from existing literature and the lower heating value for UCO from the GREET database (Table S3, Table S4). Then the GREET model is employed to account for the maximum amount of biofuel that can be produced by CRs and UCO (Table S5). Four scenarios are then constructed (see details in the following “Assumptions and scenario settings”), representing different waste utilization levels, to compare the biofuel production potentials with food transportation fossil fuel demands across countries.

For emission reduction analysis, a life cycle approach is adopted using the GREET model to evaluate the WTW emissions of biofuels and the fossil fuels they replace across different transport modes. Based on the fuel demand share for each transportation mode in different countries, the available biofuels under each scenario are proportionally allocated to each transportation mode. This allowed for an assessment of the emission reduction potential achievable by each country under varying food transportation structures.

Fossil fuel demand of food transportation

This study categorizes transportation into four distinct modes: road transportation, railway & inland waterway transportation, marine transportation, and aviation transportation, incorporating the demand for conventional fossil fuels including oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel demand of food transportation in each country can be expressed as:

$$\begin{array}{c}E{D}_{i}=({\sum }_{j}E{D}_{O,i}\times {T}_{j,i}+E{D}_{N,i})\times {F}_{i}\end{array}$$

(1)

Equation (1) represents the total food transportation fuel demand in each country by adding up the demand for various types of fuels under different transportation modes, which is used for comparative analysis with the biofuel production potential. EDi represents the fossil fuel demand (PJ) of food transportation in country i. EDO,i and EDN,i denote the demand for oil fuel and natural gas fuel, respectively. The study assumes that all natural gas fuel demand originates from road transportation57,58, with the proportion for oil fuel demand estimated according to regional consumption patterns of various fuel types globally48. Tj,i represents the proportion of oil fuel demand in transportation mode j (road, railway & inland waterway, marine, aviation). Fi denotes the proportion of food transportation relative to total transportation (Table S1), calculated based on the ratio of the transportation sector’s output allocated to the global food sector to the gross output of the transportation sector in each country, derived from the EORA26 MRIO table59,60.

Energy potential of food system waste

In this study, the CRs from 34 kinds of crop species and the UCO from 13 kinds of edible oils are considered (Table S2). The energy potentials of CRs and UCO in various countries are calculated according to crop production and consumption of edible oil, combined with waste collection coefficients and energy conversion coefficients (Table S3, Table S4).

Equation (2) calculates the total amount of CRs that can be collected in various countries based on yield coefficients and collection coefficients of CRs. On this basis, Eq. (3) calculates the energy potential of CRs by adding the energy conversion coefficients of various CRs types, which is used to calculate the production potentials of CRs-derived biofuels in various scenarios. \({C}_{{CRs},i}\) and \({{ENE}}_{{CRs},i}\) respectively represent the collectable amount (t) and theoretical energy potential (PJ) of CRs. \({Y}_{i,c}\) is the yield (t) of crop species c. \({S}_{F,c}\) and \({S}_{P,c}\) are the yield coefficients of field residues and processing residues per unit dry weight of crops, respectively (t t-1). \({\lambda }_{c}\) represents the collection coefficient61,62. \({p}_{{CRs},c}\) represents the energy conversion coefficient per unit dry weight of CRs (PJ t-1)29.

Equation (5) calculates the energy potential of UCO, which is used to calculate the production potentials of UCO-derived biofuels in various scenarios. \({C}_{{UCO},i}\) and \({{ENE}}_{{UCO},i}\) respectively represent the collectable amount (t) and theoretical energy potential (PJ) of UCO. \({P}_{i,u}\), \({{IO}}_{i,u}\), and \({{EO}}_{i,u}\) are the production, import, and export amounts (t) of edible oil type u. \({\lambda }_{i}\) represents the collection coefficient of UCO, estimated based on the consumption and collection data of UCO in each country63. \({p}_{{UCO}}\) is the lower heating value of UCO (PJ t-1).

Life cycle analysis of biofuels and fossil fuels

This study compares life cycle emissions between conventional fossil fuels and representative biofuels across multiple transportation modes through defined substitution pathways: (1) Second-generation renewable biodiesel (RD II) displaces low-sulfur diesel in road transportation and conventional diesel in railway & inland waterway64,65; (2) the second-generation marine renewable biodiesel (RD II marine) substitutes heavy fuel oil in marine transport55,66; (3) the biomass Fischer-Tropsch aviation fuel (FT-AF) and HEFA sustainable aviation fuel (HEFA-SAF) replace conventional aviation fuel54,67; (4) the biomass liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) supplants fossil-based liquefied natural gas (LNG) in road transport68. Figure 8 illustrates the WTW system boundaries encompassing biofuel production, distribution, and end-use combustion. The analysis evaluates emissions across all stages, including feedstock collection, conversion processes, transportation logistics, and final energy utilization.

This study evaluates biofuel production pathways through distinct biofuel conversion technologies. Fast pyrolysis converts CRs into RD II, while esterification-hydrogenation processes UCO into RD-II. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) methods produce FT-AF and HEFA-SAF from CRs and UCO, respectively. Anaerobic digestion processes both feedstocks into bio-LNG69,70,71,72. The analysis employs Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model to quantify fuel production efficiencies and emission intensities across full lifecycle boundaries: well-to-wheel (WTW) for road/rail fuels, well-to-haul (WTH) for marine fuels, and well-to-wake (WTWa) for aviation fuels. The model calculation results of biofuel conversion efficiencies and emissions from biofuels/fossil fuels as shown in Table S5, Fig. S1. As only two energy sources (oil fuel and natural gas fuel) suitable to be substituted by biofuels are included in the emission analysis, the estimated overall emissions from food transportation in this study may be conservative. Detailed emission accounting methodologies and system boundaries of biofuels and fossil fuels are provided in Supplementary Information (Supplementary Methods Section 5).

Assumptions and scenario settings

To analyze the energy and emission reduction contributions of reusing food system wastes in food transportation under varying utilization levels, this study defines four scenarios of food system waste utilization: Scenario of sole UCO utilization, Scenario of sole CRs utilization, Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization, and Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential. The assumptions for each scenario are as follows:

Scenario of sole UCO utilization: Given that biofuel production from UCO has been already widely applied and UCO has a large presence in international markets, with biofuel production being its primary end use, this scenario assumes that all available UCO is converted into biofuels and reused within food transportation. The purpose is to assess the sole contribution of UCO reuse to food system.

Scenario of sole CRs utilization: While biofuel production from CRs is less common compared to UCO due to higher feedstock transport costs and broader competition from other uses, CRs generally have a higher yield potential. In this scenario, based on the IEA statistics on the proportion of global bioenergy used in the transport sector73,74, it is assumed that only 7% of CRs are utilized for biofuel production and reused in food transportation. This reflects the potential contribution of CRs to the food system under competing use constraints.

Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization: Considering that UCO-derived biofuels are more mature and typically have fewer competing applications, this scenario assumes that UCO-derived biofuels are used first to substitute fossil fuels. Any remaining fuel demand is supplemented by CRs-derived biofuels. To reflect the competition for CRs in other applications, their availability remains capped at 7%.

Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential: This scenario adopts the same utilization pathways as the co-utilization scenario but removes the 7% cap on CRs utilization. It represents the ideal case where food system wastes are fully leveraged to realize their maximum potential for fuel substitution and emission reduction in food transportation.

In addition to these scenario settings, this study assumes that, under each scenario, the biofuels derived from UCO and CRs are allocated to each transportation mode in proportion to the country-specific fossil fuel demand shares across transportation modes. This approach reflects the benefits of biofuel penetration into all food transportation modes while maintaining the current national food transportation structures.

Calculations of emission reductions

Calculations of biofuel production and emission reductions for each scenario proceed as follows:

(1)

Scenario of sole UCO utilization

Under the scenario of sole UCO utilization, it is assumed that all UCO in various countries is used for biofuel production. The total production of UCO-derived biofuels under sole UCO utilization (\({{ENE}}_{1,i}\)) (PJ) is calculated as:

$$\begin{array}{c}EN{E}_{1,i}=min \left(EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{{\prime}},E{D}_{i}\right)\end{array}$$

(6)

$$\begin{array}{c}EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{\prime}=EN{E}_{UCO,i}\times {\rho }_{UCO,i}\end{array}$$

(7)

$$\begin{array}{c}{\rho }_{UCO,i}=\left[{\sum }_{j}\left({T}_{j,i}\times {\rho }_{UCO,O,j}\right)\times E{D}_{O,i}+{\rho }_{UCO,N}\times E{D}_{N,i}\right]/E{D}_{i}\end{array}$$

(8)

Equation (8) calculates the conversion efficiency of UCO to biofuels by countries, which is used to convert the energy potential of UCO into biofuel production potential. Equations (6) and (7) respectively represent the maximum production potential and the utilization of UCO-derived biofuels under this scenario. The emission reduction contributed by UCO-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{1,i}\)) as substitutes for fossil fuels in food transportation is calculated as:

$$E{R}_{1,i}={\sum }_{f,j}\left[{T}_{f,j,i}\times \left({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{UCO,f,j}\right)\right]\times EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(9)

Equation (9) allocates the biofuel production potential s under this scenario according to the food transportation fuel demand shares, and calculates the emission reductions in various countries under this scenario by combining the difference between fossil fuel and biofuel emissions per unit under each transportation mode. \({{ENE}}_{{UCO},i}^{{\prime} }\) is the maximum biofuel production for UCO (PJ). \({\rho }_{{UCO},i}\) is the average conversion efficiency of UCO-derived biofuels. \({\rho }_{{UCO},O,j}\) and \({\rho }_{{UCO},N}\) are the UCO-derived biofuel conversion efficiencies for oil fuel and natural gas fuel, respectively. \({E}_{{con},f,j}\) is the life cycle emission (kg PJ-1) for conventional fuels of type f (oil fuel or natural gas fuel). \({E}_{{UCO},f,j}\) is the life cycle emission (kg PJ-1) for UCO-derived biofuels of type f under unit energy consumption.

(2)

Scenario of sole CRs utilization

To approximate realistic CRs availability for biofuel production, under this scenario, this study refers to the statistics of world’s bioenergy available for transportation fuel supply obtained from IEA73 and IRENA74, assuming available CRs for biofuel production not to exceed 7% of CRs’ total energy potential.

The total production of CRs-derived biofuels under sole CRs utilization (\({{ENE}}_{2,i}\)) (PJ) is calculated as:

$$EN{E}_{2,i}=min \left(\gamma \times EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime},E{D}_{i}\right)$$

(10)

$$EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime}=EN{E}_{CRs,i}\times {\rho }_{CRs,i}$$

(11)

$${\rho }_{CRs,i}=\left[{\sum }_{j}\left({T}_{j,i}\times {\rho }_{CRs,O,j}\right)\times E{D}_{O,i}+{\rho }_{CRs,N}\times E{D}_{N,i}\right]/E{D}_{i}$$

(12)

Equation (12) calculates the conversion efficiency of CRs to biofuels by countries, which is used to convert the energy potential of CRs into biofuel production potential. Equations (10) and (11) respectively represent the maximum production potential and the utilization of CRs-derived biofuels under this scenario. The emission reduction contributed by CRs-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{2,i}\)) as substitutions for fossil fuels in food transportation is calculated as:

$$E{R}_{2,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j,i}\times ({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{CRs,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{2,i}$$

(13)

Equation (13) conforms to the principle of Eq. (9). \({{ENE}}_{{CRs},i}^{{\prime} }\) is the maximum biofuel production for CRs (PJ). \(\gamma\) is the proportion of CRs that can be used to produce biofuels in the total (assumed as 7%). \({\rho }_{{CRs},i}\) is the average conversion efficiency of CRs-derived biofuel. \({\rho }_{{CRs},O,j}\) and \({\rho }_{{CRs},N}\) are the CRs-derived biofuel conversion efficiencies for oil fuel and natural gas fuel, respectively. \({E}_{{CRs},f,j}\) is the life cycle emission for CRs-derived biofuels of type f under unit energy consumption.

(3)

Scenario of UCO and CRs co-utilization.

The total production of food system wastes-derived biofuels under UCO and CRs co-utilization (\({{ENE}}_{3,i}\)) is calculated as:

$$EN{E}_{3,i}=min\,(EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{\prime}+\gamma \times EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime},E{D}_{i})$$

(14)

$$EN{E}_{3,CRs,i}=EN{E}_{3,i}-EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(15)

Equations (14) and (15) respectively represent the total utilization of biofuels and the utilization of CRs-derived biofuels in this scenario. The emission reduction contributed jointly by UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{3,i}\)) is calculated by Eqs. (16)–(18):

$$E{R}_{3,i}=E{R}_{3,UCO,i}+E{R}_{3,CRS,i}$$

(16)

$$E{R}_{3,UCO,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j,i}\times ({E}_{con,fj}-{E}_{UCO,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(17)

$$E{R}_{3,CRS,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j,i}\times ({E}_{con,fj}-{E}_{CRs,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{3,CRs,i}$$

(18)

where, \({{ENE}}_{3,{CRs},i}\) is the production (PJ) of CRs-derived biofuels under this scenario. \({{ER}}_{3,{UCO},i}\) and \({{ER}}_{3,{CRS},i}\) are the emission reductions (t CO2) for UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels, respectively.

(4)

Scenario of maximum biofuel production potential

The total production of food system wastes-derived biofuels under UCO and CRs co-utilization without considering CRs’ competing uses (\({{ENE}}_{4,i}\)) is calculated as:

$$EN{E}_{4,i}=min(EN{E}_{UCO,i}^{\prime}+EN{E}_{CRs,i}^{\prime},E{D}_{i})$$

(19)

$$EN{E}_{4,CRs,i}=EN{E}_{4,i}-EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(20)

Equations (19) and (20) respectively represent the total utilization of biofuels and the utilization of CRs-derived biofuels in this scenario. The emission reduction contributed jointly by UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels (\({{ER}}_{4,i}\)) is calculated by Eqs. (21)-(23):

$$E{R}_{4,i}=E{R}_{4,UCO,i}+E{R}_{4,CRS,i}$$

(21)

$$E{R}_{4,UCO,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j}\times ({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{UCO,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{1,i}$$

(22)

$$E{R}_{4,CRS,i}={\sum }_{f,j}[{T}_{f,j}\times ({E}_{con,f,j}-{E}_{CRs,f,j})]\times EN{E}_{4,CRs,i}$$

(23)

where, \({{ENE}}_{4,{CRs},i}\) is the production (PJ) of CRs-derived biofuels under this scenario. \({{ER}}_{4,{UCO},i}\) and \({{ER}}_{4,{CRS},i}\) are the emission reductions (t CO2) of UCO- and CRs-derived biofuels, respectively.

“This platinum demand growth will be incremental overall, mitigating the expected decrease in petroleum platinum demand as global markets continue to make their energy transition from 2030 to 2050,” the council explains.
In the FT SAF production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas).
This makes it a strong candidate for commercial-scale SAF production, although supportive policies and regulatory frameworks are needed to accelerate its deployment.
However, cobalt catalysts are preferred in PtL FT and these use platinum as a promoter.","Platinum is required across all major sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production pathways, including power-to liquid (PtL), which uses the Fischer Tropsch process (FT), as well as the FT process itself, and while current platinum demand from SAF is modest, it is expected to grow significantly in the long term, industry body the World Platinum Investment Council points out.

The council expects yearly SAF capacity additions to increase eight-fold from about two-million tonnes in 2024 to about 16-million tonnes by 2050, while platinum demand from SAF production is expected to increase from negligible volumes to about 260 00 oz/y by 2050.

“This platinum demand growth will be incremental overall, mitigating the expected decrease in petroleum platinum demand as global markets continue to make their energy transition from 2030 to 2050,” the council explains.

The International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF could contribute about 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

Unlike petroleum-based kerosene, SAF is produced from sustainable, non-petroleum feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, or via synthetic e-fuels combining renewable electricity with captured CO₂, the council explains.

Originally developed by German chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch, this year marks 100 years since the FT process was developed.

Their research demonstrated that a mixture of the gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen could be transformed over suitable catalysts into liquid and solid hydrocarbons. Today, FT is used in myriad industrial applications, the council outlines.

PtL is a synthetic jet fuel produced using renewable electricity, with water and CO₂ serving as the primary inputs.

To create a climate-neutral carbon feedstock, green hydrogen and captured CO₂ (from the atmosphere or industrial sources) are used.

These components are then combined through FT synthesis to form liquid hydrocarbons, which are subsequently refined into a kerosene-equivalent fuel, the council adds.

In the FT SAF production pathway, solid materials such as biomass are first converted into synthetic gas (syngas). This syngas is then processed through FT synthesis into liquid wax. FT has significant scalability potential for SAF production as it can use a range of feedstocks, including waste materials that would otherwise be discarded.

This makes it a strong candidate for commercial-scale SAF production, although supportive policies and regulatory frameworks are needed to accelerate its deployment.

PLATINUM’S ROLE

The council highlights that platinum plays an important supporting role in certain types of FT synthesis. Iron catalysts dominate biomass FT and do not use platinum.

However, cobalt catalysts are preferred in PtL FT and these use platinum as a promoter. Even at very low concentrations, platinum improves cobalt catalyst reduction, stability and dispersion, resulting in higher efficiency and longer lifetimes, the council posits.

It adds that platinum has a significant role in isomerisation, which is needed in both the FT and the PtL FT SAF production pathways, where it functions as a catalyst to transform straight-chain hydrocarbons into branched isomers with better cold-flow properties.

“Without this step, SAF would fail to meet the strict freezing point requirements necessary for safe, high-altitude flight,” the council avers.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001240307_resized_rollsroyceflyingtestbedsafflightaviation11231022.jpg,N,,2025-11-21 08:56:44.301152

The output will be sustainable aviation fuel that can cut life cycle emissions by as much as eighty per cent compared with traditional kerosene. The project will serve airlines across the region and propel the emirate to the forefront of next generation aviation.

How the technology converts trash into thrust

The planned facility unites two mature technologies in one production line. First, waste gasification transforms sorted refuse into a synthesis gas rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Second, renewable powered electrolysers create additional green hydrogen from water. By blending both streams the plant achieves an optimal chemical balance that is then upgraded into sustainable jet fuel using established Fischer Tropsch chemistry. Because all electricity for electrolysis comes from solar and other clean sources, the end product retains a very low carbon intensity.

Insight: why waste matters more than feedstock price

An often overlooked benefit of waste based fuel is feedstock stability. Unlike crop oils, municipal waste volumes remain steady regardless of commodity cycles, giving producers predictable supply and shielding airlines from volatility. That stability can drive longer fuel offtake contracts and lower financing costs for future facilities.

Conclusion

The waste to fuel initiative demonstrates how circular economy thinking can unlock climate progress while supporting a sector that already contributes significantly to the national economy. By treating refuse as a valuable resource Abu Dhabi is setting a regional benchmark for integrated waste management, clean hydrogen and low carbon mobility. Investors around the world are watching closely for partnership opportunities here.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-4.svg,N,,2025-11-21 07:56:19.133159

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is quickly becoming a key factor in reducing the environmental impact of flying. With the introduction of advanced electrolytic SAF (eSAF), travelers now need to understand how these fuels affect flight options, ticket prices, and overall travel planning.

SAF offers a greener alternative to traditional jet fuel, but its higher cost and limited availability can influence airline operations. For those planning trips in 2025 and beyond, understanding SAF is essential for making informed travel choices.

What Travelers Need to Know About eSAF

eSAF, a synthetic form of SAF, is produced using renewable energy and captured carbon. It significantly reduces carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. According to recent industry analyses, eSAF currently costs more than 13 times traditional jet fuel and about 3.5 times more than conventional bio-SAF options.

For travelers, this means that eco-friendly flights may carry slightly higher ticket prices, especially on routes where SAF mandates are being actively enforced. Airlines incorporating eSAF are investing in sustainability, but the cost gap between conventional fuel and SAF is still significant.

SAF Mandates in Europe and the UK

Travelers flying to or within Europe should be aware of upcoming SAF requirements:

European Union: SAF blending in aviation fuel starts at 2% in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. By 2050, the target is 70%. eSAF, a more advanced synthetic option, will be required starting in 2030 and gradually increase to 35% by 2050.

United Kingdom: SAF usage starts at 2% in 2025, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The UK also has a sub-target for synthetic SAF reaching 3.5% by 2040.

These mandates aim to make flights greener while supporting the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon goals. For travelers, this highlights the growing availability of more sustainable flights across Europe.

Airlines and the Current SAF Challenge

While SAF adoption is increasing, supply remains limited. Many airlines are concerned about meeting these mandates due to the high cost and restricted availability of eSAF. Some airline executives have noted that targets, such as a 10% SAF blend in the UK by 2030, may be ambitious without additional government support.

For travelers, this means that eco-conscious flight options may currently be limited, especially on shorter or less busy routes. However, popular international airports in Europe are more likely to have flights blending SAF, offering travelers a chance to reduce their environmental impact.

Tips for Travelers Seeking Green Flights

Travelers who want to fly sustainably can take several practical steps:

Check airline sustainability reports: Many airlines disclose the percentage of SAF used on their flights. Choosing these airlines helps support greener aviation.

Book flights early: As SAF adoption increases, flights with higher SAF blends may become premium or limited offerings.

Prioritize major airports: Large hubs like Amsterdam, London, and Frankfurt are leading SAF adoption, offering more eco-friendly flight options.

Understand pricing: Be aware that eco-friendly flights may cost more initially due to the high price of eSAF, though governments may provide incentives in some regions.

These small steps allow travelers to actively contribute to reducing aviation emissions while planning responsible trips.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Green Air Travel

While eSAF remains expensive, it is currently the most practical solution for reducing flight emissions without overhauling existing aircraft. Other technologies, like hydrogen or electric planes, are still years away from commercial viability.

For global travelers, this means that SAF will play an increasingly important role in making flights more environmentally friendly. Early adoption of SAF-friendly airlines allows travelers to minimize their carbon footprint and encourages airlines to continue investing in green aviation solutions.

Conclusion: Travel Smarter, Fly Greener

Sustainable aviation fuels are shaping the future of air travel. Understanding SAF, eSAF costs, and airline adoption helps travelers make informed choices. While ticket prices may reflect current fuel costs, flying with SAF ensures a smaller environmental impact.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) prices are rising sharply, particularly electrolytic SAF (eSAF), which now costs significantly more than conventional jet fuel. Understanding these trends can help travelers make eco-conscious decisions while planning trips.

Why SAF Is Becoming Important

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a key solution for reducing aviation emissions without altering aircraft or airport systems. Unlike electric or hydrogen planes, which are still in early stages, SAF can be used immediately on existing flights.

Europe and the UK are implementing SAF mandates, requiring airlines to blend increasing amounts of sustainable fuel into their flights. By 2025, Europe expects a 2% SAF share in aviation fuel, rising to 6% by 2030 and 20% by 2035. The UK has similar targets, starting with a 2% blend in 2025 and reaching 10% by 2030.

For travelers, this shift means more flights will include SAF, sometimes at slightly higher ticket prices. But these changes are crucial for supporting sustainable air travel.

Current SAF Prices and Travel Impact

Reports indicate that eSAF costs nearly 13 times more than traditional jet fuel in key European hubs like Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp. Even compared to bio-SAF, eSAF is more than three times as expensive.

For travelers, higher SAF costs can translate into modestly higher flight fares. Yet, choosing airlines that prioritize SAF use supports cleaner air travel. It also aligns with a growing trend of responsible tourism, where travelers consider environmental impact when selecting flights.

Airlines’ Approach to SAF

Not all airlines are equally prepared for the SAF transition. Some carriers express concerns about supply shortages and meeting mandated targets. However, international aviation bodies highlight government support as a key factor in stabilizing SAF supply and costs.

Travelers can take advantage of this by researching airlines’ sustainability initiatives. Many carriers now disclose SAF usage percentages, helping passengers make eco-conscious choices.

Tips for Eco-Friendly Travel

Check Airline SAF Policies: Select carriers that actively use SAF to reduce carbon footprints.

Book in Advance: Early bookings can offset rising ticket prices linked to higher fuel costs.

Fly Through Key Hubs: Major European airports, such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp, are leading SAF adoption.

Plan for Sustainability: Consider flights that blend SAF use with other eco-friendly travel practices.

These small choices allow travelers to enjoy their trips responsibly while supporting sustainable aviation efforts.

Travel Planning Amid Fuel Price Changes

As SAF production increases, travelers may see gradual stabilization in ticket pricing. Experts predict a temporary oversupply until around 2030, followed by stricter mandates. This could influence fares and airline compliance penalties.

Being aware of these trends helps travelers anticipate costs and make smarter decisions. For example, flights with a higher SAF blend may be slightly more expensive but are environmentally responsible. Travelers who prioritize sustainability contribute to the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Future of Sustainable Air Travel

SAF is reshaping the way we think about flying. While costs remain higher than conventional fuel, the benefits to the environment are significant. Travelers can play a role by choosing airlines that commit to SAF and planning trips with sustainability in mind.

The rise of SAF also signals a shift in global travel culture. Eco-conscious travelers are increasingly considering their carbon footprint, and airlines are responding by integrating greener practices. From long-haul flights to regional connections, SAF adoption is becoming a defining feature of modern travel.

Conclusion: Flying Responsibly

For global travelers, understanding the implications of SAF prices is essential. By choosing airlines that prioritize sustainable fuel, planning travel strategically, and supporting eco-friendly practices, passengers can enjoy flights that are both enjoyable and responsible.

This RCM will act as a financial support system to help encourage domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The Bill works alongside the existing SAF Mandate, which already requires fuel suppliers to include increasing amounts of SAF into the UK aviation fuel mix. While the Mandate creates demand, the Bill addresses the supply side by making it financially viable for companies to invest in building SAF production plants in the UK.

Probably by the end of 2026.

The Bill has completed its committee stage in the Commons and was welcomed by Members across the House as a necessary step towards decarbonising aviation.

It had a second reading yesterday (20 November), with the government intending for all required legislation to be in place by the end of 2026.

In the meantime, the supporting SAF Mandate, or, to give it its official name, the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) Order 2024, came into force at the beginning of 2025.

The Mandate requires fuel suppliers to ensure that 2% of UK jet fuel comes from sustainable sources, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. Unless this is going to be imported, domestic production needs to be encouraged, hence the SAF Bill.

The UK is far from alone in mandating sustainable aviation fuel, though approaches vary significantly worldwide.

The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF share beginning at 2% in 2025, increasing incrementally to 70% by 2050. This is considerably more ambitious than the UK’s 22% target by 2040.

However, the EU scheme does not permit a buy-out mechanism – airlines face penalties but must still make up for non-compliance in the following year. The practical impact is already being felt. Airlines operating in Europe face an additional US$1.3 billion (approx. £995 million) during 2025 in compliance fees, with charges often being twice the prevailing market price premium of SAF.

Singapore is implementing a direct passenger levy from October 2026. Charges ranging from S$1 (approximately £0.58) for economy passengers flying within Southeast Asia to S$41.60 (around £32) for business and first class passengers heading to the Americas. Singapore aims for SAF to make up 1% of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3-5% by 2030.

Notably, transit passengers through Singapore are exempt from the levy – a pragmatic decision to maintain the city-state’s position as a major hub, though one that’s drawn criticism for appearing to make residents subsidise international travellers.

The US approach focuses on tax credits rather than mandates, with the section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit providing up to US$1.75 (£1.34) per gallon for SAF that meets emissions reduction thresholds.

The Biden Administration had targeted 3 billion gallons of SAF production by 2030, though Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ reduced tax credits and will significantly impact the feasibility of that target.

The UK’s approach sits somewhere between the EU’s stricter mandates and the US’s incentive-based system. By combining a mandate (creating guaranteed demand) with the RCM (supporting supply), we are aiming to build a domestic SAF industry while capping consumer costs – though whether this balancing act succeeds remains to be seen.

Yes, in theory. Industry body IATA estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. This makes SAF the single most important tool for aviation decarbonisation in the near to medium term.

However, context is crucial. The UK’s 22% SAF target by 2040 means that 78% of fuel will still be conventional kerosene. Even with SAF delivering 70-85% lifecycle emissions reductions, this translates to roughly a 15-19% reduction in overall UK aviation emissions by 2040.

There are, however, serious questions about SAF’s sustainability credentials, depending on how it’s made. To find out more about that, check out our SAF explainer.

The success of the scheme ultimately depends on whether it successfully catalyses a domestic SAF industry capable of meeting the mandated volumes. If suppliers consistently opt to pay buy-out fees rather than source SAF, then it won’t work.

The government’s £400 million investment through the Advanced Fuels Fund is welcome, but whether this proves sufficient to overcome the current cost and supply barriers remains uncertain.

From a business traveller’s perspective, the SAF Bill represents an attempt to make flying marginally greener without drastically increasing costs, though it’s noticeable that Air Passenger Duty (APD), which is far higher and will rise again in April 2026 goes directly to the Treasury, and hasn’t been used for environmental causes.

Whether the new UK SAF Levy succeeds in balancing these competing priorities – and whether its ambitions prove sufficient to meaningfully address aviation’s climate impact – will only become clear over the coming decade.

As we have heard today, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill aims to encourage investment in sustainable aviation fuel in the UK by creating a mechanism to guarantee a certain level of revenue.
We will, as we go through this Bill, have regard to its overall effect on the provision of sustainable aviation fuel.","The Minister of State, Department for Transport (Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill) (Lab) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I am pleased to present the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill for Second Reading today. I welcome the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester and congratulate him on his forthcoming maiden speech in your Lordships’ House today. I look forward to hearing his contribution to this important debate, and to his many contributions in the months and years ahead.

If we are to be an outward, confident trading nation that is connected to the world and leading the way on innovation, we must move as fast as we can towards a greener, cleaner future for flying. Domestic transport accounted for 29% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Aviation is currently the second largest contributor, and it faces unique barriers to decarbonisation. By 2040 it is set to overtake road vehicle use as transport’s largest emitter. SAF will be key to decarbonisation, a drop-in solution that can be used today in today’s aircraft with today’s infrastructure. SAF also has huge economic benefits for the wider low-carbon fuels industry, potentially supporting up to 15,000 jobs and contributing up to £5 billion to the economy by 2050.

SAF is not the only measure that we are supporting to address emissions in the aviation sector. The Government are supporting the development of more efficient and zero-emission aircraft technologies, and we have announced a further £1 billion of funding for the Aerospace Technology Institute to help to spur green aerospace innovation. The Civil Aviation Authority, supported by my department’s funding, is shaping regulations for zero-emission aircraft through its hydrogen challenge. Alongside that, we are advancing airspace modernisation to enable cleaner, quicker and quieter journeys. The Government are also establishing a UK airspace design service with the Civil Aviation Authority and the National Air Traffic Service, which are working together to launch this by the end of the year.

Turning to aviation fuel, the Government, alongside industry, are working collaboratively to ramp up the UK’s SAF industry. The UK stands at the forefront of global efforts to decarbonise aviation. When this Government came into power, we acted immediately by laying the statutory instrument for the SAF mandate, which came into force on 1 January this year. We have invested £63 million in 17 projects through the Advanced Fuels Fund, which will drive growth, support good jobs and deliver emissions reduction.

The revenue certainty mechanism introduced in the Bill is a scheme designed to support UK SAF production to drive growth and opportunity across the country. It addresses the lack of a clear and predictable market price for SAF, one of the biggest constraints on investment in UK SAF production. The RCM builds on the established precedent of contracts for difference in the renewables sector. Under the RCM, an SAF producer will enter into a private law contract with a government-owned counterparty that sets a guaranteed strike price for SAF. If SAF is sold for under that price, the counterparty will pay the difference to the producer. If SAF is sold above the price, the producer will pay the difference to the counterparty.

It is important to emphasise that no final decisions have been taken on how the strike price will be determined. The RCM contracts must set a strike price that finds a balance between securing the appropriate protection for the producer and its investors and providing value for money for the scheme and the wider sector. This is a new and emerging market. This will be the world’s first SAF RCM, and it will derisk SAF projects by addressing barriers to investment in a nascent market that is using innovative technologies. Like similar schemes in the low-carbon electricity sector, this will help to provide greater certainty of future revenue, help to attract investment in first-of-a-kind SAF plants, and support growth and opportunity across the country.

Turning to the SAF Bill, it has four key areas. First, it will enable the Secretary of State to designate a counterparty that is wholly owned by government. Secondly, the Secretary of State can direct the counterparty to enter into private law contracts with SAF producers, guaranteeing a price for the sale of eligible SAF over a period of time. The mechanism is there to support the development of a first-of-a-kind plant by increasing investor confidence. While first-of-a-kind plants are likely to be more expensive than future plants, supporting them allows future, cheaper plants to get constructed and start producing SAF. The contract allocation process will be designed to maximise competition, with all contracts to be underpinned by robust technical and commercial due diligence to ensure that successful projects represent value for money.

Thirdly, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to make regulations imposing a levy on suppliers of aviation fuel in the UK, in order to fund the RCM. That will allow the counterparty to collect the levy to cover the costs of issuing payments under contracts that are administering the scheme. It is right that the costs of decarbonising air travel should at least be partially borne by the aviation sector rather than the taxpayer. We are levying aviation fuel suppliers because placing the levy higher up the supply chain spreads costs across the sector, and because aviation fuel suppliers will benefit from the greater volumes and lower prices for SAF that the RCM will create. The RCM will provide support only if SAF is actually being produced. If a project fails, there is no obligation on the Government to provide support. While novel technologies can have high failure rates, we can support multiple technology pathways to minimise risk and strengthen the UK’s project pipeline.

Fourthly, the Bill will enable the Secretary of State to enforce certain provisions imposing financial penalties. The Secretary of State may impose a financial penalty on a person who fails to comply with levy regulations, or with requirements under regulations made to ensure that any paid-out surplus is used to benefit fuel suppliers’ customers.

This is a comprehensive and focused Bill that lays the foundations for a thriving UK SAF industry by delivering investment certainty, cutting emissions and securing the long-term sustainability of the aviation industry. More SAF supply and lower prices are good for the aviation sector and, ultimately, for those who wish to fly. The Bill is an essential part of securing our world-class aviation sector’s future, and we want it to do that sustainably. I look forward to engaging with noble Lords on this legislation. I beg to move.

Earl Russell (LD) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, we too look forward to the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, and we welcome him to the House. We are generally supportive of the measures in the Bill but have some concerns about areas of government policy that lie beyond its scope, and a few questions about the details.

To put the Bill in its legitimate context, it will help reduce CO2 emissions from aviation, but it is not a magic bullet. Alone, it is not a sustainable answer to the challenges we face. Aviation is, of course, one of the hardest sectors to abate and it is expected to show continued and rapid upward growth. Aviation is critical to our economy and our way of life. It moves some 240 million international passengers and 2.4 million tonnes of freight each year, adding £14 billion in GVA to UK GDP. The industry also supports 1 million associated jobs and £4.2 billion in associated passenger duty. Aviation accounts for 7% of UK carbon emissions, but this figure is due to rise significantly, to 11% in 2030 and 16% in 2035. Unless decisive action is taken on a broad range of fronts beyond the scope of the Bill, we will not meet our targets. Net zero 2050 is not optional; it is imperative.

We on these Benches do not wish to challenge any UK family’s right to a holiday. When we debate the Bill, we need to be clear that 15% of people in this country take 70% of the flights, and we need to change that. The Climate Change Committee was clear in 2023 when it said that SAF alone is a risky strategy. My party would reform air passenger duty to target the most frequent flyers. We would ensure that we have an escalating passenger duty so that those who fly the most frequently, pay more. We also oppose overexpansion of the airports, particularly in the south-east. This Government have chosen to take a different path, and it is for them to balance this path of increased airport expansion against their climate change commitments and targets. Therefore, we welcome the Bill but note our caveats.

SAF is widely considered as the main available pathway to decarbonise aviation. It can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 70% compared with conventional jet fuel. As we have heard, it is a drop-in fuel that can be used alongside existing aircraft and infrastructure. The SAF mandate passed last year starts at 2% and rises to 10% by 2030, and then to 22% in 2040. From 2040, the obligation will remain at 22% unless there is greater certainty of supply. The SAF mandate could, it is claimed, deliver up to 6.3 megatons of carbon savings each year by 2040.

We on these Benches welcome the revenue certainty mechanism. It will serve to strengthen investor confidence and unlock significant capital investment in the production facilities that need to be based here in the UK. It will allow for long-term stability and contracts through the guaranteed strike price. As the Minister said, this mechanism has been widely used in the renewables sector, and we know that it works. It will provide certainty to these suppliers. The approach is logical. The industry stands to benefit from cheaper staff, and the cost will be spread widely throughout the industry.

We recognise the UK’s approach, the long-term mandate, the proposed revenue support and the degree of certainty it will provide to help with this transition. Indeed, the UK is seen as an example of best practice, with ambitious targets and support mechanisms. Establishing a homegrown low-carbon fuel sector will bring significant jobs and benefits to the UK industry and wider society. Will the Minister update the House on the progress of ongoing negotiations with industry, running parallel with the Bill? Further, when will the Government be able to provide details on how the strike price will be set and what mechanisms will exist for adjustments? When do the Government anticipate that the first contracts will be signed?

While we welcome the Bill, we stress that SAF is only a first step. This is about not merely blending fuels but seeking alternative, more sustainable climate-friendly options for the longer term. That needs continuous investment and innovation in the next generations of technologies, including the battery/electric and hydrogen-fuelled. The Bill sets the policy framework, but crucial details are left to subsequent negotiations.

We have several key questions regarding the Bill’s ambition, scope and technical design. The SAF mandate requires 22% of jet fuel to be sustainable by 2040. This means that 78% of fuels will still be polluting just a decade before our net-zero deadline, so how will the Government achieve this target? In addition, the European Union has a higher target of 70% by 2050. What action will the Government take to bring further alignment not just with our EU partners but internationally?

We also have concerns about SAF feedstocks and the amount of cooking oil that is imported. It is important that we have a reliable domestic supply. We also note concerns about bioethanol and the closure of plants, particularly the Vivergo plant in Hull, and the impact of the US trade deal and subsidies on US ethanol. We are concerned about the potential for future bioethanol plant closures.

What consideration have the Government given to the inclusion of intermediate cover crops, such as catch and cover, as a scalable feedstock outside the HEFA cap to expand the resource base without competing with food markets? We believe that the transition to a sustainable aviation industry must be strategically linked to our existing industrial base. What actions are the Government taking to see that existing industrial plants are brought back into use, make sure that the planning system is fit for purpose and ensure that these plants can be brought online quickly?

While the Government are committed to undertaking a comprehensive assessment of these industrial sites to see that they are brought back online, transparency is paramount given the importance of public trust and accountability. The funding levy should also not place undue financial burden on air travellers, so how will the Government review the impacts to ensure that the levy does not include further burdens on those travellers? For the sake of public accountability, are the Government amenable to ensuring that the airlines report publicly on their use of SAF and the amount of it that they supply? We broadly welcome this Bill, but the Bill alone is not a sustainable long-term solution, and we call for greater monetary transparency and openness.

Lord Ravensdale (CB) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I declare my interests as a chief engineer working for AtkinsRéalis and co-chair of Legislators for Nuclear. I look forward to the maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester. I support the Bill, with the caveat that costs to consumers of these measures must always be front and centre, with all the freedoms that cheap air travel has opened up to people from all backgrounds in recent decades. But I accept that there is a strategic need to invest in the long-term sustainability of aviation fuel for the UK and that we need a revenue certainty mechanism alongside the mandate.

I have three broad points. My first is around the definitions in the Bill of fuels that are eligible for the revenue certainty mechanism. Clause 16 defines “sustainable aviation fuel” as,

“aviation fuel that is renewable transport fuel”.

“Renewable transport fuel” is defined in the same clause as,

“anything that is (or is treated as) renewable transport fuel for the purposes of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of the Energy Act 2004”.

It then refers to Sections 131D and 132. I proposed the amendment to what is now the Energy Act 2023 that led to Section 131D, which treats recycled carbon fuels and nuclear-derived fuels as renewable transport fuels. That amendment was therefore a key enabler for this Bill in enabling support for second-generation and types of third-generation SAF.

However, this requires secondary legislation to take effect and treat these fuels as renewable transport fuels. This has not been completely done for the surface transport renewable transport fuel order; it has been done only for recycled carbon fuels. But it has been done for the sustainable aviation renewable transport fuel order, so we have quite a convoluted legislative route here between various Acts and secondary legislation. Can the Minister please confirm that recycled carbon fuels and nuclear-derived fuels are within the scope of the revenue certainty mechanism outlined in the Bill?

Clearly, recycled carbon fuels will be very important in the near term. Over the medium to long term, nuclear could well be a significant source of synthetic fuels due to the potential economic efficiency it brings to hydrogen production, whether that is high-temperature electrolysis, with the current pressurised water reactor plants, or, looking further ahead, the sulphur-iodine cycle in advanced high-temperature nuclear plant.

My second point is around the powers that the Government are taking in the Bill. They have clearly stated that they do not intend to offer contracts for first-generation SAF based on hydrogenated esters and fatty acids—HEFA. Should this therefore be stated in the Bill? The Government should take only the powers they need, given that this Bill is a framework for the long term. There is a case that the powers in the Bill should be limited to second-generation and third-generation sustainable aviation fuels. I do not foresee any good reason why HEFA fuels would need such support, so I believe that this could be clearly stated in the Bill.

My third point is around value for money and competition. We rightly heard a lot of discussion in the other place around costs to consumers and analysis on the £1.50 impacts on airfares. The Minister clearly stated that we need to get the right balance between investors and consumers with the prices that are negotiated, but another way of looking at this relates to the competitive structure within the Bill. Of course, the way the Bill is structured around bilateral negotiations, rather than a competitive process, is what is needed for the SAF market at this stage, noting its immaturity. An auction process, such as that which we have for offshore wind, is not perhaps appropriate at this stage.

However, this Bill needs to be fit for the longer term. Competition is the way to drive down costs for consumers in the long term, as has been demonstrated in more mature markets such as offshore wind. So, in the longer term, we need that mechanism for auctions and competitions within the Bill but, looking through it, I cannot see a mechanism for setting up such a competitive process.

Other government legislation, such as the Energy Act 2013 for CfDs for renewable energy generation, clearly states that regulations made may include provision for,

“the determination of a matter on a competitive basis”.

We also have that in the Energy Act 2023 for low-carbon hydrogen, which clearly states:

“Provision falling within subsection (2) may include provision for … the determination of a matter on a competitive basis”.

This Bill makes no provision for regulations to cover the determination of a matter on a competitive basis, or indeed for allocation frameworks. I would be grateful if the Minister could state whether, in his view, a competitive framework is covered by the Bill as written and, if not, whether it should be. The Bill should be fit for the future to avoid the need for future legislation in this area, and it should be structured to minimise costs to consumers, which in the end will be enabled through competition.

Finally, this Bill will go a long way to realising second-generation and third-generation SAF production in the UK, but the Government need urgently to address broader challenges as well, not least our high industrial electricity prices. I have spoken to a number of companies that want to set up SAF plants and related infrastructure in the UK, but they simply cannot make the numbers stack up when our electricity is four times as expensive as competitors such as the USA. This is a very energy-intensive industry. Alongside the measures in this Bill, we need to address the fundamentals to ensure that we are being fair to consumers and minimising required subsidies. I hope the Government will think about the broader framework as well and not just see this as a problem to be addressed through subsidies.

The Lord Bishop of Chester (Maiden Speech) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their warm welcome, although I confess that sustainable aviation fuel was not a subject that I imagined I would be addressing when various noble Lords have given me advice about maiden speeches. I am grateful for their wisdom, warmth and welcome, and especially that of the doorkeepers and staff of this House. It seems that I should have taken them rather more literally when they said I would be working with high-flyers, and rather less literally when they pointed out that not everything was rocket science.

I speak as one born almost two and a half thousand miles from where we sit. Indeed, the first serious journey of my life was by air, back here to the UK. I am also a father and, like the rest of this noble House, entrusted with passing on entire to the next generation this good earth. Sustainability matters: the good Lord provided us with many things, but a spare planet was not among them, at least in this age. It is this balance of pragmatisms which means that I speak largely in support of the Bill. We need to be real about air travel being vital to modern life. It builds community, enables encounter and crosses divides.

My diocese of Chester serves communities in two nations and 23 local authorities. It spans urban and rural, wealth and extreme poverty. We gaze at the universe from Jodrell Bank. We support half of the Mersey’s industrial life. We rejoice in our schools and in Chester University, and we cherish our world-renowned zoo. Indeed, we also have Warrington, which, according to the i Paper, may be Britain’s hardest-working town—who knew? All are part of the life of the diocese, from the newish migrant to the most established among the Cheshire set, from those who take penalties on the sporting field to those who serve a very different type of penalty. We are linked to the world both by Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is in the diocese of Liverpool just across the River Mersey, and Manchester Airport, where one actually lands in the diocese of Chester but disembarks in the diocese of Manchester.

To repeat myself, the diocese of Chester touches two nations. I serve a border people, just as I did in my former see of Berwick-upon-Tweed. In Chester, we have several parishes which are all or partly in Wales. My Lords—or, as I should say, “fy Arglwyddi”—“Esgob Caer ydw i a ’dw i’n dysgu tipyn bach o Cymraeg”. I apologise for my lamentable Welsh accent. I am learning a little Welsh, partly because I carried on with Duolingo long after lockdown but, much more importantly, because communication is a vital gift for those of us who nurture and curate community. In communication, we need to learn to speak and to listen. This is almost always done in person and directly. Indeed, I argue that one of our primary vocations in this noble House is to be with and to listen, for few disciplines are more vital in the search for wisdom—the search I so often witness in your Lordships’ House. The question for me is not so much how we can be great again, but how we can be kindly present. Greatness is great, but grace is greater.

Air travel does more than build community; it enables partnership and commerce. It is a vital part of the defence of our nation, as I witnessed when offering chaplaincy to our Armed Forces. It is the backbone of much international aid provision, and it enables care for people and the planet. Chester Zoo, for example, serves ecosystems around this world. The relative ease of transport is one factor in this. My experience working in the university sector showed just how much journeys matter in the service of education.

Air travel is vital and is here to stay, but its environmental impact must be addressed. This means that net zero matters, but it is not the only sustainability consideration. Mike Berners-Lee points out, when ostensibly discussing the environmental impact of bananas, that the problem is not only emissions but where they are released. Sustainable fuel is far from carbon neutral. Although it shortens the life cycle of released carbon in the sense that it releases carbon which has only recently been captured, it also moves that carbon into the upper parts of the atmosphere, where it is most harmful.

I welcome the Bill’s creation of an economic framework in which SAF becomes a viable investment. I welcome the balancing of the use between investment by directing costs towards those who make use of the service—in effect, taxing flying to enable more sustainable flight seems very sensible. By itself, though, the Bill does not do nearly enough. The move it encourages from first- to second- and then, vitally, to third-generation SAF is essential. HyNet, in which the University of Chester is a partner, and which makes use of the geology and industrial infrastructure in the north-west, is one other expression of this kind of investment. The production of green hydrogen, which combines captured carbon with sustainably electrolysed hydrogen, really is the holy grail here—let any budding and noble theologians note that I do not use that term in a technical sense

Alongside the Bill, we must invest in rail and in environmental road transport if we are to progress to sustainability. It cannot be right that more than half my return trains from this place to my home in Chester seem to be delayed or cancelled. What are the projected timescales for substantive provision of third-generation SAF? Is consideration being given to roll out this technology beyond aviation?

The Bill helps us play our part in global well-being in every sense. The question with which I come to this House is—as I mentioned earlier—not so much how we make Britain great again, but rather how we make Britain kind again. Such kindness and responsibility are what leads to greatness in a manner which actually lasts and embraces all. In this, this Bill matters. Our infrastructure must line up with our fundamental identity and core vocation if we are to thrive. The Bill represents one structural step, but it is a step in the right direction and I support it.

Lord Grayling (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, it is a particular pleasure to follow a very well-articulated tribute to the right reverend Prelate, to whom I also offer my congratulations on a very well-made, thoughtful and appropriate maiden speech. He will undoubtedly make a major contribution in this House, and I think all of us welcome him to this place.

I start, ironically, by referring to my entry in the register as an advisor to AtkinsRéalis as well as to Hutchison Ports. It is a particular pleasure for me to speak in this Second Reading debate. Two years ago, I was responsible for an amendment to the then Energy Bill which mandated the Government to set up a revenue support mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel in the UK. I stopped after getting 56 Conservative signatures to the amendment, which proved enough, just about, to finally jolt the Government, particularly the Treasury, into action and starting a process which has brought us to this point today. I am glad that I will be speaking alongside my noble friend Lord Harper, who followed that by playing a significant part in delivering us to the point we are at today. My noble friend is another example of why this is a genuinely bipartisan Bill. There are debates, differences and discussions about the detail, but there has been strong support across all sides for the principles that underlie the Bill today.

I was very pleased at the time that Ministers then recognised that they needed to do something and I am very pleased that Ministers in the current Government have continued the work that we started and have delivered this piece of legislation, which I strongly support, albeit with some caveats and questions which I want to push the Minister on today, in Committee and subsequently. I think there are some things that need to be tightened up and some questions that need to be answered, but the principle is absolutely right.

For me, the reason this all matters is very simple. The aviation industry is under growing pressure over its carbon footprint. Whether you are an opponent or a supporter of net zero is, to my mind, completely irrelevant to this debate. This is actually about the market pressures on the airlines themselves, particularly from a younger generation of potential customer among whom flight shaming has become more visible. The industry has to address those concerns, and we have to help it address those concerns and its impact on the environment.

It is not just about politics, it is actually about what is commercially necessary for what is one of our most important economic sectors. Of course, that is why Virgin Atlantic, Boeing and Rolls-Royce collaborated on the ground-breaking transatlantic pioneering flight using sustainable aviation fuel two years ago. We were on that flight and it was a very unique experience. It is why I know that most of the industry strongly supports this legislation. It is why the last Government brought forward plans for the SAF mandate and why this Government continued to introduce the mandate at the start of this year.

Why then do we need a revenue certainty mechanism of the kind set out in the Bill? Our airlines could just buy SAF from overseas. The initial product being used in this country will almost certainly come principally from the United States. There are two very good reasons why the Bill remains necessary. First, our aviation sector is, as I say, a key part of our economy; it is the strongest sector in Europe, it is fundamental to our regions and to the economy of so many different parts of the country. Do we really just want to import the fuel it needs for the future, or is it better to encourage serious investment here, of the kind that companies such as alfanar are planning for Teesside—a part of the country that clearly wants and needs investment?

Even in a world of free markets, sometimes I really think we need to make sure that we do some important things for ourselves. I think we can have a successful SAF sector in the UK that brings investment and creates jobs, but SAF plants require a very large amount of capital, and investors are always cautious about new markets and developing technologies. The truth is that the first SAF plants in the United States, of which there are just a handful, received investment support from the Biden Administration. The EU is poised to introduce its own revenue certainty mechanism. The Minister was right to say that ours is the first in the world, but it is not going to be the last, so for me it comes down to a straightforward choice: do we want a SAF industry in the UK or do we just have to depend on imports? I do not think we have to. My view is that we need that industry in the UK and I strongly support the Bill as a result.

There is another reason for caution about buying SAF from elsewhere: I think the UK approach is much smarter and much better. In the United States, SAF is being produced primarily from corn. In the EU, SAF will be produced, as we have heard, from what is called HEFA—basically, used cooking oil. I absolutely do not support growing fuel in fields that could be used for growing food. I have long been uneasy about the practice of growing crops for purposes other than food, but I think it is mad to use the space that the world needs to feed itself to grow aviation fuel. The UK is right also to accept for now, I think, that HEFA will be needed for the time being, but we need to understand that it is not going to be there for ever, and it is right that its future use is capped.

There are serious question marks about the availability of HEFA and there is also the suggestion that it is often not really used cooking oil at all but near-virgin oil that has been doctored to create the semblance that it has been used in a kitchen. Of course, much of it comes from the Far East, and SAF mandates are going to spread there too, so there is absolutely no certainty of supply going forward. The UK’s approach, which has been to push quickly towards SAF produced from biowaste, of which we have quite a lot here already, and then in due course from municipal waste, has to be the right one. To me, this really is the nirvana of sustainable aviation fuel: if we can turn our waste—what we put in our black bins each week—into fuel oil, removing the impact of landfill, incineration and the rest, that has to be a good thing.

I have a question for the Minister, and this is the first of the points I want to put to him. There are rumours around that the Government want to allow first-generation SAF from crops here. I really hope that is not true and I ask the Minister to set that to rest by confirming that there are no such plans. We should not be growing agricultural crops to turn into fuel. We have taken a much smarter approach in this country to delivering aviation fuel that has a positive environmental impact. We must not see that compromised in any way.

There are a number of other issues I have with the Bill that I want to put to the Minister. I want to see these issues addressed in the debates ahead, and there is at least one that I am very committed to asking the Government or this House to put in the Bill.

My first concern is about how the levy is applied on conventional aviation fuel manufacturers. I know that the Government’s initial intent was to assign the levy based on the previous year’s market share. I genuinely do not think that approach is viable. It misses out the impact of changes in the composition of the market, which could mean that a new player faces a period without charges and is able to undercut the existing market. The levelling-up process would then come way down the track, after a long period of time when there had been a real price discrepancy between the two and a competitive advantage to the newcomer.

Also, if someone disappears from the market—and we have seen two refineries close in recent times—such a delay will also cause complications for the counterparty. So, the mechanism to apply the levy has got to be immediate. I do not understand why it cannot just be done per barrel of fuel as it leaves the refinery or the terminal. I think the Minister needs to explain to all of us why that cannot happen. I appreciate that that is going to come in the secondary legislation, but we need to understand how it is going to be applied, and it has got to be done in a timely way. It cannot happen way after the event.

I was grateful to the Minister for spending some time with me and allowing his officials to spend some time with me. I know they have thought about this, but I ask him to now put some of the Government’s thinking about this on the record, so we can understand where it is going as we go through the Bill.

My second concern is there has got to be a direct link between the commencement of the levy and the opening of the first SAF plant. We do not realistically expect the first SAF plant in the UK to be operational much before 2030. So, the levy cannot start until close to 2030, otherwise we would be raising money—which passengers are paying more for—and just leaving it sitting in the bank. It is important that there has to be a clear linkage between the arrival of SAF manufacturing in the UK and the application of the levy.

On the timeframe, there is one other thing I would just ask the Minister to consider. At the moment, because there is not an awful lot of SAF capacity anywhere in the world, we must not apply the mandate on a ratchet scale up to 2030 in a way that is detached from the reality of the availability of SAF in the marketplace. I would ask him to keep monitoring the mandate as we go towards 2030 and make sure we are not actually out of kilter with the availability of SAF for the airlines to put in their planes.

The third concern I would ask the Minister to address is there has got to be no legal doubt whatever that the proceeds of the levy will be used only to support investment in the manufacturing of SAF in the UK. There has just got to be a proper safeguard against any other part of Government going, “Oh, there’s some money there. We’ll have that for something else”. It does happen; it has happened in other countries in similar areas. We need that certainty in the Bill.

I think the most important addition to the Bill—and I would ask the Minister to go away and think about this, because it must be in primary legislation, so there is no doubt in the courts going forward—would be to make it absolutely certain that the revenue support mechanism is going to be used only to support the production of SAF in the UK. There has got to be no legal doubt about this and no loopholes whatever.

The Government already know that there are loopholes out there and there are people trying to take advantage of them. The Government have already had to stop one multinational in the hydrogen marketplace from benefiting from UK financial support while planning to produce part of its product in the Middle East. It would be relatively easy for a manufacturer of SAF to import an intermediate fuel into the UK, process it at a SAF plant and claim the benefits the RCM would offer. The legislation has got to be absolutely categoric: that cannot be allowed to happen.

I would like the Bill to say very explicitly that any certified fuel that is a component of SAF has to be manufactured in the UK and that only the feedstock can be imported. Of course, there will be times when we buy biowaste from other European countries—that is perfectly reasonable. But you cannot be allowed to produce a three-quarters-finished fuel that you just adjust, turn into SAF at the end and claim that that should benefit from the revenue support mechanism. I would only countenance the feedstock as being imported, and hopefully, as we see the move towards urban municipal waste and even sewage turned into fuel, even that will not be necessary.

It is really important that we have that in the Bill, because courts do strange things. They interpret laws in different ways, sometimes in ways that those in Parliament do not expect or do not want to be the case. We have got to have absolute certainty on that in primary legislation. I mention this now to the Minister ahead of Committee to give him advance warning that I really want to explore this in detail.

I believe the Bill to be essential to the UK, benefiting from a new industry that we have ourselves mandated as essential to one of our most important and oldest sectors. It makes no sense to tell airlines to buy SAF but then ignore the opportunity to produce it here and let other Governments incentivise their own investments and industries instead.

I am very glad that both the last Government and this one accepted the intent behind that amendment two years ago, and I look forward to seeing the Bill pass into law. Our job in this House is to make sure it leaves no loopholes and then to encourage the Government to get on with the secondary legislation, so that contracts and the constructions can begin as quickly as possible.

Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb (GP) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I welcome the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester. I was absolutely delighted to hear him remind the House that there is no spare planet. Quite honestly, the rate at which we humans are trashing our planet suggests that we actually do think we can go to Mars, or something spectacular like that, and still live a good life. However, I point out that if we destroy this very beautiful planet, or make it increasingly less beautiful and diverse, our lives will be utterly constrained as well.

I like to say something nice about the Government occasionally, if I possibly can. I noted the Minister’s statement at the start that this Bill aims for a greener, cleaner future for aviation. That is a very noble aim, but I am afraid it is impossible unless we radically rethink how we are going to deal with it.

About 25 years ago, when I was on the London Assembly, we assembly members and the mayor, then Ken Livingstone, had a presentation by Heathrow representatives. They promised—this is 25 years ago, remember—that Heathrow could become sustainable within a few years. They claimed it should be given permission to expand because it would soon be polluting less.

It took us a couple of years, but the mayor and the assembly soon realised that Heathrow had lied. It still lies about expansion and pollution. It lies about how important it is to the economy and about how much public subsidy it gets. The truth is that the aviation industry cares about profits, not the environment. You can no more have sustainable aviation than you can have a crocodile with a conscience; it just does not exist.

There is absolutely no techno fix for the pollution that aviation causes. The Royal Society worked out that to reach net zero for aviation fuel—is this what we are snappily calling “jet zero”?—we need at least half the UK’s agricultural land to grow the raw materials. That would be over two-thirds if farmers only grew rapeseed.

That means less wheat, barley and fodder for livestock. That also means higher prices for cereals and food. We already have food inflation due to floods in some areas and droughts in others. Last year, the 2025 UK harvest was the second worst on record. If the Government want farmers to grow jet fuel instead of food, prices in the shops are going to rise in order to keep the planes flying.

As we enter the era of climate crisis impacting on world food production, our country will have less farming land but will want more of it devoted to support the oxymoronic idea of sustainable aviation. In the past 25 years, the UK has lost 771,000 hectares of farmland, contributing to a 12% fall in food self-sufficiency. That decline is about to get worse with the disastrous planning Bill the Government have passed.

I love the effort going into expanding renewable energy and battery storage, but as the Climate Committee has pointed out, that does not stop aviation becoming the number one contributor to emissions in the next few decades.

This Government have lost all claim to be a green Government, with their attack on nature in Britain and their decision to expand aviation. The go-ahead for the expansion of London City Airport, Luton, Gatwick and Stansted means an extra 51 million passengers per annum. If the Government add Heathrow to that total, that is an extra 65 million passengers. If all those extra flights result in either extra emissions or extra farmland taken up growing jet fuel, that means rising fuel prices and more public subsidy.

Of course, the reality is that we will not switch two-thirds of our farming land to jet fuel. The whole Bill is greenwash, designed to provide political cover for aviation expansion and bigger profits. The real solutions are to tax private jets and the ultra-frequent flyers, to stop short-haul flights, and to make train journeys cheaper and more reliable. The solution is less flying, not this fiction of sustainable aviation.

A noble Lord mentioned “flight shaming”; I am not trying to do that. It is understandable that families want to go on holiday once a year, but as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, pointed out, 70% of flights are taken by 15% of the population, which suggests that those people are grabbing their unfair share of the pollution that we can each expect to produce. Therefore, I ask the Minister: does he approve of making train journeys cheaper and more reliable, and putting a tax on private aircraft and frequent flyers?

I said to the owners of Heathrow 20 years ago—much to their annoyance, “If you want to show how environmental you are, then go ahead and fix the major problems of noise and air pollution and stop ruining the climate. Once you’ve done that, then, and only then, can we have a conversation about expansion of airports and of aviation”. I am so disappointed that this Government cannot see that. I recognise that they feel the need to explain that aviation can go on just as it has in the past, but that simply is not true.

Lord Harper (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I declare my interest as a non-executive chair of RVL Aviation.

I too congratulate the right reverend Prelate on his excellent maiden speech. Before he started speaking, I wondered whether he was going to set out the Church of England’s policy on sustainable aviation. I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent content of his speech and look forward to his further contributions in the House. The bit I will particularly remember is his injunction to be “kindly present”, which we should all strive to do. If I ever require someone to provide a reference for me, I will think of the noble Lord, Lord Raval, who spent most of his speech, rather than talking about the Bill, saying fantastic things that the right reverend Prelate would have been too humble to have said himself. He painted a rich picture of the right reverend Prelate’s skills, and I look forward to his future contributions.

The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, will not be surprised to learn that I disagreed with almost every word of her speech. On flying, she referred to the ability of people to go on holiday. We had a very interesting test case during the pandemic, when, in effect, we told people—albeit not for this reason—that they could not fly. Listening to constituents then as a Member of Parliament made clear to me the breadth of reasons why people value aviation. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester touched on some of them, including aviation bringing people together and enabling people to see friends and family around the world. It is not just about holidays; it is about bringing people together.

I also do not share the noble Baroness’s distaste for frequent flyers. Most of the people who do frequent flying are those involved in business, in global investment and in growing both the British and the global economy, which is essential to generate the wealth that we will need to green the economy and to make it more sustainable. We will get public acceptance for a lot of this only if we also make people better off, so it is incredibly important that we support flying and enable more people to fly. I want people who currently do not have the opportunity to fly, both in the United Kingdom and globally, to have the chance to do so.

Where I do agree with the noble Baroness is that we absolutely need to do that sustainably. It will be done by the use of technology. Before I move on to the subject of the Bill, it is worth me saying that a range of technologies are available. When I was Secretary of State, I was surprised by the unanimity across the aviation industry—airlines, airports and the aerospace sector involved in developing technology and manufacturing planes—on the importance of sustainability and decarbonisation. We never had any arguments with the industry or had to push it in this direction; it was already there and moving at pace. I found that incredibly encouraging.

Innovative companies based in the United Kingdom, such as ZeroAvia, are working on the technology around hydrogen fuel cells, which will be available in the future. I will discuss SAF in a moment, but there are also companies working on electric planes. There is also the important work that the Government are doing on airspace modernisation, which we kicked off when I was Secretary of State; that will also make a contribution. To get to net-zero aviation, we will also need to use—for the bit you cannot abate with plane technology—carbon capture and storage, and I know that a great deal of work is going on in that space, too.

I was very pleased to see the Government carry on our Jet Zero Council, which they now call the Jet Zero Taskforce—the renaming is a minor detail. That brings together industry, government, academia and, importantly, representatives from the Climate Change Committee, who provide helpful advice. They therefore learn about where the technology has got to, to inform the advice that the Climate Change Committee then provides to the Government. That is very welcome.

On sustainable aviation fuel, my noble friend Lord Grayling referred to the VS100 flight that Virgin Atlantic put on; it was funded by Virgin Atlantic but also supported by a contribution from the taxpayer because of a competition run by my predecessor. That flight took place in November 2023 and captured enormous public interest and attention. It was one of the rare occasions that I was able to do the morning broadcast round standing in front of a plane at Heathrow Airport—a great backdrop. It also had a good response from broadcasters, who found the whole thing very interesting and who did great explainers for the public on some of this technology; they wished us well with the endeavour, which is not something that broadcasters usually did to Ministers doing the morning broadcast round. It captured attention not just in Britain but around the world. When I went, shortly afterwards, to the climate change conference, COP 28, I was able to speak about that flight, which was a very good example of Britain leading the way in this area and demonstrating the value of technology.

We then started developing and consulting on the SAF mandate, which, in effect, provides the demand side of the equation for sustainable aviation fuel. I am very pleased again that, with the present Government, there has been enormous continuity in policy in this area.

On the supply side, the Minister referred to the excellent work being done by the Aerospace Technology Institute, which I also support. As has been mentioned, including by my noble friend Lord Davies of Gower, the capital cost of the domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel has been supported from the advanced fuels fund. I think the third round of that took place recently; the first round happened when we were in government. I would be interested if, in his winding-up speech, the Minister could provide us with an update on where the development of those plants has got to and when we might see more. My noble friend Lord Grayling suggested one timeframe for that, as did my noble friend Lord Davies. If the Minister gives us an update on progress in this area, it would be helpful if he also sets out something that my noble friend Lord Grayling also touched on, which is the value that the Government place on domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel.

There is a national resilience case for that, because again we saw during the pandemic that countries, regardless of the contractual obligations that businesses had, very much protected their domestic supply of this sort of fuel. We can quickly find that our reliance on getting this from overseas rapidly dries up. Having some domestic resilience is very important, and I would be grateful if the Minister could set out the Government’s view.

The specific purpose of the Bill is the revenue certainty mechanism. My noble friend Lord Grayling touched on this, and I clearly remember what I might term his rebel amendment to force the pace. It was good that he provoked that debate. I must confess that, when I was Secretary of State, I took quite a bit of persuading about the need for the revenue certainty mechanism. I will say a few words about that, because it will be helpful in posing some questions to the Minister, both here and when we are in Committee.

When the industry and my noble friend were lobbying for this, I was clear that I wanted to understand what the market failure was that we were trying to fix with the revenue support mechanism. We have ended up with a clear enunciation of it in the Explanatory Notes for the Bill. In his opening remarks, the Minister touched on this and talked about how the need to develop first-of-a-kind technology, which is not currently in existence, requires a significant amount of capital and is very high risk.

The caveat is that, when I had some round-table discussions with some of the investors, both here and in the United States, they understandably quite liked the idea of some guaranteed demand through a mandate. They also quite liked the idea of guaranteed pricing through a revenue certainty mechanism. I gently pointed out to them that they have to take some risk in this process in order to justify the return. The trick here is not to remove all risk, but to get the risk to the level of comparable investment projects, so that we make sure that we get appropriate levels of investment. But we must guard against what has happened in some of the rest of the energy sector, with very long-run contracts guaranteeing returns to investors that are higher than are strictly necessary, with the costs being paid by the consumer.

It is important that, when the detailed work is done, we get the balance right between securing the investment in domestic SAF production, minimising the cost to the consumer and getting the length of the contractual terms right. I do not pretend that that is easy, but it will be important to do it. In Committee, I think we will be discussing how to design the levy obligations on the fuel suppliers. My noble friend Lord Grayling touched on some of the detailed questions, such as how the levy interacts with the UK’s emissions trading scheme, the CORSIA scheme that has been set up internationally and the EU scheme, particularly as the free allocations for aviation under the emissions trading scheme expire.

Some argue that payments under the emissions trading scheme should be used to fund sustainable aviation fuel plants, rather than creating yet another obligation. I would be interested if the Minister set out how he and the Government see those schemes interacting with each other to ensure that consumers do not pay more than once.

My final point, which was also touched on by my noble friend Lord Grayling, is about the composition of sustainable aviation fuel and the international dimension to this. It is quite right—I agree in principle with what my noble friend Lord Grayling said—that we should not be using land that could be used for food crops to produce SAF. But there is one thing that we need to be realistic about, which maybe we should not have to but we do.

There is a big lobby in the US, which my noble friend touched on, that wants to use corn ethanol for SAF. Normally, I would be very much against that. The only argument in favour of it is whether it may be necessary to engage the United States Administration, who are not enormously well disposed towards sustainability and net zero, about what international agreements we may need to have with them, because it is really important in this area to keep the United States Administration broadly aligned. Given that aviation is by definition an international industry, it will be quite difficult to decarbonise the industry if the United States is heading in a different direction. Therefore, I would be interested to know what discussions the British Government are having with the United States Government about trying to keep them in this space and what sorts of discussions are going on with fuel providers. The only argument for using food crops for this would be that if by doing so we could keep the United States in this space.

However, in summary, I strongly support aviation and strongly support making it more sustainable. That will be done not by stopping people flying but by using technology—all the technology. Sustainable aviation fuel is the technology solution that is going to be available first—it is available now. The Virgin flight that I referred to demonstrated that you can have a 100% sustainable aviation fuel flight that works. It is a drop-in fuel with existing technology, and the revenue certainty mechanism that is enabled by the Bill, if the design of it is correct—we will test some of that in Committee—will help get that domestic production up and running. With those caveats, I support the Bill and look forward to further debate in Committee with the Minister and, I suspect, a number of the noble Lords who are here today.

Viscount Trenchard (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I add my congratulations to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his entertaining and informed speech. He should moonlight and take a second job on the Climate Change Committee.

It is a great pleasure for me to follow my noble friend Lord Harper, who rightly stressed that we should continue to lead the way in developing new technologies. Perhaps the Government could pay more attention to the absurdly high level of electricity costs in this country and the high levels of taxation.

I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill today. I have been a frequent flier for most of my working life and still travel regularly overseas, especially to the Far East. So I declare my interest as set out in the register, especially in connection with advising Japanese companies and British companies with regard to their Japanese business.

My noble friend Lord Grayling knows a great deal about this subject and made a compelling speech. The rapid adoption of SAF is still broadly supported by the Conservative Party, but I believe the sands have been shifting on the whole question of how quickly and at what cost businesses and individuals should be compelled to adopt a net-zero and clean energy agenda. In particular, if the larger carbon dioxide emitters, such as China and developing countries in Africa and Asia, are not imposing similar constraints on market forces in their countries, logic suggests that we should not do so either.

It seems to me that the effect of the Bill is to distort the market for sustainable aviation fuel. I suspect that the cost of this distortion will be borne ultimately by consumers. The Bill is about the creation of a revenue certainty contract, which will, in effect, insulate the quango which will be created as the counterparty from market risk. I am very sceptical about the Government’s claim that the net cost per passenger of implementing the revenue certainty mechanism will be between minus £1.50 and plus £1.50 per passenger. How can this be possible if the cost of the SAF itself is going to be more like £10 per passenger? In any event, ticket prices have soared beyond our wildest expectations over the last few years, so whether the cost of the RCM amounts to one cup of coffee or 100 cups of coffee is not really relevant.

I am not certain that forcing an increase from 2% to 22% of the SAF component of aviation fuels over the next 15 years is likely to save the planet. Can the Minister tell us whether the Government will interfere with airlines’ freedom to refuel their aircraft in other jurisdictions at will, including those that either have not imposed any mandate for inclusion of SAF or have imposed a less onerous one? I am not sure that the performance in miles per gallon of cars using E10 fuels is not slightly inferior to that of cars using E5 fuel, and I ask the Minister to tell the House what evidence there is that fuel economy and, crucially, safety are not at all impacted by the quite steep and burdensome mandate imposed on an already challenged aviation sector.

My noble friend Lord Davies of Gower in his interesting speech encouraged me to be more positive about SAF and to recognise its benefits and its importance. But he did point out that the Government’s mandate will be difficult to achieve without diverging from HEFA-based SAFs, and there is doubt about whether second- or third-generation SAFs will work well. There are more than 160 ships powered by small nuclear reactors, and the noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, rightly drew attention to nuclear power as a potential source of power for aircraft. In particular, he pointed out that high-temperature gas-cooled reactors enable the production of hydrogen at scale, and hydrogen technologies are already capable of powering aircraft. Airbus plans to have commercial hydrogen aircraft in service by 2035. Unfortunately, the Government’s hydrogen strategy does not recognise the role of nuclear in producing hydrogen at all. I ask the Minister why this is the case. Our Japanese friends are disappointed that we are moving so slowly with their project to develop high-temperature gas-cooled reactor technology with the National Nuclear Laboratory and believe that Poland may be a better partner than we are likely to be.

Can the Minister tell the House about the counterparty? He is going to have a great number of powers to direct it. How many people will it employ, and what does he expect will be its annual cost of operation? The Bill is designed to enforce a piece of industrial policy. Is the Minister certain that the counterparty will be well placed to manufacture SAFs competitively in this country, given our very high energy costs? Surely, if either the taxpayer or the consumer is going to have to pay for the cost of the counterparty and its activities, it follows that the legislation should require the Government to monitor costs and that the counterparty should be required to prioritise British technologies. Can the Minister tell the House why the Government declined to accept a perfectly reasonable and sensible amendment to require transparency over the effect of any revenue certainty contract on ticket prices, on both a one-year view and a five-year view?

I note that Jonathon Counsell of IAG, in his evidence to the Public Bill Committee in another place, raised the question as to whether the Government’s estimate of plus £1.50 to minus £1.50 really included all elements of the counterparty’s costs. If the Government did not like the amendment moved by my right honourable friend Richard Holden, could the Minister not undertake to bring forward the Government’s own amendment to achieve the same purpose? It is beyond doubt that the public and the consumer are entitled to know that the costs of this new foray into industrial policy will be strictly monitored.

How will the Minister ensure that the counterparty will ensure that any contract leading to the establishment of a new factory will prioritise the use of British technologies? We would certainly welcome the Minister telling the House how we can ensure that new factories will prioritise the use of British technologies. I look forward to hearing the Minister’s winding-up speech and to working with other noble Lords to improve the Bill, which is absolutely necessary.

Viscount Hanworth (Lab) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, the carbon content of fossil fuels has been accumulating over eons by the removal of carbon dioxide from the earth’s atmosphere via biological processes of photosynthesis, depending on chlorophyll and powered by sunlight. Such processes are highly efficient in their use of energy but they are far too weak and gradual to remove from the atmosphere the quantities of carbon dioxide that have been emitted by burning fossil fuels.

Capturing this carbon dioxide requires artificial processes that are far less efficient than the biological processes and far more consumptive of energy. Only by expending a large amount of energy that could be supplied by nuclear fission, and possibly in the long run by nuclear fusion, can there be any hope of cleansing the atmosphere of its excess carbon dioxide. According to a recent analysis, about 3% of carbon emissions are due to aviation. This figure is rising. We have heard that it is about 7% of UK emissions. Jet aircraft consume high-octane kerosene, which is refined from petroleum. Each flight powered by hydrocarbons adds to the burden of atmospheric carbon dioxide. If global heating due to carbon dioxide is to be addressed, something must be done to staunch the carbon emissions of aviation.

The problem is that there is no viable means of powering long-haul aviation other than kerosene, which has an unequalled energy density. Moreover, the technology of jet turbines, which has developed over the past 80 years, is not easily replaceable. Electric batteries or hydrogen fuel cells can be used in short-haul aviation, but their weight penalty precludes their use in long-haul aviation. Hydrogen, which has been used to power space rockets, has been proposed as an alternative for aviation fuel. Hydrogen has a very high energy content per mass, which is significantly greater than that of gasoline, but it has a low energy density per volume, meaning that it requires a large space to store it, even when compressed or liquefied. Liquid hydrogen has an energy content of about 5.6 megajoules per litre, whereas gasoline has about 32 megajoules per litre—almost six times as much. To use hydrogen to power aircraft would require a technology radically different from the current aviation technology, which would take a long time to develop. Its efficiency in transporting passengers would be severely limited by the storage requirements of the fuel.

If we are to sustain the present aviation technology, we need to develop sustainable aviation fuels, or SAFs. The ultimate requirement for such fuels is that they should emit to the atmosphere no greater quantities of carbon dioxide than are removed from the atmosphere for the purpose of creating their carbon feedstock. At present, so-called sustainable aviation fuel, which forms a very small proportion of the total supply of fuel for aviation, depends on a carbon feedstock that originates in biomass. Such aviation fuel cannot be relied on to reduce significantly the net emissions of carbon dioxide. They can have a beneficial effect only if the net supply of biomass can be increased to cover their use.

There are three cases to consider. First, the carbon feedstock might be grown for the purpose without displacing any other processes, but this is unlikely to happen. Secondly, the feedstock might be freely available, such as materials that would otherwise be consigned to landfill. Finally, and at worst, the production of the feedstock could displace other activities, such as the growth of foodstuffs.

Only in the first case, where there might be a net increase in photosynthesis, could there be a subtraction from atmospheric carbon dioxide. In the other cases, the emission of carbon dioxide from burning the fuel would be more rapid than if it had resulted from the natural decay of the feedstock, which might gradually add carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere.

It should be observed that wood, unless it is burned, will lock away carbon for many human generations. Therefore, forestry products should not be used as a carbon feedstock for synthetic fuels. Sustainable aviation fuel will deserve its name only if its carbon content can be removed directly from the atmosphere via the so-called technology of direct air capture.

This Bill has the ambition of stimulating the production of sustainable aviation fuels. It proposes to do so via minor financial interventions modelled on those that intend to encourage investment in renewable means of generating electricity.

The Bill itemises three levels, or generations, of SAF production. The first-generation SAFs are made from hydrogenated esters and fatty acids derived from oils or fats, such as used cooking oil. The second-generation SAFs are to be made from waste sources, including so-called municipal solid waste. The third-generation SAFs, also known as power-to-liquid aviation fuel, are to be made by combining hydrogen produced by electrolysis and carbon monoxide, which can be produced from captured carbon dioxide.

Regarding the first generation of SAFs, hydrogenated esters and fatty acids—commonly described as chip fat, because that is their major source—are already pre-empted to produce biodiesel. There is a good deal of mystery and doubt surrounding the second generation of SAFs. Their primary feedstock, which is described as municipal solid waste, is poorly defined, and different processes will be needed to cope with different categories of waste. A website of the British company Johnson Matthey, which is proposing to build plants in the US and Germany to produce second-generation SAFs, mentions a variety of sources for the carbon feedstock, including agricultural residues, forestry biomass, captured carbon dioxide, and the ill-defined municipal solid waste.

At the heart of the second generation of SAFs is the venerable Fischer-Tropsch process, which was invented in Germany in 1925 and used extensively in Germany during the war to create synthetic fuels using coal as the predominant carbon feedstock. The process generates hydrocarbons from syngas, which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The syngas will be the product of a gasification plant, which must be specific to the nature of the primary feedstock. If this process were to take its carbon dioxide from captured industrial emissions then it would emit carbon to the atmosphere that might otherwise be sequestered in the ground. The conclusion of this critique is that the only sure way of reducing aviation emissions would be to capture the carbon directly from the atmosphere. In that case, the Fischer-Tropsch process would continue to be used to synthesise the fuel.

The Bill appears to envisage a gradual transition between the three generations of SAF production, and it imagines that this can be achieved by financial incentives that could be structured by the Government. There would be no other government intervention and the Government would bear no costs. The costs would be covered by levies on the aviation industry and maybe by the suppliers of hydrocarbon fuels.

This is a weak proposal for addressing a crisis. The Bill has been inherited from the Conservatives, and it bears the marks of their social and economic philosophies. One might have expected a more interventionist approach from a Labour Government. One is reminded of how an early post-war Labour Government sought to revolutionise the supply of power to industrial and domestic users by creating a completely new industry: the nuclear industry. A similar endeavour would be required to create a sustainable aviation fuel industry, but there is little indication that this will be forthcoming.

Baroness Pidgeon (LD) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I congratulate the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his excellent maiden speech and his commitment to sustainability and rail, which is music to many of our ears in this House. I look forward to working with him in the months and years to come.

As we have heard today, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill aims to encourage investment in sustainable aviation fuel in the UK by creating a mechanism to guarantee a certain level of revenue. The Bill provides for a guaranteed strike price, guaranteeing price for a producer selling SAF over a defined period. The GSP will be funded via a levy on the aviation industry, specifically through a variable levy on all aviation fuel suppliers over a set period. This legislation should help the industry meet its requirements under the SAF mandate, introduced in January this year, which specifies that at least 10% of all jet fuel used in flights taking off from the UK from 2030 must be made with sustainable fuel, rising to 22% by 2040. This is clearly an area where the UK is trying to lead the way in decarbonising the aviation sector.

However, it should be noted that aviation, with all its benefits in connecting people and businesses, was responsible for almost 30 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022, equivalent to about 7% of the UK’s total emissions. As I understand it, even as emissions from other sectors decline, aviation’s share is projected to rise to 16% by 2035. This is not compatible with our net-zero targets. Sustainable aviation fuel is not a silver bullet, but it is a step forward to help us in the challenging environment that other noble Lords have described.

We on the Liberal Democrat Benches welcome these steps to decarbonise our aviation industry, including investment in sustainable aviation fuels. However, we see SAF as just the first step; we want it to offer a real low-carbon alternative. We believe that the Government should set out how they will go beyond securing investment in SAF and ensure that, longer term, this measure complements rather than detracts from investment in zero-carbon flight technology. We want to see greater innovation, research and development to make the UK the world leader in zero-carbon flight. SAF should be a springboard for that objective rather than a final destination, helping the UK transition to truly climate-friendly options such as battery-electric platforms and hydrogen-fuelled models as these technologies develop. There is a lack of clarity about what level of zero-carbon flight the Government are aiming for, if any, so perhaps the Minister can advise.

It is hard to square an objective of net-zero aviation by 2050 without measures alongside SAF to cut emissions and make climate-friendly flight a reality, and it is hard to look at the decarbonisation of fuel use in aviation while this Government seem intent on expanding airports such as Gatwick and Heathrow, to name just two, leading to many more flights.

There are a number of areas that we will be probing further in Committee. There are some concerns about the levy and the need to ensure that there are no loopholes, that progress is monitored and published and that we are aligned with our European and global neighbours or even ahead of them. Looking at international examples, the EU’s ReFuelEU aviation regulation requires a minimum blend of 2% SAF in 2025, rising to 70% by 2050; it focuses far more on both fuel suppliers and airlines; and, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Grayling, it is considering its own revenue support mechanism. Singapore and Thailand’s mandates started a 1% blend in 2026. Japan and South Korea are considering mandates starting some way off, in 2027 and 2030. In China, there is a SAF mandate at 2% that increases to 15% by 2030. Elsewhere, India and Brazil are considering SAF mandates. In the US, while there is no mandate, there is government support, as we have heard, to boost production, in the form of tax credits and other incentives. While there is no consensus on the route map for sustainable aviation fuel and how to support its growth, in developing this mechanism, what international examples have the Government considered to help shape their approach and the Bill before us today?

The levy on fuel producers is not necessarily the wrong approach, but key details are missing and could have unintended consequences if regulations are poorly designed. Leaving the mechanism to be determined later provides useful flexibility for a new and emerging industry. However, assurances are needed on how the mechanism will be designed. One issue that has been raised by industry and by other noble Lords today is that the levy is based on historical market share, which could cause problems. It is not clear if new market entrants might avoid paying the levy if they have no prior market share. Perhaps the Minister can clarify.

Another important issue I have picked up from talking to producers such as Neste is that, although industry in general supports the creation of a revenue certainty mechanism as a means to strengthen investor confidence and unlock the significant investments required for SAF production, there is concern that a level playing field would be guaranteed internationally. There is a strong feeling that revenues of the levy should not be used to support production of SAF that is subsequently exported. This should be about developing and supporting our own UK industry and needs. The levy should be focused on ensuring SAF supply at an affordable price within the UK. Since the UK and EU SAF mandates, I understand that we have seen an increase in the cost of SAF. This mechanism should help with the supply of SAF within the UK and help to ensure a stable price.

I have also been talking to operators that use SAF, for example DHL. In 2024, DHL used 73,000 tonnes of SAF in its own fleet, which is 3.5% of their total fuel share. This is in addition to investing in its fleet to decarbonise and in its ground-handling equipment to move to fully electric. We need to ensure that all operators are looking to decarbonise their whole operations and are not just relying on SAF to tick the green box, in effect.

A final issue that has come up in discussions and been raised by many noble Lords today, including my noble friend Lord Russell, is a concern that the levy will filter down and potentially cost passengers and airlines significantly. Can the Minister explain what assessment the Government have carried out and assure the House that passengers will not be significantly penalised? The combination of a long-term mandate and the proposed revenue support mechanism clearly offers a high degree of regulatory certainty, which is crucial for attracting the significant capital investment needed for SAF production in the UK. I hope the Minister can reassure us on the important points raised today and as we move forward to Committee.

Lord Moylan (Con) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, what is one to say? The easy part is to start by joining other noble Lords in congratulating the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his entertaining and interesting maiden speech, and to welcome him and the many contributions he will no doubt make to your Lordships’ House in the future.

When the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats, even without the support of the Green Party, all agree in supporting a measure, who can withstand them? Some might call it groupthink; others might see in it the spirit that defeated fascism in Europe. But here we are. We have huge support for this Bill from all quarters of the House, but I am afraid that it is the job of the Official Opposition to express a degree of scepticism.

Our debate has ranged very widely indeed, whereas the Bill has a very narrow focus. Many have spoken of it as if it were a net-zero measure. I dispute that. The net-zero measure was the SAF mandate that was put in place, as the Minister said, before Christmas last year, in November, which mandated airlines to use a certain quantity of SAF in their fuel, increasing every year over a period and set out in a statutory instrument. That was certainly a net-zero measure.

However, few noble Lords were open in saying that the Bill is not a net-zero measure as such but an industrial policy measure; in fact, it was really only my noble friend Lord Grayling who was explicit about that. He was explicit also in saying that he supported that industrial policy, which says that not only do we have to require SAF to be used by airlines in this country but we have to be the producer of that SAF. He gave reasons: he said, “Why would you want to use foreign producers? Why would you want to import your SAF?” But there are answers to that.

I am told that there is no future in being an old-fashioned Thatcherite and believing in markets, and that people like me are terribly out of date. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Pidgeon, made clear that SAF mandates are not confined to Britain and the European Union; there are countries all over the world with SAF mandates. She mentioned Thailand and Singapore, and I am sure there are many others as well. SAF is a global business. There is an argument that you might be able to import your SAF more cheaply and have a more efficient market if you were not insisting on producing it all yourself. None the less, the Conservative Party when in power and the Labour Party today have decided on that as a matter of industrial policy.

So what can possibly go wrong, even though it is hard to see what comparative advantage the United Kingdom has as a producer of SAF? The noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, pointed to one element that seemed pretty damning of our comparative advantage—our very high electricity costs by international standards. He pointed out that this the production of SAF is an electricity-hungry process, but that none the less has to be ignored and overridden.

The Government have decided to be a leader in this uncertain field, and it is uncertain. I think we have agreed that there are three stages of SAF. There is HEFA, which the Government do not want to subsidise, as I understand it, even though, as again the noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, pointed out, the Bill appears to be drafted so that they could. We need to examine that more closely in Committee. Assuming that the Government do not want to subsidise HEFA, that leaves us with non-HEFA SAF, but the processes for producing non-HEFA SAF are highly uncertain and some of them are first of a kind. We do not even know that they are going to work, but we are putting in place a revenue certainty mechanism so that investors can find out, for practically no risk, whether they are. This is going to be of advantage to the national economy.

Beyond that, as the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, said, there is a power-to-liquid option, but the Government do not appear to believe that it is worth investing in that at the moment, even though it is being pursued in the United States with the support of tax credits and, as I understand it, with a large plant in Texas.

Anyway, having decided that this is our industrial policy, we have to find a way of subsidising it. The Treasury has discovered this wonderful thing, the contract for difference, which is a form of subsidy that means that they do not have to shell out any money, because the cost of the subsidy is passed on to the consumer. Contracts for difference have given us the very high electricity costs to which the noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, referred earlier, which are apparently crippling the process on which we are embarking. So we are to have not a subsidy but a contract for difference, and we are to set up a counterparty that will be able to work that out. It is going to have the skills to negotiate with the hard-faced lawyers sent by the investors to get, as my noble friend Lord Harper said, absolutely that price which offers an appropriate level of reward for the very low level of risk the investors are taking, but not a penny more. Our negotiators will be able to manage that and land it to perfection, and they will have the resources to do that. And so we go on.

Noble Lords have raised a whole series of questions, which I suspect will form the basis of our discussion in Committee. I will add a few myself. Can the Minister clarify whether the Government have made an assessment of the compatibility of the revenue certainty mechanism with the non-discrimination requirements of the WTO’s Article III.4 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, particularly in relation to the differential treatment between qualifying SAF and imported non-qualifying non-fossil aviation fuels such as HEFA? Also, will he indicate—I assure him that I do not necessarily expect him to answer these questions at the Dispatch Box, though it would be very impressive if he did—whether the Government have assessed whether the RCM would constitute a subsidy for the purposes of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and whether any risk of countermeasures or formal dispute settlement from other WTO members has been identified?

I am sure there are further questions, which I can bring up in Committee, but for the moment, there we are. We stand solidly behind the Bill, but we see a large number of holes in it. We are far from convinced that it will do the job that the Government have said it will set out to do. Whether it can be done at a price of £1.50 per ticket seems to be something else that is worthy of exploration—as is what that figure actually means. Since the mandate increases every year, at what point does the £1.50 come in? Surely, the cost per ticket would rise over the course of time as the mandate requirement rises. We will explore both how it was calculated and what it means but, for the moment, we look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response to what has been a lively and well-informed debate.

Lord Hendy of Richmond Hill (Lab) - View Speech - Hansard - - - Excerpts

My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have engaged in today’s lively debate on the Bill. I have listened with much interest to the excellent points raised across your Lordships’ House, and I will now attempt to answer some of the questions. Of course, we can explore many of the issues in greater detail in Committee. In the meantime, I will follow up as soon as I can on some of the issues that I cannot answer now, but I am grateful for such wide, general cross-party support for this important measure.

First, I should compliment the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester on his maiden speech. He said that sustainability matters; I am so glad that he did, and that he said it in English, because he might have been able to say it in Welsh and I would not have been able to respond. The Government and I are grateful for his support of a vital sustainability measure for air transport, which is essential for the nation’s wealth and defence. The only other thing I should say to the right reverend Prelate at this point is that I am sorry about his train service. I will speak to him separately about the trains to Chester.

As I said, I am grateful for the support of many noble Lords who have spoken. The noble Lord, Lord Davies of Gower, was supportive. The points that he and many others made and the questions he asked were all about making early progress. The Government are pursuing the Bill now, as we did with the SAF mandate, in order to get on and do this, because getting on and doing this is absolutely what we seek achieve. The noble Lord referred to the net effect of this on the price of airfares, as a number of other noble Lords have done. Our best estimate is plus or minus £1.50—we are confident on that—but I am happy to explore that further in Committee. We do not believe it is plus or minus £10. We believe that we have, at least for the moment, explored the cost that would fall on air passengers.

A number of points made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, were about progress, and this Bill is evidence of the Government making progress. Like other noble Lords, he referred to the point of the first tranche and subsequent tranches. We of course need to move beyond HEFA feedstuffs, which is the point of the further tranches of the revenue support mechanism. The noble Earl also referred to the sustainability of UK plant, which is why the Government have put £63 million into the advanced fuel fund: for the very purpose of ensuring that there are plants in this country which can produce sustainable aviation fuel and that the plants themselves are sustainable.

The noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, referred to competition in due course. The Bill includes the opportunity for the Secretary of State in due course to run tenders or auctions as a means of developing this market.

The noble Lord, Lord Raval, talked about waste and foodstuffs. We will, as we go through this Bill, have regard to its overall effect on the provision of sustainable aviation fuel.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Grayling, for his detailed and compelling speech on this subject and for his great interest. He talked about not allowing crops to be made into SAF. We have committed to publishing a call for evidence by the end of this year on the use of crops in the SAF mandate. The aim is to improve the evidence base on crop-based SAF production, following suggestions from some stakeholders that certain types of crops could be used to increase SAF supply without compromising our approach to sustainability. But we will get information provided through that call for evidence, and we will consider what we find out.

The noble Lord, Lord Grayling, referred particularly to the use of data and how the market price is determined. The counterparty will be responsible for determining the market and should do so by using data that suppliers submit to the SAF mandate reporting system. Our live consultation seeks views on whether the assessment period should use volume data from an earlier period, or—since he suggested that is not sensible—uses forecast volume data. We will have more discussion about that in due course, I am sure. He also made a very strong point about the support being used only for production in the United Kingdom. We intend to support only eligible SAF plants in the UK; I am sure we will discuss that further. It is a strong point and I will consider it as we get to Committee.

The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, talked about cleaner skies and warmer homes. I am aware of the consultation on alternative heating solutions, and we are working with our colleagues in DESNZ to move those forward.

The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, does not agree with this at all. We have discussed the points she was making about aviation before. This is a move towards net zero. We are trying to make aviation more sustainable, as it is not going to stop overnight and is important for the economy of the country. The mandate will save some net additional 54 million tonnes of CO2. On the noble Baroness’s other point about frequent flyers, last year the Government altered air passenger duty which does have an effect on more frequent flyers.

I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Harper. He made some substantial points. The noble Lord referred to a flight that used 100% sustainable aviation fuel; I believe he was a passenger on it. If I may, I will try to respond in detail to the points that the noble Lord made before Committee stage.

The noble Viscount, Lord Trenchard, is perhaps not so supportive, though in the end I think he said he was. But what we are doing is important. We should be trying to move into a market that self-evidently can be a success for British industry, if we approach it properly. Government intervention, as justified by a number of noble Lords this afternoon, is the only way to do it. The noble Viscount is very sceptical of the effect on pricing for passengers; again, I have no doubt that we will discuss this in Committee and afterwards. Of course, he wants safety not to be compromised; none of us does. It is only right to point out that another noble Lord on his Benches was on a flight wholly powered by sustainable aviation fuel and I doubt whether the noble Lord would put himself at risk: I hope he would not. We are absolutely committed to safety. We are also committed to the fuel economy, which he mentioned.

The noble Lord, Lord Ravensdale, referred to nuclear and hydrogen power. The Government have clearly not set their mind against any solution. The significant funding put towards investing in technical solutions and the way in which the SAF process is being developed encourages other solutions and will encourage British industry to look particularly towards these solutions in the longer term. We will, of course, prioritise UK technology. This is the point and it is a good thing to do.

My noble friend Lord Hanworth is also probably not supportive—not because he does not agree with the general principle but because he somehow thinks, despite all we are doing to be at the forefront of global action, including the £63 million we are putting into the advanced fuels fund, that somehow this is not enough and that there should be some red-blooded approach. I contend that this is a pretty red-blooded approach from the Government. Significant sums of public money have been put into it, and we believe that it is the right thing to do.

The noble Baroness, Lady Bloomfield, referred to the nuclear option. SAF produced using nuclear energy is and will be eligible for the SAF mandate. We have provided funding to support the development of this technology through the grant funding programme of the advanced fuels fund. We are clearly on a journey and I note the noble Baroness’s proposition that it will need longer-term support. Although the Bill is limited to a term of 10 years, the support term is not so limited. I hope the noble Baroness will note that this is one of the reasons why.

The noble Baroness, Lady Pidgeon, made some strong points. As I have said, we are on a journey. In Committee, we can discuss the consistency of the trajectory of that journey with the EU and other countries that have set themselves different targets. Of course, it is not the only measure: zero-emission flying is and could not be just about SAF. To that end, we have talked about airspace modernisation, which is something the noble Baroness knows about. We have looked at funding of up to £2.3 billion over 10 years to extend the Aerospace Technology Institute which was announced in the modern industrial strategy in June to look at low-emission and zero-emission aircraft. We are looking at reducing aviation emissions through schemes such as the UK Emissions Trading Scheme on carbon pricing. We are also seeking to address the non-CO2 impacts of aviation. The noble Baroness is correct, of course, in looking at everything to do with carbon reduction in flying, not just aircraft fuel and technology but the operations surrounding aircraft. She mentioned the activities in that respect of DHL, which is a major user of aircraft.

Lastly, the noble Lord, Lord Moylan, for whom I have huge respect, appears to see a conspiracy between all the parties here to do something which he does not seem to support, which is to have an industrial policy that gives British industry the chance to develop something new in the world and to develop jobs and processes which will lead to a bigger economy. He is not in the same place as some of his colleagues on his own Benches on that and I think that he is wrong, because this is not only an industrial policy but a step towards net zero. He mentioned power-to-liquid, and we have invested in that in the advanced fuels fund. He asked a couple of very detailed questions about the World Trade Organization, and I would be delighted to write to him with the answers, supposing that I was unable to provide answers from the Dispatch Box just now.

Once again, I thank all noble Lords who participated in the debate today and I welcome the support of the many who spoke in favour of the Bill’s measures. The Bill will kick-start the UK SAF industry, attracting investment and creating jobs. By addressing the market and investment uncertainty in SAF production, it will enable the UK to lead the way to greener aviation.

The U.S. Department of Energy on Nov. 20 announced an organizational realignment. The current Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Bioenergy Technologies Office are among the DOE departments that will be impacted.

In a statement, the DOE said the organizational realignment is “designed to strengthen DOE’s ability to execute President Trump’s bold agenda to restore American energy dominance.” The agency noted that the “realignment reflects the administration’s priorities of expanding American energy production, accelerating scientific and technological leadership, and ensuring the continued safety and readiness of the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.”

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is aligning its operations to restore commonsense to energy policy, lower costs for American families and businesses, and ensure the responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “These changes will help us better execute the DOE mission of delivering affordable, reliable and secure American energy for the American people.""

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is currently housed under the Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Innovation and headed by the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Currently, the EERE contains 10 technology offices, including the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), along with offices dedicated to advanced materials and manufacturing, buildings, geothermal, hydrogen and fuel cell, industrial efficiency and decarbonization, solar energy, vehicle technologies, water power and wind energy.

The BETO focuses on research, development and demonstration of technologies aimed to enable the use of domestic biomass and waste resources for the production of biofuels and bioproducts. It currently spearheads efforts related to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge, CO2 utilization, transportation biofuels, waste-to-energy innovation, bioproducts production, wood heater innovation, and algae. BETO is also the DOE office that has published and updated the Billion-Ton Report.

According to a DOE spokesperson, the EERE has been renamed the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI). Some functions associated with the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Office of State and Community Energy Programs, and Fossil Energy and Carbon Management have also been realigned to the newly formed CMEI. An update flow chart released by the agency indicates the CMEI will no longer be housed under the Office of Science.

The DOE did not elaborate on how the many functions of the EERE and BETO will be impacted as the agency rolls out the organizational realignment.
