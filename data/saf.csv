The goal: lower fuel burn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help airlines save money at a time of rising costs and mounting climate pressure.
Airbus has already completed several successful test flights in partnership with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic.
If applied to commercial operations, Airbus estimates that this technique could reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% on long-haul flights.
According to a study by the environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E), the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—which emits less CO₂ over its lifecycle—will continue to grow.","Airbus is experimenting with a flight formation inspired by nature in an effort to cut fuel consumption and reduce aviation’s environmental footprint. The concept borrows directly from how birds fly in groups, using airflow dynamics to improve efficiency—much like the slipstream effect seen in Formula 1 racing.

The European aerospace giant is behind the initiative, known as Fello’fly, a project designed to optimize flight routes by taking advantage of aerodynamic lift created by aircraft flying ahead. The goal: lower fuel burn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help airlines save money at a time of rising costs and mounting climate pressure.

How the Fello’fly concept works

The idea is simple in theory but complex in execution. Two aircraft fly in a coordinated formation similar to migrating geese. One plane leads, generating wake turbulence that creates a slight upward lift. The aircraft behind can then “ride” that airflow, improving fuel efficiency through a phenomenon known as wake energy recovery.

Airbus has already completed several successful test flights in partnership with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic. These trials focused on validating whether such formations could be flown safely, precisely, and within existing aviation regulations.

Successful tests over the North Atlantic

According to French business outlet BFM Business, Airbus carried out eight test flights over the North Atlantic between September and October 2025. The objective was to prove the operational feasibility of guiding two aircraft to a precise rendezvous point while maintaining vertical separation, as required by air traffic control rules.

If applied to commercial operations, Airbus estimates that this technique could reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% on long-haul flights. That reduction would translate directly into lower CO₂ emissions—a meaningful gain for an industry under intense scrutiny.

Why fuel savings alone won’t solve aviation’s climate problem

While innovations like Fello’fly can help, their overall impact remains limited. Several structural challenges continue to slow progress toward more sustainable air travel.

The high cost of cleaner fuels, a shortage of new aircraft, and the relentless growth in global air traffic all work against deeper emissions cuts. Passenger numbers keep climbing year after year, putting added pressure on airlines and the environment.

A future with more passengers—and more planes

Airbus forecasts that global air travel will reach 8 billion passengers by 2040, nearly double the 4.5 billion recorded in 2019. Meeting that demand will significantly expand the world’s aircraft fleet over the next two decades.

According to a study by the environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E), the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—which emits less CO₂ over its lifecycle—will continue to grow. However, the study warns that even if SAF accounts for 42% of fuel use, as required under European regulations, the aviation sector would still burn as much fossil kerosene in 2049 as it did in 2023.

The worldwide movement toward cleaner energy sources is gaining momentum, fundamentally changing how institutional investors approach their portfolios. As the push for decarbonization intersects with rapid technological progress and evolving regulations, a new category of assets is emerging—offering both environmental benefits and financial stability. A key driver of this change is the creation of sophisticated market infrastructure, such as RESurety’s CleanTrade platform, which has received CFTC approval. This platform is enhancing transparency, liquidity, and risk management in the clean energy derivatives space. For institutional investors, these advancements open up fresh possibilities to diversify holdings and meet ESG objectives, especially in an era of modest returns.

Building the Backbone of Clean Energy Markets

Robust infrastructure is the cornerstone of thriving, liquid clean energy markets. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Technology Commercialization allocated over $35 million to support 42 projects through the CLIMR Lab Call, aiming to bridge the gap between laboratory breakthroughs and commercial-scale deployment. At the same time, private companies are making strides in essential technologies: Helion Energy’s Orion fusion facility in Washington is set to deliver 50 MW to Microsoft’s data centers, while TAE Technologies is making plasma formation more cost-effective and less complex, advancing the promise of fusion energy. Progress in hydrogen infrastructure is also notable, with Southwest Research Institute leading projects to test high-pressure valves and underground storage solutions. Collectively, these initiatives are overcoming long-standing challenges in scalability and reliability, paving the way for greater institutional investment.

CleanTrade: Driving Market Liquidity and Openness

At the center of this market transformation is RESurety’s CleanTrade platform, which gained CFTC approval as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) in September 2025. By offering a regulated environment for trading Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), CleanTrade has resolved persistent inefficiencies in clean energy derivatives. Within just two months of its debut, the platform saw $16 billion in notional trading volume, reflecting strong institutional trust in ESG-focused assets. Enhanced by real-time analytics, carbon tracking, and robust risk management features, CleanTrade meets the rigorous standards of institutional investors.

Beyond streamlining transactions, CleanTrade is transforming the investment landscape by standardizing contracts and introducing transparent price discovery. This reduces the information gaps that have historically deterred clean energy investment. The platform’s ability to hedge against renewable energy price swings through structured derivatives gives investors greater confidence—a crucial advantage as energy markets are increasingly shaped by policy changes and technological innovation.

Portfolio Diversification and Risk Control in a Low-Yield World

The emergence of liquid clean energy markets coincides with a broader trend among institutions to seek alternative assets. According to a 2025 U.S. report, private equity, hedge funds, and infrastructure have become central to institutional portfolios as investors search for returns in a low-interest-rate climate. Clean energy derivatives, made accessible through platforms like CleanTrade, offer a valuable addition to these strategies. They provide access to rapidly growing sectors such as hydrogen and fusion, while also enabling cross-asset hedging to manage systemic risks.

Incorporating ESG considerations is now a mainstream priority for institutional investors. Assets that support decarbonization are increasingly favored, and CleanTrade’s transparent carbon tracking ensures compliance with evolving regulations. For example, the platform’s verification of renewable energy production and carbon offset credits enables investors to achieve Scope 2 targets under the SEC’s climate disclosure requirements. This dual emphasis on financial returns and environmental responsibility strengthens portfolio resilience, especially as markets contend with the long-term effects of climate change.

Looking Ahead: The Next Era of Clean Energy Investment

As innovation, regulatory clarity, and institutional interest converge, liquid clean energy markets are poised to become a foundational element of future investment portfolios. The U.S. clean energy lending sector, which expanded by 7.6% in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, highlights the sector’s growth potential. Meanwhile, advancements in long-duration energy storage by companies like Form Energy and the development of sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure by Twelve Energy are broadening the applications for clean energy assets.

For investors, seizing this opportunity means leveraging platforms like CleanTrade to access structured, liquid, and ESG-compliant investments. As the energy transition accelerates, those who incorporate these assets into their diversification strategies will not only protect themselves from traditional market risks but also position themselves at the forefront of a transformative economic era.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-14 14:57:04.703475

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an accessible tool to spell out their thesis, link it to a forecast, and then compare their Fair Value to today’s share price to decide whether Airbus looks like a buy, hold, or sell. Because Narratives update dynamically when fresh news, earnings, guidance or industry data comes in, your thesis evolves as the facts change rather than staying frozen in time. For example, one investor might build a Narrative that leans on the most bullish analyst targets, strong backlog growth and smooth production ramp ups, leading to a higher Fair Value than the current price, while another might focus on supply chain risks, slower margin expansion and the lowest analyst targets, producing a much lower Fair Value and a more cautious stance.

Major markets

While Asia Pacific was the largest market for sustainable aviation fuel in 2024, this year that title has been taken by North America, which currently accounts for 47.11% of the market.

By feedstock type, vegetable oils currently lead the market, accounting for more than a third (36.11%) of overall capacity, however the waste oils and fats segment is anticipated to see the fastest growth over the forecast period.

In terms of processing technology, while hydro processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is currently the largest segment, with a share of 41.23%, this is expected to be overtaken by the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis segment over the coming decade.

The commercial aviation segment accounts for around 71.09% of all sustainable aviation fuel use at present, and this segment is expected to continue to dominate, with the private and business aviation segment set to account for around 10% of total use by the end of the forecast period.

Increased production

Noting that there are currently three major commercial producers of SAF, World Energy Neste and Montana Renewables LLC, Precedence Research added that production is expected to accelerate, particularly in the US.

‘Many airlines have signed agreements with existing and future SAF producers to use all their expected output,’ it said.

‘The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects renewable fuel data as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard, which provides an approximate consumption for novel biofuels such as SAF.

He underlined the importance of a comprehensive approach to industry development, including the use of various types of feedstock and the search for new sources to expand production capacity.

Such an approach, he said, would enable countries in the region to fully harness the potential of SAF, reduce production costs, and enhance the investment attractiveness of the aviation sector.

It is worth recalling that Allied Biofuels FE LLC Uzbekistan has signed an agreement with the government of the Khorezm region concerning land and water resources for the implementation of a project to build a bioprocessing complex in the Tuproqqalinsky district. The total investment in the project is estimated at US$5.9 billion.

The project предусматривает the establishment of Central Asia’s first fully integrated zero-emissions aviation fuel production facility. Once operational, the plant is expected to produce annually 382,000 tonnes of SAF, 152,000 tonnes of electro-synthetic e-SAF, and 11,000 tonnes of green diesel, based on 2 GW PEM electrolyzers.

Currently, India's total distillery capacity is approximately 1,900 crore litres, including 900 crore litres from sugar feedstock and 1,000 crore litres from grain feedstock.
With 1,048 crore litres of ethanol contracted by OMCs in 2024-25 ESY (Ethanol Supply Year November-October) and 330 crore litres of ethanol for alternative uses, there is a surplus of 450-plus crore litres of ethanol in the country.","In an interview with PTI, Sinha outlined India's competitive advantages in the emerging SAF market. The earliest alcohol-to-jet SAF plants could become operational by 2029, he projected, assuming policy clarity emerges by the end of the current financial year. Until then, India will rely on limited SAF production from used cooking oil for 1-2 per cent blending.

""India has very significant potential to emerge as an export hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. We can start exporting on the East Coast to Southeast Asian countries, where Singapore is a major aviation hub. Similarly, on the West Coast to countries like Dubai,"" said Sinha.

""The first big benefit is a surplus of ethanol. The capacity is already done,"" Sinha explained. ""India has capacities equivalent to support E30, E35 ethanol supply, which means we are in an oversupply situation."" More significantly, Indian sugarcane-derived ethanol has lower carbon intensity than Brazilian ethanol. ""If my CI number is lower than Brazil's, the pollution reduction is far larger if I use Indian ethanol versus Brazilian ethanol,"" he said.

""If you look at the US, unless it imports Brazilian 2G ethanol, it will largely be maize-driven SAF where carbon intensity will be very high. My carbon intensity of Indian sugarcane ethanol is the lowest. That's a very big advantage we bring to the table."" Setting up an SAF facility with 80 tonne per day capacity would require about Rs 1,400 crore investment and 200 kg per day ethanol supply, Sinha said, and stressed that policy support is essential, including 100 per cent offtake guarantee, viable pricing, viability gap funding and preferential pricing for first movers.

""The earliest plant, from alcohol to jet, can come up in 2029. That big quantum jump will take place in 2029, when people would be available to produce SAF from ethanol,"" he said.

""FFVs have been there in Brazil for very long. They have been extremely successful and in India we believe that would be the right pathway for enhancing offtake."" He also pointed to ethanol-diesel blending up to 5 per cent, which has been successfully tested. ""Can we look at creating an ecosystem for safe usage of diesel blended with ethanol?"" On feedstock availability, Sinha expressed confidence that the sugar industry can supply around 500 crore litres even at demand levels of 900 crore litres, after accounting for potable and industrial uses.

Currently, India's total distillery capacity is approximately 1,900 crore litres, including 900 crore litres from sugar feedstock and 1,000 crore litres from grain feedstock. With 1,048 crore litres of ethanol contracted by OMCs in 2024-25 ESY (Ethanol Supply Year November-October) and 330 crore litres of ethanol for alternative uses, there is a surplus of 450-plus crore litres of ethanol in the country.

Yields are set to improve. Sugarcane yields are expected to rise from the current 75 tonnes per hectare to 85 tonnes over the next decade, while maize yields could increase from 3.4-3.5 tonnes toward the global average of 6-7 tonnes per hectare.

However, Sinha stressed the need for price adjustments. ""If my input prices increase, there has to be a corresponding increase in the output price. Otherwise, it becomes very unviable."" Triveni was among pioneers in setting up multi-feed distilleries, enabling flexible feedstock conversion between sugary feedstocks like cane syrup B or C heavy molasses and grains such as maize and rice.

The company has secured approximately 80 per cent of its contracts with public sector and private oil marketing companies for ESY 25-26, and expects to reach 100 per cent capacity utilisation once the second cycle of ethanol tenders is announced.

""The country being a signatory to Corsia, and we believe that used cooking oil with a very fragmented supply chain in an unorganised sector will not be in a position to take India beyond one, two, three per cent numbers. Therefore, when the 5 per cent target comes into force 2030 onwards, we believe ethanol to jet would really be the right pathway,"" he said.

Triveni is among 2-3 Indian companies exploring SAF production facilities, though no formal board proposals have been submitted yet.

The company produces approximately 23-24 crore litres of ethanol annually, making it one of India's largest producers.

India's key strength lies in substantial ethanol surplus. With ethanol production capacity built for E30-E35 blending targets but current usage at E20, ample feedstock is available for alternative applications.

""The first big benefit is a surplus of ethanol. The capacity is already done,"" Sinha explained. ""India has capacities equivalent to support E30, E35 ethanol supply, which means we are in an oversupply situation.""

""SAF is not taking away too much ethanol. But the abundance of ethanol shows why India has that comparative advantage,"" Sinha noted.

With ethanol capacity built for higher blending but current usage at E20, the industry faces idle assets.

Sinha advocated for faster adoption of flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), calling for GST cuts and state-level benefits in road tax and registration to match electric vehicles.

""FFV is the right way forward. Give them greater attractiveness in terms of GST cuts and road tax and registration tax benefits,"" he said, suggesting a dual dispensing system offering E20 and E100 options.

""FFVs have been there in Brazil for very long. They have been extremely successful and in India we believe that would be the right pathway for enhancing offtake.""

He also pointed to ethanol-diesel blending up to 5 per cent, which has been successfully tested. ""Can we look at creating an ecosystem for safe usage of diesel blended with ethanol?""

On feedstock availability, Sinha expressed confidence that the sugar industry can supply around 500 crore litres even at demand levels of 900 crore litres, after accounting for potable and industrial uses.

Currently, India's total distillery capacity is approximately 1,900 crore litres, including 900 crore litres from sugar feedstock and 1,000 crore litres from grain feedstock. With 1,048 crore litres of ethanol contracted by OMCs in 2024-25 ESY (Ethanol Supply Year November-October) and 330 crore litres of ethanol for alternative uses, there is a surplus of 450-plus crore litres of ethanol in the country.

Yields are set to improve. Sugarcane yields are expected to rise from the current 75 tonnes per hectare to 85 tonnes over the next decade, while maize yields could increase from 3.4-3.5 tonnes toward the global average of 6-7 tonnes per hectare.

However, Sinha stressed the need for price adjustments. ""If my input prices increase, there has to be a corresponding increase in the output price. Otherwise, it becomes very unviable.""

Triveni was among pioneers in setting up multi-feed distilleries, enabling flexible feedstock conversion between sugary feedstocks like cane syrup B or C heavy molasses and grains such as maize and rice.

""That has helped us maximise utilisation of our distillation assets,"" Sinha said.

The company has secured approximately 80 per cent of its contracts with public sector and private oil marketing companies for ESY 25-26, and expects to reach 100 per cent capacity utilisation once the second cycle of ethanol tenders is announced.

Sinha believes India should leverage initiatives like the Global Biofuels Alliance to showcase its leadership in biofuels, with SAF ideally positioned for this role.

""The country being a signatory to Corsia, and we believe that used cooking oil with a very fragmented supply chain in an unorganised sector will not be in a position to take India beyond one, two, three per cent numbers. Therefore, when the 5 per cent target comes into force 2030 onwards, we believe ethanol to jet would really be the right pathway,"" he said.

At the global level, used cooking oil is being used for making SAF, especially in Europe and China, while others are looking at ethanol. The first SAF plant has been commercialised at Atlanta in the US.

""One of the differentiating factors of ethanol to jet is the benefit it brings to farmers in terms of rural prosperity, it enhances the farmer's income,"" Sinha said, highlighting socio-economic benefits beyond environmental gains.

India is poised to become a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) export hub, leveraging its significant ethanol surplus and lower carbon intensity compared to rivals. With potential SAF plants operational by 2029, India aims to supply Southeast Asia and the Middle East, capitalizing on its competitive advantages in ethanol production.

India is positioning itself as a potential export hub for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), leveraging surplus ethanol capacity and lower carbon intensity compared to rivals like Brazil, according to Sameer Sinha, CEO (Sugar Business) of Triveni Engineering and Industries Ltd.

In an interview with PTI, Sinha outlined India's competitive advantages in the emerging SAF market. The earliest alcohol-to-jet SAF plants could become operational by 2029, he projected, assuming policy clarity emerges by the end of the current financial year. Until then, India will rely on limited SAF production from used cooking oil for 1-2 per cent blending.

""India has very significant potential to emerge as an export hub for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. We can start exporting on the East Coast to Southeast Asian countries, where Singapore is a major aviation hub. Similarly, on the West Coast to countries like Dubai,"" said Sinha.

Triveni is among 2-3 Indian companies exploring SAF production facilities, though no formal board proposals have been submitted yet.

The company produces approximately 23-24 crore litres of ethanol annually, making it one of India's largest producers.

Live Events

India's key strength lies in substantial ethanol surplus. With ethanol production capacity built for E30-E35 blending targets but current usage at E20, ample feedstock is available for alternative applications.

""The first big benefit is a surplus of ethanol. The capacity is already done,"" Sinha explained. ""India has capacities equivalent to support E30, E35 ethanol supply, which means we are in an oversupply situation.""

More significantly, Indian sugarcane-derived ethanol has lower carbon intensity than Brazilian ethanol. ""If my CI number is lower than Brazil's, the pollution reduction is far larger if I use Indian ethanol versus Brazilian ethanol,"" he said.

""If you look at the US, unless it imports Brazilian 2G ethanol, it will largely be maize-driven SAF where carbon intensity will be very high. My carbon intensity of Indian sugarcane ethanol is the lowest. That's a very big advantage we bring to the table.""

Setting up an SAF facility with 80 tonne per day capacity would require about Rs 1,400 crore investment and 200 kg per day ethanol supply, Sinha said, and stressed that policy support is essential, including 100 per cent offtake guarantee, viable pricing, viability gap funding and preferential pricing for first movers.

""The earliest plant, from alcohol to jet, can come up in 2029. That big quantum jump will take place in 2029, when people would be available to produce SAF from ethanol,"" he said.

Five-year SAF demand for international flights is estimated at 50-60 crore litres, requiring 120 crore litres of ethanol -- a fraction of available surplus.

""SAF is not taking away too much ethanol. But the abundance of ethanol shows why India has that comparative advantage,"" Sinha noted.

With ethanol capacity built for higher blending but current usage at E20, the industry faces idle assets.

Sinha advocated for faster adoption of flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), calling for GST cuts and state-level benefits in road tax and registration to match electric vehicles.

""FFV is the right way forward. Give them greater attractiveness in terms of GST cuts and road tax and registration tax benefits,"" he said, suggesting a dual dispensing system offering E20 and E100 options.

""FFVs have been there in Brazil for very long. They have been extremely successful and in India we believe that would be the right pathway for enhancing offtake.""

He also pointed to ethanol-diesel blending up to 5 per cent, which has been successfully tested. ""Can we look at creating an ecosystem for safe usage of diesel blended with ethanol?""

On feedstock availability, Sinha expressed confidence that the sugar industry can supply around 500 crore litres even at demand levels of 900 crore litres, after accounting for potable and industrial uses.

Only then can African airlines transition from survival mode to sustainable profitability—and provide the connectivity on which the continent’s future depends.","The story of Africa’s air transport sector remains one of the great paradoxes of our time. A continent that hosts 18 percent of the world’s population accounts for barely 3 percent of global air passenger traffic.

Even more telling, three quarters of international passenger traffic into Africa is carried not by African airlines but by foreign carriers. This imbalance is not simply a market curiosity but a sign of deeper structural challenges.

Air transport is anything but a luxury. It is a lifeline for landlocked nations, a catalyst for tourism, a conduit for trade, and a bridge across a geography where road, rail, and marine infrastructure are often fragmented or underdeveloped. In short, aviation is a strategic enabler of integration and growth.

Yet African carriers continue to limp from year to year with margins so thin they barely amount to commercial viability. The latest financial outlook from the International Air Transport Association (Iata) underscores this reality.

It projects that African carriers will earn only $0.2 billion in profit in 2025 and 2026. This translates into net margins of 1.1 percent in 2025 and 1.0 percent in 2026—the lowest of any region worldwide.

Profit per passenger tells an even starker story: $1.40 in 2025 and $1.30 in 2026, compared with a global average of $7.90. African airlines are carrying more passengers, yet earning far too little from each seat.

This weakness is particularly troubling because underlying demand is robust. Passenger traffic is expected to grow by 6 percent in 2026, well above the global forecast of 4.4 percent. But capacity growth lags at 5.7 percent, constrained by older fleets, high financing costs, and limited liquidity. Africa is participating in the global aviation recovery, but without the financial stamina needed to sustain long-term growth.

The causes are structural. Africa has the highest operating costs of any aviation market globally, with cost per available tonne-kilometre nearly double the global average.

Fuel—already a major cost everywhere—is up to 20 percent more expensive in Africa due to taxes, storage fees, weak supply competition, and logistical inefficiencies. Ageing aircraft consume more fuel and require more maintenance, further inflating operating costs.

Read: African airlines brace for another year of thin margins as old challenges persist

Market fragmentation, reinforced by restrictive bilateral agreements and inconsistent visa regimes, suppresses intra-African travel and keeps airfares high in price-sensitive economies.

Taxes and charges, averaging 28 percent, compound the problem. These levies push ticket prices beyond the reach of ordinary travellers and erode airline margins.

Rising labour costs, airport fees, and the growing expense of sustainable aviation fuel add new pressures. Supply chain delays slow fleet renewal, leaving African airlines with some of the oldest aircraft in the global industry even as competitors modernise. Without deliberate action, they remain exposed to every shock — from fuel volatility to geopolitical disruption.

A reset is essential. Unless there is a decisive review of aviation taxes, charges, and the broader cost of doing business, Africa’s airlines will remain trapped in a cycle of underperformance. Governments must reassess aviation taxes, and liberalise market access to unlock meaningful economies of scale.

Accelerating open skies policy, modernising fleets through targeted incentives, and abandoning restrictive bilaterals would all reduce operating costs and stimulate traffic.

Only then can African airlines transition from survival mode to sustainable profitability—and provide the connectivity on which the continent’s future depends.",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/image/5296708/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/24670b5ec01e08ad6297a1fc0d54e5f0/XC/plane-1-.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 00:56:22.153936

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform’s low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (“LCA”) methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

“Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths – XCF’s production expertise, Southern’s developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset monetization capabilities – to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.”

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern’s planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern’s in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF’s HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

“We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.”

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern’s biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana’s growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern’s existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

“We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern’s developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.”

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

Dalam sambutannya, Wamenlu menyampaikan bahwa Indonesia terus berupaya mengimplementasikan standar keberlanjutan demi memajukan industri kelapa sawit. Kendati banyak tantangan dalam implementasinya, tetapi kita harus tetap optimis.

Dubes Arif mengungkapkan saat ini Indonesia masih bisa bernapas lega karena Uni Eropa masih menunda penerapan regulasi EUDR. Penundaan ini dilakukan setelah Uni Eropa juga mendapatkan desakan dari internal, termasuk diantaranya dari industri kendaraan. Sebagai informasi, regulasi keberlanjutan EUDR juga mengatur terkait peternakan.

Dengan adanya aturan EUDR, negara-negara di Eropa menolak hasil peternakan yang tidak lolos sertifikasi keberlanjutan. Di sisi lain, industri kendaraan yang membutuhkan bahan baku dari peternakan, kulit sapi untuk jok misalnya, akan kelimpungan dengan adanya aturan itu lantaran susah mendapatkan pasokan dan menaikkan harga bahan baku.

Sementara itu, Ditya Agung Nurdianto selaku Direktur Perdagangan Internasional Kemenlu menyampaikan kegiatan ini sebagai upaya untuk menyamakan persepsi tantangan yang dihadapi oleh petani kelapa sawit dan juga petani kakao dalam memenuhi standar keberanjutan internasional seperti EUDR.

The election is highly polarized and will determine the direction of the country amid growing concerns over security, migration, and economic stagnation.

Jeannette Jara represents the continuity of the leftwing Unity for Chile of incumbent President Gabriel Boric Font against the Republican (rightwing) José Antonio Kast, who is making his third attempt to reach La Moneda on his harsh stance regarding irregular migrants and also promising broad tax cuts.

Sunday's runoff follows the Nov. 16 elections, where former Labor Minister Jara secured approximately 27% of the vote, narrowly edging out former Congressman Kast, who finished with about 24%.

Both candidates have made security a central pillar, but with opposing approaches. Kast promises a hardline, “iron fist” strategy, including military deployment to troubled areas and harsher penalties. Jara focuses on strengthening the police, investing in the prison system, and cutting off the financial streams of organized crime.

On the economic front, Jara advocates for boosting social rights, raising the minimum wage, and implementing a more progressive tax system. Kast, an admirer of Argentine President Javier Milei, proposes a radical reduction in the State's size and lowering the tax burden on businesses.

Political analysts widely view the election as a contest between extremes. Despite Jara's narrow win in the first round, Kast is generally seen as the favorite, largely because other right-wing candidates who collectively took over 50% of the vote in the first round have endorsed him. His victory would mark the most significant conservative shift in Chile's leadership since the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990).

For the first time since 2012, voting is compulsory for most citizens, with fines imposed for non-voters. Over 15 million citizens are eligible to cast their ballots, with polls open from 8 am to 6 pm local time.

With the aviation industry under pressure to tackle climate change, these leading airlines are revolutionizing air travel by introducing groundbreaking green initiatives. This collaboration includes carbon offset programs, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and much more. By joining forces, these airlines are demonstrating a shared commitment to reducing emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices. Emirates, along with United, Delta, and Singapore Airlines, is setting a new benchmark for the industry, proving that sustainability and air travel can go hand in hand.

With carbon offsetting leading the way, these airlines are showing how the sector can evolve while keeping passengers and the planet in mind. The future of air travel has never looked so green!

Global Commitments: Airlines Pledge to Achieve Net-Zero Emissions by 2050

The aviation industry has a significant impact on global emissions, but many airlines are committed to reducing their environmental footprint. One of the most ambitious pledges is the Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 target, a commitment made by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This resolution, supported by most airlines, outlines a clear roadmap for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint to net-zero by the middle of the century. The commitment aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement and emphasizes the need for the industry to take proactive measures in combating climate change.

A Comprehensive Approach to Sustainability

IATA’s Fly Net Zero initiative highlights several strategies to reach this ambitious target:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): SAF is considered the most effective near-term solution for reducing aviation’s carbon emissions. It can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80%, depending on the type of feedstock used. SAF is seen as the cornerstone of the industry’s transition to greener operations, with major airlines ramping up their use of this fuel.

New Aircraft Technologies: The future of aviation is green, with new aircraft designs focusing on energy efficiency. Electric and hydrogen-powered planes are being tested, offering a glimpse into the future of aviation.

Operational Efficiency: Airlines are optimizing flight routes and adopting more efficient flight procedures to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Carbon Offsets and Removals: While airlines work on long-term solutions, carbon offset programs and direct air capture technologies are helping reduce the impact of current emissions.

These initiatives are part of a wider, global movement where airlines are looking at both short-term and long-term solutions to meet their sustainability goals. However, it’s not just about pledging to reduce emissions; it’s about actively making changes today that will have a lasting impact tomorrow.

Leading the Charge: Airlines with Innovative Green Initiatives

United Airlines: Pioneering SAF and Carbon Removal Technologies

United Airlines is one of the industry leaders in sustainable aviation practices. The airline has committed to reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Unlike some other airlines, United has made it clear that it will not rely solely on voluntary carbon credits. Instead, the airline is focusing on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), carbon removal technologies, and fleet renewal to achieve its environmental goals. United has formed partnerships with companies that specialize in Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies, which remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. These efforts place United at the forefront of aviation’s green revolution, ensuring the airline is investing in the right technologies for the future.

United’s goal is to reduce emissions through fuel efficiency and SAF procurement, ensuring that by 2030, more than 50% of its fuel will be sustainable. This proactive approach will significantly contribute to achieving its 2050 net-zero goal.

Delta Air Lines: Pushing the Boundaries of SAF Procurement

Another major player in the sustainability game is Delta Air Lines. Delta has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, with a focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Delta is tripling its annual SAF delivery volumes year-on-year and setting ambitious procurement targets for future years. The airline has also focused on fleet renewal by investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft and improving operational efficiencies to reduce fuel consumption.

Delta’s integration of SAF into its fuel supply is crucial to achieving its environmental targets. The airline is also expanding its SAF partnerships with companies like Neste and Shell Aviation, ensuring that it has a reliable supply of sustainable fuel to power its operations.

Singapore Airlines: Leading the Way in Passenger Carbon Offsetting

Singapore Airlines has launched a unique program that allows passengers to offset their carbon emissions when booking flights. Through their voluntary carbon offset program, passengers can purchase carbon credits that support verified sustainability projects, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative gives passengers a simple way to participate in sustainability efforts and play a role in mitigating the environmental impact of their travel.

This model is a great example of how airlines can integrate sustainability into the passenger experience, allowing individuals to contribute to environmental protection while continuing to enjoy air travel.

Emirates: Testing Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Pushing for Innovation

Emirates, one of the world’s largest international airlines, has made significant strides in advancing green aviation technologies. Emirates has conducted successful test flights using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in a bid to prove the viability of these fuels in large-scale operations. The airline has partnered with suppliers such as Neste and Shell Aviation to ensure the availability of SAF, allowing it to take practical steps toward reducing its emissions.

In addition to its commitment to SAF, Emirates is also focused on reducing fuel consumption through aircraft innovations and operational improvements. The airline has modernized its fleet, with newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, reducing emissions per passenger.

The Role of Carbon Offsetting Programs in Greener Aviation

CORSIA: A Global Regulatory Mechanism for Emissions Offsetting

The aviation industry has a global framework in place to monitor and manage emissions. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), led by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is an international initiative that aims to offset the growth in carbon emissions beyond 2020 levels. Under this scheme, airlines on participating international routes must purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions, ensuring that the sector does not contribute to the rise in global emissions.

CORSIA is essential for providing a standardized global approach to emissions management, helping airlines to take part in a collective effort to reduce their environmental impact while continuing to serve global travel needs.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): The Game Changer for the Aviation Industry

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely regarded as the most effective solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint in the near term. SAF is produced from sustainable resources such as algae, plant oils, or waste products, and can be blended with traditional jet fuel to reduce the carbon emissions associated with flying.

SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80%, and it is already being used by many leading airlines, including United Airlines, Delta, and Emirates. However, the widespread adoption of SAF faces some challenges, including high production costs and limited supply. Nevertheless, with continued investment in SAF infrastructure and government incentives, this fuel type is set to become the dominant source of aviation fuel in the coming decades.

The Future of Green Aviation: A Collective Responsibility

The future of aviation is green. Airlines worldwide are making significant strides toward reducing their environmental impact, but achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require continued innovation, collaboration, and commitment. It will require not just airlines, but also governments, fuel producers, and passengers to contribute to this collective effort.

While the path to greener aviation is not without its challenges, the progress made by major airlines such as United, Delta, and Singapore Airlines proves that it is possible to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without sacrificing the benefits of global connectivity. With Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), carbon offsetting programs, and innovative technologies such as direct air capture (DAC), the aviation industry is moving closer to a future where air travel is both sustainable and accessible.

Airlines must continue to invest in cleaner technologies, sustainable fuel sources, and offset programs to ensure that their emissions are effectively managed. Meanwhile, passengers have a vital role to play in supporting these initiatives through their choices, whether by choosing airlines with strong sustainability records or by contributing to carbon offset programs.

The transition to greener air travel is not just an industry initiative; it is a global movement. By working together, airlines, governments, and travellers can ensure that the skies remain a place of opportunity for generations to come, all while protecting the planet.

The Path Ahead for Green Aviation

As we look to the future, the aviation industry’s commitment to sustainability will continue to evolve. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), carbon offset programs, and technological innovations will all play a crucial role in reducing emissions and achieving net-zero by 2050. The efforts of airlines like United, Delta, and Emirates serve as a model for others to follow, showing that a sustainable future for aviation is not just possible, but within reach.

With industry and government collaboration, the aviation sector can meet the growing demand for travel while reducing its environmental footprint, creating a cleaner, greener future for the skies.

The flight is scheduled to run twice a week in 2026. The service is reshaping expectations for ultra-long-haul travel and highlights how aircraft and airline planning are evolving to connect distant corners of the globe.

What makes it the longest, and how it compares

The Shanghai-Buenos Aires service departs from Shanghai Pudong International Airport and arrives at Buenos Aires’ Ezeiza International Airport after a stop in Auckland, New Zealand, for refuelling and crew rotation. The total distance covered is more than 20,000 kilometres, and the entire journey takes around 26 to 29 hours, depending on winds and routing. Despite the stop in Auckland, the flight retains the same aircraft and flight number throughout, classifying it as a direct flight under aviation definitions.

Before this route debuted, the longest scheduled nonstop commercial flights were services such as Singapore Airlines’ Singapore-New York route covering roughly 15,300 kilometres in about 18 hours and 40 minutes.

Another historic benchmark in aviation was Air Tahiti Nui’s flight between Tahiti and Paris in 2020, which briefly held the record for the longest distance nonstop by a commercial passenger service at over 15,700 kilometres.

Fuel and sustainability considerations

Airlines and manufacturers have been gradually extending the practical limits of long-haul air travel thanks to advances in aircraft design, fuel efficiency and operational planning. Aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER used by China Eastern on the new route offer the range and payload capability needed for transcontinental services, even if they require a refuelling stop on extreme distances. Ultra-long-haul routes naturally demand large amounts of jet fuel, and airlines and manufacturers are increasingly focused on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other technologies to lower emissions.

Sustainable aviation fuel is widely seen as a key tool in lowering aviation emissions, with the potential to cut lifecycle carbon output by as much as 80% compared with traditional jet fuel, depending on how it is produced. In September 2024, China Eastern introduced a series of sustainability-focused flights powered by SAF, highlighting both the fuel’s practical use in commercial operations and the airline’s broader environmental goals. For the ultra-long-haul service operated by the Boeing 777-300ER, the aircraft currently flies primarily on conventional Jet A-1 fuel, with SAF used only where available and blended in limited proportions.

Operationally, long distances mean careful flight planning, crew scheduling and payload management to balance passenger comfort, range and environmental impact.

KLM views the national SAF fund as a mechanism to align with European initiatives, such as the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), and make ‘SAF Made in Holland’ a reality.
Accelerating Production and Access to Raw Materials: The fund should improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove obstacles to building necessary infrastructure, accelerating domestic production scale-up.
The airline proposed that the fund could be financed through revenues generated by the existing Dutch aviation tax, ensuring Dutch aviation takes the lead in scaling up alternative fuels and keeps the 2030 blend ambition within reach.","Airline giant KLM is strongly backing the recommendation from the recent Wennink report, ‘The Route to Future Prosperity’, which calls on the Dutch government to establish a national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) fund. KLM argues that such a fund is necessary to accelerate the domestic production of alternative aviation fuels, make them more affordable, and fast-track the sector’s sustainability, reports news.klm.

KLM CEO Marjan Rintel emphasized that meaningful progress requires collaboration and a more active government role.

“Real progress can only be achieved if government and industry work together and if the government takes a more active role. KLM urges policymakers to adopt this recommendation,” she stated.

KLM fully supports the report’s conclusion that aviation is vital for safeguarding prosperity and maintaining the Netherlands’ position as an innovative ecosystem. The airline stressed that the industry, centered around Schiphol Airport, is crucial for the nation’s economic strength, trade, employment, and international competitiveness.

“It is therefore vital that we invest collectively in a future-proof aviation sector rather than restrict it or impose additional national charges. Doing so would undermine the Netherlands’ competitive position and the global connectivity on which our prosperity depends,” the company warned.

KLM confirmed it is heavily investing in cleaner operations, noting that SAF is currently one of the most effective ways to reduce aviation CO₂ emissions, achieving at least a 65% reduction across its lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuel.

The airline already blends more SAF than mandated by European regulations and has committed to a long-term purchasing agreement to support the development of the Netherlands’ first dedicated SAF production facility in Delfzijl. However, to meet the national goal of a 14% SAF blend by 2030, these fuels must become more widely available and significantly more affordable. KLM argued that government investment, similar to support provided for wind and solar energy, is essential.

KLM views the national SAF fund as a mechanism to align with European initiatives, such as the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), and make ‘SAF Made in Holland’ a reality. The airline recommends the fund focus on three key areas:

Making SAF Affordable for Airlines: The fund should bridge the current price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene using incentives. KLM estimates that an annual investment of €60 million could increase the SAF blend by an additional one percent.

Accelerating Production and Access to Raw Materials: The fund should improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove obstacles to building necessary infrastructure, accelerating domestic production scale-up.

Investing in Innovation: Support should be channeled into developing next-generation technologies like e-SAF, positioning the Netherlands as a European leader in innovation.

The major success is attributed to the dedication of the Gamleby team to drive change.
Hearing the news about the grant made the result even better, but we would have continued regardless,” said Henrik Nilsson, Industrial Engineer at Saab’s Barracuda facility.
“The success here has really grown the enthusiasm across the Barracuda team and wider Saab.","The Barracuda facility in Gamleby, which manufactures camouflage for Saab, has achieved a massive reduction in its carbon footprint by introducing a biogas system into its production process. This single change is projected to fulfill nearly 50% of Saab’s overall company-wide carbon dioxide (CO₂) reduction target for 2025 while also increasing the security of the factory’s energy supply, reports SAAB.

The shift to biogas effectively cuts the Barracuda facility’s total CO₂ emissions by 65% and creates opportunities for further environmental improvements in the future.

When the Saab Barracuda management team first began exploring ways to reduce their emissions, few expected that one modification could be so transformative. The major success is attributed to the dedication of the Gamleby team to drive change.

“This was our strategy and our goal from the beginning. We want Saab to be a leader in sustainability, but we also wanted Barracuda to set the example within the company. We moved forward with this project because we believed in it, and we managed to secure the necessary support,” explained Charlotta Fridell, Production Manager at Saab Barracuda in Gamleby.

Manufacturing camouflage is a process that requires a lot of energy and heat. The process involves heating two boilers, which are now powered by biogas but previously used liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This heat is then used to dry the camouflage material.

This heating process previously generated 1,250 tonnes of CO₂ annually. With the switch to biogas, the process now creates almost zero direct emissions.

Beyond the reduction at the factory, the move improves overall environmental performance because the old LPG had to be transported to Sweden by ship from Eastern Europe, generating large emissions throughout the delivery process. The new biogas, however, is produced locally in Sweden. Some of the organic waste used to create the gas even comes from the nearby town of Västervik, making it a truly local and sustainable supply chain that also enhances energy security.

The team started looking into biogas after securing funding from Saab’s internal Climate Fund for initial studies in 2022. They later learned from Västervik Council that a grant from the Swedish climate organization, Klimatklivet, might also be possible.

“We committed to the project in the third quarter of 2024, before we received confirmation from Klimatklivet that we would get the grant. Hearing the news about the grant made the result even better, but we would have continued regardless,” said Henrik Nilsson, Industrial Engineer at Saab’s Barracuda facility.

Planning began shortly after, and the new biogas system was successfully installed over a six-week period during the summer production break in 2025. This allowed production to resume on schedule, a key factor for management.

Now, the Barracuda team is already looking ahead, investigating the feasibility of capturing the excess energy from the production process to heat the rest of the factory, as well as finding spaces to install solar panels for further gains.

“The success here has really grown the enthusiasm across the Barracuda team and wider Saab. This is something we needed to do to contribute to Saab’s environmental goals, but also something we wanted to do as an example to others of what is possible. It was a real team effort from Saab management, the environment team, and those involved in production here in Gamleby,” Ms. Fridell concluded.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biogas-14.png,N,,2025-12-13 10:56:37.262013

According to the U.S. Forest Service census of our forests, our forests had 630 million tons of standing timber in 1970.
Today, according to that same census, Arkansas forests boast a hefty 1.1 billion tons of standing timber.
According to the Arkansas Division of Forestry, each year our forests grow by more than 50 million tons, while all harvests and removals are 27 million tons.
Enter Arkansas' forest industry.","Arkansas' forests are overweight and becoming more obese every year.

According to the U.S. Forest Service census of our forests, our forests had 630 million tons of standing timber in 1970. Today, according to that same census, Arkansas forests boast a hefty 1.1 billion tons of standing timber. We have added about 10 percent to our forest land, but that still represents a whopping weight gain.

The growth of our forests isn't slowing down ... yet. According to the Arkansas Division of Forestry, each year our forests grow by more than 50 million tons, while all harvests and removals are 27 million tons.

That means every year, our forests are increasing their stocking by about 23 million tons. Our forests are becoming unhealthy.

My cardiologist tells me that I cannot keep gaining weight every year or I'll have some real health problems. Forests don't have heart attacks, but they are subject to insects, diseases and fires that can ravage the landscape and peoples' lives.

Check the news about forests out west -- pine beetles and wildfires are on the upswing.

Enter Arkansas' forest industry. It supports more than 50,000 jobs in the state and represents nearly 4.1 percent of our state's economy -- all on a renewable resource that supports wildlife, clean water and some of the best recreation in the nation. You can think of the forest industry as a way of ""exercising"" our forest and managing its health.

Yes, we obtain products and jobs from our forests, but forest managers are most concerned with promoting the sustainability and health of our forests.

The money and jobs are really a side benefit of good forest management. The voluntary adoption of sustainability standards is just one demonstration of the forest industry's commitment to the long-term health of our forests.

But our forests are outgrowing our industry. There is more forestland than we can effectively manage. If this continues, Mother Nature -- in the form of insects, diseases, fires and climate events -- will rebalance the scale. It is inevitable. And while some might think that Mother Nature knows best, the side effects of insects, disease, fires and storm-damaged forests is incredibly detrimental to Arkansans. Ask the good folks of Paradise, Calif., where the 2018 Camp Fire killed more than 85 people and displaced about 50,000, how they feel about uncontrolled wildfire.

A TALE OF TWO FUTURES

One future has us staying the course towards forest catastrophe. In this future, Arkansas' rural towns lose their paper mills and sawmills, leaving forest landowners without affordable ways to manage the health of their forests. Dense forests are feeding grounds for bark beetles and diseases. Dying and dead forests are vulnerable for wildfires. Homes, property, whole towns and lives are lost. Again, I refer the reader to recent events in the forests of the American West.

Another future supports our forest industry with innovative and forward-thinking policy. The most critical need is a market for small-diameter trees that landowners typically send to paper mills or use for products such as wood pellets for energy. Potential markets for this small-diameter wood include emerging technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuel, and existing technologies, such as combined heat and power or combined natural gas and wood pellets.

The advantage of using renewable wood for energy production is clear. It provides rural jobs in communities already dependent on our forest. At the same time, it gives landowners tools to improve the health of their forest and produces more wildlife habitat, clean air and clean water. The landowners and communities also get the side benefit of jobs and income.

These infrastructural characteristics can limit the types of aircraft that can be deployed efficiently. In this context, turboprop aircraft offer performance features - such as effective take-off and landing capabilities on shorter runways - that make them particularly suitable for regional networks. As a result, they play a central role in ensuring stable and reliable connectivity across a wide range of territories.

These aircrafts have been around for many years: they have propellers in front of their engines and create speed and power by directly spinning the blades. In contrast, a jet engine creates a blast of air which passes behind the plane and pushes it forward.

Turboprop engines produce high thrust at lower speeds making them efficient to take off and land on much smaller airstrips.

That’s just one of the reasons why they have become an increasingly popular option with airlines. In recent years, the turboprop has also gained renewed attention for its suitability in supporting regional mobility strategies.

Lower Altitudes Needed

Turboprop engines generate thrust by driving the propeller. This allows maximum thrust to be achieved at much lower revs than jet engines. Jets create thrust by pushing air out the back; the faster they turn, the more air, or thrust, is generated.

Turboprop aircraft fly at a lower speed and lower altitude compared to similar size jets. This makes them perfect for regional connectivity.

Maintenance

Turboprop aircraft burn less fuel than similar size jet aircraft. They have fewer moving parts compared to traditional jet (turbofan) engines, which can simplify some aspects of maintenance.

Fuel Usage

Because turboprop engines produce thrust efficiently at lower RPM and are optimized for lower-speed flight, they consume significantly less fuel than comparable jets.

It’s similar to driving a car—pushing for higher speeds uses more fuel. This efficiency improves operational performance and helps airlines open additional regional routes, supporting better access for smaller communities.

Improved Sustainability

The aviation industry is working toward having net-zero emissions by 2050. It’s a challenge, but it could make a dramatic difference to the amount of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere.

Using turboprop aircraft for regional flights reduces fuel usage as we just said and, therefore, emissions. In addition, some aircraft manufacturers, such as ATR, already offer turboprop planes which can use 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ATR completed the first successful commercial flight using 100% SAF in 2022 proving that new technology can be achieved without expensive modifications.

By adopting solutions such as turboprops capable of SAF operations, airlines contribute to the sector’s ongoing progress toward decarbonisation, supporting efforts already underway across the industry.

Airlines which have switched to turboprop aircraft for regional flights are benefiting from cost savings and reducing environmental damage. These, and the above factors, make regional flights attractive to customers. In turn, this makes the airline’s investment valid, effectively regenerating regional connectivity and making smaller cities more connected.",https://www.bbntimes.com/images/ATR_Turboprop_Aircraft_-_Flight.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 11:56:58.956016

Conclusion The IATA outlook positions 2026 as a year of consolidation rather than acceleration — profitability is holding steady, but margins remain thin.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released its latest global airline industry outlook, projecting a stabilised yet record-breaking year for airline profitability in 2026, with combined net profits estimated at USD 41 billion, up from USD 39.5 billion in 2025. Despite this growth, the net profit margin will hold steady at 3.9 per cent , underscoring a cautiously optimistic trajectory for the sector.

According to the forecast, airlines are expected to report USD 72.8 billion in operating profit, with an operating margin of 6.9 per cent , driven by steady demand, cost discipline, and resilient travel appetite. However, return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to remain below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) at 6.8 per cent vs 8.2 per cent , reflecting structural profitability challenges.

Advt

Total industry revenues are forecast to reach USD 1.053 trillion, while passenger numbers will rise to 5.2 billion, up 4.4 per cent year-on-year. Cargo volumes are expected to expand 2.4 per cent to 71.6 million tonnes, supported by robust e-commerce and semiconductor-related shipments.

Willie Walsh, Director General, IATA, said:

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9 per cent net margin and a USD 41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds the industry faces — rising costs, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain bottlenecks. Airlines have built shock-absorbing resilience that is now delivering stable profitability.”

Walsh also highlighted persistent imbalance within the aviation value chain, noting that while airlines form the backbone of global connectivity and economic activity, their margins remain far below those of other sectors.

“Airlines underpin nearly 4 per cent of the global economy and support 87 million jobs, yet industry-level margins remain minimal. The sector’s potential could be even greater if profitability across the value chain were more equitably distributed.”

Revenue and Cost Outlook

Passenger revenues are projected to rise 4.8 per cent to USD 751 billion, with load factors at a record 83.8 per cent .

Advt

Cargo revenue will reach USD 158 billion, driven by time-sensitive shipments and e-commerce.

Ancillary revenues will grow 5.5 per cent to USD 145 billion, accounting for 14 per cent of total revenue.

Fuel costs are expected to dip slightly to USD 252 billion, comprising 25.7 per cent of total operating expenses.

Labour costs will remain high, forming 28 per cent of the cost base, as wage growth continues to outpace inflation.

The industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) spend is projected to reach USD 4.5 billion, representing 0.8 per cent of total fuel use, while CORSIA compliance costs will grow to USD 1.7 billion.

Regional Performance

Europe will remain the most profitable region, with USD 14 billion in net profit and a 4.9 per cent margin.

North America will post USD 11.3 billion in profit, maintaining 3.4 per cent margins despite domestic slowdowns.

Asia Pacific is expected to record USD 6.6 billion, led by strong recovery in China and India.

Middle East carriers will continue to lead in margin performance at 9.3 per cent , reflecting their hub strength.

Latin America and Africa will post smaller but positive results, at USD 2 billion and USD 0.2 billion, respectively.

Air Cargo and Resilience

Air cargo continues to outperform expectations, supported by flexible routing amid trade shifts and tariff-driven demand realignment. Walsh described air freight as “the hero of global trade,” citing its critical role in maintaining supply continuity amid economic and geopolitical turbulence.

Traveller Sentiment

An IATA global survey found 97 per cent of travellers satisfied with their last air travel experience, with 88 per cent agreeing that aviation enhances quality of life. Most respondents recognised air connectivity as vital to the economy and sustainable development, reinforcing the industry’s social and economic importance.

Conclusion

The IATA outlook positions 2026 as a year of consolidation rather than acceleration — profitability is holding steady, but margins remain thin. With supply chain constraints, infrastructure costs, and regulatory burdens persisting, airlines must balance stability with strategic efficiency to sustain long-term growth.

A team of researchers from Tohoku University found that the rare-earth element europium (Eu) was the key to controlling the selectivity of this reaction for C1 or C2+ products.
At low Eu concentrations, certain bonds are weakened that lead to C-C coupling and produce C2+ via the frustrated deep hydrogenation of *CHO.
For high Eu concentrations, certain bonds become strengthened instead, which facilitates the deep hydrogenation of *CHO to CH4 via the C1 pathway.
This research provides a design concept for ""dialing in"" desired carbon products from CO2 using earth-abundant Cu-based catalysts and rare-earth promoters.","The electrochemical CO2 (carbon dioxide) reduction reaction takes harmful pollutants and transforms them into valuable products like fuel. However, selectively tailoring various processes in this reaction to successfully and efficiently arrive at a particular desired outcome remains a challenge.

""We want to be able to tailor this reaction so we can accurately predict what the result will be each time—and to control what that result is,"" explains Hao Li (Distinguished Professor, Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR)).

A team of researchers from Tohoku University found that the rare-earth element europium (Eu) was the key to controlling the selectivity of this reaction for C1 or C2+ products. Their findings are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

When atomic Eu was incorporated into Cu2O, it was able to shift the dominant product depending on whether Eu concentration was high or low. For example, low Eu-doped Cu2O achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 80% for C2+ products, while higher Eu doping tips the pathway toward C1 products such as CH4.

Theoretical calculations and other observations imply that the mechanism behind this involves the way Eu facilitates different reactions depending on its concentration.

At low Eu concentrations, certain bonds are weakened that lead to C-C coupling and produce C2+ via the frustrated deep hydrogenation of *CHO. For high Eu concentrations, certain bonds become strengthened instead, which facilitates the deep hydrogenation of *CHO to CH4 via the C1 pathway.

This work establishes a clear, intrinsic mechanism for switching between C1 and C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction by using Eu as an electronic modulator in Cu2O-based catalysts.

Air travel is entering a transformative phase. A new industry-backed study reveals that hydrogen-powered aviation could significantly reduce emissions while allowing global air travel to grow responsibly. For travelers, this signals a future of cleaner flights without limiting mobility.

The research highlights how hydrogen propulsion, when combined with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), could reshape the European and UK aviation landscape. This transition supports climate goals while protecting travel connectivity across borders.

Why Hydrogen Matters for Travelers

Hydrogen-powered aircraft produce zero carbon emissions at the point of use. This makes them especially important for travelers concerned about environmental impact. Government climate agencies across Europe, including those aligned with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, continue to prioritize low-carbon transport solutions.

For passengers, this means future flights could feel familiar while being far cleaner. Routes remain open. Destinations stay accessible. The difference lies in what powers the journey.

Strategic Airports Could Lead the Change

The study suggests that hydrogen infrastructure does not need to be everywhere at once. Instead, focusing on around 20 major European airports could deliver more than 80 percent of the total emissions benefit.

Airports such as London Heathrow are already preparing for next-generation fuels. Government-backed airport transition programs emphasize safety, efficiency, and phased implementation. For travelers, this means early hydrogen-powered routes are likely to appear at major international hubs first.

What This Means for European Travel Routes

Popular short- and medium-haul routes are expected to benefit first. These are often the most traveled corridors for tourism and business. Hydrogen-powered aircraft are particularly well-suited for these distances.

Tourists flying between European capitals or regional cultural centers may be among the first to experience hydrogen-supported travel. Over time, route availability is expected to expand as infrastructure grows.

Supporting Growth Without Limiting Travel

One key takeaway is that hydrogen does not restrict aviation growth. Instead, it supports it. The study shows that earlier adoption leads to greater long-term carbon savings.

From a traveler’s perspective, this reassures frequent flyers that sustainability does not mean fewer choices. Governments supporting innovation through funding programs and fuel incentives help airlines invest without raising barriers for passengers.

Collaboration Behind the Scenes

The research draws on advanced airline behavior modeling developed by academic aviation labs. These models simulate how airlines respond to fuel costs, incentives, and emerging technologies.

This approach aligns closely with government transport research standards used across the UK and EU. The findings reinforce the importance of coordinated action between airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and regulators.

A Gradual but Meaningful Transition

Hydrogen aircraft will not replace today’s fleets overnight. Officials stress that efficiency improvements and SAF remain crucial in the near term. Hydrogen becomes increasingly valuable as infrastructure matures.

For travelers, this means a gradual shift. Flights become cleaner step by step. Airports adapt quietly in the background. The travel experience remains smooth.

What Travelers Can Expect Next

Government climate roadmaps indicate that pilot hydrogen routes could emerge in the 2030s. Travelers booking European trips later this decade may begin seeing hydrogen-supported flights offered on select routes.

Clear labeling, safety certification, and international standards will guide public adoption. Aviation regulators emphasize that passenger safety remains the highest priority throughout this transition.

The Bigger Picture for Global Tourism

Cleaner aviation supports sustainable tourism growth. Destinations remain reachable without increasing environmental pressure. Hydrogen-powered aviation helps preserve cultural travel, international exchange, and global mobility.

For travelers planning future journeys, this innovation represents progress without compromise.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5nov7-7.jpeg,N,,2025-12-13 10:57:07.035317

According to KLM, SAF could reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint by up to 65% compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.
KLM’s proposal for a national SAF fund is designed to subsidize SAF production, bringing it closer to cost parity with traditional jet fuels.
The Netherlands’ tourism sector stands to benefit greatly from this transition to more sustainable aviation fuels.
As tourism worldwide seeks solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of travel, the Netherlands is positioning itself as a forward-thinking leader in sustainable tourism.","The tourism industry in the Netherlands is on the brink of a sustainability revolution, thanks to a bold proposal from KLM, the country’s flagship airline. In a bid to reduce aviation emissions and make travel greener, KLM has urged the Dutch government to invest in a national fund for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The call comes at a critical time, as the global tourism market increasingly favours environmentally responsible travel options. The move could also significantly enhance the tourism experience in cities like Amsterdam, known for its rich culture and eco-conscious initiatives.

As the world grapples with climate change, airlines and destinations alike are seeking ways to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining essential global connectivity. SAF, which is made from sustainable feedstocks like waste oils and agricultural residues, has been hailed as a key solution for achieving greener air travel. According to KLM, SAF could reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint by up to 65% compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel. By urging the Dutch government to boost SAF production, KLM is not just advocating for a cleaner future but also reinforcing the Netherlands’ position as a leader in sustainable tourism.

The government’s role is crucial in scaling up the production and use of SAF. KLM’s proposal for a national SAF fund is designed to subsidize SAF production, bringing it closer to cost parity with traditional jet fuels. The Dutch government has already made strides toward incorporating sustainable aviation technologies into the broader transportation strategy, but KLM’s push for increased investment represents a call to action. The government’s commitment to financing SAF production would help make cleaner travel options more affordable for airlines, eventually lowering the costs for tourists.

The Netherlands’ tourism sector stands to benefit greatly from this transition to more sustainable aviation fuels. Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, one of Europe’s busiest and most iconic travel hubs, could serve as a model for green airports worldwide. By increasing the availability of SAF, Schiphol and other Dutch airports would offer visitors the option of flying with significantly reduced emissions, making the Netherlands an even more appealing destination for eco-conscious travellers.

This move is aligned with EU climate goals that aim to decarbonize the aviation sector by increasing the use of renewable fuels. The European Union has set ambitious targets to increase the share of SAF in aviation fuel consumption, aiming for a 5% SAF mix by 2030. The Netherlands, with its strong focus on sustainability and green innovation, has an opportunity to lead by example. A national SAF fund could not only help the country meet these targets but also attract international attention as a hub for sustainable tourism.

Additionally, the Dutch tourism sector could benefit from a stronger tourism brand tied to sustainability. Tourists are becoming increasingly mindful of their environmental impact, and those travelling to the Netherlands could be more inclined to choose this eco-friendly destination if they know their flights are powered by renewable fuels. The proposed SAF fund would ensure that this growing trend of sustainable tourism continues, positioning the Netherlands as a leader in responsible travel.

In line with KLM’s request, the proposed investment in SAF could help the Netherlands build a robust sustainable fuel infrastructure that supports both domestic and international tourism. By securing funding for this critical resource, the Dutch government would not only be supporting its aviation industry but also promoting eco-friendly travel options for tourists. The sustainability push in aviation could also encourage more businesses in the tourism sector to adopt green practices, further boosting the country’s reputation as an eco-conscious destination.

As tourism worldwide seeks solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of travel, the Netherlands is positioning itself as a forward-thinking leader in sustainable tourism. KLM’s call for a national SAF fund is not just about aviation—it’s about creating a more sustainable, competitive, and attractive travel destination for the modern, eco-conscious traveller. The future of tourism in the Netherlands looks greener than ever, thanks to the collective efforts of KLM and the Dutch government working together to achieve a cleaner, more sustainable travel experience.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/KLM-Royal-Dutch-Airlines-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 10:57:14.944631

Despite these extreme difficulties, SABR stayed busy and the industry saw some important advocacy wins.","On Feb. 29, 1968, the Beatles won the Grammy Award for album of the year with “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” But something else happened that Leap Day that was an even bigger blessing to the Jobe family—my cousin Angie was born. We are 11 months apart and are still more like siblings than cousins. She likes to quip that she is just a teenager since she has technically only had 14 birthdays. The Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners Coalition (SABR) just celebrated our second official birthday—and while we weren’t founded on Leap Day, we share something in common with Angie: We’re a bit older than our birthday count suggests. In reality, SABR has existed in one form or another for nearly six years.

SABR incorporated as a 501(c)(6) biodiesel trade association in September 2023 with about 20 organizational members, and now we have more than 70, including some of the most seasoned veterans in the industry. This includes Pacific Biodiesel, the first dedicated biodiesel company in the U.S., celebrating 30 years in the industry this year—a milestone I will hit in a little over a year. Other biofuel trade associations represent a broader constituency of advanced biofuels, which is fine. But SABR is a more focused group representing biodiesel stakeholders. This includes every link in the biodiesel value chain: soybean growers and processors, biodiesel producers, glycerin refiners, input suppliers, distributors and retailers. Our truck stop members buy and sell about half of all the biodiesel sold in the U.S.

SABR encourages growth in all biofuels, but we support policies that cause the new fuels, like renewable diesel (RD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to grow the RFS rather than displace existing biofuels in the program. And SABR supports all feedstocks, but we are unapologetically pro–soybean farmer—the folks who invested their time, talent and treasure to build the biodiesel industry in the first place. Our narrow mission is to pursue corrections to policies that improperly disadvantage biodiesel as a fuel and soy as a feedstock. We seek to level the playing field for biodiesel and soy that has been improperly tilted by flawed policies that are neither feedstock- nor technology-neutral.

SABR has its origins in 2019 when many in the industry and NGOs began lauding the California LCFS as the template for state carbon policy. On behalf of a group of biodiesel clients, I wrote a white paper in an attempt to persuade our peers in the industry that this was a flawed approach. California policy is anti-agriculture, with multiple layers of “guardrails” to penalize crop-based feedstocks. It also contains flawed policies that improperly advantage renewable diesel over biodiesel. Biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel, which makes it combust more efficiently, giving it a better health and emissions profile. Biodiesel further exhibits premium diesel characteristics that provide performance, safety and maintenance benefits. These issues are detailed in the white paper titled “Renewable Diesel and California LCFS Impacts to Soybean Industry,” which is available at sabrcoalition.org under the news tab.

Because the California LCFS falls under the umbrella of the RFS, California policy does not generate any additional demand over what would otherwise be generated by the RFS. It simply dictates where the volumes are consumed and under what policy conditions—favoring renewable diesel from non-soy feedstocks. In 2019, there were approximately 500 million gallons per year of biomass-based diesel sold in California. The white paper predicted that this volume would increase at an accelerating rate and result in a cascade of petroleum refinery conversion projects to renewable diesel, and that this phenomenon would have negative impacts on soy biodiesel in other parts of the country by non-soy renewable diesel in California. That is exactly what happened. Biomass-based diesel in California is now 2 billion to 2.5 billion gallons per year, and very little of it is biodiesel or soy-based. That amounts to roughly half of the RFS. And that portion continues to grow at an accelerated rate as the three other western-tier states come online that have adopted California-style LCFS.

SABR spent a good deal of time in 2024 trying to persuade groups that without one more extension of the biodiesel blenders tax credit in order to buy time to fix the new and very flawed 45Z credit, and get a proposed and final rule in place, 2025 would be an extremely difficult year. Some groups argued that an extension of the blenders credit was not needed because we had 45Z in place and that it was operative, pointing to a Jan. 10, 2025, IRS bulletin. But that was not a final rule—it wasn’t even a proposed rule. Rather, it was a “notice of intent to propose a rule.” Indeed, we are now in December and 2025 volumes have been about half of the previous year’s, back to 2011 rates. The policy uncertainty was in triplicate: tepid RVOs, the lapse of the biodiesel blenders tax credit and the lack of implementing regulations for 45Z. In 2025, some companies went under; others shut down or ran at a fraction of their capacity at a loss. The economic harm has been devastating.

Despite these extreme difficulties, SABR stayed busy and the industry saw some important advocacy wins. There were significant shared victories among all of the biofuel groups working on them, including the dropping of ILUC penalties from 45Z and robust proposed RVOs for 2026 and 2027. There were several key victories in which SABR played a leading role—often working alongside a handful of close partners—to help push important provisions across the finish line. These included securing SAF parity in 45Z, achieving partial transition relief through the extension of the small agri-biodiesel credit—which doubled its value and made it transferable—and advancing a proposal to correct inflated equivalence values for RD, SAF and naphtha in the EPA’s proposed rule. SABR also collaborated with soybean farmer allies in supporting the half RIN on imported feedstocks, adding an important voice to a unified effort.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Joe_Jobe_26ae6188bb.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 02:56:12.325143

Republic Airways, where Bedford was CEO before joining the FAA, completed a merger with Mesa Air Group on November 25, 2025.
Cantwell’s letter noted that timing and the recent merger could have increased the value of Bedford’s holdings, raising further questions about why the divestiture has not been completed.
Bedford has previously pledged to divest the holdings and recuse himself from matters affecting Republic Airways until that process is complete.
Cantwell’s letter ties into broader concerns about FAA leadership credibility and public trust in the agency’s oversight.","The head of the US Federal Aviation Administration has been accused of violating his ethics agreement by failing to divest a multimillion-dollar stake in an airline he once led, drawing criticism from a senior lawmaker and raising fresh questions about potential conflicts at the helm of the United States’ top aviation safety regulator.

Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, wrote to FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford saying he promised during his confirmation process to sell all his shares in Republic Airways within 90 days of taking office but has failed to do so more than 150 days later. Bedford’s financial disclosures showed his holdings in the regional carrier were worth between $6 million and $30 million at the time he was confirmed.

In a December 8, 2025, letter from the Office of Government Ethics to Cantwell’s committee, regulators noted that Bedford sought to amend his original ethics agreement to extend the divestiture timeline, but the request was denied because it did not meet the standards for such changes. The ethics office also said it has not been informed that Bedford has divested his Republic stock and told Transportation Department ethics officials to emphasize his personal responsibility to avoid any actions that could create a conflict of interest.

Cantwell’s letter says the ongoing failure to divest violates the commitments Bedford made when he was confirmed as FAA chief, a role in which he oversees critical aspects of US aviation safety and regulation. “It appears you continue to retain significant equity in this conflicting asset months past the deadline set to fully divest from Republic, which constitutes a clear violation of your ethics agreement,” she wrote, calling for a full accounting of his actions.

Republic Airways, where Bedford was CEO before joining the FAA, completed a merger with Mesa Air Group on November 25, 2025. Under the merger deal, Republic shareholders now own about 88% of the combined company, which operates a fleet of more than 300 Embraer jets under contracts with legacy airlines. Cantwell’s letter noted that timing and the recent merger could have increased the value of Bedford’s holdings, raising further questions about why the divestiture has not been completed.

Bedford has previously pledged to divest the holdings and recuse himself from matters affecting Republic Airways until that process is complete. But as of mid-December 2025, that effort has not been finished, apparently leaving him with a significant airline stake while leading the agency responsible for regulating carriers and overseeing air safety.

The FAA has been under heightened scrutiny this year after a deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., earlier in 2025 and other recent operational challenges, including air traffic control outages and widespread flight delays during a prolonged government shutdown. Cantwell’s letter ties into broader concerns about FAA leadership credibility and public trust in the agency’s oversight.

Cantwell has asked Bedford to explain why he did not comply with the 90-day divestiture timeline, why he sought an amendment to his ethics agreement, and to provide a full accounting of any Republic stock he has sold.

SAF mandates will shape flight operations, prices, and traveller experience for the next decade.","Air travel is entering a transition. Governments around the world are introducing rules that require airlines to use sustainable aviation fuel, often called SAF. These policies aim to cut emissions and help aviation shift to cleaner energy. For travellers, these rules may influence ticket prices, flight options, and long-term travel planning. This guide breaks down what global tourists should expect as these rules take shape.

Why SAF Matters for Travellers

SAF is produced from materials like waste oils, agricultural residues, or advanced synthetic processes. It can significantly reduce lifecycle emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. Governments promote SAF as a pathway to meet climate goals without limiting mobility.

Travellers may hear airlines speak about rising costs or “fuel adjustments.” This is because SAF is still produced in small volumes and is much more expensive than conventional fuel. When governments set strict mandates, airlines must buy a minimum percentage of SAF even if the supply is limited. Industry observers have said that these rules could slow production growth and raise costs in the short term.

The Policies Behind the Shift

Several major regions have introduced binding fuel rules. Europe has created a system that gradually increases the minimum share of SAF at airports. The United Kingdom has also announced its own SAF mandate, supported by guidance to help the industry scale fuel production. These policies focus on long-term environmental benefits, but airlines say compliance can increase immediate operating expenses.

Government agencies state that the mandates are part of their climate commitments. They explain that early adoption is needed so that the industry can scale fuel production to lower costs over time. The aim is to make greener aviation accessible to all travellers in the future.

How Mandates Could Influence Airfares

Fuel is one of the largest expenses for airlines. When the cost of fuel rises because of mandatory SAF blending, the effects can appear in ticket prices. Travellers may see small fare increases on certain routes, especially during the early years of mandate introduction. Some airlines may also adjust flight schedules or routes if operational costs rise at specific airports.

However, these effects may not be uniform. Airports located in regions with government incentives and targeted support for SAF production may experience smoother transitions. Travellers flying through certain European, UK, or North American airports may find more stable prices as production capabilities grow.

Travel Booking Tips for the SAF Transition

Travellers can prepare for the changes with simple steps:

Compare airfares across multiple dates.

Prices may fluctuate more often as airlines adjust to new fuel requirements.

Check airline sustainability pages.

Most major carriers now publish information on SAF usage and long-term fuel plans. This can help travellers understand how each airline is responding to mandates.

Choose airports with clearer SAF availability.

Airports in regions with strong government incentives often have more predictable supply. This can reduce the risk of unexpected fare spikes.

Monitor added fees.

Some airlines might pass certain compliance costs to passengers through surcharges. Reading fare breakdowns can help travellers spot these changes early.

Book flexible tickets for complex itineraries.

During early implementation periods, airlines may adjust routes or frequencies as they respond to the new regulations.

Long-Term Travel Impact

Governments emphasize that SAF mandates are part of a broader climate strategy. They aim to support sustainable tourism, cleaner skies, and long-term consumer stability. As global fuel production expands and new facilities open, the price gap between SAF and conventional fuel is expected to shrink. For travellers, this means that short-term adjustments may lead to more efficient and environmentally conscious flying in the future.

Final Takeaway for Global Tourists

The world is moving toward cleaner air travel. SAF mandates will shape flight operations, prices, and traveller experience for the next decade. Understanding these rules helps tourists plan smarter. Keep track of airline announcements, airport developments, and fare trends. With the right preparation, travellers can navigate this transition easily while supporting a greener future for aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-app-logo.png,N,,2025-12-13 10:57:28.312170

A national SAF fund would allow government and industry to work together to drive change.
In KLM’s view, a national SAF fund should focus on the following: 1.
Accelerating production and access to raw materials Improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove barriers to accelerated SAF infrastructure development.
The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax.","KLM has backed calls for the Dutch Government to invest in a national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) fund.

In doing so, the Dutch flag carrier is supporting the so-called Wennink Report, a wide-reaching support, by Dutch businessman Peter Wennink, examining how the Netherlands should and could invest in innovative technologies to support its future economic growth.

Such a fund would enable the Netherlands to accelerate the production of alternative aviation fuels and make them more affordable, thereby accelerating the sector’s sustainability. Real progress can only be achieved if government and industry work together and if the government takes a more active role. KLM urges policymakers to adopt this recommendation, the report said.

KLM fully endorses the report’s conclusions about the crucial importance of aviation to safeguarding prosperity and maintaining the Netherlands’ innovative ecosystem.

The airline said: “Aviation and Schiphol are crucial to our economic strength: they connect the Netherlands to the world and are essential for trade, employment and our international competitiveness. It is therefore vital that we invest collectively in a future-proof aviation sector rather than restrict it or impose additional national charges. Doing so would undermine the Netherlands’ competitive position and the global connectivity on which our prosperity depends.

“KLM is investing significantly in cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient operations. Alongside fleet renewal, SAF is currently one of the most effective means of reducing aviation CO₂ emissions, cutting emissions by at least 65% across its entire lifecycle compared with fossil kerosene. KLM blends more SAF each year than required under the European mandate and has entered into a long-term offtake agreement to support the development of the Netherlands’ first dedicated SAF production facility in Delfzijl. However, to achieve the joint ambition of a 14% SAF blend in the Netherlands by 2030, alternative fuels must become more affordable and widely available. Just as with wind and solar energy, government investment can make a real difference in securing the future of sustainable aviation.”

Marjan Rintel, CEO KLM, said: “We fully support the Wennink report’s conclusion that aviation is vital to the Netherlands’ future prosperity. To maintain that position and accelerate our sustainability efforts, the government must invest rather than introduce additional national charges. A national SAF fund would allow government and industry to work together to drive change. KLM is already investing in alternative fuels, but only with an active government role can we achieve the necessary scale and affordability. Now is the moment to position the Netherlands as a leader in sustainable aviation.”

A national SAF fund: paving the way for ‘SAF Made in Holland’

The creation of a national SAF fund aligns with European efforts to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels, including the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), and would make ‘SAF Made in Holland’ a reality. In KLM’s view, a national SAF fund should focus on the following:

1. Making SAF affordable for airlines

Bridge the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene through an incentive fund, enabling airlines to actually use SAF and encouraging them to choose sustainable options. Based on current prices, an annual investment of €60 million could already deliver an additional 1% SAF blend.

2. Accelerating production and access to raw materials

Improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove barriers to accelerated SAF infrastructure development. This would allow the Netherlands to make significant progress in scaling up domestic production.

3. Investing in (e)SAF innovation to become a European leader

Support the development of next-generation (e)SAF technologies and take a leading role in European innovation initiatives. The Dutch government has already taken a promising first step by joining a European pilot within the STIP programme.

The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax. This would allow the Netherlands, and Dutch aviation, to take the lead in scaling up alternative aviation fuels and help ensure that the national ambition of a 14% SAF blend by 2030 remains within reach.",https://ittn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marjan-Rintel-KLM.webp,N,,2025-12-13 10:57:32.684905

(OTCQB: GWTI) (“Greenway”), an advanced gas-to-liquids (“GTL”) and gas-to-hydrogen (“GTH”) technology development company, announced today that, on December 5, 2025, it signed a non-binding term sheet with Swift Creek, LLC (“SCL”), a native and veteran owned company assisting tribes to find solutions in technology and economic development with potential access to certain U.S. government subsidies and funds by virtue of its American domicile and ownership status.

The term sheet sets forth certain terms regarding the parties’ desire to have SCL purchase a patented Greenway G-Reformer™ unit and Fischer Tropsch unit to produce a minimum of five barrels per day at a site to be determined. The purchase price of this micro-plant is expected to be $16 million with Greenway retaining 20% of the agreed offtake from the production of liquid hydrocarbons and other liquids. The term sheet also contemplates SCL acting as a representative of Greenway to promote, market and identify potential customers/purchasers of such systems on behalf of Greenway in return for agreed-upon commissions. Greenway expects to negotiate definitive documentation with SCL pertaining to the term sheet by the first quarter of 2026.

In a statement, Doug Cogan, Chief Executive Officer of Greenway, said, “Greenway Technologies has been working diligently on research and development for over 10 years to develop and patent processes and procedures to perfect innovative and clean gas-to-liquid and gas-to-hydrogen solutions. Because natural gas is available across the globe, we believe the winning GTL solution is the one that can produce valuable liquids and hydrocarbons at the final site where it is utilized without carbon generation into the atmosphere. We believe the relationship that Kevin Jones, our Executive Vice President of Sales, has developed with SCL has been invaluable and is the reason the partnership between our two companies has progressed. We are excited for our shareholders as we move our focus from pre-revenue (R&D) to commercialization. By using our technology in conjunction with SCL’s projects, we expect that the G-Reformer™ units can be configured to not only produce valuable liquid hydrocarbons, but also synthetic diesel blend stock, jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and valuable tech water.”

Mr. Cogan added, “Greenway has been investigating the implementation of additional technology for a variety of purposes. Greenway continues to diligently research and develop patent processes and procedures for clean gas-to-hydrogen solutions. Our research and development has shown the conversion of natural gas (CH4) to hydrogen gas (H2) can be accomplished efficiently. However, widespread use to convert H2 into marketable liquids or electricity has been limited due to the prohibitive cost to liquify and transport the H2. We are focused on a more efficient process to commercialize. Greenway and SCL are collaborating in the utilization of using the G-Reformer™ to produce methanol, a liquid fuel, in areas where removal of the offtake is efficiently accomplished as a single liquid. Methanol is emerging as a clean burning hydrocarbon fuel, which may have substantial value if created with a low-carbon emitting process. Renewable methanol is in large demand at premium prices due to worldwide interest in lower carbon standards.”

Michael Stopp, Managing Partner of Swift Creek LLC, stated, “Over the past 18 months, I’ve gained tremendous confidence not just in the technology itself, but also in the evolving leadership at Greenway. Greenway’s commitment to innovation, recent leadership changes, and research and development partnership(s) have strengthened our collaboration and aligned our shared vision for sustainable business growth. Our partnership underscores Swift Creek’s dedication to embracing forward-thinking solutions and strong organizational leadership across all its ventures. We believe this technology will change the way we think about natural gas going forward.” Mr. Stopp added. “Because Greenway’s cutting-edge reformer technology can also address the challenges of stranded natural gas wells, it will be especially important in Indian country. Many tribes have an abundance of natural resources, but face challenges in getting those resources to market.”

Following a turbulent year, full of highs and lows, the Port of Seattle’s 2026 budget is keeping us on the right trajectory. The highs included the grand opening of the newly renovated working waterfront, our big win to protect maritime industrial lands in Seattle, new bike lanes at Pier 66 and Terminal 91, and three days that broke records for overall daily number of passengers at SEA Airport. The lows included the Trump administration‘s tariff-induced impacts on maritime trade, tensions with Canada reducing tourism revenues for our communities, and an all-out attack on foundational environmental laws. The Northwest Seaport Alliance’s weekly basis tracking of tariff-induced impacts for the last several months are clearly negative with void sailings up 15% compared to 2024 and our import volumes down more than 20% compared to 2024.

That said, we still expect to break more records next year, with a projected 54 million passengers estimated to fly through SEA and more than two million cruise passengers. From the waterfront to the airport, we’ll continue to prioritize creating good paying jobs through sustainable economic growth while working to minimize collateral impacts.

Among the work we’re facilitating with this budget, I’m particularly pleased that we’re continuing to invest in the next generation of maritime workers, with funding for “Blue Schools,” Core Plus maritime curriculum, and pre-apprenticeship programs for construction trades. The silver tsunami of retirements in the maritime field is gathering pace, and we’re working to ensure Seattle’s working waterfront continues to thrive for generations to come. That starts with elevating public awareness of maritime-related career opportunities through educational interpretive signage associated with the redevelopment of the waterfront and in the aquarium’s new Ocean Pavilion as well as in the classroom. These investments are designed to help inspire students and their parents to consider careers in the maritime industry, which is central to the Port’s mission.

I’ve also continued to advocate for funding for responsible tourism in King County and beyond. One of Washington’s most visited tourist hot spots, including for our cruise passengers, is the Snoqualmie Falls. That’s why we convened a group of people interested in protecting this incredibly special place last year. Together with members of the SnoValley Chamber, members of the Snoqualmie Tribe, and others, we mapped out potential strategies to ensure visitors care for the environment and appreciate the history of the falls and the entire Snoqualmie Valley. This year, I’m looking forward to building on that work, with additional support for interpretive signage.

I also spearheaded the installation of an interpretive kiosk at Shilshole Marina to educate boaters about protocols to avoid impacting the recovery of our endangered population of Southern Resident orcas and how they provide whale-sighting networks with information that can aid in their protection. As a former professional photographer and killer whale biologist, I know firsthand how incredibly lucky we are to have them here in our backyard and retain a sense of responsibility to do what I can to preserve their coexistence.

Advancing clean fuels: The potential of Renewable Natural Gas

In recent weeks, the Commission Office has received hundreds of letters from community members expressing concerns about the climate impacts associated with the growing use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel by ships being deployed globally and already calling on our gateway. The Port shares those concerns, which is why we continue to push for the development and deployment of sustainable alternatives, including Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), which can both lower near-port communities’ exposure to harmful pollution and reduce the impact on the climate.

AAPA’s Annual Convention in Québec City

Earlier this fall, I had the honor of representing the Port of Seattle at the annual convention of the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) in Québec City. This gathering brought together maritime leaders from across North America. Together, we had the chance to exchange ideas on strengthening the maritime industry while protecting our communities and environment.

Discussions focused on a range of issues, including supply chain resiliency, sustainability, and modernizing port infrastructure. It was enlightening to learn how ports are addressing these challenges and made me proud of the progress we continue to make at home — from expanding shore power to electrifying cargo-handling equipment and supporting innovation in alternative fuels.

Most importantly, attending this convention ensured that the voices and values of the Port of Seattle — especially our commitment to environmental stewardship and community partnership — were front and center. Whether we’re addressing climate challenges or strengthening economic opportunities, our participation in these forums reinforces the Port of Seattle’s leadership and dedication to advancing maritime innovation, workforce development, international trade, and sustainable tourism practices.

I was also glad to be at the event to celebrate Mario Cordero’s retirement. As the CEO of the Port of Long Beach for the last eight years, Mario led the organization through a period of tremendous growth while advancing environmental initiatives. His own journey, as a first-generation American and as an activist and educator, is incredibly inspiring. As a port executive and member of the Clinton administration, he helped advance America’s role both in international commerce and sustainability. It was an honor and a pleasure to meet him.

Talking responsible tourism in Spokane

It’s gratifying to see how Washington’s priorities have grown to include responsible tourism in recent years, thanks in part to leadership I brought on the subject to the Port of Seattle. In October, just after leaving Québec, I had the opportunity to speak to the Port’s commitment to responsible tourism at the state’s tourism conference in Spokane. While I celebrated our work in SnoValley and our “Stay Another Day” program for cruise ship passengers, I also pointed to the work I’d like to accomplish in the coming year — the “Three-Nation Vacation” associated with visitors arriving from around the world to attend the World Cup tournaments in Seattle and Vancouver, B.C.

The Three-Nation Vacation would be a collaboration across Washington state, British Columbia, and Tribal and First Nations. The concept builds on the government of Canada’s Juan de Fuca Crossing initiative, which affords a great opportunity to encourage travel between Victoria, B.C. and Port Angeles on the Black Ball ferry. This would provide a diversity of experiences for the traveler, increase prosperity across the border, and help repair some of the strains between our countries associated with the Trump administration’s rhetoric assaulting the sovereignty of Canada.

As a demonstration, I’m planning to take the Three-Nation Vacation journey by bus, train, and ferry. I will start from SEA Airport, take the light rail to within walking distance of Coleman Dock, ferry to Bainbridge Island, catch the Clallam transit bus to Port Angeles, and then ferry to Victoria. Along the way I intend to visit Olympic National Park, Tribal and Frist Nation communities, and the culturally rich capital of B.C., all without renting a car. After all, one of the most important ways to practice responsible tourism is to travel by public transit.

I’ll also meet with public officials, Tribal leaders, and tourism industry entrepreneurs to learn more about how we can advance efforts to welcome visitors while protecting the places we love here in the Northwest. The trip, of course, will be the subject of a future Field Notes newsletter.

The tourism conference in Spokane ended on a high note, pun intended. On my last evening in the city, I enjoyed one of the best live jazz concerts I’ve seen recently. It was a great reminder that you don’t have to travel far from home to experience cultural richness. And after a few days in Canada, it was a great example of one of the art forms forged right here in America.

Preserving North SeaTac Park

Protecting North SeaTac Park has been one of my top priorities in recent years, and I’m pleased to share that we have reached a major milestone.

In October 2024, I championed a legislative order – passed by the Commission unanimously – that directed the Executive Director to identify options for permanently protecting 55 acres of the park from development. Through the Joint Advisory Council (JAC), I worked with members of the SeaTac City Council toward that goal.

Earlier this year, the Executive Director adopted the JAC's recommendation to support the City of SeaTac’s application for a King County Conservation Futures (KCCF) grant. The grant would enable SeaTac to purchase the Park with permanent development restrictions in place – ensuring that the park remains open for recreation, not development.

North SeaTac Park is one of the most ecologically important areas in south King County. It includes forests, wetlands, gardens, play areas, and community spaces that provide essential environmental and recreational benefits. After hearing the concerns of local residents and assessing disparities in tree canopy cover and access to open space, it became clear that permanent protection was the right thing to do. I’m grateful to the many residents and advocates who have engaged with the Port of Seattle and the City of SeaTac regarding the park. Their advocacy helped us advance this effort.

The work is not yet complete. The Port and the City are now coordinating appraisals, documentation to support the grant, and negotiating on long-term protection mechanisms to ensure the park remains undeveloped and open to the public in perpetuity.

While the ultimate decision as to whether to sell the Park or to preserve it in another manner remains at the discretion of the Port Commission, our actions on the Commission signify a strong, shared commitment to protect North SeaTac Park for the communities of south King County.

It is efforts such as this that have the potential for improving the quality of life of King County residents. That continues to be a source of motivation for my public service on the Commission.

TRA Seeks Continued Duties on Indonesian Biodiesel

The TRA suggests keeping countervailing duties on Indonesian biodiesel and updating the product description to exclude sustainable aviation fuel.

The Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) has published its Statement of Essential Facts regarding imports of biodiesel from Indonesia.

This transition review was initiated on 6 December 2024. It examined the existing countervailing duties and considered the product scope. The TRA has recommended updating the product description to exclude sustainable aviation fuel, the proposed new definition is:

Fatty-acid mono-alkylesters or paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis or hydrotreatment of non-fossil origin in pure form or as included in a blend, excluding sustainable aviation fuel, in pure form or as included in a blend.

The intended recommendation is to maintain the existing countervailing duties rates which range from 8% to 18%.

Interested parties are invited to submit comments on these findings via the Trade Remedies Service by 8 January 2026 TBC.

Notes:

Period of investigation: 1 October 2023 to 30 September 2024

Countervailing duties are designed to counteract government subsidies that cause material injury to domestic industries.

This review follows the UK's post-Brexit trade framework, under which the TRA assesses inherited EU measures and determines their appropriateness for the UK market.

The aviation industry is facing a significant challenge as airlines like Delta, United, and Lufthansa struggle to meet their Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) targets, throwing a wrench in the industry’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions. As SAF, a green alternative to conventional jet fuel, remains costly and limited in supply, the consequences are being felt across the travel sector. U.S., Germany, and European travelers are already seeing the effects, with airfares soaring and hotel costs climbing due to rising fuel prices. With SAF production lagging behind expectations, travelers can expect to face higher costs on flights and accommodations in the near future. As airlines battle to meet their green fuel goals while dealing with supply shortages, tourists are left wondering how these issues will impact their travel plans, budgets, and overall experience in some of the world’s most popular destinations.

Delta, United, and Lufthansa Struggling to Meet SAF Targets: Why U.S., Germany, and European Travelers Are Facing Skyrocketing Airfares and Hotel Costs!

As travelers around the world eagerly plan their vacations, the soaring prices of airfares and hotel accommodations have become a major concern. With global travel on the rise, an unexpected challenge is shaking the foundations of the aviation industry—Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply shortages. The world’s top airlines, including Delta, United, and Lufthansa, are struggling to meet their SAF production targets, which will have a ripple effect on both airfares and the hospitality industry. But what does this mean for tourists looking to plan their next getaway?

Let’s explore how the SAF shortage is impacting the aviation sector, why flight prices are climbing, and how these challenges will affect popular travel destinations like the U.S., Germany, and the rest of Europe. We’ll also discuss the rising costs within the hospitality industry and what travelers need to know to plan ahead.

Delta, United, and Lufthansa Struggling to Meet SAF Targets

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is considered a critical component in reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. SAF is made from waste sources such as used cooking oil and agricultural waste, offering a greener alternative to traditional jet fuel. In theory, SAF could reduce aviation-related carbon emissions by up to 80%, making it a key player in achieving the industry’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. However, the transition to SAF has not been as smooth as expected.

Airlines like Delta, United, and Lufthansa have committed to using SAF as part of their sustainability pledges. However, SAF production is currently facing numerous hurdles, including limited supply, regulatory bottlenecks, and a high production cost, which is two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. For example, in 2026, IATA expects SAF to account for just 0.8% of global aviation fuel consumption, falling drastically short of the 10% target set by many airlines for the same year. This shortfall poses a challenge to carriers that are trying to meet their green fuel goals.

The aviation industry’s failure to scale up SAF production not only threatens sustainability goals but also has financial implications. Airlines are already dealing with inflationary pressures on fuel costs, which will inevitably be passed on to travelers in the form of higher ticket prices. The lack of SAF availability also affects future flight planning, as airlines may face delays in meeting their sustainability pledges or be forced to adjust routes, adding further complexity to the global air travel landscape.

Why U.S., Germany, and European Travelers Are Facing Skyrocketing Airfares

The United States, Germany, and European Union countries are experiencing the sharpest rise in airfares, largely due to the uncertainty surrounding SAF availability. With SAF making up a smaller percentage of the overall fuel mix than originally anticipated, airlines are left to rely on conventional jet fuel, which has seen its own price spikes. A combination of higher fuel prices, supply chain disruptions, and a slow shift to SAF has led to the inevitable: increasing costs for airline tickets.

For instance, a New York to Paris flight on a major carrier like Delta or United could see an average increase of up to 10% over the next year. Similarly, a Frankfurt to Berlin flight operated by Lufthansa may rise by 7-8%, with European carriers struggling to meet SAF quotas while also juggling rising fuel prices. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that airlines will face a $3.6 billion additional fuel bill by 2025, which means that the cost burden will inevitably trickle down to passengers.

While higher fuel costs may seem like a short-term challenge, the reality is that these hikes are expected to continue. With airlines still striving to balance their sustainability goals, many are postponing fleet renewals or flight expansion plans, which will ultimately affect travelers. This means fewer affordable flight options, longer layovers, and potentially more crowded flights as airlines try to optimize their networks to cope with these new costs.

How the SAF Crisis Will Impact the Hospitality Industry

Airfares are not the only travel expenses that are climbing. The hospitality industry is also feeling the pressure of SAF shortages and higher travel costs. As flights become more expensive, travelers will likely reduce their overall budgets for accommodations, dining, and other travel services. Additionally, many hotels, resorts, and other tourism-related businesses that rely on international tourists are bracing for a potential slowdown in tourism as a direct result of high travel costs.

Countries like Germany, France, and Spain—which rely heavily on tourism for revenue—are already seeing signs of a shift. According to recent reports, hotel occupancy rates in major European cities have decreased slightly as travelers become more selective about their destinations and travel dates. High fuel prices also contribute to a rise in the cost of hotel transportation, tours, and excursions, which are typically linked to the aviation industry’s operational costs.

In the United States, areas like New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami could experience a slowdown in international tourist arrivals, particularly from Europe and Asia. Hotel chains are expected to raise their prices in response to the increased travel costs, while tourist hotspots may see reduced visitation as travelers focus more on local or regional vacations rather than expensive long-haul flights.

Flight Details and Travel Tips for Tourists in 2025

As travelers look for ways to mitigate the effects of rising airfares, it’s crucial to keep a few tips in mind when booking flights and accommodations. Here are some expert tips to help you stay ahead of the curve:

Book Early: With the uncertainty surrounding fuel prices and SAF availability, booking your flights well in advance will give you the best chance to lock in a competitive rate before prices rise further. Airlines are often more transparent with prices for flights that are months out rather than those booked closer to departure.

Flexible Dates: If you’re open to adjusting your travel dates, you may be able to find more affordable flight options. Certain days of the week—usually Tuesdays and Wednesdays—tend to have lower airfare prices. Traveling during the off-peak seasons can also help you avoid higher costs during popular travel periods like summer or the holidays.

Consider Alternative Airports: Major airports like Los Angeles International or Frankfurt International might see higher ticket prices due to their high demand. Consider flying into smaller airports in nearby cities and taking public transport or connecting flights to your final destination.

Check for SAF Initiatives: Some airlines are actively promoting the use of SAF on certain routes or flights. Look for carriers that are making strong sustainability efforts, as they may offer better long-term solutions for green travel without as much fluctuation in ticket prices.

Accommodation Deals: Many hotels are offering discounts and packages for early bookers, especially as international travel prices rise. If you’re visiting a popular destination like Berlin or Barcelona, look for early booking promotions, loyalty programs, or all-inclusive packages to save on accommodation costs. Keep an eye out for deals that combine airfare and hotel stays for added savings.

The Future of SAF and Its Impact on the Aviation and Hospitality Industries

As airlines struggle to meet SAF production targets, both the aviation and hospitality industries will need to adapt to this evolving situation. While SAF has the potential to be a game-changer for reducing aviation-related carbon emissions, its current limitations in production, cost, and infrastructure are slowing the industry’s transition to a greener future.

However, there is hope on the horizon. Governments around the world are investing heavily in the development of SAF infrastructure. In the United States, a proposed $5 billion investment in biofuels and SAF production is expected to ramp up production in the coming years. Similarly, the European Union has set ambitious goals to ensure that European airlines meet their SAF targets by 2030, though regulatory hurdles remain.

For the time being, travelers should expect to see a fluctuating landscape. Airlines will continue to prioritize routes that can deliver the most significant return on investment, and passengers will feel the effects of higher fuel prices in the form of higher ticket prices and additional fees for amenities. In turn, travelers will likely adjust their behavior to adapt to these new costs, potentially opting for more sustainable and cost-effective travel options closer to home.

What Travelers Need to Know

As the aviation industry grapples with the challenge of SAF production and the rising costs of traditional jet fuel, U.S., Germany, and European travelers are already seeing the effects. Airfares are climbing, and hotel costs are following suit. While these increases may be necessary for the long-term sustainability of the aviation industry, travelers should prepare for higher travel costs in 2025 and beyond.

For those planning their next international trip, now is the time to plan ahead, book early, and stay flexible to avoid sticker shock. Look out for sustainable travel options and package deals that can help offset some of the increased costs. With SAF slowly becoming a larger part of the aviation fuel mix, it’s likely that we will see more affordable, eco-friendly travel options in the future—but for now, expect a few bumps along the way as the industry navigates this complex transition.

Nevertheless, Rintel added that to accelerate the country’s sustainability efforts, the Dutch government must invest, noting that a national SAF fund would enable cooperation to drive change.
“Now is the moment to position the Netherlands as a leader in sustainable aviation.” KLM concluded that a national SAF fund should focus on three things.
First, it would have to make SAF affordable for airlines, bridging the gap between alternative and fossil fuels.
“The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax,” KLM stated.","Following the publication of an independent advisory report on the Netherlands’ future, KLM has issued a statement calling for the country’s government to invest in a national sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fund, which would enable the Netherlands to accelerate the production of alternative fuels and reduce emissions.

In a statement on December 12, 2025, KLM, the flag carrier of the Netherlands, said it endorsed the report’s conclusions, including the importance of aviation in safeguarding the country’s prosperity and innovative ecosystem.

“Aviation and Schiphol are crucial to our economic strength: they connect the Netherlands to the world and are essential for trade, employment, and our international competitiveness.”

As such, stakeholders must invest in a future-proof aviation sector rather than undermine it with, for example, additional charges and/or taxes. Growing taxes would only negatively impact the Netherlands’ competitiveness and the country’s global connectivity, KLM warned.

While KLM noted that it has been investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft, as well as SAF, which is “one of the most effective means of reducing aviation CO2 emissions,” to achieve the goal of blending 14% of SAF by 2030, “alternative fuels must become more affordable and widely available.”

Like with wind and solar energy, government investment can make a difference in securing the future supply of SAF, the Dutch airline added.

Marjan Rintel, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of KLM, reiterated that the airline supported the report’s conclusions. Called the ‘Wennink report,’ which was ordered by the country’s caretaker government in September, it focused on the state of the Netherlands’ economy.

In his foreword, Peter Wennink, the former CEO of ASML, famous for its role in making computer chips, warned that while the Netherlands is “a wonderful country” with “smart people, strong businesses, and a society where we care for each other,” the foundations are starting to crumble. “If we do not take action, our quality of life will decline rapidly.”

The report, in Dutch, is available in full here.

Nevertheless, Rintel added that to accelerate the country’s sustainability efforts, the Dutch government must invest, noting that a national SAF fund would enable cooperation to drive change.

“Now is the moment to position the Netherlands as a leader in sustainable aviation.”

KLM concluded that a national SAF fund should focus on three things.

First, it would have to make SAF affordable for airlines, bridging the gap between alternative and fossil fuels. “Based on current prices, an annual investment of €60 million [$70.3 million] could already deliver an additional 1% SAF blend.”

Second, the fund would need to focus on accelerating production, including access to raw materials for SAF and the removal of barriers to the development of SAF infrastructure. This would allow the country to significantly progress in scaling up the production of environmentally friendly fuels.

Lastly, KLM said that investing in the development of next-generation (e)SAF technologies could help the Netherlands cement its position as the leading country in European innovation initiatives.

“The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax,” KLM stated.

Currently, the Netherlands has a plan to increase its aviation taxes, adopting a similar, distance-based approach used by the United Kingdom, for example. From January 1, 2027, the country would apply a €29.40 ($34.47) per-passenger levy on short-haul flights to destinations within the European Union (EU) or for itineraries up to 2,000 kilometers (1,079 nautical miles) from Amsterdam.

Medium-haul journeys of between 2,001 km and 5,000 km (2,699 NM) would have a per-passenger tax of €47.24 ($55.39), while long-haul departures would be taxed at €70.86 ($83.09).

The first phase of the project was aimed at converting the Venice refinery from a conventional facility into a biorefinery. This was achieved by repurposing existing units, which previously processed crude oil, to handle renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and non-edible vegetable oils. The conversion leveraged Honeywell-ENI’s Ecofining® technology.

The scope of work encompassed all engineering services leading up to ENI’s Final Investment Decision (FID), as well as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) activities. The plant was designed with a production capacity of 400,000 tonnes per year, targeting the supply of renewable diesel, naphtha, and LPG to the local market.

The second phase, which began in 2025, involves the expansion of the Venice Biorefinery. It includes all engineering services required to support ENI’s FID and subsequent EPC execution. This part of the project increases production capacity from 400,000 to 600,000 tonnes per year, with the strategic goal of starting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production by 2027.

However, total emissions increased by 11% compared to Season 9. The report attributes this to a change towards primary data collection for business travel, resulting in a more accurate carbon footprint.

Jeff Dodds, CEO of Formula E, says the season proved that “elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive – they are mutually reinforcing.

""Our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing.”

Optimising global logistics

A key factor in the championship's sustainability efforts is its logistics. Formula E moved its global hub to Valencia, Spain, whose port proximity allows for optimised freight routes and greater use of sea freight.

In partnership with DHL, the series prioritises ships using sustainable biofuels. The Valencia hub transition was completed for Season 11, despite challenges like a flood in October 2024.

The championship also used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for freight between its Berlin and Shanghai races through DHL’s GoGreen Plus service.

Paul Fowler, Vice President Motorsports at DHL, says the collaboration shows what is possible ""when logistics and sport work together."" He notes they have identified practical ways to reduce emissions, such as optimising routes and moving to sea and road transport.

New benchmarks and net zero certification

Formula E’s sustainability credentials were strengthened in Season 10. It was ranked first in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport for the second consecutive year with its highest score of 85%.

The series also became the first sport to be awarded BSI’s Net Zero Pathway certification. This award provides independent assurance of an organisation's carbon inventory and climate targets.

Matt Page, Senior Vice President at BSI, explains: “Sport has the opportunity to play a leading role in our transition to a sustainable world. This achievement reflects a deep, long-term commitment to credible climate action.”

Expanding social impact

The series has also expanded its social initiatives.

IATA says airlines are now paying up to five times the price of fossil fuel, driven by limited supply and “poorly designed mandates” that have allowed fuel suppliers to pass on significant compliance fees to airlines, effectively doubling the standard SAF price premium.
This regulatory burden is intensifying the cost squeeze on low-fare and regional carriers, whose razor-thin margins depend on minimal fuel expenditure.
“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.
But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Walsh.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has criticised European and UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, claiming that the cost of SAF compared to conventional fuel has escalated dramatically.

This regulatory burden is intensifying the cost squeeze on low-fare and regional carriers, whose razor-thin margins depend on minimal fuel expenditure.

Speaking the Association’s Global Media Day in Geneva this week, IATA Director General Willie Walsh warned that the majority of airlines with commitments to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be “forced to reevaluate” these targets, posing a major challenge for the industry’s long-term decarbonisation strategy.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.

The parties believe that the partnership has the potential to advance HEFA and next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF pathways

The parties intend to jointly evaluate the future development of New Rise Louisiana, a SAF facility comparable in size to XCF's New Rise Reno facility of ~40 million gallons

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESS Newswire / December 12, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (""Southern""); and DevvStream Corp. (""DevvStream"") (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together ""the parties"") today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

The SAF, originating in Texas, has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel. For every 8,000-gallon truckload of fuel, the SAF provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres of U.S. forests per year. In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

This initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program—a company-wide commitment to responsible aviation practices. The Beyond Green platform focuses on integrating more sustainable solutions across Million Air’s network, from renewable energy investments and facility efficiencies to greener fuel options, like SAF. Million Air Austin joins Million Air Albany (KALB), which partnered with Avfuel to bring SAF online this summer.

SAF is made from renewable and sustainably sourced waste materials, like used cooking oil. Once blended with conventional jet fuel, SAF is a drop-in solution that meets ASTM D1655 specifications and performs to the same standards as traditional jet fuel—requiring no changes to aircraft, fuel infrastructure or handling procedures.

The award represents a significant milestone for the project and for Imperial County, one of California’s most economically challenged regions.

The Jobs First Grant will support critical activities, including geotechnical engineering, foundation design, agricultural preparation, and procurement of key components for SVE’s integrated clean-energy system. These steps are essential to advancing construction readiness and securing full project financing for the $1.28 billion renewable infrastructure development, which will create 250 direct full-time living wage jobs and 15,000 jobs from planning through construction and plant start-up. The project will work in tandem with Imperial Valley College and the Imperial County Workforce Development Office to maximize local training and hiring opportunities.

“The Jobs First Grant accelerates the final steps needed to bring one of California’s most important clean-energy and agricultural revitalization projects across the finish line,” said Dave Rubenstein, president & CEO of California Ethanol + Power. “Sugar Valley Energy will deliver long-term climate benefits, stable employment, and a transformative new industry for Imperial County.”

The Catalyst Last Mile Proposal was submitted by IVEDC in partnership with CE+P, which has already invested $27 million to advance SVE from concept to shovel ready. The grant will immediately support jobs for key local project partners, including Landmark Consultants, Duggins Construction, Benson Farms, and Dubose Design Group and enable the project to begin construction on foundational elements of the ethanol plant.

“This award represents a major step forward, not only for the Sugar Valley Energy project, but for thousands of Imperial Valley families who deserve access to high-quality jobs and long-term economic opportunity,” said Timothy Kelley, president & CEO, Imperial Valley Economic Development Corporation. “The Jobs First Collaborative is helping remove barriers that have historically held this region back.”

Developed by CE+P, Sugar Valley Energy will be the first-of-its-kind project in North America. Once operational, the integrated biorefinery campus in Brawley, California will produce more than 73 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol, 771 million standard cubic feet of renewable natural gas (RNG), and 41 megawatts of renewable electricity each year from sustainably grown sugarcane.

Sugarcane cultivated on more than 48,000 acres of Imperial County farmland will serve as feedstock for the project, creating new revenue streams for more than 50 farming entities and supporting 2,000+ local agricultural jobs. The crop replaces less profitable forage crops and will help fill the void left by the 2025 closure of the Spreckels Sugar Company plant, which eliminates hundreds of jobs and dismantled California’s last sugar-beet processing industry.

Imperial County continues to face persistent underinvestment and the highest unemployment rate in the nation, notably 20.2% as of July 2025. The Jobs First Grant helps remove barriers to economic mobility by:

Strengthening workforce development and local hiring pathways

Expanding clean-energy and wastewater infrastructure

Supporting agricultural diversification and resilience

Creating jobs in a future-facing, low-carbon industry

Catalyzing regional investment tied to more than $200 million in federal investment tax credits.

A recent impact analysis found that construction and startup operations for SVE will generate more than $928 million in direct economic activity, creating 15,000+ construction and startup jobs and 250 long-term, family-sustaining operations jobs.

As California implements AB 30 and prepares for statewide E15 adoption, Sugar Valley Energy is positioned to become a major producer of ultra-low-carbon renewable fuel that supports the state’s climate goals and Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

The championship's Season 10 Sustainability Report reveals strategic supply chain innovations that could offer valuable insights for logistics professionals managing complex international operations.

Between 2023 and 2024, Formula E achieved a 55% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions against its baseline, according to its Season 10 Sustainability Report. However, the championship's total emissions rose by 11% compared to Season 9, primarily due to the transition from secondary assumptions to primary data for business travel across each team in the championship.

Jeff Dodds, CEO of Formula E, says: ""Season 10 proved once again that elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive – they are mutually reinforcing.

""From using sustainable aviation fuel across continents to leaving lasting legacies in host cities through our Better Futures Fund, our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing.""

Optimising freight routes

Formula E restructured its logistics network in Season 10, implementing a new global hub in Valencia, Spain, which replaced its previous logistics base at Donington Park in the UK. The strategic relocation could demonstrate how proximity to major transport infrastructure can transform freight efficiency.

The new hub's location near a major port allowed Formula E to optimise its freight routes and increase its use of sustainable sea freight. The championship partnered with DHL to prioritise the use of ships powered by sustainable biofuels, shifting away from more carbon-intensive air freight where operationally feasible.

Formula E successfully completed its logistics transition by the start of Season 11 despite challenges including an unexpected flood in Valencia in October 2024. This resilience in supply chain operations highlights the importance of contingency planning in complex logistics networks.

The Valencia facility provides Formula E with enhanced capabilities for managing equipment across its global race calendar.

By centralising operations in a location with direct access to Mediterranean shipping routes, the championship reduced transit times and improved coordination between freight movements and race schedules.

Sustainable aviation fuel integration

The championship also successfully used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to transport freight between Berlin and Shanghai using DHL's GoGreen Plus service. This service uses a book and claim system, with SAF used by air carriers and the emission reductions allocated to shippers as certificates.

Paul Fowler, Vice President of Motorsports at DHL, says: ""Our collaboration with Formula E shows what's possible when logistics and sport work together.

""By partnering closely and rethinking freight strategies, we've identified practical ways to reduce emissions – optimising routes and shifting to sea and road transport – while ensuring the championship runs smoothly.""

The partnership between Formula E and DHL could illustrate how shipper-carrier collaboration can identify emission reduction opportunities without compromising operational performance. The modal shift strategy, prioritising sea and road transport over air freight, represents a practical approach to freight decarbonisation.

The integration of SAF into Formula E's logistics operations demonstrates the viability of alternative fuels in time-sensitive freight movements.

While SAF currently represents a premium cost compared to conventional jet fuel, the championship's commitment to its use could help drive broader market adoption and scale economies in the sustainable aviation sector.

Supply chain certification standards

For a second consecutive year, Formula E was awarded first position in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport with a best-ever score of 85%.

The championship reaffirmed its environmental credentials, aligning with standards including ISO 20121, ISO 14064 and the IWA 42 framework for climate governance and emissions transparency.

Formula E also became the first sport to receive BSI's Net Zero Pathway certification. The Pathway provides independent assurance across an organisation's carbon inventory, targets and management controls to help ensure net zero goals are realistic and achievable.

The certification process required Formula E to demonstrate comprehensive measurement and reporting of emissions across all operational scopes. This level of scrutiny ensures that sustainability claims are supported by verifiable data and aligned with internationally recognised climate science targets.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f9358c393e73a4dded9748a6c65d1f30:2a75c822d01b7e5830488b20b1a4fa19/s10-track-shot.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 11:56:24.707371

A new generation of aircraft One of Delta’s main goals this year has been to procure more than 35 sustainable aircraft.","Delta’s centennial year was not a time for looking back at the past. In fact, in the hundred years since its founding in Macon, Georgia, US, the airline has rarely had such a progressive 12 months.

Across 2025, Delta made good progress against its fuel efficiency targets, it struck up some partnerships to develop cutting-edge prototypes of planes and cut down on the use of unsustainable materials across its flights too.

The carrier, which is now based in Atlanta, also surpassed its near-term fuel savings goal, delivering more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in Q1 alone.

It’s an achievement that has helped save the firm more than US$125m, as well as move the dial on its pursuit of net zero.

Delta’s focus on improving efficiency

Delta's cross-enterprise Carbon Council was instrumental in the savings it made on fuel in 2025.

The council implemented a few important measures to this end, including weight reduction on board, technology to track and reduce Auxiliary Power Unit usage between flights, optimised aircraft speed and routing, new landing procedures and drag reduction technologies like ‘winglets’.

Though the impacts of these initiatives are fairly small in isolation, together they helped to make a good dent in Delta’s emissions.

The US-based airline also launched a programme called ‘Green Station of the Year’ in an effort to encourage its employees to change behaviours and contribute to fuel savings in their day-to-day work.

Thanks to this programme, lots of Delta’s frontline team members are now competing against one another to see who can be most sustainable.

In September, Delta joined up with Maeve Aerospace to help it expedite the development of hybrid electric aircraft for regional flights.

Compared to today's regional aircraft designs, Maeve's aircraft aims to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40% using conventional jet fuel, with further lifecycle emissions reductions possible when using SAF.

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences, and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

A year of unusual innovations

Elsewhere, Delta decided to deepen its working relationship with Airbus. This renewed collaboration saw the two companies test fello'fly – a flying technique inspired by migrating geese that pairs flights to improve fuel efficiency.

Using this technique, a pair of aircraft fly concurrently, with one creating an uplift that can markedly improve the fuel efficiency of the other.

Airbus says that the practice can reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights.

Delta also added MicroTau to its Sustainable Skies Lab. MicroTau is an Australian aerospace technology company that is known for creating external cladding for planes that mimics shark skin. This, the start-up says, reduces drag and saves fuel.

The technology can be applied to an aircraft's fuselage, wings and tail and may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% according to MicroTau's estimations.

Delta is also testing finlets, fins similar to those fish have, that can be installed on the back of an aircraft on the fuselage to reshape airflow and reduce drag.

The carrier finalised modifications of the split-scimitar winglet upgrade on its 737-800 fleet this year, marking the completion of adding the most advanced winglet technology available to all existing fleets that can be modified.

Delta’s investments in SAF

Delta says it is on track to increase its usage of sustainable aviation fuel by 50% compared to last year.

In 2025, the carrier collaborated with the likes of Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland on a project that saw the first-ever commercial scale delivery of SAF to an airport – Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80% and has the potential to deliver net negative emissions in certain circumstances.

The problem with SAF has always been supply, though. Currently, there isn't enough available to meet global demand for even a week.

Investments from the likes of Delta will be crucial in scaling the fuel as time goes by.

Thanks to its forward-thinking approach this year, Delta was named one of the world's Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for the fifth time, ranking number three in the Corporate Social Responsibility category for its efforts on SAF.

A new generation of aircraft

One of Delta’s main goals this year has been to procure more than 35 sustainable aircraft.

Though 2026 is just around the corner, the company says that it is on track to do so.

On average, these new planes are more than 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than the aircraft Delta has retired since 2019.

With approximately 90% of Delta's carbon emissions coming from jet fuel each year, the airline is keeping its focus on those modifications that are within its control while the next generation of aircraft and supporting technologies become more mature and more accessible.

Creating a more sustainable travel experience

Keeping with that same thinking, Delta officially rolled out a new range of paper cups across its entire operation this year, replacing plastic cups for all flights.

The airline began final testing of the cups on transcontinental domestic flights in 2023, completing testing in 2024 before teams worked through inventory, supply chain and logistics to make the transition possible.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b9353d940f88d4abc637cedac4d8a49a:31f953c6fba549c6d858c596f7907842/delta-s-centennial-year-saw-the-airline-make-some-progress-against-its-net-zero-targets.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 10:56:48.705514

Abstract

This study investigates the effect of the concentration of sustainable jet fuel components on selected physicochemical properties of blends with fossil Jet A-1 fuel, as well as on parameters characterizing the combustion process in aircraft turbine engines. The analyzed physicochemical properties were density, net heat of combustion, and fractional composition (50% recoverey temperature and viscosity at −20 °C) of the fuel blends. The combustion process was examined using test rigs equipped with GTM 140 and DGEN 380 engines operated at different rotational speeds. For each engine speed, the fuel mass flow rate and the combustion chamber temperature were determined. The functions mf = Ae^(−Ea/RT) were derived, corresponding to the kinetic equations of the complete combustion reaction chain. The (Ea/R)mf values obtained using the trend line method for the GTM 140 engine were found to be linearly related to those obtained for the DGEN 380 engine. A deviation from linearity was observed for blends containing 5% of various synthetic components. These findings support a new hypothesis that the same intermolecular interactions between liquid fuel components that account for the non-additivity of physicochemical properties also contribute to the parameters of combustion kinetics in turbine engines. Tests on the turbine engine provided preliminary validation of this hypothesis.

eFuel Market

Synthetic aviation fuel is a clean, drop-in-ready jet fuel made from renewable power, green hydrogen, and captured CO₂, offering up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions and helping airlines meet global decarbonization mandates without changing their aircraft engines or retrofitting.

The broader global aviation fuel market size was valued by Fortune Business Insights at USD 391.23 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 431.70 billion in 2024 to USD 819.73 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.35% during the forecast period (source).

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sustainable aviation fuel market is projected to expand from an estimated USD 2.06 billion in 2025 to approximately USD $25.62 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 65.5%.

Within these projections lies the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, the European Union's landmark mandate requiring airlines and fuel suppliers to adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at all major EU and EU Economic Zone airports starting in 2025. The regulation sets binding, rising SAF blending requirements of 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035 and up to 70% by 2050, creating one of the world's largest guaranteed markets for clean jet fuel (Source).

The EU has also paired this demand-side measure with a supply-side subsidy, offering up to 6€ per liter to airlines that purchase eSAF specifically (Source: Reuters). The combination of mandated demand and subsidized supply underscores the EU's seriousness about bolstering the rapid scale-up of eSAF production from producers like Syntholene.

The First-tier Tribunal’s approach since Pawar Late 2025 has seen a deluge of ‘late’ appeal decisions by the First-tier Tribunal.","2018: The “Martland Test”

In Martland, the Upper Tribunal set out a three-stage test for considering whether to grant permission for an appeal that is out of time. The three stages are:

1. The Length of the Delay.

The Tribunal first considers how long the delay in filing the appeal was and assesses whether the delay was significant.

2. The Reasons for Default.

Next, the Tribunal examines the reasons for the delay, and evaluates whether the appellant had good reason for not acting within the time limit.

3. The Circumstances of the Case.

Finally, the Tribunal will balance the merits of the appeal against the potential prejudice which would be caused to both parties if permission were granted or refused. The Upper Tribunal in Martland emphasised that this balancing exercise should give special weight to the need for efficient conduct of litigation and adherence to statutory deadlines.

2025: Medpro’s impact on the Martland Test

In July this year, the Upper Tribunal endorsed the Martland test, in Medpro Healthcare Ltd. v HMRC [2025] UKUT 255 (TCC) (Medpro). However, the Upper Tribunal ultimately diverged from Martland’s approach, stating that when considering stage three of the Martland test, time limits are important but there is no legal basis for concluding that they should take precedence over the merits of the case.

Judgments of the Upper Tribunal are binding on the First-tier Tribunal but, while it will regard them as highly authoritative, the Upper Tribunal is not bound by its own decisions. The tests as set out in Martland and Medpro are on an even footing, with neither taking precedence over the other.

Since Medpro, the Tax Tribunals have taken a varied approach to the Martland test, generally considering both cases, some showing a preference for one test over another.

Application of the Medpro Test

The key authority for following the Medpro formulation of the test is Tajinder Pawar v HMRC [2025] UKUT 00309 (TCC) (Pawar). Having originally dismissed Mr Pawar’s appeal on its three original grounds, the Upper Tribunal was asked to consider a late fourth ground, based on the Medpro decision and its impact on observing time limits for allowing a late appeal.

Pawar concerns a significant VAT penalty imposed on First Stop Wholesale Ltd due to errors in the company’s VAT returns. In October 2017, HMRC issued Mr Pawar, who was both a director and shareholder of the company, with a personal liability notice holding him wholly and personally liable for the penalty and upheld the penalty in late 2018. In 2022, more than 3 years after the 30-day deadline, Mr Pawar applied to the First-tier Tribunal for permission to bring a late appeal. The First-tier Tribunal, applying stage 3 of the Martland test and taking account of the length of the delay, refused permission for the late appeal. Mr Pawar appealed the decision to the Upper Tribunal.

The decision in Pawar centres on this fourth ground of appeal and whether the Tribunal should follow the authority of Martland, which stated that particular emphasis should be placed on observing statutory time limits, or Medpro, which held that while observing time limits is important, it is not a factor that should overshadow the merits of the case.

The Upper Tribunal reasoned that Medpro was a more recent decision and a decision which expressly considered the Martland test. The Upper Tribunal therefore set aside the First-tier Tribunal decision and remade it, balancing the merits of the delay against the potential prejudice to Mr Pawar, if his appeal was dismissed, and to HMRC if it was granted, without giving special weight to the need to observe time limits.

The Upper Tribunal nonetheless found that, even without according special importance to the need for statutory time limits to be respected, the prejudice to Mr Pawar of the appeal being dismissed was not sufficiently great as to outweigh an unjustified delay of more than 3 years. The Upper Tribunal therefore dismissed the appeal.

Pawar therefore affirmed the Medpro approach. One might expect the First-tier Tribunal to adopt Medpro going forwards, given it is both the most recent approach and the approach confirmed by the Upper Tribunal in Pawar (having had the opportunity to consider both Medpro and Martland). However, a proliferation of recent First-tier Tribunal decisions has made it difficult to discern any single approach.

The First-tier Tribunal’s approach since Pawar

Late 2025 has seen a deluge of ‘late’ appeal decisions by the First-tier Tribunal.

In Lands Luo Limited v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 1207 (TC) (Lands Luo), the First-tier Tribunal acknowledged the tension between Martland and Medpro but quickly discounted it: “We should state immediately that we doubt that the difference in the approach to the test to be applied to determine whether to grant permission to bring a late appeal between Martland and Medpro is likely to lead to different results in many cases. This is because when it comes to evaluating all the circumstances of the case, factors specific to the case are always likely to determine the outcome” (para 70).

The same ambivalence appears in Choudhury v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 1274 (TC) (Choudhury), which was heard prior to the judgments in Medpro, Pawar and Lands Luo. The First-tier Tribunal acknowledged these later decisions but nonetheless felt it unnecessary to seek further representation from the parties, having satisfied itself that it would have reached the same conclusion under both Medpro and Martland tests.

This uneasy balance may be sustainable for so long as the Tribunal can satisfy itself that both tests would, on the facts, result in the same outcome. However, if the tests were to result in conflicting outcomes, it is not certain which would prevail. The First-tier Tribunal in Lands Luo ultimately favoured Martland on the basis that it was consistent with the approach of the Court of Appeal in BPP Holdings v HMRC [2017] UKSC 55, which was affirmed or permitted by the Supreme Court. The First-tier Tribunal panel in Lands Luo was larger than usual, particularly for this type of hearing, and notably included Dingeman LJ, the Senior President of Tribunals. However, despite the seniority of its panel the decision is ultimately of limited assistance as it makes no reference to the judgment in Pawar. A similar preference for Martland was shown more recently in Dounetas [2025] UKFTT 1416 (TC) (Dounetas) in which case the First-tier Tribunal referred to Medpro but acknowledged it was under appeal.

Conversely, in each of Wolf & Whistle Limited v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 01187 (TC) (Wolf & Whistle) (heard before the Pawar judgment), Hamasala v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 01261 (TC) (Hamasala) and Dreyer v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 01336 (TC) (Dreyer) (both heard after the Pawar judgment) the First-tier Tribunal applied Medpro but noted that it would have reached the same decision had it applied the stricter test in Martland.

HMRC’s view

It is not clear whether HMRC has a settled internal view on which is the correct test. In Len Lothian Holdings Limited [2025] UKFTT 01254 (TC) (Len Lothian), HMRC agreed with the taxpayer that the First-tier Tribunal should apply the test as set out in Martland. However, although Len Lothian was heard after the judgment in Medpro, it was heard before the judgment was handed down in Pawar. By contrast, in Figa Store Limited v HMRC [2025] UKFTT 1260 (TC) (Figa Store), which was heard after the judgment in Pawar, the parties agreed that the First-tier Tribunal should apply the test as adjusted by Medpro; and similarly in Dounetas it was HMRC that sought to bring the Medpro authority into the appeal at the hearing. It is unclear whether this represents a change in HMRC’s stance following Pawar or merely indicates a lack of consistent approach with HMRC preferring one or the other when it best suits their circumstances.

Practical takeaways

Fortunately, we understand that Medpro has been appealed, so the question of whether special weight should be given to observing time limits should be resolved authoritatively by the Court of Appeal.

For now, the case law suggests that the First-tier Tribunal is prepared to follow the approach set out in Medpro in seeking to ensure a fair balance between procedural integrity and the merits of the appeal. As a result, the merits of late appeals to the First-tier Tribunal may be given greater consideration than they might have previously. However, this is not certain and it is notable that no decision to date has found the outcome of Medpro or Martland would be different. Until we have definitive guidance from a higher court, it is possible that, faced with a fact pattern that results in different outcomes depending on which test is applied, a Tribunal could prefer the approach set out in Martland without the Medpro modification.

Anyone considering a late appeal should ensure they have strong reasons for the delay and should make clear in submissions any potential prejudice they would suffer if the appeal is not allowed.",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white-with-accent/dispute-resolution4.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 12:57:33.440837

About Project Starling

Situated in Workington, UK, Project Starling is envisioned as a pioneering Power-to-Liquid facility designed to produce approximately 25,000 metric tons of e-SAF annually using renewable electricity and advanced electrolysis. The initiative is currently in the FEED phase, with construction anticipated to commence in 2028. Full operational capability is targeted for 2031.

When operational, the plant is projected to cut lifecycle emissions by up to 89% compared to fossil-based jet fuel, offering a major contribution to the UK’s emission reduction goals and the broader aviation decarbonization roadmap.

In July 2025, the project secured a significant boost when it received a £6 million grant—the largest awarded to any e-fuels company—from the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuel Fund Window 3. This funding is intended to accelerate SAF development in the country and aligns with government ambitions under the Jet Zero Strategy and upcoming SAF mandate.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-12 08:58:11.173678

Consequently, AIIB remains committed to investing in aviation infrastructure that enhances connectivity, strengthens regional cooperation and delivers shared prosperity, while advancing a forward-looking vision grounded in climate resilience and sustainability.","The aviation sector is undergoing a profound transformation. With global air travel demand projected to reach 25 billion annual passengers by 2052, the industry’s focus has shifted from growth alone to sustainable growth, balancing connectivity and net-zero ambitions. Within this context, multilateral development banks (MDBs) play a pivotal role in mitigating risks, fostering innovation and mobilizing capital and expertise for aviation.

This understanding was reflected in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank’s (AIIB) Transport Knowledge Week 2025, themed “Sustainable Transportation: Clean Skies for Tomorrow” (Oct. 27-31, 2025). Through a mix of workshops and site visits, the event aimed to advance a more efficient, green, connected and integrated aviation ecosystem by fostering meaningful dialogue among stakeholders and identifying emerging trends, challenges and opportunities shaping the sector’s future.

Over 20 speakers and 20 participants from airlines, airports and aviation authorities from 13 AIIB members participated in the event. A wealth of in-depth insights and case studies was shared by experts from policy, industry, financing and research. These insights highlighted the need for harmonization in standard-setting for sustainable aviation fuel to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2025. They also highlighted projections indicating that advanced air mobility, a new business model in aviation that features electric air taxis and low-altitude economy, will generate over 7,000 jobs in the next 20 years. Case studies such as the Hong Kong International Airport’s Sky Pier Terminal and autonomous-vehicle corridors indicated the shift toward multimodal connectivity enabled by smart mobility.

The case study of the Kunming Changshui Airport, which received four stars – the highest possible rating among all airports in China in the 2024 Dual Carbon Airport evaluation by the China Civil Airports Association – showed how international standards and global expertise enabled the AIIB project to set new sustainability benchmarks. Beyond financing the Kunming Changshui Airport’s expansion and green development, AIIB developed a comprehensive green airport assessment framework integrating local and international standards, proposed tailored decarbonization action plans and advocated for gender inclusivity throughout the project.

Two other AIIB-financed aviation projects in Thailand and China were discussed at the event workshops and amplified AIIB’s sustained efforts in mobilizing expertise, transferring knowledge and building capacity. Other MDBs, such as the World Bank Group, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the New Development Bank, together with their partners and clients, also showcased their financing and projects in aviation.

Participants also visited sites such as the state-of-the-art Beijing Daxing International Airport, the Chengdu Tianfu International Airport, the Chengdu Eastern New District, the Comprehensive Bonded Zone, and the Cargo Terminal of the Tianfu Airport. The visits demonstrated that as aviation continues to serve as a catalyst for connectivity and economic growth across industries, the associated infrastructure needs to be thoughtfully integrated into broader industrial, urban and national development strategies. The discussions and insights following the site visits also underscored that airports are not isolated transport hubs but strategic enablers of sustainable growth and regional cohesion. Integration is key.

Through the event, AIIB aimed to provide a knowledge-sharing platform for aviation stakeholders, enabling participants to gain insights relevant to their varied national contexts and development priorities, be it in terminal design and best practices, engaging with MDBs for airport financing or innovative solutions to achieve sustainable aviation. AIIB also called for immediate efforts to build smart aviation infrastructure for tomorrow – one that expands access jobs, essential services, new markets and regional and global cooperation, while safeguarding the planet we all share.

Today’s announcement follows the launch of applications for the next cohort of Aviation Ambassadors in September, a group of industry professionals who work to raise the profile of aviation careers alongside undertaking their professional roles in the sector.

Alongside inspiring the next generation of aviation leaders, the government is also backing the development of technologies to help futureproof the sector. This includes greener aviation through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which will provide economic security for the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market by guaranteeing a set price per unit for UK producers.

An additional £63 million is also being invested to speed up construction on new SAF production plants, to unlock the opportunities of the green fuels sector in aviation to deliver growth and create skilled jobs on the journey to reach net zero.

Caitlin Gould, TEC Women CIC and TEC Girls Director, said:

At TEC Women CIC, we are thrilled that our TECgirls Reach for the Sky Festival and Take Flight education programme has been funded to help more girls explore STEM roles in aviation and aerospace.

Our Take Flight festival has been building year on year, with over 500 girls and 1,000 people attending last year and our education outreach has provided practical hands-on-learning for over 200 girls across Cornwall, including a work experience week.

In 2026, we plan to continue to grow this programme, working with more industry partners and reaching new audiences across rural and coastal locations. Without support from the challenge fund, ambitious events like our festival would not be possible.

The award, in the category of Excellence in Energy – Downstream, was presented at a gala in New York, thus consolidating the company's leadership in the promotion of renewable fuels.

The Platts Awards are considered the most prestigious awards in the global energy sector, recognizing excellence in innovation, leadership and sustainability. The jury granted this award to Repsol for overcoming the dual challenge of supplying affordable and reliable energy while advancing decarbonization across its operations and products.

In addition, Repsol stood out among its peers thanks to its large-scale production of renewable fuels and their successful implementation, achieving significant progress in its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Repsol currently sells NEXA diesel at almost 1,500 service stations in Spain and Portugal, making it one of the largest distribution networks for 100% renewable fuels in Europe.

The company already operates the first plant in the Iberian Peninsula in Cartagena to produce 100% renewable fuels on a large scale, with the capacity to produce 250,000 tonnes of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year. In 2026, a second plant will be added in Puertollano with an annual capacity of around 200,000 tonnes of renewable diesel for road and maritime transport.

Repsol recently achieved a technological milestone by producing gasoline of 100% renewable origin on an industrial scale at its Tarragona complex, positioning the company at the forefront of energy innovation. Repsol's 95 NEXA gasoline is already available at more than 20 service stations in Spain, with the aim to reach 30 points of sale before the end of the year.

Repsol’s NEXA fuels of 100% renewable origin, both diesel and gasoline, have formulations that are similar to conventional premium fuels, enabling the engine perform at its best and remain in optimal condition.

Fly Smooth with Sergeant Oil & Gas Fuel is the heart of every flight.","Flying makes people happy because planes can take them all over the world. But a plane can only fly when it has the right fuel. This fuel is like a special drink for the engine. Without it, the plane cannot move at all. Sergeant Oil & Gas provides the correct fuel for pilots, flight schools, and heliports so every flight goes well.

Why Planes Need Different Fuel

Not all planes are the same. Some are big. Some are small. Some have wings that spin fast, others go slow. Because planes are different, they need different fuel. Using the wrong fuel can make engines sad. Our team makes sure every plane gets the right kind of fuel for its engine. This keeps flights safe and easy.

Jet Fuel for Big Planes

Big planes and jets use jet fuel. This fuel helps engines run high in the sky. It can handle cold and windy heights. Airports and airlines need fuel that works the same every time. At Sergeant Oil & Gas, we provide jet fuel that pilots can trust. Clean fuel and on-time delivery mean planes fly on schedule without surprises.

Avgas 100LL for Small Planes

Oman’s access to varied carbon-rich feedstocks and its strong industrial infrastructure make it an ideal location to lead circular carbon initiatives, the company said.","Muscat: US-based carbon recycling company LanzaTech has signed an agreement with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank Group’s private-sector arm, to work together on developing Oman’s first-ever Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project, reports Zawya.

LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren said the initiative will focus on converting waste industrial gases in Oman into ethanol, which can then be refined into sustainable aviation fuel—allowing aircraft to run on recycled carbon instead of fossil fuels.

Holmgren described the agreement as a major milestone. “I recently had the honour of signing an agreement that marks an important step for aviation and climate efforts in Oman,” she said. “Oman is quickly emerging as a leader in the circular carbon economy, showing how industrial capabilities and progressive policies can turn waste carbon into valuable products. Across the GCC, countries such as Oman and Saudi Arabia are demonstrating how carbon can be continuously reused, opening new opportunities for circular carbon systems,” she said.

Stage 1 of the project is in progress, with LanzaTech and the IFC carrying out a joint feasibility study that includes assessing feedstock and product markets, estimating capital costs, and developing financial models to create a clear path to a final investment decision and project rollout.

LanzaTech’s biorecycling technology will be central to SAF production in Oman. The process captures carbon-rich gases directly from energy-intensive industrial sites and prevents them from entering the atmosphere. The carbon is then turned into sustainable substitutes for fossil-based materials, used in products such as detergents, textile fibres, packaging and transport fuels.

Currently, six commercial plants around the world operate using LanzaTech’s technology. The company says it is creating a new value chain by converting captured carbon into ethanol and then into SAF, and believes Oman is well-placed to become a regional—and possibly global—hub for circular carbon solutions.

Holmgren said the project could make a significant difference for Oman. “Projects like this could produce around 80,000 tonnes of SAF every year, boosting Oman Vision 2040, creating jobs, and supporting economic diversification,” she said.

She added that SAF is expected to contribute more than 60% of aviation’s CO₂ reductions by 2050. “If only 15–20 more plants of this scale are built globally, we could see more than 1.5 million tonnes of sustainable fuel produced annually — which would be 50% more than what the world produced last year. That is the kind of scale needed today,” she said.

Oman’s access to varied carbon-rich feedstocks and its strong industrial infrastructure make it an ideal location to lead circular carbon initiatives, the company said. The project strengthens Oman’s position as a regional frontrunner in carbon circularity.

Highlighting the importance of the initiative, the IFC said: “This project aligns with Oman Vision 2040 and its goals for sustainable industries, economic diversification, and employment generation — a priority for the World Bank Group in the country. This collaboration builds on IFC’s growing engagement in Oman following major agreements announced during the World Bank Group Day last year.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-10.png,N,,2025-12-12 06:56:16.452357

KLM is investing significantly in cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient operations. Alongside fleet renewal, SAF is currently one of the most effective means of reducing aviation CO₂ emissions, cutting emissions by at least 65% across its entire lifecycle compared with fossil kerosene. KLM blends more SAF each year than required under the European mandate and has entered into a long-term offtake agreement to support the development of the Netherlands’ first dedicated SAF production facility in Delfzijl.

1. Making SAF affordable for airlines

Bridge the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene through an incentive fund, enabling airlines to actually use SAF and encouraging them to choose sustainable options. Based on current prices, an annual investment of €60 million could already deliver an additional 1% SAF blend.

2. Accelerating production and access to raw materials

Improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove barriers to accelerated SAF infrastructure development. This would allow the Netherlands to make significant progress in scaling up domestic production.

3. Investing in (e)SAF innovation to become a European leader

Support the development of next-generation (e)SAF technologies and take a leading role in European innovation initiatives. The Dutch government has already taken a promising first step by joining a European pilot within the STIP programme.

Biodiesel in the United States: A Market Overview

Biodiesel is a biodegradable, renewable fuel produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled cooking grease. It stands out as one of the few sustainable fuels that can be used directly in existing diesel engines with minimal modifications. It is commonly blended into petroleum diesel in ratios such as B5, B20, or used as B100 (pure biodiesel), depending on emission goals and engine compatibility.

Across the United States, biodiesel is widely used in:

Transportation (trucks, buses, marine vessels)

Agriculture (tractors, harvesters, farm machinery)

Commercial and municipal fleets

Industrial applications

Home heating systems through Bioheat®

Power generation in backup and distributed energy systems

As states and industries commit to renewable energy targets, biodiesel continues to gain traction as a scalable and proven low-carbon solution, especially in sectors where electrification is difficult or economically unfeasible.

Key Market Growth Drivers

1. Government Policies and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)

Government incentives remain a dominant force behind biodiesel adoption. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires fuel refiners to blend increasing amounts of renewable fuels—including biodiesel—into the national fuel mix.

One of the most influential incentives is the Biodiesel Tax Credit (BTC), which helps reduce costs for producers and end users, making biodiesel more competitive with petroleum diesel.

In December 2023, the EPA established volume requirements for the RFS program for 2023–2025, including categories such as:

Biomass-based diesel

Cellulosic biofuel

Advanced biofuel

Total renewable fuel

This update also introduced regulatory improvements across the RFS program, streamlining compliance and strengthening incentives for producers. Although the EPA has not yet finalized renewable electricity provisions for RIN generation, the broader regulatory updates signal ongoing commitment to expanding renewable fuel use nationwide.

These policies collectively support industry profitability, feedstock investment, and long-term growth.

2. Surge in Demand for Low-Carbon and Sustainable Fuels

As climate priorities intensify, American industries, states, and large fleet operators are aggressively adopting low-carbon fuels. Biodiesel reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions significantly compared to petroleum diesel, making it an essential tool for meeting sustainability commitments.

States with stringent climate targets—such as California, Washington, and New York—are accelerating biodiesel adoption through mandates, incentives, and carbon reduction programs.

The U.S. Department of Energy’s Pathways to Commercial Liftoff report highlighted the potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to dramatically reduce aviation emissions. As biodiesel technologies advance, synergies between biodiesel production and SAF pathways further strengthen the overall renewable fuels ecosystem.

Corporate fleets, public transportation agencies, and agricultural operations are also incorporating biodiesel into daily operations, driven by:

Sustainability reporting requirements

Corporate ESG goals

Pressure to reduce carbon footprints

Lower sulfur emissions and engine benefits

With both environmental and economic appeal growing stronger, biodiesel’s demand trajectory continues to rise across industries.

3. Technological Advancements in Biodiesel Production

Innovation across biofuel production technologies is making biodiesel more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally competitive. New processing methods—including improved transesterification and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) technologies—are enhancing fuel quality and increasing output yield.

Researchers are also exploring next-generation feedstocks such as:

Algae-based biofuels

Waste-derived feedstocks

Advanced grease and fat recycling technologies

These advancements reduce dependence on traditional vegetable oils and help producers diversify supply chains.

In 2023, Be8, a global bioenergy company, expanded into the U.S. market by investing in both biofuel technology and cereal-based ethanol ventures—demonstrating increasing foreign investment in U.S. biofuels and the broader potential for technology-led expansion.

As technology improves and production costs fall, biodiesel becomes even more competitive with petroleum diesel and other renewable alternatives.

Market Challenges

1. Feedstock Price Volatility

Feedstock accounts for the majority of biodiesel production costs. Prices for key feedstocks—including soybean oil, corn oil, canola oil, and animal fats—can fluctuate sharply due to:

Weather disruptions

Global supply chain instability

Agricultural policy changes

International trade dynamics

When feedstock prices rise, biodiesel becomes less price-competitive compared to fossil diesel, challenging producers and squeezing profit margins.

2. Competition from Other Renewable Fuels

While biodiesel is a major renewable fuel, it faces growing competition from:

Renewable diesel (RD)

Electric vehicles (EVs)

Hydrogen fuel cells

Renewable diesel, in particular, poses a strong challenge because it is chemically identical to petroleum diesel, requiring no modifications to existing infrastructure.

The expansion of EV incentives and charging infrastructure also risks shifting demand away from liquid biofuels in the long term.

For biodiesel to maintain market share, ongoing innovation, cost reduction, and feedstock diversification will be essential.

United States Biodiesel Market Breakdown by Key Segments

1. Biodiesel for Fuel Applications

The fuel segment remains the largest and fastest-growing application in the U.S. Commercial trucking fleets, transit systems, shipping operators, and government agencies increasingly use biodiesel blends such as B20 to reduce emissions and extend engine life.

Federal and state renewable fuel policies continue to bolster demand, positioning the fuel segment for robust long-term expansion.

2. Biodiesel from Vegetable Oils

Vegetable oils—primarily soybean, canola, and corn oil—account for the largest share of biodiesel feedstock.

Growth in this segment is supported by:

Expanded domestic crop production

Advances in oil extraction technology

Federal support for U.S. agriculture

However, this category remains vulnerable to global commodity market fluctuations.

3. Biodiesel from Animal Fats

Animal fats, tallow, and used cooking grease offer a cost-efficient alternative to vegetable oils. Their increasing availability from rendering plants and food processing facilities supports growing biodiesel output.

This segment benefits from:

Waste-to-energy sustainability initiatives

Lower feedstock costs

High energy return compared to vegetable oils

Environmental policies encouraging recycled feedstocks are expected to accelerate growth in this category.

Key State Markets

California

A national leader in renewable fuel adoption, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) drives significant biodiesel usage. The state’s vast trucking and public transportation networks rely heavily on biodiesel blends such as B20.

In April 2022, BDI-BioEnergy International commissioned a new biodiesel facility in Bakersfield, underscoring growing investment in the region.

Final Thoughts

The United States biodiesel market is moving into a decade defined by policy-driven acceleration, technological innovation, and rising corporate sustainability commitments. With a projected value of US$ 20.29 billion by 2033, biodiesel is positioned to remain an essential component of America’s renewable fuel strategy—especially in hard-to-electrify sectors like trucking, agriculture, maritime, and industrial operations.

Although challenges such as feedstock price volatility and competition from renewable diesel and electric mobility persist, the biodiesel sector continues to evolve. Expanding feedstock sources, adopting new processing technologies, and strengthening state-level renewable fuel policies will be key to ensuring long-term growth and energy resilience.

As the U.S. moves towards a cleaner, more sustainable fuel economy, biodiesel stands out as a practical, scalable, and economically viable solution—fueling a greener future while strengthening domestic energy independence.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/693bcfaccdbf4f001d79f8a5.jpg",N,,2025-12-12 06:56:58.509500

The future of not just Lindsey oil but the whole oil refining sector is at stake.
The Grangemouth oil refinery operated for over a century, and was Scotland’s only oil refinery before refining officially ended in April this year.","I beg to move,

That this House has considered the future of the oil refining sector.

It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr Western. I am pleased that this debate has attracted considerable support, particularly from north of the border, and that today The Times had a timely editorial on this issue.

My constituency is in northern Lincolnshire on the south bank of the Humber, which has been christened “the UK’s Energy Estuary”. In recent years, the Humber has become a world-leader in the offshore and renewable energy sector—something we are proud of locally. However, while the Humber is full of opportunity for offshore and renewable energy and will play a significant role in the UK’s net zero efforts, we must not overlook the UK’s carbon energy needs as we make the transition to cleaner energy sources. We must face the fact that a significant portion of our total energy consumption still comes from oil, gas and coal and will continue to do so. The UK’s annual total primary energy consumption is around 130 million to 140 million tonnes of oil equivalent; fossil fuels made up roughly 79% to 81% of that in the year 2022-23.

The Humber has played a significant role in ensuring that that demand is met. Until the crisis at Lindsey oil refinery in my constituency earlier this year, the Humber could boast of producing a third of the UK’s refined fuel, with two of the UK’s six major oil refineries based in the Humber region. Now, as we approach the end of 2025, only four operational refineries remain in the UK, following this year’s closure of Grangemouth, with significant job losses, and the uncertainty at the aforementioned Lindsey refinery where over 400 people are employed. Even more striking is the fact that the number of refineries is down from 18 in the 1970s.

Sadly for the oil refining sector, most people do not even realise that it exists or appreciate its importance, yet the sector is a vital part of the UK’s energy security. A number of our crucial sectors rely on it, including the transport industry and defence sectors. All Members will know that oil refineries produce products that are essential for our critical energy needs, such as petrol, diesel, jet fuel and fuel oil. The Lindsey refinery has a capacity equivalent to around 35% of British petrol consumption and 10% of British diesel, and also supplies aviation fuel to Heathrow via pipeline.

Yet the House of Commons Library states:

“Refinery output in 2024 was 48 million tonnes. This was 55% below the 1973 peak.”

Output in 2024

“was around 14% below levels from the late 2010s and more than 40% below output from the start of the century.”

That is worrying considering that refineries supply 47% of the UK’s final energy demand, as 100% of aviation, 97% of road and 61% of rail transport still relies on liquid fuels. The refineries also support 100,000-plus jobs across the UK, with 4,000 directly in the refineries. We collect £37 billion annually in tax—that is duty and VAT—from them, and they deliver low-carbon fuels that have an impact equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road each year. That is not to mention the fact that ours are among the lowest-carbon refineries globally—in fact, 80% of the UK’s top import partners have a higher carbon intensity—yet despite their importance we have seen the closure at Grangemouth and the uncertainty at Lindsey.

What does the future hold? UK oil refineries continue to face a number of challenges. Of course demand for refined products will decrease as the country continues to reduce its emissions in accordance with the legally binding commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, though that target may change. Moreover, energy is the single largest cost of operating a refinery. The industry faces high energy costs, and carbon costs negatively impact the competitiveness of UK refineries. UK refineries are essentially competing with one hand tied behind their back while their competitors pay little or nothing in carbon costs. That is on top of the issue of unequal access to decarbonisation opportunities.

Our route to lower emissions must not come at the price of deindustrialisation or at the expense of our energy security. As an editorial in The Times today points out, some in the Government are so hostile to fossil fuels and so beholden to the green ideology that they are willing to sacrifice our future income and tolerate the jobs that are being lost. We must put the national interest first. Moreover, our climate targets are still some way off, so in the meantime we must continue to rely on the products that refineries produce.

The sector remains vital for today’s economy, yet our refineries are closing. We must realise that closing UK refineries does not reduce demand; it merely shifts production abroad. That, of course, often leads to higher emissions. We are thereby exporting jobs outside the UK while failing in our efforts to cut emissions. Losing further capacity would therefore leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports and the unpredictability of global politics, relying on other nations that often have weak rules on environmental protection, labour rights and safety.

Moreover, once a refinery closes, it does not return. The skills, infrastructure and investment are lost permanently. We must also consider the impact on the local economy and local people that closures cause. At Lindsey, over 400 people are directly employed on the site, and well over 1,000 rely on it through the supply chain. As North Lincolnshire council said in its position statement on Lindsey oil, the implications of any closure of the site will have far-reaching consequences for the local economy and the people employed directly and indirectly.

The council has stated that the potential closure of the refinery will have a significant impact on local market confidence, particularly following the turmoil at British Steel earlier this year. As such, failure to properly support the businesses impacted could multiply exponentially the impact of the closure. Moreover, the south Humber bank, where the site is located, relies on the interconnectivity of its industrial supply chains. As such, the refinery is not an isolated operator but an integral node in a wider network that supplies products to downstream users, and disruption at one site can quickly ripple across the regional economy.

These integrated clusters work in tandem, reflecting the modern industrial model, and our economic resilience relies on the system being maintained, thereby ensuring long-term industrial sustainability in the UK. I note the Scottish Affairs Committee’s conclusions on the handling of Grangemouth, which can be found in the Committee’s recently published report on Scotland’s oil and gas industries. I am sure the Chair of the Committee, the hon. Member for Glasgow West (Patricia Ferguson), will delve more deeply into the detail of the report, though let me quickly say now that the report stated that both the UK and Scottish Governments should have acted sooner to prepare for the crisis in Falkirk.

The hon. Member makes an important point: it is the case that such decisions are not solely commercial; the Government must consider, more widely, energy security and the impact on the economy.

In preparation for this debate, I received representations from various interested parties that are dependent on the oil refining sector. They have outlined their concerns, some of which I have mentioned already, and the solutions they would like to see put forward. One issue that has been mentioned to me is the expansion of the scope of the carbon border adjustment mechanism to include oil refineries’ products. As Members may know, the CBAM is a tax levied on goods at the border based on their carbon content. Expanding the CBAM to products from oil refineries based overseas, as the Government proposed in their autumn Budget, would enable domestic oil refineries to remain competitive and stop them fighting with one arm tied behind their back.

I mentioned that the refining sector is subject to ever-increasing regulatory burdens and carbon pricing. Sadly, the impact of net zero politics, particularly the UK emissions trading scheme, is driving rapid and sustained deindustrialisation of the British economy. Refining receives substantially lower free allowances under the scheme compared with other industries, such as steel and cement, and ETS costs are one of the highest expenditures in a refinery’s operating budget. Competitors in other regions do not face those costs, which seriously damages the competitiveness of UK refineries. We must realise that the ETS damages our energy security and should be urgently repealed. Longer-term solutions may include bringing refined products fully into the UK CBAM or ensuring that the UK retains control over refineries in any future UK-EU carbon market linkage agreement. If we do not want to let this issue get any more out of control, we must act now.

Before concluding, I refer back to the situation at Lindsey oil, because the company is in administration. We have a situation in which FTI Consulting, acting on behalf of the official receiver, is engaged in discussions with potential buyers and investors. Those talks are rightly confidential, and when questioned, Ministers have repeatedly said that they are awaiting the recommendations from FTI. That inevitably feeds speculation through the grapevine that angers employees and their union representatives. I have held meetings with two consortia that are interested in buying the whole site and continuing operations, and the leader of North Lincolnshire council has held discussions with a third. Do the Government support a deal that would retain the refinery complete? Until now there has been no answer. I again ask the Minister: do the Government favour that option and, if necessary, would they provide some support?

Have the Government instructed FTI to prioritise jobs? A letter from Unite the Union to the Secretary of State throws that into doubt. In the letter, Unite says:

“In this vein you informed me and the Unite reps for the refinery on two occasions that you had advised FTI that bids which save the jobs should be prioritised and that if needed, there could be government money for a viable bid which saved the site.”

Is Government money available? The reply seems to throw doubt on all of that. The reply from the Minister for Energy to Sharon Graham at Unite says that the Government

“have made repeatedly clear that long-term and sustainable employment is a priority for the Government”,

but that does not necessarily mean it is a priority that has been passed on to the official receiver.

At a meeting with me and the hon. Member for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes (Melanie Onn), the Minister for Energy assured us that if the worst came to the worst and the refinery were to close, or there were to be large- scale job losses, one option would be for the Government to work with MPs, local authorities and other agencies to form a taskforce to consider what help and support would be available to revive the local economy. Is that offer still open? My understanding is that the Government have said that there will be no further redundancies until the end of March, which I welcome. Could today’s Minister clarify whether the Government are meeting the cost of that, or whether the costs will be taken into account by the administrators and the amount available to creditors adjusted accordingly?

The future of not just Lindsey oil but the whole oil refining sector is at stake. The Government must review their current position and act to secure the industry for the future.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate. I speak in my capacity as a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee, which has recently published a report, “The future of Scotland’s oil and gas industry”, as part of our inquiry into Scotland’s role in the UK’s energy transition. I thank the hon. Member for allowing the report to be tagged to this debate on the Order Paper.

The closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery, following the Petroineos announcement in November 2023 that refining operations would cease at the site, was a key focus of our report. The Grangemouth oil refinery operated for over a century, and was Scotland’s only oil refinery before refining officially ended in April this year. The refinery’s closure has left some 400 employees and the wider Grangemouth community facing deep uncertainty. The Prime Minister’s pledge of £200 million through the National Wealth Fund for future industries at the site was welcome, as was the Scottish Government’s announcement of £25 million to help establish a just transition for Grangemouth. The extra £14.5 million announced in the Budget was another welcome boost. However, the Government have not yet set out how that will be delivered and how it will tangibly result in jobs.

The Committee visited the Grangemouth site during our inquiry. We heard oral evidence from Petroineos, the company that owns the refinery, from its parent company Ineos, from union representatives, from Project Willow and from the Forth Valley college, which provides the skills support for former refinery workers. Our report concluded that both Governments should have acted sooner to set in motion plans for the site’s future and to prepare for resulting job losses. That lack of action created an employment gap and hardship to the local community that could have been avoided.

We said in our report that Grangemouth is the “canary in a coalmine” and a stark warning of what is to come. That warning proved prescient: just a few months on from the publication of the report, ExxonMobil announced its plans to shut the Mossmorran ethylene plant in February 2026. That is yet another example of Scotland’s rapidly changing industrial base. As we move away from our reliance on fossil fuels, industrial transition will only accelerate. For our national resilience, we must learn from these cases.

The Grangemouth case has illustrated the need for the Government’s active stewardship in the energy transition. Our report recommends that the Government set out clear principles that outline the conditions and actions that underpin a just transition. We recommend principles that emphasise the importance of early Government intervention, proactive engagement with workers and communities, and a focus on decent jobs. Those principles should draw on best practice and ensure that transitions are fair and planned, not rushed and reactive.

Last month, the Minister for Energy, my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen (Michael Shanks), said that announcements will be forthcoming on the investment proposals brought forward by the National Wealth Fund. I understand that the first project to be funded on the site was announced today: a groundbreaking biotech company using by-products from whisky distillation, which is jointly funded by both the UK and Scottish Governments’ £3 million of investment and hopes to deliver over 300 good jobs. That announcement is welcome.

The timescales of establishing future industries at Grangemouth and the jobs that they will create all hinge on the types of investment proposal put forward. I commend the Committee’s report to all hon. Members. A response from the Government is expected by Christmas; I hope that that response will recognise the sentiment in our report that continued momentum on Grangemouth’s future is vital. Project Willow must not be left to gather dust while jobs are at stake. Communities that have powered our economy for generations deserve certainty and a fair future.

That may be a fair point. I said at the beginning of my speech that I am not a climate change sceptic. Everybody is prepared to do their bit.

I have already mentioned wind farms, but what about solar energy? In Lincolnshire we are prepared to have solar energy on our farmland, but in my constituency 16,000 acres of the most productive land in the entire country—enough land to feed the city of Hull every single year—is put under solar farms, with panels manufactured in China, destroying our ability to feed ourselves. There has to be a balance, but at the moment we do not have one. We are importing so much from our dear friends in Norway that they are opening 250 exploration wells.

This debate, secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham, is extremely timely. The closure of Lindsey oil refinery is a complete disaster. It employs many of our constituents and is vital for the whole of our industrial infrastructure. We need strong domestic refining capacity. The Secretary of State goes on about energy security all the time, but that would strengthen energy security at a time when we are already importing two thirds of our gas and increasing volumes of refined fuels.

I would not mind these green policies, but we are not actually contributing to tackling global warming; we are simply exporting carbon emissions to other countries. It is complete madness. If we were sensible about this, and if it were possible to get some sort of global recognition of the problem, maybe we could start to tackle it. Relying on foreign refiners means exporting jobs and value overseas while leaving Britain more exposed to global price shocks and geopolitical risks. Expansion of the UK refining sector protects thousands of highly skilled, well-paid jobs. It also supports an entire region and supply chain in engineering, fabrication, logistics and maintenance. Those are precisely the jobs that sustain industrial communities and create apprenticeships for young people.

Refining underpins every major industrial sector. Manufacturing, aviation, defence, logistics, agriculture and pharmaceuticals all depend on reliable supplies of fuels and petrochemicals. Allowing it to pass into decline would simply shift production to countries with weaker environmental standards.

Lindsey oil refinery was a major economic anchor for our area. We know that it was put into administration. I share the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham: this is a national crisis in terms of national policy, which is wrong, and of local policy. The people of Greater Lincolnshire demand action from this Government, and they demand it now.

It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair today, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this highly important debate, and I draw everyone’s attention to my membership of Unite the union.

Since coming to this place, I have repeatedly raised the issue of the Grangemouth oil refinery closing, with 435 jobs lost on site and 2,822 lost in the wider supply chain. Closure means an end to a century of oil refining on the site and to a generational employer for Grangemouth people. Nearly every family in the town has had someone, or knows someone, who worked at the site. There is no doubt about it: local businesses will feel the pain of the closure. The hairdressers, barbers, small independent retailers, hotels, restaurants, pubs and garages are the very businesses that make up the heartbeat of the local community and the town’s economy. They are all negatively impacted.

The closure is more than just a local constituency issue. It is Scotland’s biggest industrial issue in four decades, it is safe to say, since the end of the coalmining industry. To put the matter into the national context, the Grangemouth refinery was worth more than £400 million per annum to the Scottish economy, according to both Scottish Enterprise and PwC. While conflict rages on in Europe, British people have been susceptible to the resulting price shocks and disrupted supply chains that have impacted the oil industry in Europe. At this perilous time, with refining ending at Grangemouth, Scotland is now in the ridiculous position of importing our own oil. The energy-abundant nation of Scotland is reliant on global logistics and outside influences for our oil products. It is incredible that we have lost our self-sufficiency.

Why has this happened? Why did the refinery close? I will say something different from what right hon. and hon. Members have mentioned so far. Let me be clear: the idea that the Grangemouth refinery closed as part of trying to achieve net zero, or as part of some woke green agenda or an environmental campaign, is utter nonsense. The real reason—the heart of the matter—is Petroineos. It is made up of private capital, Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos and a foreign Government in the form of Chinese state-backed PetroChina. It controlled the Grangemouth refinery, a key piece of Scottish and British national infrastructure, and closure was a commercial decision.

Closure happened because it was more profitable for a private company to make hundreds of workers redundant and operate Grangemouth as an import terminal. It was international capital concerned with the corporate greed of a billionaire owner, with shareholder dividends their priority. That is the ruthless nature of how international capital works. Ratcliffe has massively weakened Scotland’s national economy and jeopardised our country’s energy security for his own needs. I am disgusted by Governments allowing that to happen, and by the pandering to Ratcliffe in spending billions of pounds to help with the regeneration around Old Trafford and hundreds of millions of pounds to provide a loan guarantee for his plant in Belgium.

I make absolutely no apologies for being ideological. As the country sacrificed state ownership of vital infrastructure, we lost control of our own refinery. We have seen job losses, an exodus of skills and talent, local shops closing and all the social consequences that follow deindustrialisation. That is what has happened to former industrial towns the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. For goodness’ sake! The country needs a different industrial direction, to bring an end to being at the mercy of private capital and foreign Government influence.

There is a clear, coherent case for Government ownership. It is in the public interest. In questions to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and to the Treasury, I have asked what ownership stake the UK Government are willing to take in future industries at Grangemouth. I put the same question to the Minister this afternoon.

Just as I make no apologies for being ideological in my opinion of public ownership, I make no apologies for criticising both the UK and Scottish Governments. We know that oil will be part of the energy mix for decades to come, so it is time for both of Scotland’s Governments to be bold. The existing infrastructure of the Grangemouth refinery is largely still in place, and there should be a conversion to sustainable aviation fuel there.

We have signed up to highly ambitious mandates, so let us try to meet those targets. Successful conversion of refineries is there for everyone to see—at La Mède in France, Eni’s Venice refinery in Italy and Phillips’s Rodeo refinery in the US. I say this to the Minister today: what happens at Grangemouth will go a long way in deciding how we shape our future economy, who controls it and who this Government actually serve and work for.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I commend the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate. I also acknowledge the contribution of the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman), who spoke with his usual passion, but today I believe with a degree of anger as well, and rightly so.

A just transition supports and protects existing oil and gas sector workers through—I emphasise “through”—the transition to a world-class renewables workforce, a transition in which Scotland is well placed to lead the world. I want to share the following quote:

“‘just transition’ has now become meaningless for so many people and that’s a failure… People should feel like that’s not something done to them, but something they’re part of shaping.”

That was said by the Minister for Energy in a recent interview with the Holyrood magazine. Sadly, for thousands of workers in North sea upstream, midstream and—in the case of refining—downstream jobs, a just transition is far removed from the reality that they face.

The workers now made redundant are angry at the UK Government’s failure to support their transition. Their families and communities are also angry, as are we, their representatives. We know that the just transition is doomed to fail because of three things: first, the failure to press forward with renewable energy schemes in north-east Scotland at the urgent pace that is required; secondly, the failure to allow new exploration licences while persisting with the crippling energy profits levy on the oil and gas sector; and thirdly, the failure to protect refinery jobs at Grangemouth and Mossmorran. Today I learned that 7,000 business leaders, workers and companies have signed a letter to the Prime Minister in which they demand change to the EPL to avoid the projected 1,000 job losses per month.

Looking specifically at the situation in Grangemouth in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, the leader of the Labour party in Scotland, said that a Labour UK Government would

“step in to save the jobs at the refinery and to invest in that transition…and we would put hundreds of millions of pounds behind it to make it a reality.”

No doubt the Minister will cite the £200 million promised to support Grangemouth, and reference has been made to the Scottish Government’s contribution. Of course, today brings good news in that regard, with MiAlgae’s welcome investment announcement on top of the Celtic Renewables project. The Scottish Government are an active partner in funding those projects, and we welcome the investment. However, the funding announced today amounts to only £7.73 million in total, and the 280 jobs —perhaps more—will not be fully realised for five years, if ever. Where is the rest of the promised £200 million? Where is fulfilment of the promise made by the leader of the Labour party in Scotland? Where is the intervention that occurred for Scunthorpe? People need work now. Families need certainty, but all they face this Christmas is uncertainty. In the meantime, the refinery workforce has been largely cast aside.

Looking further afield in Scotland, including Prax Lindsey, the UK has lost a third of its oil refineries just this year, on this Government’s watch. Furthermore, it is an uncomfortable truth for the Government that the UK’s uniquely high energy costs—the highest in the G7—are one of the main factors harming the refining sector and industry more generally.

I acknowledge that the North sea basin is in decline, but the importance of sovereign capability in national security is often repeated from the Government Front Bench. It is particularly true in defence, but how can defence capability be even remotely claimed if the vital fuel needed to operate tanks, ships and aircraft is acquired in the quantities needed through imports from abroad? Those imports can hardly be described as secure in this currently very dangerous world. Refining sites, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth, have great potential for such things as sustainable aviation fuel production, but this remains a jam tomorrow promise. This is not remotely a positive trend for our economy, our environment, or, vitally, our national security.

I must press the Minister to address these questions. How can she tell the thousands of directly employed and supply chain workers at Grangemouth, Prax Lindsey and the many other sites and companies that are shedding workforce in the oil and gas sector that they are part of shaping the just transition? What assurance can she give those workers that the future is bright, especially when the Acorn project in my constituency faces growing uncertainty, for example? I urge her to address those questions in her speech. The destruction of the refinery jobs is a repetition of the Thatcherite coal mine closures and the steel plant shutdowns, with no plan for the workers, their families and the communities affected. We have long memories in Scotland. Only with the full powers of independence in areas such as energy policy will the workforce at Grangemouth and elsewhere in Scotland’s oil and gas sector get the priority and the just transition to the future that they so richly deserve.

It is a privilege to serve under your chairship, Mr Western. I congratulate the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) on securing this important debate, and I agree with his comments regarding the strategic importance of oil refineries for their communities—if only colleagues who were previously in government had grasped that before the decision by Petroineos to close Grangemouth in November 2023 was announced.

As has been remarked by colleagues, 2026 will mark the first year since, I believe, 1850 that Scotland does not have an oil refinery. This year marked 101 years since the start of oil refining in Grangemouth, and the date that refining ceased in April 2025 was a devastating time for the community I represent, the community of my hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman), the whole of Scotland and the United Kingdom. I remember sitting in the Falkirk council chamber when the announcement was made. The implications were obvious immediately: the loss of many of the highest-paying jobs in the Falkirk area, and the loss of a substantial tax base for Falkirk council and the Scottish and UK Governments. The announcement was completely unexpected for those of us in opposition parties, who were not in the know.

The failure of Government, as my hon. Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire (Douglas McAllister) has articulated on behalf of the Scottish Affairs Committee, to prepare our community or have a plan in place for a no job loss transition at Grangemouth refinery has become symbolic of a similar story happening across industrial communities for decades. It was infuriating to find out from the Scottish Affairs Committee report that, through late 2023 and 2024, when it would have mattered, many of the decision makers failed to act to prevent the unjust transition at Grangemouth.

Petroineos confirmed to the Committee in April 2025 that, in the years prior to the announcement in November 2023, the then UK and Scottish Governments had requested information from the company, and subsequently chosen not to make an investment decision that would have saved the refinery. It was engaged for years with Government and no one lifted a finger to stop the path to the closure of refinery operations. Although I wish we had grasped the reality of the situation far more clearly in the transition from opposition to entering government, I welcome the determination of Ministers to get investment into Grangemouth quickly so that we can deliver that new industry to the community.

Today—two weeks after the Chancellor allocated further Government funding to Grangemouth to speed up investment decisions—marks an exceptionally positive announcement for the area. Up to 310 jobs are coming to Grangemouth to support the construction and operation of MiAlgae, a Scottish biotech success story. That does not, however, diminish the fact that many high-paid, high-skilled jobs have been lost, and the constant worry that they and the industry will never come back is justifiably the primary emotion that still grips my community.

We have an obligation not to repeat the mistakes of the past. We do not want the workers at Grangemouth, many of whom have not found employment since the closure in April, to be lost to the middle east, America or Norway. There is still a future for high-skilled refining workers at Grangemouth. That is why I welcome the Skills Transition Centre, announced back in February, funded out of the Falkirk and Grangemouth growth deal, which this Labour Government enhanced by £10 million when we came to power. However, the college that contains the skills centre is facing an existential financial crisis. One of the three campuses that constitutes Forth Valley college—the Alloa campus, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth —is directly jeopardised by the 20% real-terms cut inflicted on colleges since 2021 by the SNP Government.

The pathways for local kids to grasp the new industrial opportunities coming to our community will be actively barred if Government settlements for our further education sector are insufficient. Any consolidation that followed the closure of the Alloa campus would affect the courses available for thousands of young people in Falkirk, Stirling and especially Clackmannanshire. Kenny MacInnes, the principal of Forth Valley college, rightly reminded a conference recently that the college will be an instrumental part of whatever comes next at Grangemouth. The Scottish Government must bear that and Colleges Scotland’s recently published report in mind when they set their budget next year if they ever want to speak credibly about rebuilding opportunities in my community.

I note the attendance, and I welcome the hon. Gentleman’s presence in this debate. However, when we were talking about the Grangemouth refinery at the time that it mattered, in the previous Parliament, I note there was an active lack of interest from SNP politicians, with the exception of the former Member for East Lothian, who is no longer a member of the Scottish National party. I have raised the concern, and I have asked for direct intervention from my Government about skills funding for the college during Treasury questions. I very much welcome the enhancement of the local growth deal, which enabled the skills centre to be built.

I will talk about the future of the refining sector. Since being elected I have repeatedly made the case that the best opportunity for Grangemouth is in refining biofuels, especially sustainable aviation fuel, due to its industrial role as a fuel supplier for Glasgow and Edinburgh throughout history, its equal proximity to Scotland’s two largest and busiest airports, its operational capacity and its proximity to a town that has the infrastructure necessary to host the required contractors.

The £200 million national wealth fund commitment to Grangemouth first proposed by Scottish Labour MPs late last year, fought for by Scottish Labour Ministers and announced by the Prime Minister in February, should be spent primarily on developing a new anchor industry for our community that complements the existing skills profile of refinery workers. Ideally, we would not give private international capital a full stake in the project. Many businesses are interested in investing in refining biofuels at Grangemouth, and they are calling for policy certainty during the transitional phase into sustainable aviation fuel.

Legislative measures such as the SAF mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism go a long way towards that, after the Government picked up the work that was delayed for far too long under the previous Administration. However, I would like the Minister to address the following points. Clarity on the revenue certainty mechanism and the pre-contractual work that can be carried out is crucial. Will the Government enable pre-contractual work to be carried out, as we did through contracts for difference, so that there are no delays once the RCM comes into effect later next year?

Project Willow mentioned a proposal to delay the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids cap. Despite substantial questioning from me, that has not been addressed yet by Ministers at either the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero or the Department for Transport. Will the Government consider altering, delaying or lifting the cap following that recommendation? Finally, it would be useful to have an update on how the £200 million is being deployed, following the welcome announcement on MiAlgae this year.

If the right hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, he is more than welcome.

What the Government did not realise at the time is that when they got rid of a coalmine—each coalmine had a football team, a rugby team, a cricket team, a community club, a miners’ welfare, a brass band and a bandstand in the local welfare grounds—it destroyed whole communities, and those communities will never come back. They will never be the same again.

Fast forward 40-odd years and we have a Labour Chancellor and Government, who we would think would protect these industries. Look at the hypocrisy in that part of the world. We have Drax power station, which used to burn coal from a nearby coalmine, just a few miles down the road. I think that was shut about 10 years ago. I remember the Energy Secretary at the time was campaigning to keep it open. How things have changed! The power station now burns wooden pellets from trees chopped down in North America—in Canada. They chop the trees down and put them on diesel-guzzling cargo ships. They then chop them up into pellets using diesel-guzzling machinery on the ship. They then come to this country, are put on diesel-guzzling cargo trains and transported to Drax power station, where we set fire to them. And we say that is renewable energy. That costs the British taxpayer about £1 million a day in subsidies. I think it has cost about £10 billion so far since we have been using wooden pellets there.

Just a few miles down the road we have the perfectly good Lindsey oil refinery, which appears to be doomed, with 400 jobs at risk and a thousand more in the supply chain. If the Government are going to use taxpayers’ money to subsidise industry or keep places open, they should look at the oil refineries, because once they have gone, they are never coming back, and we have lost the community and that sense of pride.

There are not many Government Members here, to be honest—I cannot see many—although I will thank the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) for his passionate contribution. I did not catch most of it because I am a little bit deaf; I will sit a bit closer next time.

It is a real pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for leading the debate. The very thrust of the issue that the hon. Member for Ashfield (Lee Anderson) underlined, and that I endorse, is how it changes communities whenever disastrous decisions are taken.

The future of the UK oil refining industry has become an increasingly urgent topic as we navigate the pressures of energy security and the transition to net zero. I should have welcomed the Minister to her position; I wish her well in it. I am not sure whether today’s is a good debate for her to be answering questions, but that is by the way—we will see how it all goes. We have seen the closure of two major oil refineries this year, so it is important that we are here to discuss the future of our fossil fuel sector across the United Kingdom.

This debate is important not just for the constituencies represented by, for example, the hon. Members for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) and for Falkirk (Euan Stainbank), but for us in Northern Ireland as well. Our oil came from Grangemouth and Lindsey, so the impact for us in Northern Ireland will be the same as it is for everybody else. The difference will be that we will not be getting oil from within the United Kingdom and will have to buy it from outside. That concerns me greatly.

I commend the Members who have spoken. In particular, I commend the hon. Member for Alloa and Grangemouth for his passion, which he always shows in the main Chamber and here in Westminster Hall. He puts forward his case incredibly well.

The UK’s oil-refining capacity has shrunk substantially over the past 20 years or so. As of 2023, total refining capacity stood at roughly 1.22 million barrels per day, and the UK produced around 51.45 million tonnes of refined petroleum products. Some people ask how this effects the workers. Many of us have constituents who work in the oilfields—I think nearly every constituency has them; I know I have them in Strangford—and this impacts on them as well. Northern Ireland does not have any operating crude oil refinery, and all refined fuels, such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel, are imported.

Historically, some of Northern Ireland’s fuel came from refineries across the rest of the UK, with the products shipped or piped to Northern Ireland terminals. For example, Petronas, which until 2025 operated the Grangemouth refinery, supplied almost all the fuel for Northern Ireland. We have witnessed the closure of two refineries, Grangemouth and Lindsey, and Members have outlined their concerns, whether they represent the area or are here to speak on behalf of others. There is no doubt about the significant impact on where we source fuel. Events in the wider UK refining sector, such as closures or capacity losses, will have knock-on effects on fuel security, price stability and supply chain resilience in Northern Ireland. The impact will be felt by us all.

We have witnesses the United Kingdom’s reliance on imports, and there has been a significant impact in terms of job losses, and the redundancy of engineers, technicians and maintenance workers. We also have to recognise the significant loss of skill and experience. Even if things were to change in time, those people will have moved elsewhere, so how do we start again? That is, if we are able to start again, of course.

Furthermore, the closure of refineries has an impact on associated industries such as petrochemical storage and marine freight. The impact is like a domino effect: one thing happens and it knocks on right down the line. With two large domestic refining assets having closed, the UK must now import more petrol and more diesel, which completely reduces our domestic control over fuel supplies.

I believe that we are doing our bit to improve our infrastructure and to adapt to net zero goals, but what does that mean in the meantime? I do not think anybody here does not believe that there is a role for net zero, for the green environment and for green energy, but we do not want to lose the core of our ability to produce oil for our own country. The United Kingdom’s commitment to net zero remains essential to protect the environment and for our long-term energy security, and to create new green industries. However, the recent closures of the refineries at Lindsey and Grangemouth show that the transition also brings real challenges for workers and local economies—for every economy right across this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland—affecting all the regions and our overall industrial capacity.

The transition has to be carefully managed. It is the responsibility of the Minister and this Government to ensure that we are equipped to deal with the changes, for the benefit of everyone in this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I always say that we are better together, but we have got to work together as well. We have to work together for everybody. That is what I ask the Minister: how can we make sure that we can all do it better together?

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Western. I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate, and all the Members who have spoken for their contributions. I declare an interest as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group for the future of aviation, travel and aerospace—we have done a lot of work on sustainable aviation fuel—and that I met representatives of Exolum, the International Air Transport Association, LanzaJet and the Tank Storage Association in preparation for this debate.

At times of great upheaval and change, it is tempting to look to political leaders, artists or other major cultural figures to get a sense of where the world is headed. That is certainly a popular approach among historians, but I think it misses something: the often pivotal role of engineers—and I say that not just because I am one myself, or was. It is not necessary to subscribe to an entirely materialistic view of history to recognise that engineers, no matter who they work for or where they work, are often at the vanguard of the kind of technological change that enables our wider political or social ambitions to be achieved. That was true at the cusp of the industrial revolution; it was true when the white heat of technology exploded the middle class in the ’50s; and it is true now, perhaps more than ever, as we embark on the mission to undo the damage to our environment that previous technological shifts have wrought. We must secure our energy supply so that we can withstand an ever more uncertain future, and transform our late-industrial malaise into a green, prosperous and abundant economy through a truly just transition.

Data from the oil and gas industry shows that it directly supports around 26,000 jobs across the UK and indirectly supports 95,000 more. These are largely jobs in offshore drilling, rigging, catering, scaffolding, onshore fabrication yards, anchor manufacturing and vessel maintenance, and there are more. It is also estimated that there are another 84,000 jobs among the hospitality workers, taxi drivers and others who serve industrial communities and are supported by them in turn. We have seen before what happens when there is a major industrial shift and we fail to support jobs and the communities they help to keep alive—from the closure of the pits to the ongoing crisis of British Steel. We must learn lessons from past deindustrialisations to avoid similar damage to communities today.

All policy makers should dedicate themselves to avoiding the traumatic manifestations of necessary—or, at the very least, foreseeable—moments. It is vital that any job losses in this sector are mitigated by reskilling and retraining with new green investment. However, right now in 2025, we are losing our traditional refining, chemicals and existing biofuel production capability and home-grown expertise. Complexity, departmental misalignment and a lack of pragmatism in public policy are holding back the existing and future fuels sector. The Government have the power to solve those things. I hope that today we can suggest and agree some constructive next steps.

Earlier this year, Liberal Democrat colleagues and I recognised the importance of the Government’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, will be one of the main enablers of aviation’s transition from polluting liquid fossil fuels to a future of hydrogen, battery and hybrid zero emission power plants. As part of that transition, SAF has a huge role to play in creating new green jobs and delivering on our energy security goals.

Local production creates jobs, improves resilience, reduces import dependence and stabilises prices, but without efficient resource allocation and strategic investment, future refinery closures could create severe supply bottlenecks and undermine our energy independence. It is equal parts encouraging that there is consensus among the serious political parties in this country about the need for transition and energy security, and concerning that from different ends of the spectrum, the Greens and Reform are either wilfully ignorant or unwilling to accept that supporting the oil refining industry to transition is critical.

The Greens seem willing to turn their back on any of the major technologies involved in the just transition of our fossil fuel infrastructure. They are locked into the pursuit of an ideological purity that sees those companies and producers solely as the problem and not as part of the solution. Reform’s static, stagnant and staggering belief that net zero is either bound to hurt working people or just bad in and of itself, only gives them the self-satisfied and smug smile of someone who thinks they know all the answers, but that could not be further from the truth.

I completely agree. That is why we are talking about a transition. It may well bring shivers to the hon. Member’s spine to talk about transitions, but it is critical that we talk about them in a reasonable and sensible way, and about how we look forward to the future rather than to the past. Reform’s approach is equally dogmatic and damaging as that of the Green party and has already been found wanting in practice in local government.

We can only make the transition a reality if we grasp the opportunity to utilise our existing oil refining infrastructure to turn to the chemistry of the future, with a diverse set of feedstocks from a wide range of supply points. We should be working with industry on delivering that, but industry leaders tell me that on the critical steps that the Government should be taking, they are going ignored or unheard.

Let us take bioethanol, for example. At the start of 2025, the UK bioethanol sector provided 895 million litres of renewable fuel production capacity and thousands of direct and indirect jobs. It was also a significant market for British agriculture and providing critical co-products such as carbon dioxide for the NHS, and for the food and drink sector. As of December 2025, the industry has been halved, following the US-UK trade deal.

An immediate solution would be to transition that bioethanol to SAF, as the alcohol-to-jet technology being developed in the UK can convert it into jet fuel. Under the SAF mandate rules, however, bioethanol readily produced in the UK—sustainable enough for a car engine—has been deemed not sustainable enough for a jet engine. Will the Minister consider the request of industry to support the UK’s bioethanol industry to continue operations and simultaneously support SAF production by allowing bioethanol use under the SAF mandate? The upcoming call for evidence on the role of crops under the UK SAF mandate should be released urgently, and a pragmatic approach taken.

Similarly, opening hydrogen storage subsidies to include liquid fuel infrastructure would ensure that existing assets could play a role in the hydrogen economy. Hydrogen storage is critical, but hydrogen production and usage are also critical to our future renewable goals and to providing the supply of SAF that will be required to decarbonise aviation. DFT rules state that, to make compliant SAF in the UK, hydrogen must be green hydrogen—rightly—and cannot be supported by the hydrogen production business model, a scheme established by DESNZ to get UK hydrogen production off the ground. That alone is not controversial. However, there is no green hydrogen available in the UK that will not be supported by the HPBM, which means that a portion of SAF using these renewable molecules will be uncompliant and, essentially, very expensive fossil jet fuel, despite it actually being green. I convey to the Minister the ask from industry that the DFT and DESNZ should be urgently working together to ensure interconnectivity with hydrogen policy and SAF policy, so that SAF producers are not penalised for using domestic industry?

I know that the hon. Member has a lot of knowledge on this issue. I think that looking at all the options that maintain capability is critical. What might come out of this is an ask for this Minister— or potentially the aviation Minister, the hon. Member for Selby (Keir Mather)—to sit down with our APPG, in which there is a lot of expertise, to talk about some of the ways that we can maintain capability but also achieve our transition and net zero goals.

A pragmatic approach could be not to apply the rules to smaller users of hydrogen—for example, where hydrogen accounts for less than 5% of feedstock—while a longer time is taken to consider the impacts for large-scale hydrogen users.

I now turn to our wider ecosystem of logistics infrastructure. Pipelines, storage and distribution networks are essential for connecting supply and demand, especially as the market shifts towards sustainable fuels and as we look to improve our energy security. For example, Exolum, which runs a 2,000 km onshore pipeline network that delivers 40% to 50% of the aviation fuel used for UK flights each year, is transforming its aviation fuel pipeline network to supply SAF.

To unlock further investment in the infrastructure and ensure a just transition, industry is calling for long-term policy signals, such as extending and increasing renewable fuel mandates; targeted incentives like business rates relief and payment holidays for new infrastructure; inclusive subsidy schemes for hydrogen storage; and fast-tracking obligations for renewable liquid heating fuels.

At present, most support for fuel infrastructure is directed towards large-scale production projects. Conversely, investment in storage and distribution infrastructure is increasingly undertaken at an operator’s own risk and often ahead of immediate market need. That imbalance is amplified by a business rates system that can disincentivise new investments and high-end capital projects—including energy transition initiatives—especially when the investment is by overseas companies likely to be looking for more cost-effective placement of funding in countries with more generous and strategic policies. How will the Minister ensure that policy and investment frameworks can support storage and distribution infrastructure, thereby enabling the development of a future-ready energy system, capable of responding to evolving market conditions and minimising supply chain risks?

The Liberal Democrats urge the Government fully to grasp the opportunities that our industrial capacity and workforce capability offer our country, to lead the world in a transition to next-generation fuels and energy. It is in our blood and our tradition as a country to grapple with these big technological questions, so it should be up to us to show what real leadership on the just transition looks like—not just because great feats of engineering are impressive in their own right, which they are, but because a whole generation of people whose lives and careers have been shaped by our oil refineries and wider energy sector, and future generations, are counting on that leadership. In recent years, the Conservatives abandoned it. We urgently need to get it back and provide stability for the communities most affected.

Home-grown, local renewable energy and fuels can be clean, cheap and popular, and they embed resilience. The Government must work with industry because striving for theoretical perfection, rather than ambitious but deliverable policy, risks choking the sector and neutering this revolution. Our engineers and industry stand ready to deliver, as they have done time and again, the greener economy that we need and that communities up and down the country deserve.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I congratulate and thank my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) on securing this timely and important debate. I pay tribute to him for his work in standing up for workers, not just at Prax Lindsey but across his constituency and his region—his energy estuary. I also thank the Father of the House, my right hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) for his wise words. We can support all energies; it is not an either/or. We must not run down the oil, gas and liquid fuel sector just for the want of achieving a target.

In 2025 alone, we have lost two of the UK’s six remaining refineries, with thousands of well-paid workers losing their jobs in the supply chain. Grangemouth and Prax Lindsey have closed, but not because we need any less petrol, diesel, jet fuel or heating oil—just as we will not need any less ethylene after the Mossmorran plant closed in Fife, or any less oil and gas when this Government wilfully shut down the North sea, destroying jobs in communities such as mine in Aberdeenshire.

As the Minister knows, we will simply become more dependent on foreign imports, lose billions of pounds in tax receipts that could support our public services, and destroy hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs in parts of the country that need them the most. We will, as the Minister also knows, strangle our domestic production and then import more products from countries with far higher emissions. We will offshore our carbon, offshore our jobs and offshore our security, all so that the Secretary of State can boast of global leadership at COP. No one is going to want to follow our lead if we make ourselves poorer and less secure. We will become a warning, not an example, to the rest of the world. It is ideology over national interest. As Labour’s friends in the unions say, it amounts to exporting jobs in order to import virtue.

The production at Prax Lindsey will now be replaced by imports from other countries. Ineos will retain its ethylene and propylene production at Grangemouth, but will now import ethane on huge diesel-chugging container ships from across the Atlantic. Perhaps the Minister would like to explain how that is going to reduce global carbon emissions.

Rian Chad Whitton has produced a fantastic report for the Prosperity Institute in which he explains in detail how high energy costs and carbon taxes are crippling heavy industry in the UK, but particularly our refineries. We spend a lot of time in this House talking about electricity—as we should, because our electricity prices are the highest in the world, and this Government are locking us and our constituents into higher prices for longer in the upcoming allocation round 7 auction—but what we often miss in our debates is that only a small proportion of our current energy consumption is from electricity. The vast majority of it comes from other fuels such as natural gas, and that is particularly true for our heavy industry and refining sector.

When refineries use natural gas to produce their products, they are subject to a carbon tax on every unit of CO2 they release. Refineries have no choice but to use natural gas, because no other fuel can do the job that natural gas does in their processes. Many other countries charge a much lower carbon tax, or—when it comes to our competitors for refined products, such as in the US, India or the Gulf—charge no carbon tax at all. The carbon tax imposed on our industry through the emissions trading scheme makes it significantly harder for refineries to do business in the UK, increases costs for consumers and makes our industry less competitive.

Hon. Members do not have to take my word for it; they can listen to the UK chair of ExxonMobil, which runs the Fawley refinery in Southampton. At the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee recently, he said:

“the majority of…petrol and diesel imported into this country, is produced in the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and India…They have lower energy costs, lower labour costs and zero CO2 costs…Fawley refinery this year will spend between £70 million and £80 million on CO2 costs alone. In the next four or five years that will increase to £150 million. You tell me of another industry where you can afford to have a £150 million cost burden on a single producing unit and expect it to remain competitive for the long term. It is an absolute catastrophe waiting to happen”.

In his report for the Prosperity Institute, Rian calculates that at Prax Lindsey, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Immingham, the cost of the carbon tax alone amounted to 120% of the operating profit. How on earth can any refinery survive in that environment?

Things would be bad enough, but Ministers are not intent on making them even worse. Their decision to align the UK carbon tax with the EU’s more expensive one has increased the price that our industry pays by about 70% in the space of just a year. Why are they doing this? Ministers talk about EU alignment as if it is inevitable, but it is not. They control the market. They choose how many allowances they release. They could choose not to align with the EU and keep control of our own carbon market.

Increasing the carbon tax is a political choice that is already causing production costs to soar at refineries in Pembroke, Fawley, Stanlow and the Humber, and that has increased the cost of everybody’s electricity bill, too. Labour Members should know that electricity bills have increased by £2 billion this year alone because of the Government’s choice of alignment. The carbon tax is charged on gas-fired power generation too, and it is passed straight through to our constituents in wholesale electricity prices. That is exactly why the Conservatives have said that we will axe the carbon tax as part of our cheap power plan, to cut everybody’s electricity bills instantly by 20%.

The soaring carbon tax is crippling the refining sector. Will the Minister explain how refineries are supposed to survive when the Government are planning to increase the carbon tax between now and 2050? Is it the Government’s plan to have a carbon tax of £147 a tonne in 2030, as set out in the National Energy System Operator report? If not, will she disown her party’s claim that the NESO report shows that the clean power 2030 plan is achievable? Will the Government scrap their plan to align with the EU carbon tax scheme, which would lock us into ever higher carbon prices with no control? Will the Minister commit to increasing the number of free allowances given to the refining sector to shield it from at least some of the burden?

Refining is viable only when the raw product to refine is abundant and cheap. We cannot run a refinery on warm words about net zero and promises of green jobs that never materialise. We need crude oil and natural gas, so let us consider what is happening to the domestic oil and gas sector under this Government. Production is down, and falling at an accelerating rate; the cessation of production and decommissioning is being brought forward; investment is going overseas; 1,000 jobs a month are being lost from producers, operators and the supply chain, and no exploration wells were drilled in the UK North sea last year, for the first time since the 1960s. Why is this happening? Because the Government have banned new licences and continue—choose to continue—to keep the energy profits levy and tax UK oil and gas production at a higher rate than any other comparable basin. How can UK companies possibly compete when paying tax at 78%? There are no longer windfall prices or windfall profits, so why are companies still having to pay windfall taxes?

The Government’s short-term and idealistic policies on the North sea have an impact everywhere: they impact jobs, livelihoods, households, businesses and industries across the country. Does the Minister understand the anger and frustration in communities like mine in Gordon and Buchan, and throughout the energy sector, at the Prime Minister’s words about the EPL last week? People are losing their livelihoods and their ability to support their families because of the Government’s political choice to shut down the oil and gas sector. To hear that the Prime Minister does not even understand the policy that he is imposing, which is causing so much harm, is a complete slap in the face for energy communities across the country. Can the Minister confirm for the record that the Prime Minister was wrong to say that the windfall tax kicks in when there are excessive profits? Will she confirm that there is no longer any windfall left to tax?

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. I have really enjoyed the debate, which has been full of passion and emotion. I heard the anger, including in what my hon. Friend the Member for Alloa and Grangemouth (Brian Leishman) said, but I also heard that there is a lot of commonality in some of our values and on the transition that we are trying to achieve together. I have genuinely enjoyed listening and I have noted lots of points. There were a lot of questions; I will endeavour to get through them, but if I do not, we may need to follow up in writing to hon. Members.

I thank the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers) for securing this important debate, and I am grateful to all hon. Members for their contributions. This is a timely opportunity to discuss a matter of strategic significance for our nation’s energy security: the future of the UK refining sector. The industry has helped to underpin our economy and our resilience for decades, and its future deserves our full attention. The Minister for Energy is in Grangemouth today, and I will say more about that later.

Our refineries play a crucial role in ensuring a stable supply of the essential fuels that keep our transport networks running, our industries operating and consumers supplied with the energy they rely on every day. The sector is more than just a fuel; it drives growth in key sectors, supports thousands of skilled jobs in communities and sustains supply chains for chemicals, plastics and manufacturing. Refineries also play a critical role in the wider downstream oil sector. The Humber refinery in the constituency of the hon. Member for Brigg and Immingham is the UK’s only source of anode-grade petroleum coke, which is essential for electrical vehicle production. The Fawley refinery contributed to the global covid-19 response by supplying the specialist halobutyl rubber used to seal vaccine vials.

Importantly, UK refineries are also investing in their own future through decarbonisation and diversification by deploying carbon capture or producing low-carbon fuels to support our transition to net zero. Demand for refined products will continue, even beyond 2050, and the UK’s refineries will remain essential for hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry, aviation and maritime. That is why, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Energy made clear in June, the Government are absolutely committed to securing the long-term viability of the UK’s refining sector, and, as set out in the autumn Budget, we are reviewing critical policies to address the challenges that the sector faces.

Those challenges are real. In the 1970s, the UK operated 18 refineries; today, as has been said many times during the debate, only four remain. Falling demand for traditional fuels, global competition from mega-refineries in the middle east, India and Africa, changing trade dynamics and ageing assets all put pressure on UK operations. But with challenge comes opportunity, and the Government are determined to seize the opportunities by driving innovation, supporting investment and ensuring that the refining sector continues to play a vital role in our economy and for our energy security for decades to come.

The Government have already taken significant steps to support the refining sector and the wider fuel sector, and we are committed to do more. We have driven the shift to low-carbon fuels through the renewable transport fuel obligation, and this year we went further with the sustainable aviation fuel mandate, backing cleaner fuels for aviation. The Humber refinery already produces SAF at commercial scale, while Fawley and Stanlow are among the projects backed by our advanced fuels fund, which provides grants to accelerate the next generation of transport fuels. Refineries are playing a key role in driving the UK SAF industry forward, strengthening energy security with a home-grown supply. We are also de-risking investment in SAF production through the revenue certainty mechanism. We are working with industry to cut emissions through carbon capture and low-carbon hydrogen at major clusters such as Viking and HyNet. We will set out a clear plan for industrial decarbonisation to keep the UK competitive.

I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman intervened, as I was going to come on to his points—in particular, his interesting point about the national interest. I say to him gently that I feel we are working in the national interest, but the national interest includes energy security as well as respecting the science of climate change, which is happening. As he is the Father of the House, I genuinely listened to his points, but I was a little disappointed—[Interruption.] He can laugh all he likes, but I listened to his points. He talked about the UK being responsible for less than 1% of emissions. That is the case in terms of nation states, but I think the UK’s impact in the world is so much larger, whether through people following our policy decisions, the impact of our banking sector or our consumption of goods, which has also come up a lot.

We are looking at how we manage the transition, and we want to do it in a way that respects the science, but I am also competitive about where Britain can take advantage of these industries. We want to make sure that we have these industries, including the wind turbines that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, but we also want to look at how we can make the transition justly and fairly. I will come on to that later in my speech.

Last month, the UK ETS Authority confirmed that current benchmarks will stay in place for the 2027 scheme. That decision gives refineries and other energy-intensive industries the certainty that they need. By maintaining those benchmarks, we are providing stability and breathing space, helping businesses plan, manage costs and prepare for future changes to the scheme.

We are also reviewing compensation for energy-intensive industries. We announced in the autumn Budget that we are assessing the feasibility of including refined products in the carbon border adjustment mechanism, so that imported goods face an equivalent carbon price and the sector’s efforts to decarbonise will not be undermined by carbon leakage. This is the refining sector’s top priority, which the Government are committed to exploring as one of several levers to support the sector’s long-term future. These measures demonstrate our commitment to supporting investment, driving innovation and ensuring that the refining sector remains competitive and resilient as we transition to a low-carbon economy.

Looking ahead, the Government are taking further steps to secure the long-term future of the UK refining sector and to ensure a just transition. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has established a dedicated team to work across Whitehall and with industry. A number of Members asked about working across Whitehall; we will continue to do that, to ensure that we maximise the impact. This will guide how we manage the transition, protect energy security and support jobs and local communities.

We will continue to engage closely with the fuel industry to identify practical measures that can strengthen the sector. That is why, in June, we convened the first ministerial—[Interruption.]",https://hansard.parliament.uk/dist/opengraph-card.png,N,,2025-12-12 06:57:02.535821

Originally developed for diesel, naphtha, and marine fuels, the upgrading process is now central to CPTech’s P2SAF pathway, which aims to create sustainable aviation fuel from mixed waste plastics. The company plans to commission its first pilot facility in the UK in early 2026.

“Reliable, consistent upgrading of plastic-derived oils is essential for diversifying SAF feedstocks,” said CPTech CEO Dr Andrew Odjo. “These patents strengthen our ability to scale the technology globally.”

The timing of the patents coincides with growing regulatory mandates in the UK and EU for SAF, as well as increasing airline commitments to decarbonisation. Analysts note that technologies capable of converting waste plastics into sustainable fuels could play a key role in meeting rising SAF demand while addressing plastic waste challenges.

CPTech’s process stabilises raw pyrolysis oil, which is typically unstable and contaminated with metals and nitrogen, producing a cleaner intermediate suitable for aviation fuel production. The company says the patents provide legal and commercial protection as it expands deployment internationally.

CPTech COO Dr Katerina Garyfalou added that the patents support the company’s plans to scale production safely and efficiently, while contributing to the circular economy.",https://www.oilandgasmiddleeast.com/cloud/2025/10/03/shutterstock_736844653-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 02:56:45.636996

Clean Planet got its first patent for the process in the United Kingdom, as announced by the company September 7, 2022.

It said last month initial equipment for a project to demonstrate its plastics-to-SAF program had arrived. It aims to commission the pilot facility in the first quarter of 2026.

""The new facility will demonstrate the company’s proprietary process for transforming hard-to-recycle plastics into ultra-clean, low-carbon jet fuel"", Clean Planet said in a press release November 20.

It said in the statement this week announcing the new patents, ""With UK and EU SAF mandates coming into force, increasing pressure on bio-based feedstock supply chains and growing airline commitments to decarbonization, alternative circular feedstocks such as waste plastics are gaining strategic importance"".

Under the UK's ""SAF Mandate"", SAF must comprise two percent of total UK jet fuel demand in 2025, increasing to 10 percent in 2030 and 22 percent in 2040, as announced by the Transport Department December 19, 2024.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, fuel suppliers at each airport in member states must have at least two percent of SAF in their offered mix starting 2025. That must be raised to six percent from 2030, 20 percent from 2035, 34 percent from 2040, 42 percent from 2045 and 70 percent from 2050.

The requirements apply to, as stated in the text of the regulation published October 31, 2023, an airport with ""higher than 800 000 passengers or where the freight traffic was higher than 100 000 tonnes in the previous reporting period, and which is not situated in an outermost region"".

Considered SAF by the regulation are biofuels, recycled carbon fuels and synthetic fuels.

Current SAF production falls below earlier IATA forecasts due to inadequate policy support for maximizing installed production capacities.
The ReFuelEU Aviation policy in Europe has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains.
Global SAF production capacity is expected to reach around 20 million tonnes by 2030 with project success factors applied.
Walsh emphasized that Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production will slow sharply in 2026 as poorly designed European mandates inflate costs without accelerating supply. Willie Walsh, IATA Director General, stated December 9 in Geneva that mandates have failed to increase production needed for aviation decarbonization goals.

SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025, double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024, but growth will decelerate to 2.4 million tonnes in 2026 according to IATA estimates released this week. The fuel represents only 0.6 percent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8 percent the following year. Current SAF production falls below earlier IATA forecasts due to inadequate policy support for maximizing installed production capacities.

Airlines paid a premium of 2.9 billion United States dollars (USD) for the limited 1.9 million tonnes of SAF available in 2025 according to IATA data. Of this amount, 1.4 billion USD reflects standard SAF price premiums over conventional fuel while the remaining 1.5 billion USD represents compliance fees passed to airlines by fuel suppliers unable to meet mandated production targets. SAF prices exceed fossil based jet fuel by a factor of two, reaching up to five times more in mandated markets.

The ReFuelEU Aviation policy in Europe has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, all without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. The United Kingdom (UK) SAF mandate has triggered similar price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, said regulators must course correct to ensure long term viability of SAF production and achieve scale so that costs can come down. The failure to accelerate expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets, with several carriers committed to 10 percent SAF by 2030 now forced to reevaluate these commitments made in good faith.

Electronic SAF (e-SAF) mandates approach in the UK from 2028 and European Union (EU) from 2030, creating risk of repeating policy mistakes. The fuel faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel according to IATA analysis. Without strong production incentives rather than mandates, supply will fall short of targets while compliance costs could escalate to 29 billion euros by 2032 if targets remain unmet under the current policy framework.

IATA data shows approximately 68 percent of Power to Liquid (PtL) projects expected online by 2030 remain at the announcement stage with no commercial scale project reaching final investment decision in Europe. The only commercial scale project under construction is located in the United States where incentives are available, with capacity of approximately 20 thousand tonnes. To supply 0.6 million tonnes of e-SAF by 2030, the industry would need around 30 projects of similar capacity.

Renewable electricity represents a major cost driver for e-SAF, with estimated levelized costs relatively high in Europe compared with many other regions. IATA estimates show renewable electricity costs in Europe range from 51 to 136 USD per megawatt hour (MWh) compared to Middle East and North Africa region costs around 32 USD per MWh and China costs from 29 to 57 USD per MWh.

Global SAF production capacity is expected to reach around 20 million tonnes by 2030 with project success factors applied. North America will account for approximately 36 percent of global 2030 SAF capacity driven by targeted incentives, followed by Europe at 23 percent, South America at 15 percent, China at 13 percent and East Asia and Pacific at 12 percent. Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) refineries are likely to still dominate the market, accounting for about 95 percent of total volume.

Walsh emphasized that Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. The aviation executive noted that the recent European Commission Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) announcement represents a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. IATA analysis shows cumulative SAF investments could range from about 3 trillion USD under low yield assumptions to nearly 7 trillion USD under high yield assumptions by 2050.

The SAF premium translates into an additional 3.6 billion USD in fuel costs for the industry in 2025 at current price levels. Stock market data shows oil stocks have significantly outperformed clean energy since 2021, reflecting strong investor confidence in traditional energy while SAF faces expected returns below 5 percent with a 15 percentage point handicap compared to oil investments.

Walsh served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of British Airways from 2005 to 2011 and CEO of International Airlines Group (IAG) from 2011 until September 2020. He became IATA’s eighth Director General in April 2021 after a 40 year career in the airline industry that began as a cadet pilot with Aer Lingus in 1979. IATA represents approximately 360 airlines comprising over 80 percent of global air traffic.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-12-12 02:56:54.169998

AUSTIN, Texas and NEW YORK, Dec. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- T1 Energy Inc. (NYSE: TE) ( “T1,” “T1 Energy” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of its previously announced underwritten public offerings of $140.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “Convertible Notes” and such offering, the “Convertible Notes Offering”) and 28,282,830 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $4.95 per share (the “Common Stock Offering” and together, the “Offerings”). The Convertible Notes Offering was upsized from the previously announced $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes.

The Company estimates that the net proceeds from the Offerings will be approximately $264.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and T1 Energy’s estimated offering expenses. In addition, the Company has granted the underwriters of the Common Stock Offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 4,242,424 shares of its common stock, and the Company has granted the underwriters of the Convertible Notes Offering a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $21.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes solely to cover over-allotments.

The Common Stock Offering is expected to close on December 15, 2025 and the Convertible Notes Offering is expected to close on December 16, 2025, in each case, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The closing of each Offering is not conditioned upon the closing of the other Offering.

The Convertible Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of T1 Energy and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2026. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.

Before September 1, 2030, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option only in certain circumstances. At any time from, and including, September 1, 2030 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders. T1 Energy will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at T1’s election. The initial conversion rate is 144.3001 shares of T1’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $6.93 per share of common stock and represents a conversion premium of approximately 40% above the public offering price per share of common stock in the Common Stock Offering. If a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture that will govern the Convertible Notes) occurs, or if the Company calls a holder’s Convertible Notes for redemption, then the Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time for holders who convert their Convertible Notes in connection with that make-whole fundamental change, or who convert their Convertible Notes that are called for such redemption.

The Convertible Notes will not be redeemable prior to December 6, 2028. The Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), at T1’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after December 6, 2028 and prior to the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the common stock equals or exceeds 130% of the conversion price for the Convertible Notes on (1) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date T1 sends the related redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date T1 sends such notice.

If a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture that will govern the Convertible Notes) occurs, then, subject to certain exceptions, holders may require T1 to repurchase their Convertible Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.

The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Convertible Notes Offering and the Common Stock Offering (i) to progress efforts to become compliant with applicable foreign entities of concern (FEOC) related provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by December 31, 2025, including through the repayment of certain indebtedness, (ii) for working capital, construction and advancement of infrastructure relating to the first 2.1 GW phase of our G2_Austin facility and (iii) for general corporate purposes. The closing of neither the proposed Convertible Notes Offering nor the Common Stock Offering is conditioned upon the closing of the other offering.

Santander and J.P. Morgan are acting as joint bookrunning managers and BTIG and Roth Capital Partners are acting as co-managers for the Convertible Notes Offering and the Common Stock Offering.

In the medium term, Drax said its U.S. wood pellet business is “well underpinned by sales into the U.K.” Drax’s Canadian business, primarily sells wood pellets into the Asian market, is expected to be more challenged, contributing to the company’s recent decision to close its facility in Williams Lake, British Columbia. “Against this backdrop the group does not currently expect to invest in additional capacity in the short to medium term, including the paused Longview project,” Drax said in the statement.

In the long term, Drax said it remains positive on the role of biomass in industrial decarbonization and carbon removals via its Elimini business. The company also confirmed it is continuing to assess options for own-use and third-party sales, from existing and new markets, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could represent a major market opportunity from 2030 onwards.

The negative effects of EU & U.K. SAF mandates Mandates in the EU and U.K. have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption: In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains.
“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.
Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down.","The International Air Transport Association released new estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million metric tons (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The negative effects of EU & U.K. SAF mandates

Mandates in the EU and U.K. have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The U.K’.s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking ahead to e-SAF mandates

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the U.K. (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2022/06/IATALogo_16565519756802.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 19:56:21.660854

UN Report Warns Cooling Demand Could Triple by 2050

The Global Cooling Watch 2025 developed by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) warns that heatwaves are the deadliest climate hazard, and that expanding cooling access must happen sustainably and equitably. The document, released at COP30 in Belem, Brazil, finds that global cooling capacity could rise from 22TW in 2022 to 68TW in 2050. Even with efficiency improvements and the phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sector emissions could increase from 4.1Gt of CO₂e to 7.2Gt by mid-century. UNEP states that heat exposure is rising as populations and incomes grow in hotter regions, particularly in Africa and South Asia, where unmanaged air-conditioning adoption could strain grids and trigger power outages.

Microsoft, Powertrust to Support 270 MW of Distributed Solar

Powertrust, a Vancouver-based clean energy financing and aggregation platform, announced a new agreement with Microsoft to support the deployment of 270 MW of distributed solar projects in Mexico and Brazil over the next four years. Under the agreement, Microsoft will purchase RECs generated by Powertrust-supported solar installations in both countries.

ALTA Warns Zero SAF Production Threatens Regional Aviation

According to new data from theLatin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), the region produces no Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and has no active development projects. The lack of regional SAF production could raise operating costs by US$318 billion, with airlines warning that the financial burden threatens connectivity, competitiveness, and long-term compliance with global emissions targets. The study finds that Mexico—Latin America’s second-largest aviation fuel consumer and home to one of the world’s youngest fleets—has limited prospects for SAF production. By 2050, when the aviation sector must reach net-zero emissions, Mexico is expected to produce only 3% of the region’s SAF.

“For Singapore to embark on this journey in a more structured manner, they needed to set up a mechanism to collect funding, send clear market signals, address demand and supply, create the ecosystem, and kickstart the market,” Jean Nie Ho, a partner and head of the environment, sustainability and governance practice at Dentons Rodyk & Davidson LLP, told Singapore Business Review.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) bill—passed this year—imposes a fixed sustainable aviation fuel levy on all departing flights starting in 2026. The proceeds collected by the agency will form a fund to procure, manage, and distribute the fuel.

This supports Singapore’s plan to cut aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% from the 2019 level of 404,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, and reach net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

S. Sivanesan, a senior partner at law firm Dentons Rodyk & Davidson, noted that Singapore is already amongst the world’s major oil refining centres, which could encourage more companies to explore SAF-related operations in the city-state.

Several industry players have made significant investments. Finnish refiner Neste Corp. operates a major facility in Singapore with an annual capacity of 2.6 million tonnes of renewable products, including SAF, following its 2023 expansion.

Aether Fuels Pte. Ltd. and Aster Biofuels Pte. Ltd. are developing Project Beacon on Pulau Bukom, with construction planned for 2026 and commercial operations targeted for 2028.

The Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint released in 2024 details a 1% sustainable aviation fuel use target beginning in 2026, with plans to raise this to 3% to 5% by 2030. Ho said SAF adoption is straightforward since it only requires blending into existing jet fuel systems, with no major infrastructure change needed at airports.

Because the SAF levy will be incorporated into airfares, Sivanesan said airlines should assess how ticket prices across different classes would be affected, adding that carriers might need to soften the impact on travelers.

Still, industry examples suggest that passenger traffic need not suffer. Jonathan Yap, director for dispute resolution at law firm Drew & Napier LLC, said experiences in the EU and UK—where a 2% SAF mandate is in place—show that air travel demand remains intact.

“Heathrow offers a useful case study,” he said in an emailed reply to questions. “It is one of the leading airports in SAF adoption and accounted for 17% of global sustainable jet fuel consumption in 2024. In the same year, Heathrow’s passenger numbers reached a new peak.”

Heathrow uses an incentive programme that lets airlines uplift SAF at the airport to bid for rebates that lower their SAF costs. These are funded through existing aeronautical charges.

Under Singapore’s model, its aviation authority will set up Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel and manage its environmental attributes, ensuring accountability, quality control, and accurate tracking.

Yap said a central buyer could get better commercial terms through bulk purchasing. He noted that Singapore is the first country to impose a SAF levy.

“This adds to our reputation for taking pragmatic measures to advance policy objectives,” he said. “It also signals Singapore’s commitment to environmental sustainability without undercutting our status as an air hub.”",https://sbr.com.sg/s3/files/styles/opengraph/public/2025-12/pexels-ahmedmuntasir-912050.jpg?h=4be11d33&itok=GGIu1aBM,N,,2025-12-11 18:57:16.443353

Carter, Sr. (D-LA), alongside Representatives Sharice Davids (D-KS), Mike Flood (R-NE), and Tracey Mann (R-KS), introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act, bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, increase demand for American agricultural products, and reduce emissions in the transportation sector.

“Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” said Rep. Carter. “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry currently relies on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to make production economically viable. While recent legislation extended the credit for all clean fuels, it eliminated the SAF-specific bonus.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just good for the environment — it’s good for Kansas farmers, our communities, and our economy,” said Rep. Davids. “The SAF Act ensures that clean fuel production incentives are strong and long-term so businesses, farmers, and innovators can plan for the future with confidence. The bipartisan support shows the incredible potential we have to build a healthier, stronger, and more prosperous future for generations to come.”

“America is on the cusp of the next great biofuels revolution,” said Rep. Flood. “The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America. Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Davids for introducing this much-needed bill and look forward to working together to advance this commonsense, bipartisan bill through Congress.”

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a worthwhile investment for American agriculture and for American energy dominance,” said Rep. Mann. “The Securing America’s Fuels Act gives Kansas farmers the certainty they need to plan, invest, and keep supplying fuel to the country and our aviation sector. I will always support legislation that supports rural communities and helps the United States continue to lead the world in producing the fuels of tomorrow.”

The SAF Act is endorsed by National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Greater New Orleans Inc., Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugar Cane League.

“It is crucial that Congress finds ways to support farmers with good domestic policy, at this time when international trade negotiations have left farmers in difficult market conditions,” said Richard Fotenot, President, Louisiana Farm Bureau. “Congressional policy changes can also provide relief to American consumers. The SAF Act does both. It creates consistency in domestic aviation fuel markets in a sustainable manner important to consumers. We are grateful to Congressman Carter and his colleagues for continuing to find ways to support these efforts through ideas like the SAF Act.”

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, Executive Director, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“SAF may offer a great opportunity for sugarcane farmers,” said Jack Pettus, VP of Government Relations, American Sugar Cane League. “Our mills use bagasse, the fibrous byproduct of recovering sugar from the sugarcane plant, to power their operations during harvest season. Our farmers have been growing and delivering this renewable fuel for over a century and we are anxious to find new uses for the excess biofuel (bagasse) that we currently produce. The American Sugar Cane League appreciates this bipartisan effort to identify and encourage demand for domestic renewable energy feedstocks in markets like aviation fuels.”

“Delta applauds Reps. Flood, Davids, Mann, and Carter for their leadership in introducing the Securing America's Fuels Act, which will ensure 45Z reaches its full potential and provides the critical investment certainty necessary to bring additional SAF production facilities online to meet our industry's unprecedented demand for cost-competitive, homegrown fuels,"" said Cherie Wilson, Vice President, Government Affairs - Sustainability, Delta Air Lines.

“U.S. airlines are grateful to Representatives Flood, Davids, Carter, and Mann for introducing legislation that would restore and extend the full 45Z tax credit,” said Airlines for America. “This will stimulate private sector investment in SAF while also bolstering American energy dominance. This credit is a win-win for both the aviation and agriculture industries, supporting U.S. job growth across the country.”

Background:

TheSAF Act would:

Reinstate the SAF bonus credit eliminated under the recent federal budget, allowing qualifying SAF producers to receive up to $0.35 or $1.75 per gallon.

Extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for all clean fuels through 2033, providing long-term stability for the growing clean fuels industry.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a game-changer for local communities, agriculture, and the transportation industry. Scaling SAF to meet U.S. goals could(link is external) generate 33,000 construction jobs over five years, sustain 4,500 permanent operations jobs, and support 60,000 jobs in agriculture and logistics by 2030. SAF can also reduce(link is external) lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent, delivering major environmental benefits while using existing aviation infrastructure.

SAF is already being produced at several Louisiana facilities, positioning the state to lead in the growing clean-fuels economy while leveraging its existing industrial skilled workforce and port infrastructure. It also helps diversify Louisiana’s energy industry while creating new jobs, attracting investment, and strengthening long-term economic resilience.

And now it’s time to lead a new industry – sustainable aviation fuel.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an American innovation with the power to transform aviation and agriculture while strengthening rural economies. Today, more than 500 million gallons of SAF production capacity exist in the U.S., creating durable markets for crops and rendered products and supporting high-quality jobs in feedstock-rich states. But for SAF to reach its full potential, federal policy must provide the right foundation for long-term investment.

What’s holding back growth?

SAF requires advanced technology and significant upfront investment. While recent legislation extended the Section 45Z tax credit for SAF, the lower base value introduced makes new projects harder to finance. Without restoring the original incentive level, the U.S. risks slowing progress just as global demand for SAF is accelerating.

Restoring and extending SAF incentives

To address this, the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act has been introduced in the U.S. House by Representatives Mike Flood, Sharice Davids, Troy Carter and Tracey Mann. This bipartisan legislation proposes two key changes to the existing tax credit framework:

Restore the SAF base credit to $1.75 per gallon under Section 45Z for qualified facilities.

Extend the 45Z credit through 2033, providing long-term certainty for investors and producers.

These measures would encourage new SAF investment and help the U.S. maintain its global energy leadership.

Stronger markets, jobs and energy leadership

At Darling Ingredients, we’ve proven SAF can succeed. Our joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel, is the largest SAF producer in North America and thrives across diverse market conditions. But for SAF to grow from a company success story to an industry success story, higher incentives are essential.

Our vision goes beyond our success — we want to see U.S. agriculture, biorefiners, airlines and rural communities thrive. A vibrant SAF industry benefits everyone, and Darling Ingredients will succeed within that ecosystem.

Restoring the full credit will:

Create new markets for U.S. farmers and biorefiners.

Support rural communities with high-quality jobs.

Ensure America leads in sustainable aviation fuel production.

Building a future together

America has always led the way. And now it’s time to lead a new industry – sustainable aviation fuel. This is about jobs, innovation and securing our energy future. If we’re not at the table, others will write the rules. We’re ready to show what America can deliver – and smart policy will make it happen.",https://darl-p-001.sitecorecontenthub.cloud/api/public/content/a4a98b9bf4b54bfba12f006bae20e4f7?v=05e515a9,N,,2025-12-11 16:56:45.391115

Commercial aviation is undergoing rapid transformation as airlines try to differentiate themselves in a highly competitive post-pandemic market. Passenger experience is no longer defined by seat comfort or onboard service alone. Today’s leading carriers are rethinking the end-to-end journey using technology, data, sustainability initiatives, and modern payment capabilities.

Below are five strategic trends every airline operator, aviation executive, and travel-tech provider should be evaluating right now.

Data-Driven Personalization at Scale

Personalization has evolved from a nice-to-have consumer perk into a core commercial priority. Airlines are using AI, predictive analytics, and advanced CRM systems to deliver more relevant offers, smarter ancillary upsells, and higher booking conversions.

This includes personalized upgrade suggestions, targeted promotions through mobile apps, and loyalty-based recommendations. Forward-thinking carriers are seeing improvements in repeat bookings and customer lifetime value.

The real competitive advantage will come from connecting passenger data across booking platforms, loyalty programs, and digital touchpoints rather than operating isolated systems.

Biometric Identity and Frictionless Airport Processing

Airport congestion continues to impact scheduling, customer satisfaction, and overall operational efficiency. Biometric boarding and digital identity verification are streamlining airport touchpoints, reducing manual processes, and accelerating passenger flow.

Facial recognition systems and automated identity checks are improving security while reducing wait times across check-in, security screening, and boarding.

As biometric adoption expands, airlines and airports will prioritize global interoperability, data privacy compliance, and integration with existing infrastructure.

In-Flight Connectivity as a Business Requirement

Reliable in-flight Wi-Fi is quickly shifting from a premium option to an operational necessity. The business value now goes far beyond entertainment.

High-speed connectivity enables business travelers to stay productive, supports real-time operations, and creates opportunities for digital commerce, advertising, and customer engagement.

Airlines equipped with dependable connectivity are better positioned to meet the needs of corporate travelers, digital nomads, and international passengers who expect seamless online access.

Sustainability and the Transition Toward Responsible Aviation

Environmental responsibility has become a key purchasing factor for both leisure travelers and corporate travel buyers who must meet ESG commitments.

Investments in sustainable aviation fuel, lighter components, carbon-offset programs, and future electric propulsion are increasingly tied to long-term competitiveness.

Regulatory pressure and global climate expectations will continue pushing airlines toward sustainable operations, and the carriers that show measurable progress will strengthen their brand reputation and corporate partnerships.

Modernized Payment Infrastructure and Digital Wallet Adoption

Flexible payment options are now directly linked to stronger conversion rates and international reach. Airlines are expanding payment acceptance through secure global airline payment processing, enabling digital wallets, regional payment methods, alternative credit options, and buy-now-pay-later solutions.

This shift is especially important in international markets where traditional credit card penetration may be limited. By modernizing their payment infrastructure, airlines can increase cross-border bookings, reduce friction at checkout, and unlock incremental revenue opportunities.

Strategic Outlook

The airlines that succeed over the next decade will be those that treat passenger experience as a commercial growth engine rather than a service feature. Personalization, biometrics, connectivity, sustainability, and modern payment systems are no longer side projects — they represent foundational elements of future competitiveness.

Leaders should focus investments on platforms that improve revenue performance, operational efficiency, global expansion, and digital scalability. The pace of change is accelerating, and early adopters are already reporting measurable gains in loyalty, booking performance, and corporate travel acquisition.",https://www.tractionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5-Emerging-Airline-Trends-e1765487170272-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 18:57:21.546312
