Energy security is one of today’s defining challenges—and without changes to the status quo, it’s poised to intensify. As global systems become more interconnected and energy demand accelerates, the question is no longer whether transformation is necessary, but how quickly and effectively it can happen.

The future of energy doesn’t rely solely on increasing supply. It demands a shift in how energy is produced, distributed and consumed. Technological innovation, regional climate imperatives and geopolitical shifts require a rethinking of energy strategies. As the sector evolves to be more environmentally responsible and prepares for increasing interconnectivity, it faces dynamics that make energy security a top priority.

Understanding the Demand

According to the International Energy Agency’s Global Energy Review 2025, global energy demand grew by 2.2% in 2024, while demand for all fuels and technologies expanded in the same year. The increase was led by the power sector as electricity demand surged by 4.3%. Renewables accounted for the largest share of the growth in global energy supply (38%) followed by natural gas (28%), coal (15%), oil (11%) and nuclear (8%).1

Research by the World Bank consistently shows a correlation between energy consumption per capita and GDP per capita, affirming that energy availability is a foundation for development.2 This has important implications – increased energy demand in these regions should be viewed as a sign of progress, not an issue. The challenge is finding ways to use cleaner, more reliable energy sources as use rises. China’s recent decrease in CO2 emissions, driven by significant deployment of wind, solar and hydroelectric power, is one example of how rising demand and decarbonization efforts can advance together. Recognizing the link between energy demand and economic development is important, but growing demand can also present risks that make energy security a top priority.

Efficiency: The First Fuel

Enhancing efficiency is critical to improving energy security. The IEA refers to energy efficiency as the “first fuel” in the clean energy transition, since it provides some of the quickest and most cost-effective CO2 mitigation options while lowering energy bills and strengthening energy security.3

Continued increases in energy demand can lead to energy scarcity – creating energy shortages or disruptions – that can have potentially significant impacts on how organizations operate. No matter the cause of energy scarcity, communities, utilities and organizations must prepare to prevent shortages by evaluating their energy sources and systems and finding ways to enhance energy security.

Diversifying the Energy Mix

Energy mix refers to the primary energy sources used to generate energy in a specific country or region. Depending on the country, along with its climate policy and grid infrastructure, the typical energy mix may rely on a combination of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), nuclear energy and renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro, etc.).

To improve energy security, it’s important that communities, utilities and organizations continue to add new energy sources to the mix including liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels and hydrogen, along with considering technologies like carbon capture. This approach can help enhance energy security, adapt to changing demands and support economic growth.

Next-Generation Fuels: SAF and eSAF

Maximizing energy security also means enabling the use of future fuels, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF). By sourcing biofuels and using waste materials, SAF bolsters energy security through diversification of fuel sources. Investment in SAF production facilities and infrastructure will help enable greater emissions reductions in the aviation sector. SAF can be blended with petroleum jet fuel and adoption is growing, but not fast enough.

By 2035, SAF is expected to encompass 11% of worldwide jet fuel demand — which will require delivering around 13 billion gallons of SAF annually.4 Most current SAF capacity relies on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which are feedstock limited and unlikely to meet long-term needs based on regional feedstock regulatory restrictions.

The emergence of eSAF further diversifies the feedstock mix by using renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, which is then combined with carbon dioxide to create synthetic fuel. This process transforms surplus renewable energy into a viable aviation fuel. Multiple advanced technological pathways exist today to produce eSAF.

Technology and Strategy for Resilience

In today’s rapidly evolving landscape of high energy demand, addressing global energy security is critical. No one action is going to meet demand alone. Instead, a multi-pronged strategy is likely required. Depending on the market, the approach may differ but it can include using technologies that help to improve energy efficiency of production, processes and use; expanding the overall energy mix to include more energy sources like LNG and low-carbon options like hydrogen; exploring technologies like carbon capture; and supporting the deployment of next-generation fuels such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF). Each of these strategies is important on their own. Together, these approaches can help improve energy security to better meet the needs of tomorrow, today.

Starting in 2024, airlines are expected to offset between 40 and 60 million tonnes of CO₂, depending on traffic growth.
The adjustment is primarily attributed to more optimistic international traffic growth projections, as well as updates in ICAO’s registry of participating member states.
With offsetting requirements now higher than previously anticipated, carriers will face mounting demand for EEUs in the short term.","Revised sectoral growth factor projections

According to IATA’s August 2025 update, the SGF for 2024 is expected to range between 11.5% and 16.7%, reflecting international traffic growth trends.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is scheduled to confirm and publish the 2024 SGF by the end of October 2025.

The forecast presents three modelled scenarios—High, Mid, and Low—based on varying assumptions about traffic recovery.

These scenarios will influence the scale of offsetting required from operators, underscoring how industry recovery trajectories are directly shaping sustainability commitments.

Growing offsetting requirements

Alongside the SGF, IATA also updated projections for annual offsetting requirements.

Starting in 2024, airlines are expected to offset between 40 and 60 million tonnes of CO₂, depending on traffic growth.

Over the full three-year phase, total offsetting demand is forecast to fall between 146 and 236 million tonnes of CO₂.

Most of these requirements will likely be met through CORSIA Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs), given the limited availability of certified CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEFs) over this period.

This highlights the ongoing challenges of scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to levels that can make a significant impact within the scheme’s early years.

Key drivers behind the update

The revised projections represent a notable increase compared with IATA’s September 2024 forecasts.

The adjustment is primarily attributed to more optimistic international traffic growth projections, as well as updates in ICAO’s registry of participating member states.

Increased participation in the scheme broadens the scope of offsetting obligations and reinforces CORSIA’s role as the central market-based measure for international aviation emissions.

For airlines, the updated forecasts underline the scale of carbon management challenges that lie ahead. With offsetting requirements now higher than previously anticipated, carriers will face mounting demand for EEUs in the short term. At the same time, the limited availability of CEFs signals that the industry’s transition to cleaner fuels will take longer to materialise at scale.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/09/10/simon-maage-C9dhUVP-o6w-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-10 12:56:11.956654

Luxaviation operates one of the largest fleets of private aircraft worldwide. It is actively

committed to the decarbonization of aviation through a three-pronged strategy: improving

fuel efficiency; reducing emissions by actively increasing SAF use and electrification of ground operations; buying offsets for remaining GHG emissions. Since 2021, Luxaviation’s annual sustainability report tracks progress against targets. In 2023, Luxaviation launched “Go-toZero” Investment Fund to foster SAF production.

“We are very pleased with this offtake partnership with Luxaviation as it will significantly

facilitate the financing of our SAF projects in Europe. Securing long-term offtake agreements is one of the most crucial conditions for financing SAF production facilities, as they guarantee the purchase of SAF at a stable price over periods exceeding five years”, said Haffner Energy cofounder and CEO Philippe Haffner.

France-based Haffner Energy relies on its 32-year experience to design, manufacture, supply, license, and operate proprietary disruptive clean fuels solutions, including critical technology for SAF production, using all types of biomass residues wet or dry, such as agricultural and municipal waste. The company has already announced the development of a couple of SAF projects, notably in France and in Iceland. In both cases, full scale production is expected to be reached by 2030 when the next stage of the European SAF mandate kicks in, requiring airlines to blend SAF in their jet fuel at a 6% ratio or higher.

Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are members of Project SkyPower, an international CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF.

Haffner Energy designs, manufactures, supplies, and operates biofuel and hydrogen solutions using biomass residues. Its innovative, patented thermolysis technology produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel, as well as renewable gas, hydrogen, and methanol.

According to a popular AI chatbot, my carbon footprint for this trip will equal about 1.5 tons, 1.1 tons more than the average Kenyan’s carbon footprint for an entire year.

While most air travelers would be as surprised as I was to learn this, the airlines already know the score. A few years ago, 65 countries agreed to participate in the CORSIA framework, which aims to limit the carbon emissions of international flights.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The primary way for airlines to directly reduce emissions is by using sustainable aviation fuel, and the industry has committed to using SAF for one-tenth of its total fuel consumption by 2030. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough SAF for airlines to meet this target.

The main production pathway for SAF is converting fats and oils into fuel—around 80% is derived from vegetable oils, some of it recovered from restaurants. SAF made from this feedstock is known as FOG-based (a lovely acronym for “waste fats, oils, and greases). While FOG-based SAF is sustainable from the standpoint that ancient fossil carbon is not being dug up out of the earth, it’s not sustainable if one considers that manufacturing SAF with this feedstock has the potential to crowd out production of food for human consumption.

European regulations mandate that only 7% of food crops can be converted into transportation fuels, and U.S. regulations impose a similar cap of 15 billion gallons of corn-based ethanol per year. According to a 2024 National Renewable Energy Laboratory survey of SAF market participants, “All industrial stakeholders identified feedstock supply as a major barrier to scale up production of SAF.”

In addition to FOG-based methods, a chemical engineering-intensive process known as Fischer-Tropsch is approved and sometimes used to create SAF.

This process was invented in 1926 and used by Nazi Germany during WWII to manufacture diesel fuel from coal. I won’t go into all the gory details, but suffice it to say that manufacturing fuels using the FT process is phenomenally complex.

In addition to the many technical hoops one must jump through to carry out this process, the only FT pathway for SAF production uses a feedstock of organic waste. This biomass-to-fuel process has proven to be nearly impossible, and every company I know of that has attempted to commercialize it has declared bankruptcy.

Because the supply of FOG-based SAF is capped and the biomass-to-fuels pathway is so challenging, airlines are stuck between a rock and a hard place, having committed to use a commodity for which they cannot secure a sufficient supply.

Producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel from Alcohol

The good news for airlines (and for our planet’s carbon cycle) is that Chicago-based LanzaTech, a company we have featured in this column, has an innovative, highly effective process to produce a feedstock for SAF that is already operating at commercial scale on three continents.

LanzaTech’s process routes industrial gases into special bioreactors containing anaerobic bacteria which consume carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen and produce ethanol, using a fermentation process similar to that of yeast. This ethanol is then converted into jet fuel using the alcohol-to-jet process developed by LanzaTech and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

LanzaTech uses a myriad of feedstocks in its bioreactors, from raw municipal solid waste to agricultural and forestry residues to waste gases from steel, ferroalloy, and chemical refineries.

Manufacturing jet fuel with genetically modified bacteria sounds like utopian science fiction, but steel, ferroalloy and petrochemical plants in China, Europe and India are producing hundreds of thousands of tons of ethanol through LanzaTech’s process. Pilots are underway in Japan to do the same thing with municipal solid waste, with very promising results.

This ethanol can be passed on to one of LanzaTech’s spin-offs, LanzaJet, for conversion into SAF using the ATJ process.

According to a press release on September 2, LanzaTech has been working with partners to develop a follow-up fermentation process to convert ethanol into fatty oils from which SAF can also be manufactured.

Investors in LanzaTech’s stock know how painful the past few years have been for the company. I visited their headquarters a few weeks ago to speak with CEO Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, PhD, who was clearly feeling the weight of having to let go of nearly two-thirds of the company’s research staff.

Following the personnel cuts—which are painful for any company, but especially one with such a tightly-knit team as LanzaTech—Holmgren reduced the company’s cash burn and is now focused on executing the company’s SAF business. Several promising R&D lines and other commercial lines are being temporarily shelved to focus on sustainable fuels.

While the U.S. market has become trickier to navigate, the European Union has finally—in a process that began nearly 10 years ago—built a regulatory framework that will classify LanzaTech/LanzaJet’s ATJ products as a new category of sustainable fuels called Recycled Carbon Fuels.

The E.U. (and the U.K., which is tagging along from across the Channel) has established a certification body that will issue credits to companies manufacturing these fuels through certified processes, and auditors are already gearing up to submit RCF credit claims to the certifying body.

An experienced venture capitalist once told me that climate tech was especially difficult because, to succeed, a project must get its technical, funding, and regulatory ducks in a row, with the regulatory piece being especially tricky. With the E.U./U.K. regulatory framework now in place and LanzaTech already working on several European ATJ plants, we believe that Holmgren and her team can realize economic success equal to their technical accomplishments.

The market demand clearly exists: airlines need a lot more sustainable aviation fuel to meet their CORSIA commitments. I do not see how SAF demand can be satisfied in the present supply environment without LanzaTech, and possessing a proprietary technology that addresses customer pain points in a supply-constrained market is a strong competitive advantage for any business.

The pulp and paper industry has been buffeted by a long-term reduction in demand for its products.
The effects of these closings are rippling through the region, as many individuals in the timber industry and large land tract owners are speaking out about the situation.
It changes everything.” Timber Industry Professional Monroe Goss shared similar concerns, as he explained the price of timber would drastically drop.
“The closures of International Paper and Georgia-Pacific mills are a heavy blow to South Georgia families and communities,” commented Hagan.","International Paper stunned the state last month, when they announced the closure of four pulp and paper mills in Coastal Georgia. Yet, local citizens and families are continuing to feel the aftershock of this announcement, as many businesses search for their future plans.

On Thursday, August 21, International Paper announced the permanent closure of the containerboard and packaging facilities in Savannah and the containerboard and timber and lumber operation in Riceboro. These mills have been a staple in South Georgia’s economy for years, as loggers and timber companies supply dozens of loads of lumber to the mill daily.

'These mill closures will un­continued from page

doubtedly deal a devastating blow not only to Georgia’s timber industry, but to the economic fabric of the entire Southeast Georgia region,' emphasized Georgia Speaker of the House Jon Burns.

The pulp and paper industry has been buffeted by a long-term reduction in demand for its products. The number of mills in Georgia has fallen from 18 at the height of production in 1977 to just nine with Thursday's closure announcements, Marshall Thomas, president of Albany- based F& W Forest Services, told an audience of political and agriculture business leaders at the annual Ag Issues Summit at the Georgia National Fairgrounds in Perry.

Thomas said Georgia lawmakers are working to increase demand for timber products, including a state Senate study committee that began meeting last year to explore developing sustainable aviation fuel from biomass, which has become popular in Europe.

The effects of these closings are rippling through the region, as many individuals in the timber industry and large land tract owners are speaking out about the situation.

“Nobody saw it coming,” Bricoll LLC Owner Cody Alexander emphasized. “It’s nobody’s fault, but no one was prepared for this. Even the people who worked at the mill didn’t know until the morning it was announced.”

Alexander shared that the closing would not be detrimental to his business, as he sends lumber to other mills besides International Paper – but that the closures would change the timber industry in the area drastically. “It’s not just the workers at the mill that are effected – it’s everyone this way,” he remarked. “South Georgia is known for logging – this is going to hurt the banks and everywhere. It trickles down.”

He explained that large landowners would feel the effects through the decrease in prices of lumber. Due to the abundance of wood and fewer options of mills to take the lumber, loggers will have to adapt their businesses for the new set-up. Truck drivers and container haulers will have fewer loads to take on the road, and the number of employees in these businesses will need to be reduced. Due to this reduction in employees, insurance professionals who specialize in workman’s compensation will even feel the effects, according to Alexander.

Alexander gave the example that he knows one logging company that currently has three logging crews, but is only keeping one crew because of the cuts that they have to make from this closure. The number of logs that the crew hauls every week is also reducing from 120 loads to 50 loads.

He stated that local restaurant and recreation businesses, and even youth sports teams, could see some of the repercussions of the closures. “We try to sponsor whatever sports teams and all that we can. If I don’t have the extra money to give them, it’ll effect them, too,” Alexander continued. “When people lose their jobs, they don’t have extra money to spend at restaurants, stores, and bowling alleys. It changes everything.”

Timber Industry Professional Monroe Goss shared similar concerns, as he explained the price of timber would drastically drop. “It’s bad,” he commented. “Between those two mills, 2,500 loads of wood a week will have nowhere to go because all of these other mills – and there’s not many – especially the pulp wood mills – can’t absorb that,” he said. “You still will be able to sell and buy pulp wood, but it will be a huge change. You have to get used to it going from $15-$20 a ton to around $4-$5 a ton, which is where it was in the early 2000’s.”

He continued, “I’ll believe there will be dozens of loggers that will go out of business. Dozens – 40, 50, 60 – not just 5-10. It’s going to affect fuel – because you think about the fuel loggers buy. It’s going to affect the people that provide tires, hoses, and parts. It’ll even affect local taxes because every time timber is sold, the county receives a tax off of it.”

Gillis Ag & Timber Owner Ben Gillis spoke out about concerns, as he stated that he had never experienced a problem of this magnitude in his lifetime in the timber industry. “This is the biggest hit that South Georgia has taken in my lifetime,” he stressed. “It won’t just affect my business – it will affect Southeast Georgia. Most of our economy relies on timber, and the jobs and income from the mill.”

He said that though the mill’s closing announcement initially stated that 1,100 jobs would be directly affected and eliminated by the closure, the indirect effects of the closing were much greater than could be expressed. “It’s probably around 5,000-10,000 jobs that will feel the effects of the closure – everyone from loggers to insurance agents to part stores and banks,” he remarked.

Because of having a family legacy of working in the timber industry, Gillis stated that he had many people seeking guidance from him on how to handle the situation. “I have a lot of people looking at me about what’s next, and honestly, I don’t know. It’s going to forever change Georgia until we figure out how to replace it. The state is trying, but it takes time.”

Yet, amidst the chaos, Gillis still finds hope in the situation. “With a lot of hard work and persever­continued from page

ance, we’ll overcome – it’s just going to take time,” he emphasized.

TAR Land and Timber Owner Tommy Rollins also spoke about the situation, reiterating that the pricing of timber – especially pulp wood – will decrease greatly.

“There’s still a need for it,” he emphasized. “Paper still has to be made, and we still need paper products. We still have Georgia Pacific and a mill down in Fernandina that will take pulp wood – it’s just going to be different.”

Rollins referred to the situation as a “short-time glitch,” as he stressed that the depletion of timber throughout the area from Hurricane Helene and the recent closure will strain the industry. “Short term, it’s not going to be conducive [for the timber industry],” he emphasized.

He continued, “There may be another industry that discovers that they can use pulp wood for something else – who knows. We grow timber faster and better here than everyone else – we just have to find a way to make a return.”

Rollins remains positive in the situation, as he shared that he had experienced a cycle of ups and downs of the timber industry throughout his years in business. “There will be a long-term effect, but we’ll live through it and make it through,” he reassured.

Effects are expected to continue to ripple through the area, as Interfor Corporation – which has mills in surrounding counties that accept lumber daily from local loggers – announced they will be reducing their lumber production by 12%, further crippling loggers and timber professionals.

The state legislature and government is actively working to find a solution to the effects of the closure, as State Representative Leesa Hagan has announced that State Speaker of the House Jon Burns has instructed the House Rural Development Committee – which is chaired by Hagan – to examine the impacts of the closure on rural Georgia in hopes of finding solutions for these issues.

“The closures of International Paper and Georgia-Pacific mills are a heavy blow to South Georgia families and communities,” commented Hagan. “Our focus must be on supporting hard-working employees, both those who worked in the mills and those whose jobs depend on them, and ensuring they have new opportunities close to home. The House Rural Development Committee is bringing all stakeholders to the table so we can listen, coordinate resources and take forward-thinking steps to strengthen Georgia's forestry industry and our rural economy.”

“Forestry has been an established fixture in South Georgia’s economy and communities for generations,” added Speaker Jon Burns. “The recent closure of several timber processing facilities across the region has dealt an unexpected blow to not only our foresters, but to the entire economic fabric of South Georgia. Despite the challenges ahead, the House Rural Development Committee is committed to leaving no stone unturned when it comes to supporting those affected directly by job loss, ensuring the long-term success of Georgia’s forestry Industry and strengthening rural Georgia’s economy.”",,N,,2025-09-10 10:56:46.779002

Concrete solutions: Decarbonizing cement and concrete across the value chain

Cement and concrete are responsible for nearly 8% of global CO₂ emissions.

Decarbonizing this sector requires a full value-chain transformation, from the raw materials to the concrete poured on site to how we design for circularity and reuse.

The financiers, policy-makers and innovators who step up now will clean up one of the dirtiest industries and help reshape the foundations of the global economy.

Cement and concrete are the world’s most widely used human-made materials — and the second most consumed substance on Earth after water. They are also responsible for nearly 8% of global CO₂ emissions. If the cement sector were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter in the world, after China and the United States.

While renewables, electric vehicles and other clean technologies attract billions in investment and robust policy support, cement and concrete lag far behind in the capital and attention they receive. At New York Climate Week, 21-28 September 2025, these materials may not attract the headlines — but without transforming this sector, the world will not reach net zero.

Decarbonizing this cement and concrete is no small feat. It requires a whole-of-value-chain transformation, from the raw materials entering a kiln to the concrete poured on a job site and, increasingly, to how we design for circularity and reuse. This transformation won’t happen through a single technology or a single actor. It demands coordinated capital deployment, policy alignment and market-shaping measures that span the entire ecosystem.

Why cement and concrete are so hard to decarbonize

The challenge is twofold:

1. Process emissions

~60% stems from the chemical reaction when limestone is heated (calcination), releasing CO₂.

2. Fuel and energy emissions

~40% comes from the extreme heat needed to drive this process — traditionally supplied by coal or petcoke.

Replacing fossil fuels in kilns helps, but without addressing process emissions, deep decarbonization is impossible. That’s why the solution space spans everything from low-carbon clinker chemistries to electrified heat sources, carbon capture-based solutions, circular concrete production and advanced monitoring and verification.

Looking across the value chain

A value chain perspective shows where innovation and financing can make the biggest difference:

• Upstream feedstocks and kiln operations: New binders, alternative fuels and carbon capture technologies are promising, but scaling them requires large-scale retrofits and billions in upfront investment.

• Material processing and distribution: Smarter logistics and processing of alternative materials can reduce emissions and costs, but demand mid-scale infrastructure upgrades.

• Concrete production and mix optimization: Digital mix-design tools and performance-based specifications allow for stronger, lower-carbon mixes. These solutions call for plant-level upgrades and software integration.

• Procurement and market adoption: Low-carbon procurement standards and verified emissions tracking can help generate credible demand signals. Here, investment is needed in transparency platforms and attribute trading systems.

• Circularity and end-of-life: Recycling aggregates, recarbonation and urban mining can close the loop. But this requires new recycling plants and innovative reuse technologies.

Each of these stages represents an opening for financiers, policymakers and innovators — and progress must happen in parallel.

First-of-a-kind (FOAK) financing and market gap

The early deployments of any breakthrough in cement and concrete decarbonization face the highest risk and the highest capital intensity. These FOAK projects often combine unproven technology at scale, complex integration into existing industrial systems and uncertain market acceptance.

For FOAK to succeed, collaborative, blended finance structures are essential. This can include layering:

• Public or concessional capital to absorb early risk.

• Private equity or infrastructure investors to bring discipline and scale.

• Credit enhancements and guarantees to attract commercial lenders.

• Outcome-based incentives tied to verified carbon performance.

Importantly, FOAK financing should remain technology-agnostic. The focus is not on picking winners, but on building structures that reduce risk across any credible decarbonization pathway.

Despite raised awareness, the sector faces a 'missing middle' funding gap between the venture market and the public-company/infrastructure market. Once a technology moves past the pilot stage, projects are too large and capital-intensive to be funded solely with equity — but too risky and unfamiliar for conventional debt.

Two structural problems amplify this gap:

1. Data scarcity

There is limited system-wide performance and cost data for cement and concrete solutions. This makes it difficult for lenders to underwrite projects and accurately assess risk.

2. Off-take challenges

Securing binding, bankable demand for low-carbon products is still difficult, especially when buyers have limited incentives or face procurement constraints.

The result is that much of the financial industry either ignores the market entirely or demands equity-like returns for what could be debt-like instruments — a mismatch that blocks scale and slows adoption. Bridging this gap requires new market mechanisms, better data transparency and early demand aggregation to create the confidence lenders need. The World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition, for example, aims to de-risk investment in low-carbon production through showcasing an aggregated credible demand signal from companies committed to purchasing deeply decarbonized cement and concrete by 2030.

Concrete Transition Capital (CTC) is developing an innovative project financing mechanism backed by risk analysis, sector underwriting, revenue generation support and credit enhancements to derisk investment in low-emission concrete and cement (LECC) production facilities. Through organizing capital providers, utilizing blended financing vehicles and securing contracted revenues, CTC seeks to reduce the risk and cost of borrowing, thereby enabling scale-up companies to bridge the gap and meet the financing industry halfway.

Matching finance to the challenge with policy as the enabler

Each link in the value chain requires capital, but not all capital is the same. The most effective strategies remain agnostic to the technology, focusing instead on the stage of maturity and risk profile:

• Early innovation finance — Grant funding, accelerators and seed venture capital for concepts and prototypes.

• Scale-up equity — Growth equity or venture growth funding for proven technologies entering new markets or building capacity.

• First-of-a-kind deployment capital — Concessional debt, blended finance and credit guarantees to get the first commercial-scale plants operating.

• Commercial rollout capital — Infrastructure debt and equity once technologies are proven and markets exist.

•.Market enablement finance — Funds for building data platforms, verification systems and demand-pull mechanisms, such as procurement commitments.

The goal is to unlock private capital at each stage by de-risking projects through the right combination of instruments, partners and market signals.

Yet, capital alone can’t move the sector without clear demand signals and aligned policy frameworks. Procurement standards that require — or heavily weight — embodied-carbon reductions can tip markets. Disclosure mandates, embodied-carbon caps and performance-based specifications can open the door for innovative mixes without compromising safety.

Market-shaping interventions — such as verified environmental attribute certificates (EACs) for cement and concrete — can create predictable revenue streams by overcoming geographical distances between procurers and suppliers, preventing physical cement and concrete offtakes and improving the bankability of low-carbon projects. This 'book-and-claim' approach, already used in renewable electricity and sustainable aviation fuel markets, allows buyers to claim the carbon benefits of low-carbon cement and concrete, even when physical offtake is not possible, thereby improving the bankability of projects.

Collaboration, a new asset class and the road ahead

No single actor can solve this challenge in isolation. Cement producers control the kilns; ready-mix companies manage the mixes; construction firms write the specs; governments and private developers decide what to buy. Without coordination, even the best technology risks dying in pilot purgatory. A whole-of-value-chain coalition — spanning producers, tech developers, financiers, policymakers and major buyers — is essential. This is a systems challenge requiring parallel progress at every link in the chain.

If that collaboration succeeds, cement and concrete could shift from being a 'hard-to-abate liability' to becoming one of the world’s largest climate-aligned asset classes. New revenue streams could emerge from premium low-carbon products, verified performance credits tied to emissions reductions and circular business models based on reuse and recycling.

As leaders gather at New York Climate Week, much of the focus will fall on clean power, electric vehicles and finance flows. Yet, cement and concrete deserve an equal place at the table. They may lack the glamour of wind farms or EV fleets, but without them the net-zero transition cannot succeed. The technologies exist. The pathways are clear. What remains is to unlock capital at scale, align policy and summon the collective resolve to act.

The agency now expects renewable diesel production to average 200,000 barrels per day in 2025, down from last month’s projection of 210,000 barrels per day. Production is still forecast to rise to 260,000 barrels per day in 2026. Renewable diesel averaged 210,000 barrels per day in 2024.

On the consumption side, the EIA kept its outlook unchanged, with renewable diesel demand expected to average 170,000 barrels per day in 2025 and 220,000 barrels per day in 2026, compared with 240,000 barrels per day in 2024. Net imports are projected at -30,000 barrels per day for both 2025 and 2026, compared to -20,000 barrels in the previous outlook.

Biodiesel production estimates were also revised down. The EIA now expects output to average 80,000 barrels per day in 2025, compared to 90,000 barrels in last month’s forecast. For 2026, production is pegged at 90,000 barrels per day, down from 100,000 barrels projected earlier. Biodiesel averaged 110,000 barrels per day in 2024. Consumption is forecast at 80,000 barrels per day in 2025 and 90,000 barrels per day in 2026, both reduced from the earlier forecast by 10,000 barrels. Net imports of biodiesel are expected to remain at zero for both years, after averaging 20,000 barrels per day in 2024.

In contrast, the EIA raised its forecast for “other biofuels,” which include SAF, renewable heating oil, renewable jet fuel, renewable gasoline, and other emerging fuels. Production is now expected to average 50,000 barrels per day in 2026, up from last month’s estimate of 40,000 barrels.

The initiative aims to ensure compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which will be mandatory after 2027, while positioning the country as both a user and supplier of green aviation fuels.

India has set blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights to curb emissions, achieve energy self-reliance and advance its net-zero goal by 2070.

As part of the plan, the Indian Sugar & Bio-energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Deloitte are working on blending targets, and ISMA has also partnered with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of sugarcane-based SAF using syrup, molasses and bagasse. two bio-energy industry executives said.

The outcomes of this study will be critical for drafting a national SAF policy. “Committees have already been formed, and discussions with stakeholders are underway to develop a comprehensive national SAF policy,” said one of the industry executives part of the committee.

The approach aims not only to meet India’s domestic blending targets but also to position the country as a future supplier of SAF to international markets.

The conversation, however, revolves around cost, classification and scalability. SAF currently costs around three times more than conventional jet fuel, while synthetic SAF is nearly seven times costlier.

“While ethanol-based fuels can play a supporting role, synthetic SAF represents a separate and more advanced pathway that requires strong policy backing and investment,” said the committee member.

Industry stakeholders are also pushing for SAF to be formally brought under the bioenergy sector, as it is still classified under fossil fuels. “Reclassification would allow SAF to access incentives already available in the bioenergy space, such as those under the Gobardhan scheme, which currently excludes aviation fuels despite their higher economic value compared with biogas or small-scale projects,” the committee source added.

Traditional SAF is produced from waste oils and biomass, while synthetic SAF — also known as Power-to-Liquid — is created by synthesising fuel from carbon dioxide and water using renewable electricity. “A techno-commercial roadmap for SAF production in India includes a detailed analysis of blending targets, feedstock availability, infrastructure readiness, and the investment landscape until 2050 for the country to become an export hub,” said another bioenergy industry source involved in the development.

The policy is being steered jointly by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas (MoPNG) and the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA). While MoPNG will focus on production, certification and feedstock development, MoCA will handle implementation, airline blending obligations, airport readiness and compliance with ASTM D7566 and CORSIA standards. Other ministries, including New and Renewable Energy, Environment, Finance and the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, will support incentives, sustainability criteria and trade facilitation.

The development was verified by an official from the central government think tank Niti Aayog, which is also part of the committee.

Queries sent on September 9 to the secretaries and spokespersons of the ministries mentioned above and to the Niti Aayog chief executive remained unanswered till the time of publication of this story.

The LCA study on sugarcane-based SAF holds strategic significance since India currently lacks an LCA value in the CORSIA qualification framework. Brazil, with sugarcane, and the United States, with corn, already have benchmarks in place. “The report is under preparation and expected to be completed in a month,” said Souvik Bhattacharjya, senior fellow and director at TERI, in an emailed response.

Production capacity, according to government officials, is not a concern. Food ministry secretary Sanjeev Chopra said the estimated requirement for a 20 per cent ethanol blending target is 17 billion litres, while India already has an installed capacity of 18.25 billion litres, with another 2.5 billion litres in the pipeline.

“Further expansion is also being supported through the interest subvention scheme for the cooperative sector, which is adding to capacity creation. This ensures that production capacity itself will not be a limiting factor,” Chopra told this reporter last month.

He added that the key challenge lies in feedstock availability. “Ensuring a reliable and sustainable feedstock supply chain is now the government’s main focus, and dedicated efforts are underway to strengthen this aspect.”

Chopra also confirmed that standards for SAF are still being developed. “The government is actively working on finalising these standards, and once in place, they will provide clarity and certainty for producers and airlines alike. There is strong optimism that, by 2030, India will be able to achieve its 5 per cent SAF blending target, supported by robust capacity, clear standards, and coordinated policy measures,” he said.

Under the CORSIA framework, meeting the 5 per cent blending target for international flights by 2030 would require about 60 crore litres of ethanol if no other feedstocks are considered.

According to a 2024 Deloitte India report titled ‘Green wings: India’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) revolution in the making’, the country could produce 8-10 million tonnes of SAF annually by FY40, requiring investments of Rs 6-7 lakh crore ($70-85 billion). This scale of production could cut aviation emissions by 20-25 million tonnes a year and position the country as a global hub for green fuels.

Meanwhile, by the end of this calendar year, Indian Oil Corporation will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil, which will be sourced from large hotel chains, restaurants and sweets and snacks majors.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-10%2Ftmyp9eyb%2FSustainable-aviation-fuel-policy?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-10 10:57:25.903537

This new entity will spearhead the GIC's Sustainable Olefins project, starting with a comprehensive feasibility study to explore a groundbreaking, low-emission production pathway for essential chemical building blocks and sustainable aviation fuels.

The initiative focuses on using methanol-to-olefins (MTO) technology as a sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based production methods. By converting sustainable methanol—itself a rising star in the clean energy landscape—into olefins, the project aims to create a scalable and electrifiable route for producing these crucial industrial components. Olefins are the fundamental building blocks for countless products, including polymers and materials used in packaging, consumer goods, and electric vehicles. The feasibility study, a collaborative effort among GIC member companies, will assess the technical and economic viability of this first-of-its-kind production facility in Europe.

According to Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition, this project represents a critical step forward in addressing some of the most challenging aspects of industrial decarbonization. ""Transforming how we produce essential building blocks like olefins is key to reducing emissions in the chemical sector and related value chains, such as aviation,"" Tan stated. ""The announcement today signals the growing momentum toward transforming the global chemical sector at a time when new technologies are urgently needed to meet climate and business goals.""

The new spin-off structure is designed to facilitate deeper collaboration among participating companies, explore investment opportunities, and lay the groundwork for a potential large-scale project. This collaborative approach is a hallmark of the GIC, which was incubated at the World Economic Forum to tackle complex sustainability challenges that no single company can solve alone. The coalition, guided by leaders from major corporations like BASF, SABIC, and LyondellBasell, provides a crucial platform for co-developing and scaling new technologies and business models.

The project's scope extends beyond just low-carbon chemicals. A particularly impactful application of the MTO process is the production of electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF). By leveraging e-methanol—which is produced using renewable electricity, captured carbon dioxide, and green hydrogen—the MTO pathway offers a flexible and scalable route to decarbonize the aviation sector, a notoriously hard-to-abate industry. The rising demand for e-SAF, coupled with increasingly stringent regulatory mandates across Europe, positions this project to capitalize on a rapidly expanding market.

The timing of this initiative is particularly strategic. With the global green methanol market projected to triple by 2030, the spin-off is well-positioned to benefit from a growing supply of sustainable feedstock.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-10 10:57:36.177449

By turning crop waste into jet fuel, the city is positioning itself at the heart of a new energy future.","From corn stalks to jet fuel: how Moorhead is positioning itself as ground zero for aviation’s green revolution

When the Moorhead City Council unanimously voted to grant DG Fuels control over 554 acres between the municipal airport and industrial park, the air in the chamber seemed charged with possibility. This wasn’t just about land. It was about reshaping the future of flight.

DG Fuels has pledged a jaw-dropping $5 billion investment to build a plant that transforms agricultural residue and timber waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) nearly indistinguishable from traditional jet fuel but with a fraction of the climate footprint. If successful, the facility could start pumping out nearly 193 million gallons annually by 2030. That’s enough to fly a passenger jet around the planet more than 10,000 times each year.

For a city of just 50,000, the scale is staggering. But Moorhead is betting big, and the payoff could be historic.

Why This Land Deal Matters

At first glance, the “option agreement” the city approved sounds like dry legal jargon. In reality, it’s a clever low-risk move: DG Fuels gets time to test whether the site is viable, while the city keeps the land tied up without spending a dime of public money.

Key points:

The city trades patience for a potential multi-billion payoff.

No taxpayer money is at risk.

Land is reserved while feasibility checks unfold.

Why Moorhead?

The city sits at the sweet spot of biofuel logistics: abundant corn stover, direct rail access to timber regions, proximity to fuel distribution networks, and even its own municipal airport for test flights.

Moorhead’s unique advantages:

Feedstock: Surrounded by cornfields with abundant crop residue.

Connectivity: Rail lines linking timber sources and jet fuel hubs.

Proximity: Airport next door for demonstrations and testing.

Policy: Minnesota’s SAF tax credits attract investors.

Power: Local utilities backing renewable electricity.

Farmers stand to gain too. What was once waste stalks, leaves, and cobs could soon fetch a market price. Agronomists suggest carefully managed residue harvesting could boost both profitability and soil health.

Community benefits include:

Farmers earning from crop residue sales.

New jobs in trucking, baling, and logistics.

Research opportunities for universities and agronomists.

The Road Ahead

If timelines hold, site prep could begin in 2026, vertical construction in 2027, and commercial output by 2030. Thousands of jobs during peak construction and 200+ high-skill permanent roles could transform Moorhead’s economy.

Conclusion

Moorhead may look like an unlikely player in global aviation, but this project proves otherwise. By turning crop waste into jet fuel, the city is positioning itself at the heart of a new energy future. The path won’t be easy; every soil test, permit, and supply chain deal matters, but the rewards could echo far beyond Minnesota. If successful, the roar of jet engines worldwide may soon carry the quiet signature of one small city’s bold bet on cleaner skies.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-6.svg,N,,2025-09-10 04:56:36.883301

Governor Pillen Promotes Nebraska Ethanol, Concludes Successful Trade Mission to Japan

LINCOLN, NE – Today, Governor Jim Pillen wrapped up a highly productive trade mission to Japan. The mission included meetings with key importers of Nebraska beef and pork; opportunities to promote Nebraska-made biofuels; and high-level discussions to strengthen the state’s longstanding commercial, cultural, and educational ties to Japan.

“Japan is a top customer of Nebraska’s value-added agricultural products, and there is tremendous potential for our trade relationship to grow,” said Gov. Pillen. “In particular, there are gigantic opportunities for our state to meet Japan’s increasing demand for ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel. With the ability to produce the lowest-carbon corn ethanol on the planet, Nebraska is well-positioned to expand its presence in the Japanese market.”

On Monday afternoon, Gov. Pillen highlighted Nebraska’s advantages as a biofuels supplier during remarks to a gathering of ethanol buyers in Tokyo. The event was organized by the U.S. Embassy in Japan and the U.S. Grains Council. Now is an especially strategic time to promote Nebraska ethanol to Japan. In November 2024, the Government of Japan announced its intent to introduce higher ethanol blends into its fuel supply — with a target of having 10% ethanol in gasoline supplies by 2030 and 20% ethanol by 2040. This policy would significantly increase the country’s ethanol use, as Japan blended less than two percent of ethanol with gasoline in 2024 — one of the lowest percentages in the developed world. George Glass, U.S. Ambassador to Japan, also spoke at the ethanol buyers event. He emphasized the Midwest’s robust capacity to support clean energy development in Japan. The Nebraska Corn Board and Union Pacific also presented at the conference. Respectively, they underscored Nebraska’s sustainable agricultural practices and the state’s strategic location at the heart of the nation’s coast-to-coast transportation network.

Earlier on Monday, Governor Pillen touted Nebraska’s strengths in agriculture and manufacturing during a speech at the Midwest-Japan Association conference. The annual event, which alternates between being held in the U.S. and in Japan, provided a platform for the state to showcase the benefits it can offer Japanese customers and investors.

Today, the final day of the trade mission, the state’s delegation met with leaders from Kawasaki to thank them for investing in Nebraska. Kawasaki has operated a major manufacturing facility in Lincoln since 1974. It produces all-terrain vehicles, utility vehicles, recreation utility vehicles, personal watercrafts (such as Jet Skis), and passenger railcars. The company’s footprint in Lincoln has grown to nearly 1.3 million square feet of manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. In 2018, Kawasaki landed a $1.4 billion contract to build 535 next-generation subway cars for the New York City’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). Since then, MTA has upped its order multiple times (most recently in February 2025), increasing the value of the contract to $4.5 billion for 1,610 railcars.

Japan has the world’s fourth largest economy. According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Nebraska’s exports to Japan totaled $699 million in 2024. Nebraska opened its first international office in Japan in 2006 (Nebraska Center Japan). It serves as the main point of contact for Japanese companies looking for business opportunities in Nebraska.

This achievement not only expands Delta’s SAF footprint but positions PDX – owned and operated by the Port of Portland – to capitalise on the continued growth of SAF across the US.

The batch of more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF was made in the US from waste-derived feedstock.

Shell supplied the neat SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal in Portland where it was blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck and pipeline.

Earlier this month, the blended SAF entered the airport’s privately owned fuel supply system.

Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF director, said: “Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel.

“By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.”

Dan Pippenger, chief aviation officer at the Port of Portland, said: “We’re excited about this step toward bringing sustainable aviation fuel to PDX.

“It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities.

““We’re looking forward to working with our partners to make sure state and local policies support development of the infrastructure and market needed to bring SAF here on a larger scale – and unlock all of the health and environmental benefits it offers.”

SAF is an alternative jet fuel made from renewable sources that can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80%, when compared to conventional jet fuel.

Existing jet fuel infrastructure can be leveraged to deliver SAF to airports today, and it is safe to use in current aircraft engines.

However, the technology to produce it remains nascent, so it is expensive and not widely available.

In fact, there is not enough SAF in production today to fuel the world’s airlines for a single week.

This is why the work to scale SAF and bring it to new markets, like Portland, is so important, said Delta.

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland.

Delta is also working at the federal level and across key states to advocate for continued and new government incentives that will increase production, improve cost-competitiveness and make SAF more accessible at scale.

In 2022, Oregon senator Ron Wyden, then chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed enactment of the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and creating the current fuel-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

40B and 45Z provided the initial policy frameworks for state level incentives emerging across the country and 45Z was extended by the US congress this year through 2029.

This delivery represents the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX, building on Delta’s broader SAF strategy, which includes previous deliveries to hubs like Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW).

This milestone also reflects the airline’s ongoing efforts to expand SAF availability and prove its repeatability and scalability across diverse airport systems.",https://airlinergs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/09/jmzvtyxn_xp1b1l4i_h264_8128k.mp4.00_02_36_07.still012.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 19:56:38.028779

ATR has been chosen by the European Union’s Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking to lead a pair of pioneering projects aimed at shaping the next generation of low-emission regional aircraft.

The move will put the Toulouse-based manufacturer out in front in the push to develop more sustainable aviation technology, with the goal of flying the world’s first hybrid-electric regional aircraft by 2030.

ATR develops hybrid-electric propulsion technology

Under Clean Aviation’s Ultra-Efficient Regional Aircraft (UERA) initiative, ATR will guide the development of hybrid-electric propulsion, advanced propeller systems, and electrified aircraft systems on a regional aircraft platform.

The programme will utilise an ATR 72-600 test bed to demonstrate these technologies in flight.

“We are honoured to lead this transformative effort with the support of Clean Aviation,” said Nathalie Tarnaud Laude, CEO at ATR.

“This is more than a technological demonstration, it’s a bold commitment to the future of regional aviation.

“By flying the world’s first hybrid-electric regional aircraft by 2030, we aim to further demonstrate that sustainability and connectivity can go hand in hand.”

The flagship project, HERACLES (Hybrid-Electric Regional Aircraft Concept for Low EmissionS), will combine hybrid-electric propulsion, high-performance batteries, and a thermal engine compatible with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

ATR 72-600 testbed

Its technologies will be validated through DEMETRA (Demonstrator of an Electrified Modern Efficient Transport Regional Aircraft) using the ATR 72-600 as a flying laboratory.

These efforts align with Clean Aviation’s target of achieving up to 30% greater fuel efficiency for next-generation regional aircraft and support the EU’s climate objectives, including the Fit for 55 package and the European Green Deal.

ATR is the world’s leading regional aircraft manufacturer, with its ATR 42 and ATR 72 turboprops widely used by over 200 airlines in more than 100 countries.

Hybrid electric for regional aviation

Hybrid-electric propulsion is set to change the economics and environmental impact of regional air travel.

By combining electric motors with traditional engines, aircraft can operate more efficiently, reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions while maintaining the range required for short- and medium-haul flights.

For example, a hybrid-electric ATR could make a sustainable connection between cities such as Inverness and London, or Belfast and Edinburgh, with lower operating costs and a smaller carbon footprint.

ATR has been working on its ‘EVO’ concept (pictured, top), which is built around “mild hybridisation”, with entry into service planned for the mid-2030s.

EVO is being designed to combine an ultra-efficient thermal engine with a battery-powered electrical motor to optimise the engine core size through the use of electrical power. ATR says this will maximise the overall efficiency of the propulsive system.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ATR-EVO-PW-full-1920x1080-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 15:56:22.007364

The application will also help the company identify broader operational trends and make system-wide changes to save fuel. Such efforts include analyzing data collected across all JetBlue flights; refining taxi procedures; and identifying opportunities for improved scheduling and procedures to help minimize ground delays and long taxi times that waste fuel (and frustrate passengers).

SkyBreathe is already used by more than 75 global airlines, though JetBlue says it is the first commercial airline in the U.S. to adopt the tool.

Our Analysis: Every Little Bit Helps in the Fight for Emission Reductions

The airline industry is a major contributor to global emissions, and solutions to this problem have been slow to roll out. Just this past June, the International Air Transport Association reported that the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still limited and expensive, while the delivery of more fuel-efficient jets has been largely delayed.

With these challenges hindering sustainability efforts, airlines must look for additional ways to reduce emissions. With the ability to make each flight a little more sustainable, JetBlue is creating small changes that have the potential to add up in a more significant way, especially when compounded with other environmental efforts. As part of its JetForward strategy, the airline says it is committed to enhancing operational efficiency and lowering fuel consumption.

What They Are Saying: Real-Time Insights Are Already Making a Difference

""Over the course of more than 900 daily flights, small gains in efficiency can translate into major savings,"" said Chris Lum, system chief pilot at JetBlue.

The study will leverage NEXTCHEM’s proprietary NX Circular™ gasification and NX CPO™ technologies for the development of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production facility in Immingham, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.

Altalto (Immingham) Ltd., established by Velocys to advance SAF initiatives in the UK, is leading the project, which is scheduled to begin operations by 2030. Once operational, the facility aims to produce approximately 30 million litres (23,000 tonnes) of SAF annually. This output is aligned with the UK government’s SAF Mandate and will serve the domestic aviation market. The project will use residual municipal solid waste (MSW) as well as commercial and industrial (C&I) waste as primary feedstocks, thereby transforming difficult-to-manage waste streams into high-value, low-carbon fuels.

To support development, the UK Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund has awarded the project a grant, enabling the Basic Engineering Design phase to move forward. The production volume is expected to be sufficient to power more than 500 transatlantic flights between London and New York each year, underscoring the project’s contribution to decarbonising aviation.

The plant will integrate NEXTCHEM’s NX Circular™ gasification process, which transforms waste into synthesis gas (syngas). This syngas will be converted into SynCrude using Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch technology, before being refined into premium SAF. Alongside this, the NX CPO™ (Controlled Partial Oxidation) technology provides a highly efficient route to syngas generation through a rapid oxidation process. By combining these technologies, the plant is designed to maximize fuel yield while simultaneously reducing the carbon intensity of the final product.

MyRechemical will act both as a technology supplier and as the coordinator of the consortium of technological partners. Engineering services will be supported by NEXTCHEM’s NX Engineering District in Catania, with additional input from other MAIRE Group companies. The initiative is expected to deliver multiple environmental and socio-economic benefits: more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions will be avoided each year, residual waste will be valorized, and around 100 permanent jobs will be created. During the construction phase, the project anticipates generating about 1,000 direct and 300 indirect jobs, while also boosting the UK’s balance of payments by reducing reliance on imported fuels and fostering investment and export opportunities.

Commenting on the achievement, Fabio Fritelli, Managing Director of NEXTCHEM, stated: “This award demonstrates the strength and flexibility of our technological solutions, which address the urgent decarbonisation needs of the mobility sector, particularly in aviation.”

The SAF Mandate forms a crucial part of the UK’s aviation decarbonisation roadmap. Starting in 2025, it requires 2% of total jet fuel demand to come from SAF, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040, ensuring long-term commitment toward sustainable aviation.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-09 14:56:24.419021

She emphasized that by working with Shell and the Port of Portland to utilize existing infrastructure, Delta is able to access SAF at more airports and prove its viability and scalability.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a crucial component in the airline industry's plan to achieve net-zero emissions. Made from renewable sources, it can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. It is a ""drop-in"" fuel, meaning it can be used in current aircraft engines and existing fuel infrastructure without any modifications, making it a practical and immediate solution. Despite these advantages, the technology to produce SAF is still in its early stages, making it expensive and not widely available. In fact, current global production is not enough to fuel the world's airlines for even a single week.

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other stakeholders to create a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF. On a national level, the airline is advocating for new government incentives to increase production and improve cost-competitiveness. These efforts build on the groundwork laid by Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, who championed the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

Sept. 9, 2025, © Leeham News: At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Global Aerospace Summit in Washington, D.C., Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury shared an optimistic outlook for Airbus operations speaking on supply chain recovery, production goals, tariffs, sustainability, and next generation aircraft programs.

Supply Chain Challenges and Recovery

Faury claimed that the supply chain picture has changed dramatically for the better compared to 2023. Deliveries from most suppliers are now arriving on time, though he admitted that “The one that is impacting the on-time delivery most is the two engine manufacturers.” For the first half of the year, Airbus is averaging as many as 60 “gliders” per end of momth — aircraft completed but waiting for engines. He said the situation has been improving and that “We hear from our engine colleagues that they expect to be back to what we need to deliver our planning goals. That’s why we are maintaining what we believe we are going to deliver to our customers.”

Engine makers remain in recovery mode, working through shortages of both new engines and spare parts. Airlines’ strong demand ahead of the summer peak adds to the pressure, but Faury noted that manufacturers have been transparent about their timelines. “You can’t be speculating on the fact that everything will go well. You have to factor in crises and recover today,” he said. When asked about Airbus’ target of 820 deliveries in 2025, Faury’s response was confident: “The answer is yes because we see that the supply chain is there, slightly better than we planned. I’m really worried about the engines, but what we hear from our engine colleagues is that they’ll be back before the end of the year.” He explained that many of the delayed aircraft would ultimately be delivered in the second half, once engines are available.

Expansion at Airbus America FAL in Mobile, Alabama

Faury highlighted the growing role of Airbus’ U.S. production site in Mobile, Alabama, where the company now has two A321 assembly lines and one for the A220. “In Mobile, we have two A321 lines finalized and one for the A220.” When complete, he says the sprawling facility that will be the fourth largest production site in the world for commercial aircraft. Airbus delivered 91 aircraft from Mobile last year, and with a FAL coming online, capacity will rise significantly. According to Faury, “When the third line is in place, the capacity we have will be around 200 aircraft per quarter.” He described the expansion as a symbol of Airbus’ commitment to the U.S. market and a sign of its confidence in long-term demand.

Next Generation Aircraft

Airbus continues to press ahead with its next-generation single-aisle program, which it expects to launch by the end of the decade and bring into service in the mid-2030s. Faury said, “We’re targeting better fuel efficiency by overall 20 to 25 percent, and about half of it will come with propulsion.” The other half, he explained, will come from aerodynamic improvements, lighter weight, and longer wings. Airbus is working closely with CFM, GE, and Pratt & Whitney to validate technologies and identify the right architecture. “We’re still in the research validation of the technologies, comparing technologies. We’re working hard… to identify and understand how we overcome the challenges and how we can see, but it’ll be a winning architecture,” he said.

While blended wing designs appear promising for widebody aircraft, Airbus has determined they are less suitable for narrowbodies. “We came to the conclusion that the blended wing is for bigger, wide-body planes,” Faury explained. “But for the narrow-bodies, the thickness of the blended wing is too high so you loose on drag. So we’ve come to the conclusion that the better architecture for narrow bodies is the more conventional (tube design) with longer wings which are better for efficiency.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

On the sustainability front, Faury reiterated Airbus’ support for sustainable aviation fuel while acknowledging the challenges ahead. “You don’t have this alignment between ecological and economics. Bringing down the price is a big challenge,” he said. Faury argued that more innovation will be needed to scale SAF adoption: “I think we are right to continue to target more SAF, but we have to be more creative.”

Tariffs and Transatlantic Cooperation

Turning to trade policy, Faury praised the long-standing “zero-for-zero” agreement eliminating tariffs on aerospace goods, calling it a foundation for the industry’s success. “We contribute to the positive balance of aerospace in the U.S.,” he said, adding that Airbus’ work with American partners “confirms the fact that what we have today leads to a very powerful, I call it North Atlantic ecosystem, which the U.S. and the EU are offering to the world.”

He noted that without the tariff-free agreement, costs would have risen and efficiency would have suffered, though he believes demand would have remained strong. “If zero-for-zero did not get approved… that would’ve had a negative impact on the cost base, on the efficiency of what we do,” he said. “We would have continued to do the same. But what we have now is much more effective.”",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Guillaume-Faury.png,N,,2025-09-09 13:56:40.579789

Founded in 1926, Northwest Airlines grew from humble beginnings into a global carrier headquartered in the Twin Cities.
In 2008, when Delta and Northwest Airlines merged, it marked not the end of Northwest’s legacy, but its continuation.

Mr. Speaker, Delta’s 100th anniversary is not only a milestone for the company, but also a moment to honor the people who make up Delta’s legacy and current workforce.","Ms. McCollum: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 100th anniversary of Delta Air Lines, a remarkable milestone for one of the world’s most innovative and enduring airlines.

As Delta commemorates a century of service in 2025, we in Minnesota are especially proud to reflect on the deep roots this company has in our state through the history and legacy of Northwest Airlines. Founded in 1926, Northwest Airlines grew from humble beginnings into a global carrier headquartered in the Twin Cities. Northwest played a central role in shaping Minnesota’s economy, creating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, and connecting our communities to the nation and the world. Its story is inextricably linked to our state’s modern history.

One of the earliest chapters of that story is written at Holman Field in Saint Paul, the city’s historic downtown airport. Holman Field bears the name of Charles “Speed” Holman, the pioneering aviator and Minnesota native who was hired as Northwest’s first pilot in 1926. Holman’s legacy as a fearless pilot and a trailblazer in American aviation is preserved every time a plane lands at that field along the Mississippi River.

In 2008, when Delta and Northwest Airlines merged, it marked not the end of Northwest’s legacy, but its continuation. Delta wisely built upon Northwest’s deep roots in Minnesota and throughout the Upper Midwest, ensuring that the Twin Cities would remain a vital hub for international travel and commerce. Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP) now stands as one of Delta’s largest hubs, carrying forward a proud tradition of service, safety, and innovation that began nearly a century ago.

That same spirit of innovation continues today through the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Hub at MSP. This partnership, led by Greater MSP, brings together partners such as Delta, Ecolab, Xcel Energy, and the Metropolitan Airports Commission in the nation’s first large-scale hub committed to scaling production of sustainable aviation fuel to replace conventional jet fuel. As an anchor partner of the Minnesota SAF Hub, Delta is helping to create an industrial-scale supply chain for sustainable aviation fuel, anchored in Minnesota.

Mr. Speaker, Delta’s 100th anniversary is not only a milestone for the company, but also a moment to honor the people who make up Delta’s legacy and current workforce. From Charles “Speed” Holman and the thousands of dedicated Northwest employees who made aviation history in Minnesota, to the tens of thousands of Delta’s current employees—many of whom belong to a union—pilots, flight attendants, customer service agents, and the skilled technicians, engineers, and mechanics who ensure Delta flights are safe and enjoyable—this centennial reflects a shared story of vision, resilience, and progress.

On behalf of the people of Minnesota’s Fourth Congressional District, I extend my warmest congratulations to Delta Air Lines on 100 years of service and innovation, and I look forward to its continued success in the century ahead.

The delivery represents the first time that SAF has been made available at a commercial scale at the airport. It involves more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF produced in the United States using waste-based feedstock. Shell supplied the fuel to the Zenith Energy terminal in Portland, where it was combined with conventional jet fuel in line with regulatory standards. The blended product was transported to PDX by barge, truck and pipeline, entering the airport’s fuel network in August.

SAF is produced from renewable sources and can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions compared with fossil-based jet fuel. It can be distributed through existing supply infrastructure and used in current aircraft engines without modification. Despite its potential, production remains limited and costs are higher than traditional jet fuel. Global output is still far from meeting aviation demand.

Delta’s Director of SAF, Charlotte Lollar said:

Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel. By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.

The Portland delivery is part of Delta’s wider strategy to establish SAF at multiple airports. Previous deliveries have been made to Minneapolis–Saint Paul and Detroit.

At a policy level, Delta has also supported the development of government incentives to encourage SAF production. Federal measures such as the SAF Blenders Tax Credit (40B) and the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) have formed the basis for state-level initiatives and, following congressional approval, the 45Z credit is set to continue until 2029.

In Oregon, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other stakeholders to explore ways of creating a reliable market for SAF in the region. The airline operates a significant network from PDX, connecting to most of its hub airports across the United States, and employs around 4,500 people in the Pacific Northwest.

Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger said:

We're excited about this step toward bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities. We're looking forward to working with our partners to make sure state and local policies support development of the infrastructure and market needed to bring SAF here on a larger scale – and unlock all of the health and environmental benefits it offers.

MARKET DRIVERS

Strategic Geographic Positioning as a Global Air Bridge

The unparalleled geographic location by enabling airlines to capture a disproportionate global transit traffic is also driving the growth of the Middle East aviation market. Positioned at the crossroads of major trade and travel corridors, the region allows for non-stop connectivity between high-demand city pairs such as Sydney–London, Mumbai–New York, and Johannesburg–Tokyo. This centrality reduces flight times and fuel consumption compared to polar or transatlantic detours, which is making it economically advantageous for both full-service carriers and cargo operators. Emirates, for instance, operates flights to 130 destinations with an average connecting time of under 90 minutes in Dubai, a feat enabled by spatial efficiency and advanced ground handling.

Government-Led Economic Diversification and Infrastructure Investment

The national economic transformation initiatives in Saudi Arabia and the UAE are fueling unprecedented investment in aviation infrastructure and ecosystem development, which is accelerating the growth of the Middle East aviation market. Similarly, the UAE’s Al Maktoum International Airport expansion aims to handle 260 million passengers annually by 2050.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Overreliance on Transit Traffic and Vulnerability to Global Disruptions

The heavy dependence on international connecting passengers, which exposes carriers to external shocks beyond regional control is restricting the growth of the Middle East aviation market. This model, while efficient under stable conditions, becomes vulnerable during global disruptions such as pandemics, geopolitical conflicts, or shifts in international travel policies. For example, during the 2020 airspace closures, passenger volumes at Dubai International plummeted by 75%, as per the Dubai Airports Company. Unlike airlines in North America or Europe with strong origin-and-destination (O&D) traffic, Gulf carriers lack a deep local travel base. Additionally, rising protectionism in aviation rights such as the U.S. opposition to open skies agreements threatens route expansion.

Environmental Regulatory Pressure and Carbon Emissions Scrutiny

The rapid expansion of long-haul operations in the Middle East is increasing scrutiny from global environmental regulators due to high carbon emissions per passenger-kilometer on ultra-long-haul routes, which is additionally hampering the growth of the Middle East aviation market. Gulf airlines face escalating operational costs with the European Union enforcing stricter CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) compliance and potential carbon border taxes.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Expansion of Air Cargo and E-Commerce Logistics Networks

The surge in cross-border e-commerce and high-value freight to expand their air cargo dominance is major factor showcasing new opportunities for the growth of the Middle East aviation market. The rise of digital marketplaces such as Noon and Amazon.ae has amplified demand for express logistics for electronics, pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods. Additionally, the UAE’s establishment of the Dubai South Logistics District a 27-square-kilometer dedicated logistics zone that enables seamless integration of air, land, and sea freight.

Development of Domestic and Regional Tourism Aviation Markets

The deliberate push to cultivate domestic and intra-regional tourism to reduce reliance on transit passengers and build sustainable origin-and-destination traffic is additionally to enhance the growth of the Middle East aviation market. Saudi Arabia aims to increase domestic travel to 100 million trips annually by 2030, as outlined by the Ministry of Tourism, which is supported by the development of 14 tourism megaprojects including NEOM and the Red Sea Global destinations. This shift is accompanied by the launch of new low-cost carriers such as flyadeal and Riyadh Air that designed to stimulate affordable air travel within the Kingdom and across the GCC. Enhanced visa facilitation such as Saudi Arabia’s recent introduction of e-visas for 56 countries will further boosts the growth of the Middle East aviation market.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Mexico plans to turn one of the Caribbean’s most persistent environmental problems—massive seasonal blooms of sargassum algae—into a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The initiative addresses international aviation’s need for SAF while also offering a solution to a problem that has plagued the country’s tourism sector.

Sargassum converted from environmental crisis to SAF

Every year, millions of tons of sargassum wash up on beaches across the Caribbean coast, creating an unpleasant mess that threatens tourism and marine ecosystems. These algae release foul-smelling gases as they decompose, and pose a health risk to those involved in the daily cleanups required. Experts say that cleaning just 1km of beach can cost local communities around $1 million a year.

This May, a record-breaking 39 million tons (37.5 million metric tons) of sargassum clogged the Caribbean Sea. It even reached parts of the Atlantic Ocean, as tracked by the University of South Florida’s College of Optical Oceanography Laboratory (COOL). In their report, COOL notes “significant Sargassum inundation events” around most Caribbean nations and islands, including the Mexican Caribbean coast.

During a recent Ministerial Reunion of Latin America and the Caribbean for the Implementation of Regional Action, SEMARNAT, in partnership with the European Union, hosted a technical session proposing the establishment of a regional, possibly multinational, company to process this algae into SAF.

“Sargassum is a phenomenon without borders,” said SEMARNAT Minister Alicia Bárcena, as reported by Mexico Business News. “Today, the Caribbean faces more than 50 million metric tons of this algae. Regional cooperation is not optional—it is the only way to turn a threat into an opportunity.”

The plan would serve two strategic goals: mitigating the environmental and economic damage caused by uncontrolled sargassum arrivals, and helping airlines meet their upcoming fuel-blend obligations under ICAO’s CORSIA framework and national mandates.

Quintana Roo Circular Economy Centre

At a state level, Quintana Roo has already broken ground on a Comprehensive Sargassum Sanitation and Circular Economy Centre. The facility is designed to handle the collection, monitoring, and first-stage processing of the algae. While the initial focus is on biogas, officials say the technology roadmap leads directly to biofuels, including SAF.

According to engineer Miguel Ángel Aké Madera, director of bioenergy company Nopalimex, the energy potential is significant: processing 500 tons of sargassum can yield 20,000 cubic meters of biogas, roughly equivalent to the daily fuel sales of a typical Mexican gas station. “This is not a marginal solution—it is a scalable one,” Aké told Wired.

Building a regional model to convert sargassum to biofuel

A sargassum-based biofuel industry could convert expensive cleanup into an economic engine.

Mexico is not the only country experimenting with sargassum valorisation. Research into converting algae into energy has already been conducted in various countries and islands throughout the Caribbean.

In Puerto Rico, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), with $2 million funding from the US Department of Energy Bioenergy Technologies Office, explored processing Sargasso to produce SAF and graphite for lithium batteries.

But Mexico’s plan to institutionalise production through a state-backed company could make it the first country in the region to integrate sargassum into commercial SAF supply chains.

Sargassum: a sustainable feedstock for SAF

Global demand for SAF is expected to outpace supply for years, with IATA estimating airlines will need at least 120 billion litres annually by 2050 to reach net zero. Feedstock availability remains one of the greatest bottlenecks. While waste oils, fats, and agricultural residues are already in use, scaling up requires novel, non-food-based sources.

Sargassum offers some advantages as a feedstock:

It is a non-edible biomass, avoiding food-versus-fuel debates.

It grows rapidly and in abundance, requiring no farmland.

The collection solves an existing environmental and economic problem in tourism-dependent regions.

If Mexico succeeds in establishing a reliable supply chain, sargassum could become a showcase for how regional challenges can be transformed into SAF opportunities.

While Mexico’s sargassum-to-SAF initiative is still in its early stages, with growing political backing and private-sector interest, it could move quickly. For airlines, particularly those operating in Latin America and the Caribbean, the prospect of a locally sourced SAF is a development to watch closely as the industry moves toward its 2050 decarbonization targets.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sargassum_sp._Sargasse-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-09 07:56:29.001426

Nowhere is this opportunity more promising than in the Middle East, where 22% of carbon dioxide emissions come from the transport sector.","At Honeywell, we believe the answer lies in a three-pronged approach: increasing efficiency through digitalisation, diversifying the energy mix, and deploying next-generation technologies like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Innovation through collaboration

In response to the growing urgency, Honeywell recently announced a ground-breaking global alliance with Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy, and SAMSUNG E&A to deliver an end-to-end solution for producing SAF from biomass and municipal solid waste. This alliance is more than a technological collaboration. It is a blueprint for how the Middle East can scale SAF production quickly, affordably, and sustainably.

The alliance combines Honeywell’s advanced process technologies and digital automation with Johnson Matthey’s catalyst innovation, GIDARA’s gasification expertise, and SAMSUNG E&A’s engineering capabilities.

With the resources of all four companies, the integrated and modular solution is expected to reduce the time between feasibility study and facility startup by more than 15% and can reduce capital expenditures by up to 10%.

Importantly, it unlocks access to non-traditional and waste-based feedstocks, addressing one of the biggest bottlenecks in SAF scale-up: feedstock availability.

This innovation comes at a critical time. The Middle East generates millions of tons of municipal waste annually, presenting a significant opportunity to transform this untapped resource into valuable, sustainable energy.

SAF produced from such waste not only reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, but also reduces landfill dependency and enhances energy security by tapping into local, non-traditional feedstocks.

Feedstock limitations fuelling technological advancements

As global SAF adoption accelerates from 344 million gallons in 2025 to a projected 7.6 billion gallons by 2035, and airlines in the region begin adopting and utilising SAF, feedstock availability is a growing concern. Traditional feedstocks like corn, soy, and sugarcane will not be enough.

Honeywell’s hydrocracking and eFining™ technologies are designed to overcome this limitation by converting a broader range of inputs – including biomass, municipal waste, and even captured CO₂ – into jet fuel that is ready for use today.

Additionally, Honeywell’s eFining™ process creates eFuel using green hydrogen and captured CO₂. This is then used to produce eMethanol, which is upgraded into SAF. Honeywell UOP eFining can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 88% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Scale is equally critical to impact. Honeywell has issued more than 70 renewable fuel licenses globally, with licensed SAF technologies capable of producing over 500,000 barrels per day once fully operational. This global footprint includes projects in the Middle East and is pivotal in meeting projected future demand.

This scale and momentum are further reinforced by Honeywell’s recent agreement to acquire Johnson Matthey’s Catalyst Technologies business, a strategic move that strengthens Honeywell’s ability to deliver high-performance catalyst and process technology solutions for the global energy market and expand our renewable fuel solutions.

Meeting the growing energy demand

Underlying all of this is the imperative of energy security. Every country today is seeking to ensure a stable, affordable and clean energy supply for its people.

BloombergNEF forecasts a 25% increase in global natural gas demand by 2050, reaching 5.5 trillion cubic meters, reaffirming the continued importance of transitional fuels. However, meeting future demand will also require alternative solutions, such as SAF, that are scalable, reliable, and climate-resilient.

Honeywell’s integrated approach helps countries strengthen their energy resilience while supporting their environmental commitments.

By combining digitalised operations with feedstock diversification and next-generation fuel technologies, we enable sustainable growth while lowering emissions.

Nowhere is this opportunity more promising than in the Middle East, where 22% of carbon dioxide emissions come from the transport sector. With its deep energy expertise, infrastructure investment and commitment to emission reduction efforts, the region can lead the world in SAF production and deployment.

These include the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, both extended through 2029, which are intended to accelerate the growth of SAF supply in the United States.

This latest step follows Delta’s earlier SAF deliveries at Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. With the addition of Portland, the airline continues to expand its SAF footprint, aiming to create a consistent supply chain that supports its long-term environmental goals.

The cooperation among Delta, Shell, and the Port of Portland demonstrates how partnerships can help advance the integration of sustainable fuels into aviation. The company noted that expanding SAF availability is key to scaling its use across the industry and supporting broader efforts to reduce emissions in air travel.",,N,,2025-09-09 10:56:59.269185

In its latest decision on 3 September, Shell subsidiary Shell Nederland said it had decided not to restart building at the site following an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation to reassess the project's competitiveness.
De Haan said that despite Shell’s decision, the company was still “one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel”.

About half of the biofuels from the Rotterdam plant was expected to be used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fat, The Guardian reported on 4 September.

In its latest decision on 3 September, Shell subsidiary Shell Nederland said it had decided not to restart building at the site following an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation to reassess the project's competitiveness.

Speaking about the decision to halt the project, Shell’s downstream, renewables and energy solutions president Machteld de Haan said:

“As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.”

Shell’s move follows Finnish forestry/paper mill company UPM’s announcement in May to halt plans for the development of a biofuels refinery at the Port of Rotterdam due to “technical, commercial and strategic evaluations”.

De Haan said that despite Shell’s decision, the company was still “one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel”.

“We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system.”

In 2024, Shell traded over 10bn litres of low carbon fuels, selling 10 times more than it produced while becoming one of the world’s leading suppliers of SAF, the company said.

In the same year, Shell said it became one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of SAF, with close to 20% of total sales in North America and Europe.

The Rotterdam decision followed Shell’s cancellation of its SAF project on Bukom Island, Singapore, in March 2023.

In an emailed statement on 30 March 2023, the company confirmed to Reuters it was halting the exploration of two projects – a biofuels unit and a Group II base oil plant in Singapore.

According to The Guardian report, SAF proponents believe the fuel could be crucial for airlines to cut their emissions in line with global climate targets, although critics say SAF is not a realistic alternative.

MAIRE announces that NEXTCHEM, through its subsidiary MyRechemical, key player in the Waste-to-Chemical segment, has been awarded an engineering study contract by Altalto Ltd. based on its proprietary NX Circular gasification and NX CPO technologies for a SAF plant in Immingham, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.

Altalto (Immingham) Ltd. is a company set up by Velocys to develop SAF projects in the UK. The plant is expected to be operational in 2030. Initial targets include the production of 30 million litres (23 thousand tonnes) of SAF per year for the UK market in support of the SAF Mandate. Feedstocks will be sourced from residual municipal solid waste (MSW) and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste.

The project has been awarded a grant from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund to progress Basic Engineering Design. The SAF from the plant will be enough to power over 500 flights from London to New York per year.

Cutting-edge NX Circular gasification technology allows the plant to convert waste by generating synthesis gas (syngas), which is subsequently transformed to SynCrude through Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch technology and upgraded to high-quality sustainable fuels. The application of this solution, combined with NX CPO™ technology, offers a unique and efficient design. NX CPOTM ensures an advanced innovative process to produce synthesis gas via controlled partial oxidation through a very fast reaction. When applied to synthetic fuel production, this versatile technology is contributing to maximizing overall yield while minimizing carbon intensity of the product.

MyRechemical will operate as a technology provider and as coordinator for other technological partners. It will also supply engineering services supported by NEXTCHEM’s NX Engineering District in Catania and involve other sister companies of the MAIRE Group.

It must be entered in the “Electricity: Grid Consumption” field of the 45ZCF-GREET model.","Renewable fuel producers are eager to claim the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, but one powerful opportunity often flies under the radar—offsetting a facility’s electricity emissions through Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs).

As one of the most significant incentives for low-carbon fuel production in recent years, 45Z rewards producers that can demonstrate measurable reductions in their carbon intensity (CI). The difference of just a few CI points can translate into millions of dollars in additional credit value over the life of the program. This makes every emissions-reduction strategy worth exploring, especially those—like EACs—that can be implemented without major infrastructure changes.

By strategically using EACs, producers can further lower their CI score and qualify for a higher tax credit value. If EACs are not part of your 45Z strategy, you may be leaving money on the table.

EAC eligibility criteria for 45Z are outlined in the Department of Energy’s 45ZCF-GREET User Manual. While tailored for ethanol and other clean fuel producers, these rules draw heavily from the 45V Hydrogen Production Tax Credit framework.

What are Energy Attribute Certificates?

An EAC is a contractual instrument that conveys information—or “attributes”—about one megawatt-hour of electricity, including the resource used to create it and the emissions associated with its generation. Owning and retiring an EAC gives the holder the right to claim the renewable attributes it represents.

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are the most familiar type of EAC. Under 45Z, qualifying EACs allow renewable fuel producers to specify electricity purchases from solar, wind and hydroelectric sources, which are modeled as zero-emission in the DOE’s 45ZCF-GREET model. This allows renewable fuel producers to offset the emissions from grid electricity.

Three Key Requirements for EAC Eligibility

The DOE identifies three key guardrails—deliverability, temporal matching and incrementality—to ensure that a transportation fuel producer’s electricity use accurately reflects the emissions from the specific generators associated with the purchased and retired EACs. These qualifying EAC requirements are designed to reduce the risk of induced grid emissions pushing lifecycle GHG emissions rates above statutory thresholds. Much of the rationale for including these guardrails, again, is drawn from the 45V Credit for Hydrogen Production.

Incrementality standards require that the renewable generation source must be no more than 36 months older than the ethanol production facility. Temporal matching is required annually through 2029; hourly matching will be mandatory starting in 2030. Temporal matching must be measured in megawatts, so that the number of megawatt hours of electricity used to produce transportation fuel would be matched with an equal number of megawatt hours from qualifying EACs.

Deliverability requirements state that the electricity must be generated in the same region as the production facility, as defined in the DOE’s National Transmission Needs Study. For example, an ethanol plant in the Midwest region must source EACs from that same region to meet deliverability requirements.

Two Options for Claiming Electricity Use

The first option available to ethanol producers is behind-the-meter (BTM) electricity, which is electricity generated and consumed on-site that can be claimed using qualifying EACs. These must be documented and retired in accordance with 45Z requirements. The amount entered in the model cannot exceed the facility’s total electricity consumption, even if the facility is a net exporter. All fuels used to generate BTM electricity must be accounted for in the facility’s energy balance.

The second option is grid power. Electricity purchased from the grid is modeled using regional emissions factors tied to the DOE’s Needs Study regions. It must be entered in the “Electricity: Grid Consumption” field of the 45ZCF-GREET model. Unless substantiated by qualifying EACs, grid power is assumed to have the average emissions profile of the region.

Some producers will use a combination of options one and two, in which case amounts must be carefully documented and entered into the GREET model.

Important Limitations

• No gas EACs – Book-and-claim instruments for renewable natural gas (RNG) are not currently allowed under 45Z. Treasury may allow them in the future, but additional guidance is needed.

• No double counting – The same EAC cannot be claimed under multiple programs. For example, an EAC used for 45Z cannot also be claimed under California’s LCFS.

EAC Registries and Verification

Only qualified EAC registries may be used to issue and retire EACs. These registries must provide a publicly accessible view of all currently registered electricity generators to prevent duplicative registration. Registries must also meet criteria such as issuing unique IDs for each EAC, preventing duplicate claims, identifying EAC owners and providing public transparency into registered electricity generators.

Qualified EAC registries act as third-party verifiers for issuance and management. Retirement of EACs must be verified through a statement issued by the registry. If a generator is registered in multiple systems, the attestation must verify that each EAC is only issued once.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Contribution_Lede_Oct_EPM_25_f8a7ff604c.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 23:56:09.106479

During its meeting Monday, Sept. 8, city council members voted unanimously to authorize city staff to enter into an option agreement with DG Fuels, a sustainable aviation fuel company that has expressed interest in building a $5 billion production facility in Moorhead. Council member Lisa Borgen was not at the meeting.

In November 2024, Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels announced it had picked Moorhead as the site of a facility to produce low-carbon aviation fuel. The proposed facility will produce around 193 million gallons of fuel annually, according to the company’s announcement. Production is expected to begin in 2030.

The plant would use biomass, including materials left in the field after corn harvest and timber waste, to produce near-zero carbon fuel, the announcement said.

Derrick LaPoint, president and CEO of Downtown Moorhead Inc., told The Forum the agreement will allow DG Fuels to hold the land. Through the agreement, the city of Moorhead will not be able to sell the land to another party without notifying DG Fuels, he explained.

“It’s really a tactic to allow time for them to do due diligence on the land, check on permitting and environmental and all that kind of stuff,” LaPoint said. “Then ultimately, if that’s satisfying to them, then we work towards entering a purchase agreement with them.”

DG Fuels is interested in a tract of land that stretches from Moorhead’s new industrial park to the Moorhead Municipal Airport. According to LaPoint, the parcel includes 554 acres of land.

LaPoint told city council members that DG Fuels Chairman Michael Darcy requested the agreement as part of an application for federal Energy Department tax credits. To continue with the application, the company has to show site control, he said.

“We feel that this is low risk to the city of Moorhead,” LaPoint said. “We feel that this is a great first step and really kind of securing some time and due diligence needed to make sure that this project can move forward in a real detailed way.”

In the coming months, the city will explore details of the proposed development, including its size, timeline and infrastructure needs, like power, water and wastewater, LaPoint said.

There is a payment tied to the agreement, LaPoint said, but an amount has not yet been finalized. If DG Fuels decides to purchase the property, the payment will be applied to the purchase price, according to the City Council packet.

LaPoint said the agreement will be for 12 months, but will be extendable.

Provisional data suggests SAF made up just 2% of aviation fuel supplies in 2023, up slightly from 1% the year before.

Current use: SAF made up just 2% of UK aviation fuel in 2023.
For airlines, the warning is stark: without greater government support and faster investment in domestic production, net zero targets may soon slip out of reach.","Britain’s aviation industry is sounding the alarm over the Government’s net zero targets, warning that without urgent action the country risks falling behind its climate pledges.

Two of the UK’s largest carriers, Virgin Atlantic and International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways – have raised concerns that the Government’s 10% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate for 2030 is becoming increasingly unrealistic.

At a global SAF summit in London, airline executives warned of a widening “credibility gap” between the aviation sector’s ambitious climate goals and the actual pace of fuel production. Despite the UK government mandating that one in ten litres of jet fuel must come from sustainable sources by the end of the decade, not a single SAF production plant has yet been built on British soil.

For Virgin Atlantic, the issue is one of trust. Holly Boyd-Boland, vice president of corporate development, told delegates that airlines risk reaching an inflection point where they can no longer convincingly claim they are on track for net zero.

“We’re at risk of a growing credibility gap for us as a sector in terms of where we set our ambition and what we actually deliver,” she said. “From a consumer perspective and wider stakeholders, we’re getting close to an inflection point where we cannot demonstrate supply in the system and a reduction in emissions.”

IAG’s group head of sustainability, Jonathon Counsell, highlighted just how steep the climb will be. Global SAF production stood at 1 million tonnes in 2023 – a fraction of the 400–500 million tonnes per year that would be required to hit global net zero targets by 2050.

IAG, which last year used more SAF than any other airline group at 162,000 tonnes, has attempted to lock in supply through contracts extending as long as 14 years. But Counsell admitted these deals were hard-fought internally. “It took five board meetings to get approval,” he said, citing fears that governments could soften mandates in the future, leaving those who invested early exposed to higher costs than rivals.

The situation has been compounded by last week’s announcement from Shell that it would abandon plans for a major biofuels plant in Rotterdam. Once touted as one of Europe’s largest SAF facilities, Shell concluded the project was too costly and “insufficiently competitive.”

For analysts, Shell’s retreat underscored the fragility of the sector. Ashley Kelty, energy analyst at Panmure Liberum, described it as “another nail in the ideological coffin” for SAF. The immediate consequence is that supplies will remain scarce and prices high, making it even harder for airlines to deliver on their green promises.

Boyd-Boland flagged another hurdle on the horizon: the UK’s decision to cap the use of SAF derived from used cooking oils and animal fats from 2027. Beyond that date, the country will need to pivot toward second-generation fuels made from municipal waste, non-edible crops and biomass. Yet Britain has no production capacity for these next-generation fuels.

Although the Government has earmarked £63 million for 17 prospective plants, none has yet secured a final investment decision – and industry insiders warn the clock is ticking.

From the European side, Dutch airline KLM’s sustainability chief Zita Schellekens said SAF still held the potential to be aviation’s “silver bullet.” But she cautioned that scaling up production required governments to play a much more active role in de-risking investment.

“This is a critical year,” she said. “The situation isn’t looking very favourable at all. Suppliers are taking a wait-and-see approach. We need more government intervention. More carrots.”

Consumer buy-in also remains weak. KLM revealed that just 1% of passengers opted to pay a surcharge for SAF, with many sceptical about whether their money would genuinely be used to buy cleaner fuel.

The Department for Transport insists progress is being made. A spokesman said: “SAF is a core part of the global drive to decarbonise aviation. SAF is already being produced and supplied at scale in the UK and we are seeing encouraging early signs that the SAF mandate will be met.”

But the industry’s scepticism tells a different story. Provisional data suggests SAF made up just 2% of aviation fuel supplies in 2023, up slightly from 1% the year before. That leaves a daunting trajectory to reach 10% in just seven years.

UK SAF challenge at a glance

Mandate: UK requires airlines to use 10% SAF by 2030.

Current use: SAF made up just 2% of UK aviation fuel in 2023.

Global supply: 1m tonnes produced worldwide in 2023 vs 400–500m tonnes needed annually by 2050.

Shell exit: Oil giant cancels Rotterdam plant, warning of high costs and weak competitiveness.

Domestic plants: 17 prospective UK facilities, £63m pledged, but none with final investment decision.

Future fuels: From 2027, UK will cap cooking oil and animal fat fuels, forcing shift to waste and biomass — where Britain has zero capacity.

For airlines, the warning is stark: without greater government support and faster investment in domestic production, net zero targets may soon slip out of reach. The fear is not only reputational but also competitive. If the UK lags behind Europe and the US in scaling up SAF, it risks losing both investment and influence in shaping global aviation policy.

As Virgin, IAG and KLM made clear, the industry wants to lead the decarbonisation drive. But ambition without supply is meaningless. Unless Britain’s SAF sector gets off the ground, the promise of sustainable flying may prove a mirage — and net zero aviation by 2050 could remain little more than a flight of fancy.",https://travellingforbusiness.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Virgin_SAF_100-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-08 19:56:20.098566

US Japan Trade Framework Implemented in Executive Order","In a major development for international trade and domestic economic growth, President Trump signed an executive order last week implementing the U.S.-Japan trade framework agreement announced in late July. This new trade deal is valued at over $15 billion and marks a significant step in strengthening economic ties between the United States and Japan.

The agreement secures vital access to Japanese markets for American exporters. As outlined in the deal, “American farmers and producers will immediately benefit from the deal with Japan’s commitment to purchase $8 billion of U.S. agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizers, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel; Japan will make stable and long-term incremental purchases of U.S. energy, including liquified natural gas, totaling $7 billion per year; and Japan will expedite implementation of a 75% increase in purchases of American rice, among others.”

The executive order also introduces new U.S. tariffs. The United States will apply a 15% baseline tariff on nearly all Japanese imports, including automobiles and auto parts, with additional sector-specific tariffs on other goods to protect and support domestic industries.

According to the White House, “Japan’s historic $550 billion investment commitment to President Trump will be invested in U.S. projects selected by President Trump, creating hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, dramatically expanding domestic manufacturing, and securing American prosperity for generations.”

This historic U.S.-Japan trade agreement is being praised across sectors, especially in agriculture. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins posted on X: “Huge Win for America’s farmers and ranchers. Our ally Japan just delivered MAJOR market access. This is what strong trade leadership looks like! Thank you President Trump for putting America’s farmers FIRST!

CONTACT: Michael Lee CEO, UMeWorld Limited Email: info@umeworld.com","MIAMI, Sept. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF), a public company engaged in functional nutrition and sustainable biofuel innovation, today provided a comprehensive corporate update.

UMeWorld operates a dual-growth platform powered by a single proprietary enzymatic technology. This breakthrough process enables the Company to deliver both DAGola™ functional cooking oils, clinically validated to improve metabolic health, and enzymatic biofuels, designed to convert low-cost feedstocks into sustainable biodiesel. This “one technology, two markets” strategy uniquely positions UMeWorld at the intersection of wellness and sustainability, offering investors exposure to both consumer health and renewable energy.

Alongside operational progress, UMeWorld also announced its intention to redomicile from the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) to the State of Delaware, USA as part of its long-term growth strategy and preparation for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange.

DAGola Functional Cooking Oils

UMeWorld’s flagship brand, DAGola™, continues to gain traction in the fast-growing functional foods sector. The brand has received strong reviews on Amazon, validating both product quality and consumer demand. To accelerate growth, the Company is preparing a micro-influencer marketing campaign aimed at expanding awareness and engagement across social media platforms.

A major milestone is expected in Q4 2025, when DAGola sales in China are scheduled to begin through a local established sales platform with a proven distribution network. This launch will be supported by targeted digital marketing and e-commerce initiatives. Looking further ahead, management plans to expand DAGola into Southeast Asia and the EU in 2026, building on rising demand for healthier edible oils and leveraging clinical validation.

Timeline Roadmap:

Now (2025): Scaling U.S. sales through Amazon and direct-to-consumer channels.

Q4 2025: China launch with local distribution and integrated digital campaigns.

2026: Expansion into Japan, Korea and EU markets.

The global edible oil market is valued at more than $250 billion annually, while the functional foods sector exceeds $150 billion. With clinically validated benefits - including up to 80% less triglycerides and proven improvements in metabolic health - DAGola is well-positioned to capture share within these large, growing markets.

Biofuel Pilot Plant in Malaysia

Building on the same enzymatic technology that powers DAGola, UMeWorld is expanding into the renewable energy sector. Preparations are underway to establish the Company’s first biofuel pilot plant in Malaysia, with a planned production capacity of 1,000 to 5,000 tonnes per year.

The pilot plant will focus on converting palm oil mill effluent (POME), used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, and other low-cost feedstocks into sustainable biodiesel. A key objective of the facility is to obtain EU and U.S. certification for UMeWorld’s enzymatic biofuel, which will pave the way for access to premium markets and carbon credit opportunities. Achieving certification will also serve as the foundation for developing a full-scale commercial plant that meets international standards.

Timeline Roadmap:

2025–2026 (12–18 months): Pilot plant development and certification process.

2027–2028 (2–3 years): Planning and execution of a commercial-scale facility meeting EU/US standards.

Beyond 2028: Expansion opportunities into U.S., EU, and Asia-Pacific markets.

The global biodiesel market is projected to exceed $90 billion by 2030, driven by strong EU and U.S. mandates for renewable energy adoption. By focusing on low-cost, waste-based feedstocks, UMeWorld aims to deliver both cost efficiency and sustainability advantages over conventional chemical and HVO-based biodiesel production methods.

Future Potential: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Beyond biodiesel, UMeWorld’s enzymatic process is also adaptable to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets. By pre-treating difficult feedstocks such as POME, UCO, and animal fats under mild, selective conditions, the Company’s technology can produce cleaner intermediates that integrate seamlessly with established hydroprocessing steps used in SAF production. Global aviation regulators and airlines are committing to ambitious carbon reduction goals, with SAF expected to represent a growing share of jet fuel consumption by 2030. UMeWorld’s long-term strategy includes exploring SAF pathways, positioning the Company to potentially supply low-carbon aviation fuel to premium international markets and form strategic partnerships with refiners and airlines.

Redomiciliation to Delaware

In parallel with these operational initiatives, UMeWorld is taking a major step to strengthen its corporate governance and capital markets profile. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a plan to redomicile through a statutory merger and share exchange. Upon completion, all outstanding shares of UMeWorld Limited (BVI) will be exchanged for shares of a newly incorporated Delaware entity, UMeWorld Inc.

Redomiciling to Delaware will provide the Company with a stronger corporate governance framework, greater transparency, and closer alignment with U.S. investor expectations. Most importantly, it establishes the structural foundation necessary for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq.

“Redomiciling to Delaware is not just a legal formality,” said Michael Lee, CEO of UMeWorld Limited. “It’s a strategic milestone that enhances our credibility, strengthens our corporate foundation, and positions UMeWorld to engage more fully with U.S. capital markets. Alongside DAGola’s growth and our biofuel expansion, this move sets the stage for long-term value creation.”

The redomiciliation is subject to customary shareholder approval and regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). UMeWorld will provide further details, including anticipated timelines and shareholder instructions, in upcoming communications.

President and CEO Derrick LaPoint first told The Flag about DG Fuels and their plan to build a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production facility near the Moorhead Municipal Airport.

According to the company, the plant will convert so-called ‘biomass’ agricultural by-products and clean hydrogen to produce high-value fuel.

On Tuesday night, the Moorhead City Council is expected to process an option agreement for 550 acres of land near the airport.

The approval would be a precursor to the actual purchase of the land by DG Fuels.

“We felt it was an appropriate next step to take this option agreement,” said LaPoint.

“We’re talking about a five to seven billion dollar plant that’s going to be constructed [which will come with] a lot of jobs, a lot of power and a lot of water. Those are all things that we have to figure out and have a plan for over the next twelve months.”

LaPoint says that includes “what that full infrastructure need is going to be.”

Production at the plant is expected to begin in 2030 according to DG Fuels.

Meanwhile, LaPoint says White Earth Nation is conducting a market survey to figure out how to build a casino and convention center on almost 300 acres of land the tribe purchased in Moorhead in December 2024.

“A casino doesn’t need that much land, but they’re trying to figure out the size of a hotel, convention center or an event space and the footprint of the casino,” said LaPoint. “There’s also been talk of a water park and other amenities as well.”

And as Fargo considers a site for its own new convention center, LaPoint says they’re coordinating conversations between the city and the tribe.

“We don’t see it as a competition,” said LaPoint. “We certainly don’t want to overlap. We want to make sure it’s complimentary and the tribe is well aware of that”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2327/2025/03/03222313/untitled-design-40.png,N,,2025-09-08 15:56:42.363997

The green hydrogen will supply SHS Group’s Saarland steelmakers, including Dillinger’s heavy plate production, Saarstahl’s long products and the joint venture ROGESA. Each company is transitioning under the government-backed Power4Steel decarbonisation programme.

Verso plans to flow the hydrogen through the cross-border mosaHYc pipeline into the Dillingen steel plant, before being distributed across SHS’ facilities. The volumes will be used alongside scrap metal in new direct reduction and electric arc furnaces to reduce CO2 emissions.

The energy firm specified that the green hydrogen will be developed to meet the EU Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) criteria. The electrolyser plant is currently at the development stage.

The mosaHYc pipeline, however, was commissioned last year, meaning the transport infrastructure is in place ahead of the plant construction.

“For Saarstahl and Dillinger, there is only one direction: forward,” said Stefan Rauber, SHS Managing Director. “The availability of renewable hydrogen is an important criterion for the success of our Power4Steel decarbonisation project.

“[The group] will offer customers a high-quality portfolio of CO2-reduced steel products.”

Xavier Caïtucoli, Verso Energy’s President, said the contract and CarlHYng project “confirm the company’s trajectory,” as it aims to become a European leader in the production of low-carbon fuels.

Beyond CarlHYng, Verso is advancing four hydrogen-based e-SAF projects in France, with additional plans for one in the US and two in Finland.

The company, already well-known for commercializing its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process to convert ethanol into SAF, has now expanded its technological reach by enabling production through the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. This achievement not only boosts aviation decarbonization efforts but also introduces a sustainable substitute for palm oil—an ingredient linked to deforestation and environmental degradation.

This innovation was developed in partnership with the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB and the Mibelle Group. Together, the organizations have created a palm oil alternative that preserves critical functional properties, particularly those demanded by the cosmetics industry. Beyond its industrial application, the development offers a novel pathway for producing SAF without relying on traditional oil crops or waste oils, which face limitations in scalability and sustainability.

Peter Müller, CEO of the Mibelle Group, emphasized the significance of this milestone, describing it as a new benchmark for the cosmetics sector. He highlighted the collaboration’s potential to enhance supply chain resilience while contributing to environmental responsibility. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech, echoed this sentiment, underscoring how the partnership exemplifies the power of innovative alliances to generate wide-ranging impacts—from reducing reliance on deforestation-linked ingredients to unlocking sustainable aviation fuel opportunities.

Tackling Palm Oil’s Environmental Burden

Palm oil remains a key global raw material thanks to its durability, heat resistance, and high yield. However, its widespread use has fueled extensive deforestation, habitat destruction, and significant CO2 emissions. These concerns have created urgent demand for scalable alternatives that reduce environmental harm while maintaining industrial utility.

The joint breakthrough addresses this challenge through a unique dual fermentation process pioneered by LanzaTech and Fraunhofer IGB. The method converts waste CO2 gases into alcohol, which is subsequently processed by non-GMO oil yeasts into a fat structurally similar to palm oil. After successful laboratory-scale demonstrations at Fraunhofer IGB and positive application trials at Mibelle Group laboratories, the project has advanced to pilot-scale production at Fraunhofer’s Center for Chemical-Biotechnological Processes in Leuna. This scale-up marks a critical step toward full commercial deployment.

Expanding Pathways for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

LanzaTech’s ethanol is already well established as a feedstock for SAF via the ATJ route. When derived from CO2 and green hydrogen, it can also produce e-fuels. Now, this new capability extends the company’s reach into the HEFA pathway, a vital route for global SAF supply. By converting ethanol into synthetic oils that mimic conventional HEFA feedstocks, LanzaTech can broaden the available resources for SAF production, offering a sustainable and circular alternative.

This breakthrough strengthens LanzaTech’s leadership in the SAF market while providing airlines and fuel producers with a practical solution for meeting decarbonization goals. The innovation demonstrates how carbon recycling technologies can have cross-sectoral impacts, delivering value to both energy and consumer goods industries while driving progress toward a more sustainable future.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-08 12:56:52.704063

Known as SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach, the system is designed to aid pilots in optimizing their fuel usage by analyzing their performance flight-by-flight.

In recent years, sustainability has become an increasingly important buzzword in the dynamic and diverse world of the commercial aviation industry, as airlines and airports around the world race to reach the sector's shared goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. While this is a huge challenge, it is certainly true that every little helps, and little steps such as these can make a big difference when extrapolated.

JetBlue Is The First US Airline To Implement This System

As confirmed earlier today in a statement released by the New York-based hybrid airline, JetBlue has become the first US carrier to integrate the SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach tool into its operations. This innovative and widely-used application, JetBlue explains, ""enables pilots to analyze their individual fuel performance on past flights and receive tailored recommendations to improve future fuel consumption.""

With this system already having been put to use by more than 75 airlines worldwide, JetBlue is blazing the trail on this front in the US as it ramps up its sustainability efforts. Chris Lum, a System Chief Pilot at JetBlue, explains that ""small gains in efficiency can translate into major savings"" when using the SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach tool in everyday operations. Commenting on its rollout, he states that:

""With access to SkyBreathe MyFuelCoach on the flight deck, our pilots have access to real-time performance insights that help them refine their procedures and contribute to our JetForward strategy, strengthening our financial foundation through cost savings while also meaningfully addressing our emissions.""

All About SkyBreathe

SkyBreathe offers more than just the MyFuelCoach application when it comes to its efforts in helping airlines around the world to boost their sustainability credentials. Indeed, JetBlue noted in its statement earlier today that its partnership also uses ""the SkyBreathe 360 dashboard to identify broader operational trends.""

This portal, the carrier explains, dives deeper into the data, and, beyond identifying areas where individual pilots can save fuel on a flight-by-flight basis, it also looks to highlight deeper trends. According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, JetBlue has scheduled 4,950 flights this week, giving it plenty of data to work with.

For instance, the data harnessed in this way can be used to refine taxi procedures. JetBlue also highlights the fact that, on a broader level, it can help the carrier identify airports that are prone to congestion. Using this information, it can then adjust its schedules to prevent ground delays and long taxis, thus saving fuel.

JetBlue Is Already Seeing Benefits From Its Partnership With SkyBreathe

Regular readers of Simple Flying will know that JetBlue has taken various steps in the last few years to boost its sustainability credentials. As long ago as 2020, the carrier revealed its ambitions to become the first carbon-neutral US airline, later saying that COVID-19 wouldn't derail these plans.

Zacks Investment Research","As industries across the board race toward a carbon-neutral era, the global aviation industry, with its aspiration to achieve full decarbonization by 2050, has been driving the demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Being a prominent leader in this industry, The Boeing Company (BA) thus has been playing a crucial role in making SAF a reality.

In particular, commercial aviation, responsible for 2-3% of global CO??? emissions, is facing growing pressure to adopt cleaner fuels. However, although SAF offers up to 80% lifecycle emission reduction without aircraft modifications, its production remains below 1% of global jet fuel demand.

Boeing has spearheaded efforts to bridge this gap for over a decade. In 2008, it conducted the world’s first commercial SAF test flight with Virgin Atlantic and GE Aviation. A decade later, its ecoDemonstrator program performed the first commercial flight using 100% SAF on a 777 Freighter with FedEx.

In 2023, Boeing partnered with NASA and United Airlines to study how SAF affects contrails and non-carbon emissions. The following year, it agreed to purchase 9.4 million gallons of blended SAF — its largest annual commitment to date.

Most recently, in January 2025, Boeing partnered with Norway’s Norsk e-Fuel to develop one of Europe’s first large-scale e-SAF production facilities, accelerating the availability of electro-fuels and supporting deeper decarbonization of aviation.

Looking ahead, Boeing’s commitment includes ensuring that all its new aircraft are 100% SAF-capable by 2030. This, along with its aforementioned initiatives, underscores the jet maker’s critical role in making SAF a cornerstone of aviation’s sustainable future.

Other Stocks to Watch

With SAF being a critical driver of future commercial aviation, apart from Boeing, other aerospace stocks like Airbus (EADSY) and Embraer (ERJ) are also undertaking significant SAF-related initiatives and thus warrant a look.

Notably, all Airbus aircraft are currently capable of flying on a maximum 50% blend of SAF and conventional fuel. By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters are projected to be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF. In March 2025, Airbus took a significant step toward scaling the adoption of SAF by testing a new “Book and Claim” approach to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide.

On the other hand, Embraer’s E2 family of aircraft is certified to fly with blends of up to 50% SAF and is currently in the process of being fully certified to fly on 100%. ERJ has been using SAF in operations since 2021 and aims to reach at least 25% by 2040. In June 2024, Embraer agreed with Ann Arbor to increase its uptake of SAF at Melbourne Orlando International Airport in Florida to one load per week.

,,2025-09-08 14:54:58+00:00,The Conversation,Sustainable fuels could reduce the climate impact of military aircraft - The Conversation,Elna Heimdal Nilsson,,,,,https://theconversation.com/sustainable-fuels-could-reduce-the-climate-impact-of-military-aircraft-264792,"Military aircraft – from fighter jets to transport planes – are playing a significant role in today’s unstable world.
To mitigate aviation-related climate effects, the civil aviation sector has been promoting the development of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
The quality of the sustainable fuels is very high and there is no technical barrier to their use in military aviation.
The question is: to what extent can the climate and environmental impact of military aviation operations be reduced if sustainable aviation fuels are introduced?
SAFs will not make military aviation climate neutral, but they could substantially reduce its environmental footprint at a time when both security and sustainability are pressing concerns.","Military aircraft – from fighter jets to transport planes – are playing a significant role in today’s unstable world. Cumulatively, the operations carried out by these fleets, from combat missions to training flights, consume large amounts of fossil fuel.

Nevertheless, military aviation is rarely included in national climate inventories. In addition to greenhouse gases, aviation also emits other pollutants such as soot and particles, which affect both climate and air quality, and have detrimental effects on human health and ecosystems.

Recently, the UK government announced that it would purchase 12 F-35A fighter aircraft, some of which will be used to reduce a backlog in pilot training. The F-35A is the standard variant of the F-35 fighter jet.

While the decision is primarily motivated by defence and alliance commitments, it also has environmental implications. Expanding training activities will increase the number of flight hours, and consequently, fuel use and emissions. Fighter jets consume large quantities of fuel per flight hour.

The combustion process in aircraft engines releases carbon dioxide (CO₂), but the impact on the climate and environment extends further: emissions of soot particles, nitrogen oxide compounds, water vapour and sulphuric compounds influence atmospheric chemistry and cloud formation.

The persistent contrails and the cirrus clouds they generate are estimated to cause an impact on the climate comparable in magnitude to the warming effect of CO₂ from commercial aviation.

Any assessment of mitigation options must therefore consider both CO₂ and non-CO₂ effects arising from aircraft engine combustion. To mitigate aviation-related climate effects, the civil aviation sector has been promoting the development of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

When produced from waste oils or residues, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (Hefa) fuels – which are forms of sustainable aviation fuel – typically achieve 50–70% lower life-cycle CO₂ emissions compared with fossil-based jet fuel. Synthetic aviation fuels known as advanced power-to-liquid (PtL) e-fuels, produced using renewable electricity, could reduce emissions by more than 80%, though they are not yet available at scale.

Wars and climate change are inextricably linked. Climate change can increase the likelihood of violent conflict by intensifying resource scarcity and displacement, while conflict itself accelerates environmental damage. This article is part of a series, War on climate, which explores the relationship between climate issues and global conflicts.

In addition to a lower carbon footprint compared to fossil fuels, SAFs have also been shown to produce fewer soot particles during combustion, reducing the likelihood and severity of contrails and cirrus clouds.

For technical reasons, down to the specific molecular composition SAF compared to fossil based jet fuel, commercial SAFs are currently not certified as standalone fuels. However, they are available for blends of up to 50% along with fossil-based jet fuels.

The quality of the sustainable fuels is very high and there is no technical barrier to their use in military aviation. The question is: to what extent can the climate and environmental impact of military aviation operations be reduced if sustainable aviation fuels are introduced?

Sustainable fuel and the F-35

Let’s take the example of the F-35, which was the aircraft purchased recently by the UK government. Under certain conditions, the F-35 can burn five tonnes of jet fuel in a single sortie lasting an hour. For comparison, a diesel car like the Volvo V70 would, in its whole lifespan, burn an amount of fuel corresponding to just four hours of combat manoeuvring with the F-35.

Technically, the F-35 is already approved to operate on blends of conventional kerosene and certified synthetic fuels. Similar to civil aviation standards, military standards allow for blending ratios of up to 50%, depending on the production pathway.

No modifications to engines or fuel systems are required. F-35 flights that used commercially available fuel with 40% SAF were carried out by the Norwegian Air Force in early 2025.

There are no significant technical barriers to the new F-35A aircraft entering UK service to operate on commercially available SAF blends with up to 50% renewable fuel. Compatibility is not the limiting factor, but, unfortunately, the availability and cost of fuel are.

For military training flights, which may involve large numbers of sorties, SAF can therefore provide significant reductions in life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. A 50% blend of Hefa, for instance, could cut average CO₂ emissions per flight by around one third.

Since contrails can account for a large fraction of aviation’s total climate impact, this effect is potentially important. The strategic allocation of SAF to flights that are most likely to generate persistent contrails, like training missions at high altitude in humid conditions, could amplify the climate benefit of limited SAF supplies.

The UK’s acquisition of additional F-35A aircraft will help address a backlog in pilot training, but it will also increase emissions. From both a climate and national security perspective, SAFs represent the most practical near-term mitigation option.

The F-35 is technically compatible with sustainable aviation fuels – and substantial life-cycle emission reductions are achievable this way. Additional benefits may come from reduced contrail formation. However, limitations in global SAF production and their higher costs restrict the extent to which these fuels can currently be deployed.

SAFs will not make military aviation climate neutral, but they could substantially reduce its environmental footprint at a time when both security and sustainability are pressing concerns.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/689612/original/file-20250908-56-bluie1.jpeg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C339%2C5428%2C2714&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-08 11:56:13.431534

The airline has also detailed a clear roadmap to reach emission reductions of 99% from its owned GSE by 2035.

The result of these actions means less diesel, less noise and improved local air quality.

The electrification of ground operations vehicles is just one part of Jet2’s Sustainability Strategy, which covers three pillars: ‘In the Air’, ‘On The Ground’ and ‘In Resort’.

A key component of the ‘On The Ground’ pillar includes work to reduce the airside carbon footprint, through the introduction of all-electric crew buses and GSE.

As a result of this electrification programme, several hundred vehicles and pieces of GSE which include belt loaders, baggage tractors, pushback tractors, ground power units, steps, high-loaders, airside vans and cars, customer buses and crew buses have now been converted to an electric fuel supply.

In addition, a company-wide electric car salary-exchange scheme has been launched enabling Jet2 colleagues to switch to electric vehicles.

Jet2 has recently received recognition for its approach to sustainability, including being named the winner of the Package Holiday/Leisure Airline category at the global AirlineRatings.com 2025 Sustainability Awards, as well as Large Business category at the Yorkshire Sustainability Excellence Awards.

These awards recognise Jet2’s sustainability strategy, which is underpinned by two key objectives: to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050, and a milestone of 35% reduction in carbon intensity by 2035.

To monitor Jet2’s journey to NetZero, the airline and tour operator is using key metrics, third-party verification, and transparent reporting to track and share its progress.

As well as focusing on EV, Jet2’s results driven Sustainability Strategy includes actions such as:

A new climate transition plan, focused on existing technologies and tangible actions that can be taken currently. This will see Jet2 reduce its carbon emissions per revenue paying passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK) by 35% in 2035 compared to 2019 (43.55gCO2/RPK in 2035 vs. 67gCO2/RPK in 2019).

Investing billions into decarbonising its fleet, with a firm order for 155 brand-new Airbus A321neo aircraft. These aircraft give a reduction in CO2 emissions of up to 20% and are 50% quieter compared to the aircraft they are replacing.

Installation of split-scimitar winglets onto 60 of its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, reducing fuel burn by up to 1.8% through improved aerodynamic efficiency.

The project, which was initiated in 2022, has been under review as the company reassessed its feasibility. After conducting a detailed commercial and technical evaluation, Shell concluded that moving forward with the plant would not be competitive enough in the current market environment.

Machteld de Haan, President of Shell’s Downstream, Renewables, and Energy Solutions division, explained the rationale behind this strategic decision. According to her, the assessment revealed that completing the facility would not align with the company’s priority of providing affordable, low-carbon energy solutions to customers. She emphasized that, although difficult, this decision ensures Shell directs capital toward projects capable of balancing customer needs with shareholder value.

De Haan also reaffirmed Shell’s belief in the long-term role of low-carbon molecules, particularly biofuels, in shaping the future energy landscape. She noted that Shell continues to play a leading role in this sector as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Despite halting this specific construction project, Shell remains committed to investing in lower-carbon energy opportunities. Between 2023 and 2024, the company allocated approximately U.S. $8 billion to a range of cleaner energy solutions. These include renewable power generation, carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen development, and the advancement of low-carbon fuels. By 2024, Shell had already traded over 10 billion litres of low-carbon fuels and sold ten times more than it produced, highlighting its strong presence in the sector. Additionally, in the same year, Shell positioned itself as one of the global leaders in the supply of SAF.

The Netherlands continues to hold strategic importance for Shell’s business operations. The company maintains a wide footprint across the nation’s energy system, ranging from upstream oil and gas production to its extensive retail fuel network. Over recent years, Shell has invested around €6.5 billion in energy transition projects within the Netherlands. Notable initiatives include the Porthos CCS project for large-scale carbon dioxide storage, the Holland Hydrogen 1 project aimed at renewable hydrogen development, and modernization measures such as new furnaces and electrification at Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk.

In summary, while Shell has opted to discontinue the Rotterdam biofuels facility due to cost competitiveness issues, the company continues to demonstrate its dedication to supporting the global energy transition. Its strategic investments in low-carbon technologies reflect a broader vision of becoming both a leading partner and the investment case of choice in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-08 11:56:26.920543

In a significant step forward for sustainable aviation, Delta Air Lines has achieved a remarkable milestone at Portland International Airport. Working together with Shell and local authorities, they have successfully introduced more than 400,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel into the airports fuel system. This achievement represents more than just a number it showcases how traditional infrastructure can be adapted for a greener future.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel, known as SAF, represents one of the most promising solutions for reducing the environmental impact of air travel. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable

sources and can reduce carbon emissions by more than 80 percent over its lifecycle. The vurdhaan process of creating SAF involves converting waste materials into clean burning fuel that works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines.

Innovation Through Collaboration

The Portland project demonstrates the power of partnership in driving sustainable innovation. Shell supplied the initial SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal, where it underwent careful blending with conventional fuel to meet safety standards. This mixture then traveled by barge, truck, and pipeline to reach the airport, proving that existing transportation networks can support renewable fuel distribution.

Economic and Environmental Benefits

Beyond environmental advantages, this initiative brings economic opportunities to the Pacific Northwest. Delta employs approximately 4,500 people in the region, and this project helps secure their future while creating new jobs in the renewable energy sector. The successful implementation at Portland International Airport serves as a model for other airports nationwide.

Breaking Down Barriers

While SAF technology exists and works effectively, widespread adoption faces several challenges. Current global production levels would supply the airline industry for less than a week. However, supportive policies like the federal Blenders Tax Credit and Clean Fuel Production Credit are helping to address cost barriers and encourage increased production.

Looking Ahead

The Portland achievement builds upon previous successful SAF implementations at other major hubs including Minneapolis St. Paul and Detroit. This expanding network of SAF capable airports demonstrates the feasibility of transitioning to cleaner aviation fuel on a national scale.

Conclusion

The successful integration of sustainable aviation fuel at Portland International Airport marks an important advancement in the journey toward cleaner air travel. Through continued collaboration between airlines, fuel suppliers, airports, and government agencies, the aviation industry is proving that environmental responsibility and operational excellence can work hand in hand. This project not only reduces emissions but also creates a blueprint for sustainable aviation infrastructure that other airports can follow.

Beyond cost savings, SkyBreathe enhances JetBlue’s competitive positioning.
Conclusion: A Model for Future-Proof Aviation JetBlue’s adoption of SkyBreathe® exemplifies strategic operational transformation in action.","In an industry where fuel costs constitute 20–30% of operating expenses—global airlines spent $291 billion on jet fuel in 2024 alone—operational efficiency is no longer optional but existential [1]. JetBlue Airways’ recent implementation of the SkyBreathe® Analytics Platform marks a pivotal step in its strategic transformation, aligning cost optimization with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) imperatives. By leveraging AI-driven fuel efficiency solutions, JetBlue is not only addressing immediate financial pressures but also positioning itself as a leader in sustainable aviation.

Strategic Operational Transformation: From Cost Center to Competitive Edge

SkyBreathe® represents a paradigm shift in how airlines manage fuel consumption. The platform integrates Big Data algorithms, AI, and Machine Learning to analyze billions of data points from Flight Data Recorders (FDR), Operational Flight Plans (OFP), and ACARS systems [2]. This enables JetBlue to identify granular inefficiencies in taxiing, climb, cruise, and descent phases, delivering actionable insights to pilots via the MyFuelCoach mobile app [3].

The results are already measurable: JetBlue has identified potential monthly fuel savings of 73,000 gallons, equivalent to 700 tons of CO₂ emissions annually [1]. When combined with complementary initiatives like single-engine taxiing (saving an additional 15,000 gallons monthly), the cumulative impact is transformative [4]. These savings are not theoretical—OpenAirlines CEO Alexandre Feray notes that measurable results emerged within months of implementation [3].

For investors, this underscores SkyBreathe’s role as a scalable solution. A 3–5% fuel saving on a fleet of 50 Boeing 737-800s translates to $9.6 million in annual savings [1]. With JetBlue’s fleet of over 100 aircraft, the platform’s potential to reduce operating costs while enhancing route profitability is significant.

ESG Alignment: Fuel Efficiency as a Climate Action Lever

The aviation sector faces mounting pressure to decarbonize, with regulatory frameworks like CORSIA and EU-ETS tightening compliance requirements. SkyBreathe® directly addresses these challenges by enabling real-time CO₂ tracking and optimization. JetBlue’s adoption of the platform aligns with its JetForward strategy, which includes commitments to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and electrified ground operations [4].

The platform’s 360° dashboard provides a unified view of environmental performance, allowing JetBlue to monitor progress toward its net-zero 2050 goals. For instance, the system’s predictive analytics help identify routes where minor adjustments—such as optimized descent profiles—can reduce emissions by thousands of pounds per flight [2]. This data-driven approach not only supports regulatory compliance but also strengthens stakeholder trust, a critical factor for ESG-focused investors.

Moreover, SkyBreathe’s AI assistant, SkyBreathe® Advisor, empowers pilots to make eco-conscious decisions during flights. By fostering a culture of sustainability, JetBlue is transforming its operational DNA—a shift that resonates with passengers and investors prioritizing climate action.

Financial and Market Implications

The financial benefits of SkyBreathe® are clear. At $2.50 per gallon (a conservative estimate), the 73,000 monthly savings translate to $182,500 in direct cost reductions. Annually, this amounts to $2.19 million, with additional savings from CO₂ emission reductions and regulatory compliance. When scaled across JetBlue’s fleet, the platform could yield tens of millions in savings, directly boosting EBITDA margins.

Beyond cost savings, SkyBreathe enhances JetBlue’s competitive positioning. As fuel prices remain volatile, airlines with advanced efficiency tools will outperform peers. For example, Vietjet’s use of SkyBreathe® has already cut CO₂ emissions by 96,000 tons annually [2], demonstrating the platform’s scalability. JetBlue’s early adoption positions it to capitalize on future fuel price fluctuations and regulatory changes.

Challenges and Mitigation

Implementation hurdles, such as data integration and format conversion, are common in AI-driven systems. However, JetBlue’s collaboration with OpenAirlines—evidenced by SunExpress and Viva Aerobus’ successful deployments—suggests a robust framework for overcoming these challenges [1]. The airline’s emphasis on cross-departmental collaboration (maintenance, operations, and flight planning) further ensures seamless adoption.

Conclusion: A Model for Future-Proof Aviation

JetBlue’s adoption of SkyBreathe® exemplifies strategic operational transformation in action. By merging cutting-edge technology with ESG-driven goals, the airline is redefining efficiency in aviation. For investors, this initiative signals a forward-thinking approach that balances profitability with planetary responsibility—a rare and valuable alignment in today’s market.

As the aviation industry navigates a post-pandemic landscape marked by cost pressures and climate mandates, JetBlue’s partnership with SkyBreathe® offers a blueprint for sustainable growth. The platform’s ability to deliver immediate financial returns while advancing long-term environmental objectives makes it a compelling case study for airlines seeking to thrive in the 21st century.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:57:11.090716

MIAMI, Sept. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF), a public company engaged in functional nutrition and sustainable biofuel innovation, today provided a comprehensive corporate update.

UMeWorld operates a dual-growth platform powered by a single proprietary enzymatic technology. This breakthrough process enables the Company to deliver both DAGola™ functional cooking oils, clinically validated to improve metabolic health, and enzymatic biofuels, designed to convert low-cost feedstocks into sustainable biodiesel. This “one technology, two markets” strategy uniquely positions UMeWorld at the intersection of wellness and sustainability, offering investors exposure to both consumer health and renewable energy.

Alongside operational progress, UMeWorld also announced its intention to redomicile from the British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) to the State of Delaware, USA as part of its long-term growth strategy and preparation for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange.

DAGola Functional Cooking Oils

UMeWorld’s flagship brand, DAGola™, continues to gain traction in the fast-growing functional foods sector. The brand has received strong reviews on Amazon, validating both product quality and consumer demand. To accelerate growth, the Company is preparing a micro-influencer marketing campaign aimed at expanding awareness and engagement across social media platforms.

A major milestone is expected in Q4 2025, when DAGola sales in China are scheduled to begin through a local established sales platform with a proven distribution network. This launch will be supported by targeted digital marketing and e-commerce initiatives. Looking further ahead, management plans to expand DAGola into Southeast Asia and the EU in 2026, building on rising demand for healthier edible oils and leveraging clinical validation.

Timeline Roadmap:

Now (2025): Scaling U.S. sales through Amazon and direct-to-consumer channels.

Q4 2025: China launch with local distribution and integrated digital campaigns.

2026: Expansion into Japan, Korea and EU markets.

The global edible oil market is valued at more than $250 billion annually, while the functional foods sector exceeds $150 billion. With clinically validated benefits - including up to 80% less triglycerides and proven improvements in metabolic health - DAGola is well-positioned to capture share within these large, growing markets.

Biofuel Pilot Plant in Malaysia

Building on the same enzymatic technology that powers DAGola, UMeWorld is expanding into the renewable energy sector. Preparations are underway to establish the Company’s first biofuel pilot plant in Malaysia, with a planned production capacity of 1,000 to 5,000 tonnes per year.

The pilot plant will focus on converting palm oil mill effluent (POME), used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, and other low-cost feedstocks into sustainable biodiesel. A key objective of the facility is to obtain EU and U.S. certification for UMeWorld’s enzymatic biofuel, which will pave the way for access to premium markets and carbon credit opportunities. Achieving certification will also serve as the foundation for developing a full-scale commercial plant that meets international standards.

Timeline Roadmap:

2025–2026 (12–18 months): Pilot plant development and certification process.

2027–2028 (2–3 years): Planning and execution of a commercial-scale facility meeting EU/US standards.

Beyond 2028: Expansion opportunities into U.S., EU, and Asia-Pacific markets.

The global biodiesel market is projected to exceed $90 billion by 2030, driven by strong EU and U.S. mandates for renewable energy adoption. By focusing on low-cost, waste-based feedstocks, UMeWorld aims to deliver both cost efficiency and sustainability advantages over conventional chemical and HVO-based biodiesel production methods.

Future Potential: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Beyond biodiesel, UMeWorld’s enzymatic process is also adaptable to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), one of the fastest-growing renewable energy markets. By pre-treating difficult feedstocks such as POME, UCO, and animal fats under mild, selective conditions, the Company’s technology can produce cleaner intermediates that integrate seamlessly with established hydroprocessing steps used in SAF production. Global aviation regulators and airlines are committing to ambitious carbon reduction goals, with SAF expected to represent a growing share of jet fuel consumption by 2030. UMeWorld’s long-term strategy includes exploring SAF pathways, positioning the Company to potentially supply low-carbon aviation fuel to premium international markets and form strategic partnerships with refiners and airlines.

Redomiciliation to Delaware

In parallel with these operational initiatives, UMeWorld is taking a major step to strengthen its corporate governance and capital markets profile. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved a plan to redomicile through a statutory merger and share exchange. Upon completion, all outstanding shares of UMeWorld Limited (BVI) will be exchanged for shares of a newly incorporated Delaware entity, UMeWorld Inc.

Redomiciling to Delaware will provide the Company with a stronger corporate governance framework, greater transparency, and closer alignment with U.S. investor expectations. Most importantly, it establishes the structural foundation necessary for a potential uplisting to a senior U.S. stock exchange such as the NYSE or Nasdaq.

“Redomiciling to Delaware is not just a legal formality,” said Michael Lee, CEO of UMeWorld Limited. “It’s a strategic milestone that enhances our credibility, strengthens our corporate foundation, and positions UMeWorld to engage more fully with U.S. capital markets. Alongside DAGola’s growth and our biofuel expansion, this move sets the stage for long-term value creation.”

The redomiciliation is subject to customary shareholder approval and regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). UMeWorld will provide further details, including anticipated timelines and shareholder instructions, in upcoming communications.

Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen;

Introduction

1. Good morning. It is my pleasure to join you at the 2025 Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference, or APPEC for short. APPEC is hosted annually in Singapore by S&P Global and supported by Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG), and this 41st edition is the most well-attended to date, with over 1,200 delegates from 46 countries.

2. This year’s theme, “Navigating Trade, Technology and Transition”, is a timely one. The global energy sector is facing both turbulence and transformation, shaped by geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the transition to a low-carbon economy.

3. Singapore remains committed to being a thriving global hub for energy trade in a low-carbon future. However, we also recognise that traditional energy sources will continue to be important for some time. We will smoothly manage this transition by supporting companies in navigating the 3Ts of Trade, Technology, and Transition.

Trade — Navigating Complexity in an Uncertain Landscape

4. The first T is on navigating an increasingly challenging trading landscape.

a. Geopolitical tensions have ushered in a new era of volatility. The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted global energy supply chains, resulting in a surge in energy prices. US tariffs have dampened global growth prospects, and uncertainty remains over how India may or will recalibrate its demand for Russian oil in response to the tariffs.

b. Supply dynamics are shifting, too. OPEC+ has unwound its production cuts, while non-OPEC producers, such as the US and Brazil, have expanded output. In addition, oversupply from China is weighing on margins. Combined with softer demand from tariff-induced economic uncertainty and structural changes in key markets like China, Brent crude recently hit a four-year low in May 2025 at US$60 per barrel. However, it has since recovered slightly to US$67 per barrel.

c. There is structural overcapacity in refining and petrochemicals, especially in East Asia. A glut of refined products, such as diesel and naphtha, has placed downward pressure on margins. The International Energy Agency recently projected a record oil supply glut next year, with an expected surplus inventory of around 3 million barrels per day.

5. Singapore remains a global energy trading hub of choice for companies, amid this uncertain environment.

a. Between 2023 and 2024, energy trade conducted through Singapore grew from US$1.44 trillion to US$1.67 trillion, along with a 5% increase in the number of trading professionals based here. We continue to welcome you to deploy, to anchor more professionals to be based here so that you can use Singapore as a control tower base to manage, orchestrate as well as plan your operations in Asia Pacific.

b. Singapore also welcomed six new firms from the energy and chemicals sector on board EnterpriseSG’s Global Traders Programme in 2024. One example is Yulong Petrochemical, which operates a 400,000 barrels-per-day refinery in Shandong.

c. We continue to build on our key strengths as a trusted, stable and connected hub to anchor trading activities in Singapore.

Technology — Harnessing Innovation to Stay Ahead

6. The second T is on harnessing technology, which is reshaping how firms trade, produce, and compete.

a. Traders are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into forecasting and risk management, with assistance from government programmes.

b. EnterpriseSG offers support to firms in expanding or setting up new operations, including those that leverage on AI. Mining major BHP Group Limited set up a regional AI hub in May 2025. By integrating AI into its core operations, it has unlocked new insights to support sustainable and profitable growth across its global commodity supply chains. AI will help is achieve three As –

1. Assist – it will help us to assist some of your staff who may not have any teams to manage. AI will help them to develop the arms and legs to assist them.

2. Augment – it will help to augment the products and services, how we are delivering it to the customers.

3. Automate – from the example of BHP Group, you can see how we can use AI to grow the topline and bottom line and also help to mitigate the existing risks that we talked about.

c. AI Singapore’s (AISG) 100 Experiments provides co-funding of up to S$180,000 per project and access to manpower and AI experts. Four Elements Capital is a commodity asset manager which developed a machine learning (ML) framework with AISG’s support, helping it to predict base metal price fluctuations. This enables it to more effectively identify trading and arbitrage opportunities.

Transition – Thriving in a Low-Carbon Future

7. The third T is positioning Singapore well to seize growth opportunities as it transitions to a low-carbon economy.

8. With Asia growing in importance as a key import and export market for green commodities, Singapore is well-positioned to play a significant role in the four key growth areas of sustainable products, biofuels, alternative maritime fuels, and carbon trading.

9. First, we are expanding our production of sustainable products on Jurong Island to meet the growing regional demand. We will continue to grow the base in Jurong Island. We recently welcomed speciality chemicals firm Arkema, which manufactures polyamide-11, a high-performance polymer derived from renewable castor oil, which leaves a much lower carbon footprint versus fossil-based polymers. In July 2025, Arkema opened in Singapore, the world’s largest integrated factory dedicated to bio-circular materials.

10. Second, we are actively growing our biofuels production and trading ecosystem to capitalise on fast-growing regional demand. According to the International Energy Agency, Asia is set to overtake Europe in production and demand of biofuels by next year.

a. On the production side, Singapore is home to the world’s largest sustainable aviation fuel production facility, operated by Neste. The energy and chemicals sector here plays a vital role in producing and supplying fuels for the world, and we are keen to support this sector to seize new opportunities in the manufacturing of biofuels.

b. On the trading side, Singapore has an extensive network of over 250 traders in energy and agri-commodities, including major trading firms such as Wilmar and Olam, which control the feedstock for biofuels. This confluence of buy and sell sides makes us compelling as a biofuels trading hub, with Singapore’s biofuels trading revenue reaching S$1.5 billion in 2023.

11. Third, we are developing more support for alternative maritime fuels, especially ammonia. Singapore’s position as the world’s largest bunkering hub is a unique advantage as we prepare for a multi-fuel future. While LNG, methanol and biofuels will remain relevant in the near term, ammonia is expected to gain momentum and account for a substantial share of bunker fuels by 2050. The strong industry response of 26 bids for EMA & Maritime Port Authority’s (MPA) ammonia bunkering Request for Proposal or RFP, underlines market confidence in Singapore’s potential to be a leader in maritime fuels and ammonia.

12. Fourth, we are developing Singapore as a hub for carbon services and trading. Today, we are home to more than 150 firms across the carbon services and trading value chain – double the number from 2021. EnterpriseSG supports global trading firms and energy players in setting up new carbon credit trading functions. Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and Chevron all have local carbon trading teams to capture opportunities in this space, as do independent traders Trafigura, Mercuria, Vitol and Glencore.

Conclusion

13. The energy and chemicals trade sector is facing one of its most complex periods in its history.

14. Singapore is committed to working with you to navigate this challenging time and to bridge today’s energy demands with tomorrow’s possibilities. Together, we will build a more resilient and sustainable future.

15. I wish all of you a fruitful time at APPEC, with meaningful conversations and the forging of fresh and successful partnerships. Thank you.",https://www.mti.gov.sg/html/images/mti-favicon.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:58:30.311852

For Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (6505.TW), these challenges are both existential and operational. While the company’s recent financial performance underscores vulnerabilities—declining revenue since 2021, a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.65 in 2024, and a Moody’s downgrade to Baa2—their strategic initiatives reveal a deliberate pivot toward resilience. This analysis examines how Formosa Petrochemical balances sector-specific risks with innovative strategies to secure its long-term viability.

Sector-Specific Risks: A Fragile Landscape

The petrochemical sector is underpinned by cyclical demand, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory shifts. Formosa Petrochemical’s 2024 revenue of $50 billion, with $8 billion from plastics, reflects a broader industry trend of stagnation. Global demand for petrochemicals is weakening, exacerbated by oversupply from China, which added 10% to its production capacity in 2024 alone [1]. This oversupply has compressed margins, forcing companies to compete on price rather than innovation.

Debt management further complicates the outlook. Formosa Petrochemical’s leverage, coupled with peers like Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corporation (1326.TW) reporting a net debt-to-EBITDA of 7.28, signals a sector-wide reliance on capital-intensive operations [4]. Meanwhile, energy transition mandates, such as the EU’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) requirements, are reshaping demand structures. Companies unable to adapt risk obsolescence as markets prioritize decarbonization.

Strategic Resilience: Innovation and Diversification

Formosa Petrochemical’s response to these risks is multifaceted. First, the company is leveraging digital transformation to enhance efficiency. AI-driven process optimization and the “Formosa Oil APP” for customer engagement aim to reduce costs and diversify revenue streams [1]. Second, sustainability is no longer a peripheral goal but a core strategy. By 2025, the company plans to produce 5,500 metric tons of SAF annually, with a target of 50,000 tonnes by 2030. This aligns with partnerships with China Airlines and EVA Air, securing long-term contracts for SAF supply [3].

Geographic expansion is another pillar of resilience. Formosa Petrochemical is capitalizing on U.S. shale gas advantages by expanding production in Texas, where new facilities for caustic soda and chlorine are underway [1]. In China, the Ningbo Plant’s capacity upgrades position the company to meet regional demand while mitigating risks from domestic overcapacity. Additionally, solar projects at facilities in New Jersey and Louisiana—producing over 94% renewable energy—underscore a commitment to aligning with global decarbonization trends [1].

Financial Health and Market Positioning

Despite these initiatives, Formosa Petrochemical’s Q2 2025 results highlight ongoing challenges. The company reported a net income loss of TWD 293.44 million, a stark contrast to National Petroleum’s stable Q2 2025 EPS of NT$0.56 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.06% [5]. This disparity underscores the urgency of debt restructuring and cost optimization. However, Formosa Petrochemical’s debt metrics, while concerning, remain within manageable thresholds compared to peers. For instance, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre’s debt-to-assets ratio of 0.31 suggests the sector is not uniformly insolvent [4].

The company’s strategic investments in SAF and digital tools also offer a path to differentiation. By 2030, SAF is projected to account for 10% of global aviation fuel demand, a market Formosa Petrochemical is positioning itself to dominate [3]. This forward-looking approach could offset near-term profitability declines.

Conclusion: Balancing Risks and Opportunities

Formosa Petrochemical’s long-term viability hinges on its ability to navigate sector-specific risks while executing its strategic vision. The company’s investments in SAF, digital transformation, and geographic diversification are critical to countering oversupply and regulatory pressures. However, its financial health remains fragile, necessitating disciplined debt management and operational efficiency.

For investors, the key question is whether Formosa Petrochemical can scale its sustainability initiatives and market expansion quickly enough to offset declining profitability. While the path is fraught with challenges, the company’s proactive stance on energy transition and innovation suggests a resilient trajectory—if executed effectively.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 11:58:33.978810

Milan, 8 September 2025 – MAIRE (MAIRE.MI) announces that NEXTCHEM, through its subsidiary MyRechemical, key player in the Waste-to-Chemical segment, has been awarded an engineering study contract by Altalto Ltd. based on its proprietary NX CircularTM gasification and NX CPOTM technologies for a SAF plant in Immingham, Lincolnshire, United Kingdom.

Altalto (Immingham) Ltd. is a company set up by Velocys to develop SAF projects in the UK. The plant is expected to be operational in 2030. Initial targets include the production of 30 million litres (23 thousand tonnes) of SAF per year for the UK market in support of the SAF Mandate[1]. Feedstocks will be sourced from residual municipal solid waste (MSW) and commercial and industrial (C&I) waste.

The project has been awarded a grant from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund to progress Basic Engineering Design. The SAF from the plant will be enough to power over 500 flights from London to New York per year.

Cutting-edge NX CircularTM gasification technology allows the plant to convert waste by generating synthesis gas (syngas), which is subsequently transformed to SynCrude through Velocys’ Fischer-Tropsch technology and upgraded to high-quality sustainable fuels. The application of this solution, combined with NX CPO™ technology, offers a unique and efficient design. NX CPOTM ensures an advanced innovative process to produce synthesis gas via controlled partial oxidation through a very fast reaction. When applied to synthetic fuel production, this versatile technology is contributing to maximizing overall yield while minimizing carbon intensity of the product.

MyRechemical will operate as a technology provider and as coordinator for other technological partners. It will also supply engineering services supported by NEXTCHEM’s NX Engineering District in Catania and involve other sister companies of the MAIRE Group. Altalto expects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 100,000 tonnes of CO₂-equivalent per year (including CCS), valorize residual waste and create about 100 permanent jobs. The project will also generate an additional 1,000 direct and 300 indirect jobs during construction. Altalto is aiming to significantly improving the UK balance of payments by reducing fuel imports while generating substantial investment and export opportunities for the Country.

Fabio Fritelli, Managing Director of NEXTCHEM, commented: “This award confirms the validity and flexibility of our technological proposal, which meets the needs of players in the mobility sector, particularly in aviation where decarbonisation is of paramount importance.”",https://www.groupmaire.com/static/project/share/maire-social-share.jpg,N,,2025-09-08 03:56:12.938354

With policies favoring fossil fuels and a rollback of international climate commitments, the vacuum in global climate governance is being filled by Asian markets, particularly Hong Kong. For investors, this represents a pivotal moment to reassess risk and opportunity in a world where geopolitical dynamics are reshaping the energy transition.

The U.S. Retreat and Its Implications

The Trump 2.0 administration’s emphasis on nationalist energy policies and fossil fuel expansion has created a stark contrast with the global push for decarbonization. According to a report by China Daily, the U.S. is now promoting policies that prioritize domestic energy production over multilateral climate cooperation, effectively retreating from the leadership role it once held [1]. This shift has destabilized global climate markets, creating uncertainty for investors and weakening the momentum of international agreements like the Paris Accord.

The U.S. withdrawal has also disrupted capital flows. Green finance, which relies on consistent policy frameworks and long-term commitments, is now facing a fragmented landscape. As stated by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology’s Institute for the Environment, the absence of U.S. leadership has forced other regions to accelerate their own strategies, with Hong Kong emerging as a critical player [1].

Hong Kong’s Strategic Climate Ambitions

Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050, which aims for carbon neutrality before 2050, is underpinned by a HK$240 billion investment over two decades [3]. This commitment has already yielded tangible results: greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 24% between 2014 and 2022, driven by cleaner electricity generation and regional power imports [2]. To build on this progress, Professor Benjamin Horton of City University of Hong Kong has proposed eight strategic priorities, including scaling renewable energy, transforming urban mobility, and investing in carbon capture technologies [2].

The city’s transition finance policies are equally robust. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has mandated that financial institutions achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2030 and financed emissions by 2050. By August 2024, the HKMA’s sustainable bond program had mobilized around US$120 billion in underlying debt issuance [7], positioning Hong Kong as a bridge between China’s green finance ecosystem and global markets.

Transition Finance: A New Frontier for Investors

Hong Kong’s 2024-2025 budget has further expanded its green finance toolkit. The Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme, extended until 2027, now includes transition bonds and loans to support industries in decarbonization [6]. Additionally, the city is developing sustainability disclosure standards aligned with the International Financial Reporting Standards (ISSB), ensuring transparency and investor confidence [3].

Innovation is another cornerstone of Hong Kong’s strategy. A $400 million Green Tech Fund supports R&D in decarbonization technologies, while the Green and Sustainable Fintech Proof-of-Concept Subsidy Scheme incentivizes early-stage innovation [6]. These initiatives are complemented by sector-specific incentives, such as feasibility studies for green-methanol bunkering and streamlined approvals for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) [6].

China’s Role in the Global Green Transition

China’s broader efforts to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 provide a tailwind for Hong Kong’s ambitions. By 2024, China’s wind and solar capacity had surpassed 1,400 GW—six years ahead of its 2030 target—while accounting for 75% of global wind farm installations in 2023 [5]. However, the country’s reliance on coal remains a challenge, with coal power construction hitting a decade-high in 2024 [4]. To address this, China has introduced the Green and Low-Carbon Transition Industry Guidance Catalogue, which includes carbon capture and low-carbon coal projects [8]. Hong Kong’s Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, aligned with international frameworks, enhances its role as a conduit for international capital into these projects [7].

Strategic Opportunities for Investors

For investors, Hong Kong’s transition finance policies and China’s renewable energy growth present a unique opportunity. The city’s alignment with global standards, such as the ISSB, reduces regulatory friction for cross-border investments. Meanwhile, its role as a green fintech hub—supported by subsidies and R&D funding—offers exposure to high-growth sectors like AI-driven energy efficiency and circular economy technologies [3].

Conclusion

As the U.S. retreats from climate leadership, Hong Kong and China are redefining the global green finance agenda. For investors, the key lies in capitalizing on the region’s policy momentum, technological innovation, and strategic alignment with international markets. The transition is no longer a Western-led narrative—it is now a global race, and Asia is surging ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 03:56:21.431888

***********************************************************************************

Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at 2025 Hong Kong Green Finance Association (HKGFA) Annual Forum ""Navigating Climate Finance and Geopolitics: Strategies for Transition"" today (September 8):

Dr. Ma (Chairman and President of HKGFA, Dr Ma Jun), Professor Li (Professor of Political Science and Founding Director of the Centre on Contemporary China and the World of the University of Hong Kong, Dr Li Cheng), Dr. Berglöf (Chief Economist, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Dr Erik Berglöf), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a great pleasure to join you today at the eighth edition of the Hong Kong Green Finance Association Annual Forum.

This year's Forum marks the opening of Hong Kong Green Week. This week, leading voices from global financial institutions, corporations and policy circles will engage in essential discussions on sustainable finance, climate technologies, impact investing and regional green co-operation. They'll share knowledge, experiences and explore how green transformation can create fresh opportunities, particularly in the face of a volatile geopolitical landscape.

A world of contrast

Let me begin by acknowledging some uncomfortable realities. The urgency of the climate crisis is clearer than ever, and we are all witnessing it and feeling it first-hand, in the unprecedented heatwaves from Europe to Japan and the numerous black rainstorms that have battered our city this summer.

This devastating reality is compounded by rising unilateralism. The US' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, and an overt policy shift back to fossil fuels, are disappointing. It weakens the collective commitment to climate action and, no less important, complicates the US$1.3 trillion annual climate-finance target for developing countries, reached at COP 29 (the 29th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change).

Still, we must not lose hope. Many countries remain firmly committed to net-zero transition, in particular our country, China, which stands by its 3060 goals. According to estimates, our country's CO2 emissions in the first quarter this year fell by 1.6 per cent year on year. This is the first time that clean-energy expansion is leading the fall in CO2 level, and that's despite rapid growth in power demand. China is expected to invest some US$820 billion in energy transition this year, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the global total.

Moreover, its national emissions trading scheme continues to expand, now covering 70 per cent of the country's emissions, including key polluting sectors such as cement, steel and aluminium.

Across Asia and the Global South, the progress is also encouraging. In the Asia-Pacific region, investment in energy transition, last year, surpassed US$1 trillion for the first time. That's more than double the amount invested in the Americas. ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) member states reaffirmed their commitment to climate resilience at their recent summit, underscoring the priority the region has accorded to climate action. For Belt and Road economies as a whole, renewable energy now constitutes 30 per cent of their total energy investments, up from less than 5 per cent just a decade ago.

Technological advancements are also offering new hope. Beyond solar power and electric vehicles, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a transformative force. The International Energy Agency predicts that, by 2035, the widespread use of AI could reduce global energy consumption by an amount greater than the total energy usage of Mexico.

How Hong Kong can contribute

Here in Hong Kong, we remain steadfast in our commitment to climate action. We are on track to cut our carbon emissions in half by 2035, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This goal is anchored in four key strategies: decarbonising power generation, improving energy efficiency in buildings, promoting green transport and reducing waste.

In power generation, we are making pleasing progress. By 2026, with the completion of enhancements to the cross-boundary Clean Energy Transmission System, the share of zero-carbon electricity in our fuel mix is expected to rise from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. We are also planning for the construction of new facilities in Tseung Kwan O to further expand our capacity to import zero-carbon energy. Upon completion of the project, the share of zero-carbon energy in our fuel mix could increase to about 60 to 70 per cent.

Beyond fulfilling our domestic commitments, Hong Kong has much more to offer the world. As an international financial centre and an innovation hub, we are well positioned to contribute to global green transition.

On green and sustainable finance

Hong Kong has long been Asia's frontrunner in green and sustainable finance. In 2024, we issued more than US$80 billion in sustainable debts, with green bonds accounting for around 45 per cent of the regional total. Estimated issuances of sustainable debts in the first half of 2025 reached over US$34 billion, an increase of 15 per cent year on year. Over 200 ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have been authorised by the Securities and Futures Commission, with an AUM (assets under management) exceeding US$140 billion, up more than 50 per cent in just three years. These figures speak volumes about our growing role as a green financing and investment hub.

And we have been doing more than that. For example, in the area of transition finance. While it still represents a small fraction of the sustainable finance markets, it is gaining a traction and offers considerable prospects. For instance, transition bonds account for only around 3 per cent of the sustainable bonds market in the ASEAN+3 Market. Hong Kong obviously has the potential to become a transition finance hub, helping hard-to-abate sectors to decarbonise.

Separately, last year, we issued the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which aligns with the frameworks of both the Chinese Mainland and the European Union. Today, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) begins a public consultation to expand this taxonomy to cover transition finance. Other elements include expanding sector coverage and introducing climate change adaptation. These are pivotal to scaling up capital flows to accelerate green transformation.

Taking a broader perspective, setting and upholding international standards are important if we are to attract and channel more investments to green and transition projects. Hong Kong is proud to contribute to the setting of the ISSB (International Sustainability Standards Board) reporting standards and the related disclosure framework. As confirmed by the IFRS Foundation (the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation) in June this year, Hong Kong is one of the few jurisdictions in Asia with a clear roadmap for full adoption.

We are also working to mobilise more capital across the public and private sectors. The HKMA has entered into strategic partnerships with multilateral organisations to co-invest in climate and development projects. And our vibrant venture capital and private-equity sector, plus the concentration of wealthy family offices and high-net-worth individuals, are great resources. A study shows that 87 per cent of high-net-worth investors are eager to support climate-focused investments. There is even stronger interest in transition investing than in sustainable investing.

In this regard, there is great potential in developing innovative, climate-focused financial products that cater to market appetite.

Expanding green innovation

Beyond finance, technological innovation is the engine that will drive green transformation. On this, Hong Kong is emerging as a green technology hub. Today, more than 250 green tech companies are based in Science Park and Cyberport. These firms are developing globally competitive solutions – from smart grid to carbon capture technologies. They are expanding rapidly into the Mainland and international markets.

And, through the coordinated efforts of the Innovation, Technology and Industry Bureau, OASES (Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises), Invest Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Investment Corporation, we are attracting prime green enterprises from around the world. These companies span a wide array of technologies – from AI-driven green solutions to sustainable aviation fuel, electric mobility infrastructure and next-generation power systems.

We are helping them to connect with Hong Kong universities and supply chains, identify more application scenarios and tap into markets across the Greater Bay Area, Asia and beyond.

Just as I said earlier, AI can power green transition. It can help traditional industries and sectors optimise production processes and energy consumption, thereby substantially reducing their carbon footprint. Hong Kong has prioritised AI as a core industry. I'm confident that many AI solutions for decarbonisation can scale here and make a lasting impact.

Closing

Ladies and gentlemen, there is only one earth, one planet that we all share. While the world may be facing substantial geopolitical challenges, Hong Kong is fully committed to becoming a reliable and resourceful partner in the global green transformation.

Through forums like this, we reaffirm our commitment to collaboration and partnership. In the space of sustainable finance, technology, talent and many other areas, we can work together to turn climate challenges into rewarding opportunities.

On this note, I wish the Forum and Hong Kong Green Week every success, and all of you the best of health and business.

Thank you.

For investors, this creates a unique window to capitalize on margin expansion opportunities through strategic positioning in refining and energy logistics.

Market Dynamics: A Perfect Storm of Supply and Demand

According to a report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. inventories for motor gasoline, distillate fuel oil, and jet fuel are projected to fall to their lowest levels since 2000 due to declining refinery production and rising consumption [1]. This inventory contraction, coupled with record-high global crude runs of 85.6 million barrels per day in August 2025, underscores tightening supply conditions [2]. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that refining margins hit 15-month highs in July 2025, reflecting robust demand for cleaner fuels and advanced refining technologies [4].

The U.S. jet fuel market, in particular, faces acute supply constraints. With consumption forecast to reach an all-time high and inventories projected to fall to 21 days of supply—the lowest since 1963—wholesale and retail prices are likely to surge unless crude oil prices decline significantly [1]. Conversely, the distillate fuel market is being reshaped by biofuels. Renewable diesel and biodiesel are expected to account for 9% of total consumption in 2026, up from 5% in 2021, as stricter emissions regulations drive demand for ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) [1].

Strategic Initiatives: Biofuels, Diversification, and Compliance

The Trump administration’s 2026 biofuel mandates, proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are a game-changer. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has been set at a record 24.02 billion gallons, with a biomass-based diesel mandate of 7.12 billion gallons—a 67% increase from current levels [1]. This policy shift favors domestic biofuel producers like Darling Ingredients and Chevron while increasing compliance costs for refiners reliant on imported feedstocks [3].

Refiners such as Valero are proactively adapting. Valero’s expansion of renewable diesel capacity through joint ventures like Diamond Green Diesel and its investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects, including the Port Arthur SAF facility, exemplify a forward-looking strategy to align with low-carbon mandates [4]. Similarly, Marathon Petroleum and Delek are diversifying crude oil sources to mitigate volatility and meet stringent environmental standards [5].

Infrastructure and Technology: Gulf Coast as a Strategic Hub

The Gulf Coast’s dominance in refining is underscored by its 93.5% utilization rate, compared to the East Coast’s 59% [1]. This regional disparity creates asymmetric opportunities for midstream logistics firms and industrial conglomerates. Gulf Coast refineries, with their robust export infrastructure and access to low-cost feedstock, are central to global crude processing. Companies like Kinder Morgan and Magellan Midstream Partners stand to benefit from stable refining activity and retrofitting projects aimed at meeting low-carbon mandates [1].

Energy service providers such as Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are also well-positioned to capitalize on the demand for decarbonization technologies. The EIA’s refinery crude runs data highlights the critical role of biofuel compliance credit markets and grid-modernizing utilities like Xcel Energy in managing fuel price volatility [2].

Conclusion: Positioning for Long-Term Gains

The 2026 margin expansion in the refined fuels market is not a fleeting phenomenon but a structural shift driven by policy, technology, and demand dynamics. Investors should prioritize Gulf Coast infrastructure, energy transition technologies, and biofuel compliance strategies to navigate this evolving landscape. As the IEA notes, refining margins are expected to remain elevated, averaging USD 5.5-6.0/bbl, surpassing pre-COVID-19 levels [5]. Those who align with these trends will be well-positioned to capture the market’s upside.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-08 03:56:33.804785

""Sustainable Aviation Fuel"" is only 0.7% of fuel used, not increasing fast, and often not really sustainable.
There is no tax on aviation fuel (except for flights within the EU).
One company predicts labour shortages, as aviation firms seek 1.5 million new hires worldwide in the next decade.
§ GMB London Save Our Aviation Charter PCS, Aviation Review, 2013 Prospect, Towards a sustainable aviation industry, 2015 Prospect, Written evidence, 2021 RMT, Who Says There Is No Alternative?","Aviation produces 2.5% of global carbon emissions. But those emissions are rising rapidly. In other high-emission sectors there are technical alternatives (electricity generation from renewables or nuclear rather than fossil fuels, e-vehicles, food supply shifted back to plants and low-emissions livestock and forward to farm-free food), whatever the political difficulties of introducing them. In aviation, less so.

""Sustainable Aviation Fuel"" is only 0.7% of fuel used, not increasing fast, and often not really sustainable. Incremental improvements such as fewer vacant seats on aircraft reduced CO2 per passenger-km by 60% between 1990 and 2021, but it's hard to see them going much further, and total emissions doubled in those same 31 years.

Thus issues like a third runway for Heathrow loom larger in eco-debate than 2.5%. Globally, there are about 100 big airport-building or expansion projects every year.

Unlike with fossil-fuel extraction, no-one proposes to stop aviation outright, or to reduce it radically. The debate is about braking the growth.

Several UK unions have produced documents about this. The RMT rail union says high-speed rail should be expanded to replace short-haul flights. Especially if rail prices were subsidised and flights taxed more, that would help, though China in recent decades has expanded high-speed rail fast yet also increased flights, just as fast.

Aviation is lightly taxed. There is no tax on aviation fuel (except for flights within the EU). International flights, and domestic flights inside the UK, are zero-rated for VAT or sales taxes.

The UK has an Air Passenger Duty (APD), and other countries have similar levies. APD is £94 on long-haul cheap seats, £224 on long-haul posh seats; £13 and £28 for short-haul, £84 for private jets.

The Prospect union, which organises air traffic controllers, suggests a higher APD for frequent flyers. Prospect does not say this, but APD could also be increased to punitive rates for private jets (or private jets could be banned).

Prospect favours compulsory carbon-offsetting, presumably via a levy on fares and freight rates. It says it is ""not convinced"" about ""managing demand"", i.e. measures to reduce the number of flights. It favours airport expansion, focuses on resistance to cost-cutting on air traffic control, and hopes for emission-cuts through smarter controls.

Unison Scotland has opposed plans to cut APD in Scotland which in fact did not go ahead.

Unite and GMB documents focus on state aid to revive aviation after the Covid lockdowns during which many firms laid off workers. In fact, airlines and airports have largely revived since then: global airlines return on invested capital was higher in 2023, 2024, and 2025 so far than before the pandemic. One company predicts labour shortages, as aviation firms seek 1.5 million new hires worldwide in the next decade.

Unite also favours state aid for ""next generation low-emission aerospace and aviation technologies"".

Some Workers' Liberty policy documents have proposed rationing of flights. What if your job cannot be done without flying? Or you have a frail parent in Bangladesh and want to visit them more than once a year before they die? It is hard to see how the rationing could work without exceptions and thus scope for the best-connected to game the rules or bribe their way round them.

Higher taxes, coupled with low rates on rail and other transport, and a general levelling of incomes so that the taxes do not leave the rich still flying lots and the poor earthbound, seem more plausible to me, coupled with public ownership and democratic control of airports and airlines to plan development, and of other big firms to enable rationalisation of ""business travel"". §

회사측은 이번 공정 도입으로 투자 비용은 최소화하면서 수익성 증대와 원료 다각화, 지속가능항공유(Sustainable Aviation Fuel, 이하 SAF) 원료 추가 확보 등이 가능해질 것으로 전망했다. 앞서 DS단석은 지난 8월 평택1공장에 효소 반응 공정의 퍼포먼스 테스트를 완료한 후 본격 가동을 시작했으며, 시화공장에는 올해 12월 말까지 공정 구축을 완료할 계획이다. 기존 설비에 공정이 추가되는 방식(Retrofit)으로 별도의 생산 중단은 없다.

효소 반응 공정(Enzymatic Reaction)은 기존의 바이오디젤 제조 공정에 효소 촉매 투입반응을 통해 바이오디젤을 제조하는 방법이다. 바이오디젤 제조 시 원료유 안에 포함되어 있는 유리지방산(Free Fatty Acid, 이하 FFA) 함량이 높을 경우 전처리 비용 증가 및 수율 저하 등의 문제가 발생된다.

'효소 반응 공정'이 구축된 DS단석 평택1공장 외관 사진. [사진= DS단석]

이러한 문제로 업계에서는 FFA 함량이 낮은 원료의 수급 경쟁이 치열하고 해당 원료유의 가격이 높아질 수밖에 없는데, 효소 반응 공정의 FFA 함량이 높은 저급 원료로도 품질 규격을 충족하는 바이오디젤 제조가 가능하다. 특히 DS단석은 자체적인 연속식 공정기술을 적용해 바이오디젤 제조 시 생산능력과 품질은 유지하되 수율을 약 3%p 향상시켰다고 밝혔다.

DS단석 관계자는 ""바이오디젤 원가의 약 90%가 원재료비에서 발생하기 때문에 원료 다각화는 중요한 문제""라며, ""이번 공정 도입으로 수율 개선과 저급 원료 적용을 통한 수익성 개선이 기대된다""고 밝혔다. 이어 ""원료 다각화를 통해 기존에 사용하던 원료는 SAF 전처리에 추가 투입할 수 있게 된 만큼 원료 공급망을 한층 강화하고 SAF 제조기반 구축도 추진해 나가겠다""고 덧붙였다.

It has been another bad week for the cheerleaders for sustainable flying.
All the flight-shaming in the world is not going to change that, while the aviation taxes just add to the cost of living.
Jet zero is not going to happen, at least not any time soon – and there is no point in wasting more money on it.","We would be a global force in “jet zero”, promised Boris Johnson, the former prime minister, five years ago. Britain would lead the way in creating “sustainable aviation”, with world-leading research on planes that could fly across the Atlantic without doing any harm to the environment.

Right across the Western world, leaders were making similar pledges, investing billions in new types of fuels and engines, while slapping punitive taxes on the old, dirty jets to make sure we switched to cleaner ones as quickly as possible.

The jet zero project is now in full-scale retreat, with companies pulling out of a market that doesn’t exist, and countries scaling back on aviation taxes. It isn’t going to happen – and we would be far better off cutting carbon emissions elsewhere while allowing the aviation industry to flourish.

It has been another bad week for the cheerleaders for sustainable flying. Shell decided that a huge new plant in the Netherlands that was designed to be one of Europe’s major converters of waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel was too expensive and insufficiently competitive.

The decision was, according to Ashley Kelty, an analyst at Panmure Liberium, “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”. Airlines still face mandatory targets to use set quotas of green fuels, but it is hard to know where they will get them, given that even a company as large as Shell, with lots of world-class expertise at its disposal, does not seem to be able to work out how to make the stuff at a reasonable cost.

Meanwhile, Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, and one of the UK’s leading green tycoons, is struggling with his sustainable airline, Ecojet. It emerged this week that his all-electric airline, which claimed to be a “flag-carrier for green Britain”, had sacked almost its entire workforce, and it has been struggling to raise the £20m it needs to get started, and to secure its air operator’s certificate from the Civil Aviation Authority.

It seems we won’t all be flying off on a mini-break on one of its hydrogen-electric turbo-props any time soon, and will have to make do with the same old Boeings and Airbuses we are used to for a while longer.

Meanwhile, a few countries are even giving up on aviation taxes. From July, anyone getting a plane out of Sweden will no longer have to pay a green levy on their ticket, after its government decided that the “flight-shaming” movement had done too much damage to the industry. India and Germany have also reduced the taxes on air travel. With grim inevitability, Britain’s tax-obsessed Labour Government is still putting them up, with yet more rises in air passenger duty in the last Budget, but at least some countries are recognising they do more harm than good.

The jet zero strategy is in tatters. It is very hard to make the technology of decarbonising air travel work. Batteries are too heavy for a plane, and the electric engines do not generate enough power to keep an aircraft in the air.

Meanwhile the sustainable fuels that could have been an alternative cannot be produced at a competitive price. Sure, that may change, and the technology develops all the time, but we are not even close to making it work yet.

A few of us might be willing to follow the lead of Greta Thunberg and get a boat across the Atlantic, and the network of sleeper trains emerging across Europe will attract a few passengers, but most of us are not willing to give up flying. It remains by far the quickest, cheapest, and of course safest, mode of transport for anything much over 500 miles that we have. All the flight-shaming in the world is not going to change that, while the aviation taxes just add to the cost of living.

We need a change of strategy. We can all take a view on whether climate change is an emergency, or whether it is something that can be managed by gradually switching to different technologies as they emerge, and as they prove themselves effective, reliable, and cheap to run.

But even if you are closer to the Extinction Rebellion side of that debate, it still does not make much sense to obsess over air travel. In fact, flying might get a lot of coverage, partly because virtue-signalling politicians and celebrities love to boast about how they are travelling to Rome by canal, or getting a camel ride to Thailand, or whatever happens to look good on Instagram, but in fact, aviation only accounts for 2.5pc of global carbon emissions. It is never going to be critical to the outlook for global warming one way or another.

It would be far more sensible just to cut back on carbon emissions elsewhere. In the UK we could, for example, get on with building a new generation of nuclear power stations, and scrap all the cumbersome planning rules that make it twice as expensive to build one in Britain as it is in France or South Korea.

Across the EU, countries could drop the tariffs and quotas on Chinese electric vehicles, so that they could accelerate the switch to battery powered models by importing lots of cheap, well made cars. There are still lots of relatively simple ways of decarbonising the economy using technology that has been shown to work. We could then allow people to fly as much as they wanted to, without slapping punitive taxes on anyone who wants to take their children on holiday, or make a business trip; without guilt tripping everyone each time they go to the airport; and without wasting hundreds of millions of technologies that are clearly not going to work.

As at weekend, average price of the fuel in Spain was $675.50 per metric tonne.

However, last week, six vessels departed Nigeria with the fuel following high demand in Australia, Chile, Spain, Italy, Poland, United States, Netherlands and Turkey as Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA)’s shipping data revealed that Front Future left the country with 99,000 tonnes; Nave Atria, 40,000 tonnes and Albaro, 44,000 tonnes.

Others are Pacific Blue, 44,000 tonnes; STI Mighty, 44,000 tonnes; Ardmore Endurance, 40,000 tonnes and MH Daisen, 38,000 tonnes. Findings from ship traffic revealed that Front Forture was currently en route to Brisbane, Australia, with an estimated arrival time being September 14, 2025, as Albaro is around Lome Port in Togo and MH Daison currently en route to New York, United States, with an estimated arrival time on September 18, 2025.

Also, STI Mighty is currently located off the US East Coast, anchored in the Long Island Sound. Meanwhile, NGO Climate Catalyst and the SASHA Coalition have stressed the need for robust due diligence to ensure investments in aviation biofuels and e-fuels are both environmentally sustainable and financially sound.

It noted in its report that biofuel feed stocks may cause biodiversity loss, land-use change emissions or breach environmental rules, leading to regulatory penalties, saying that poor worker reskilling, lack of local economic planning, or weak community engagement could destabilise jobs and damage reputations.

Also, it explained that misuse of resources like food, water or energy could exacerbate insecurity, undermining community wellbeing and long-term investment stability. To mitigate these risks, the guide provides a framework of questions investors can use to engage with portfolio companies, including requirements for transparent lifecycle emissions accounting, holistic risk assessments, and greater accountability in SAF projects.

Climate Catalyst and SASHA argue that this approach not only protects investors but also ensures that the aviation industry’s fuel transition genuinely contributes to a sustainable and equitable climate pathway. Advocacy Manager at the SASHA Coalition, Nuala Doyle, said that alternative fuels from truly sustainable feed stocks were critical for achieving net zero aviation, saying with supply currently low, significant investment was needed to scale these solutions at the necessary pace.

He said: “However, without proper precautions, misplaced investments today risk locking in economic, environmental or social harms for years to come.” Recall that Global aviation bodies like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) had championed the adoption of SAF as part of an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

In an effort to meet environmental targets, the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC) called for the new Dangote Refinery to lead the charge in SAF production, noting that Africa, home to one of the fastest-growing aviation markets, must position itself at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel development.

With Dangote Refinery’s advanced infrastructure and capacity, AFCAC sees it as a potential key player in reshaping the continent’s aviation fuel landscape, making SAF production a priority for future-proofing the industry.

On Tuesday, Illinois farmer and National Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman spoke during a hearing at the U.S. International Trade Commission. Hartman participated alongside other farmers, technology companies, and Brazilian representatives.

Ethanol is mostly made from corn in the United States. The biofuel faces an 18 percent tariff when it enters Brazil. The South American country is the second-largest ethanol producer behind the United States. Brazil pays a 2.5 percent tariff when exporting ethanol to the U.S.

""At the same time, they've been bringing in their sugar cane ethanol into California with hardly no tariff at all,"" Hartman said. ""We as corn growers, we're all about free trade, but we're also about a level playing field and fair trade.""

Hartman said that when Brazilian sugar cane ethanol is imported into California, it is calculated at a lower carbon intensity (CI) score than American-made corn-based ethanol. He said this is mostly due to the different model the Brazilian government uses to calculate carbon emissions.

He said the discussions happening now will have an impact on future market opportunities, including for sustainable aviation fuel.

""I think it's just another situation where we appreciate the Trump administration's working on having a level playing field,"" Hartman said. ""We haven't really done much when it comes to trade agreements for how long. So, now the President has put an emphasis on equal trade throughout the world, and we're hoping that we can get some opportunities to open trade.""

Hartman said new trade deals, including with the United Kingdom, are a step in the right direction.

""The only way we're going to fix this problem if we keep producing a crop like we're doing, is to have more markets,"" he said. ""When it comes to corn, we're at record exports, but we still got this big crop....If this all comes to fruition, there's just a concern that we're going to have $3 corn and we need to sell some grain.""",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WQAD/images/c5729c9f-28c8-43c6-87ec-0c3420e6158c/20250907T231214/c5729c9f-28c8-43c6-87ec-0c3420e6158c_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 20:56:09.689731

About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said.
Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective.
Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.
“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.","RAPID CITY — Jerry Schmitz is rarely at a loss for words about soybeans.

But when asked if farmers have faith in a good outcome from the Trump administration’s trade standoff with China, his gaze shifted and his brow creased momentarily as he thought about the best way to answer.

“Hope might be the better word over faith,” he said.

Schmitz, of rural Vermillion, is the executive director of the South Dakota Soybean Association and the South Dakota Soybean Checkoff. A checkoff is a fee that’s collected from soybean sales and used for research and promotion of the crop.

South Dakota governor’s economic advisers bemoan Trump’s tariff policy

During and after a roundtable discussion Saturday at the Central States Fairgrounds hosted by a nonprofit called Farmers for Free Trade, Schmitz expressed concerns about the effects of trade disputes on farmers.

About 60% of soybeans grown in South Dakota are exported, with China formerly buying about 30%, Schmitz said. China imports soybeans largely for livestock feed to meet the growing demand for meat among its 1.4 billion people.

Now the country is boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs on Chinese goods imposed recently by Republican President Donald Trump.

“There is not a bushel sold to China right now, and we’re about to harvest,” Schmitz said.

Trump has said he’s wielding tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a negotiating tool to correct trade imbalances with other countries.

The Chinese boycott has reduced demand for U.S. soybeans, which has influenced prices. Soybeans sold for about $10.50 per bushel one year ago in South Dakota, but are now $1 to $1.50 lower, and there are fears of further declines without a China trade deal.

Another participant in Saturday’s roundtable, South Dakota Republican Congressman Dusty Johnson, put the impact of lower prices in perspective. Noting that South Dakota farmers raise nearly 250 million bushels of soybeans annually, he said a price drop of $2 per bushel translates to a loss of $500 million.

Johnson said he’s spoken with the Trump administration’s U.S. trade representative about the importance of resolving the China trade dispute quickly.

“We need a deal sooner rather than later,” Johnson said, “because there is not an unlimited ability in farm country to be able to weather the storm.”

Johnson and Schmitz said farmers are planning to store some of the soybeans they’ll harvest this fall, in hopes of selling later at a higher price. Schmitz said grain elevators and soybean processors lacking buyers might have to store excess beans on the ground outside their facilities.

Both also stressed the long-term importance of finding additional buyers for U.S. soybeans. That could include developing better trade relationships with countries that have large populations and growing economies, such as India.

It could also include capitalizing on new domestic markets, such as the possibility of converting soybean oil into sustainable aviation fuel. A $500 million processing plant that will open this fall in Mitchell, for example, will process soybeans and other oilseed crops for uses in renewable fuel, food, livestock feed, lubricants and more.

Those efforts could reduce dependence on Chinese demand but aren’t likely to wholly replace it.

“Although we want to diversify away from China, you simply can’t ignore China,” Johnson said.

The congressman said many of the farmers he meets are “still backing the president’s play” to use tariffs in negotiations that could benefit agriculture in the future, but he said high tariffs “cannot be business as usual on a go-forward basis.”

“The president’s trying to use them as a tool to get better deals,” Johnson said. “I understand that approach, but we do not want to just end with high tariffs.”

The roundtable organizer, Farmers for Free Trade, is on a 14-state tour in an RV wrapped with pro-trade messaging. The group advocates for open markets and reduced trade barriers, said its executive director, Brian Kuehl, of Wyoming.

He referenced a statistic indicating exports account for 20% of the value of U.S. agricultural production.

“So if you were to lose all your exports, you’re going to lose farms, and you’re going to lose farmers. You’re going to lose rural America and rural communities,” Kuehl said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2788.jpg,N,,2025-09-07 16:56:15.927613

Now, are all SAF pathways the same? Of course not.

Today on the podcast we will talk with Mukund Karanjikar, founder and CEO of CleanJoule, a SAF startup based in Utah that is developing a SAF production method that delivers more joules of energy per unit of fuel mass than other traditional biogenic pathways.

What’s more, not content with powering a commercial aviation industry that is thirsty for SAF, CleanJoule is also developing biogenic SAF for space travel. So, when it comes to CleanJoule, you could well say that the sky is not the limit!

The prospect of clean space travel is quite interesting by itself, but, of course, there are other considerations too, such as cost and strategic independence and, on these two counts, CleanJoule is also ready to deliver, says Mukund.

So, in today’s episode we are going to learn a bit more about CycloSAF and CycloRP, the two flavours of sustainable aviation fuel that CleanJoule is developing (for the aviation and space industries, respectively) and how CleanJoule plans to roll out and scale production before the end of this decade.

We will also talk about the positioning of CleanJoule is the broader and constantly evolving SAF industry landscape and why this startup has got the attention of prominent investors such as Indigo Partners (a private equity firm which owns a global portfolio of low-cost airlines) and Temasek (one of Singapore’s most prominent groups).
