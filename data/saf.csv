By being an early adopter of SAF and securing long-term fuel agreements, the airline aims to reduce costs while maintaining its commitment to sustainability. As other airlines struggle with rising SAF prices and environmental surcharges, British Airways’ strategy gives it a unique edge, positioning the carrier to deliver affordable and eco-friendly flights to passengers across its network.

British Airways, the UK’s flag carrier, has long been recognized for its premium services and extensive route network, often making it a more expensive option compared to low-cost airlines. However, this price gap may soon shrink, driven by a significant £2.6 billion (\$3.5 billion) investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With this strategic shift, British Airways is poised to undercut its rivals and deliver more competitive pricing to its passengers while continuing to prioritize sustainability.

As an early adopter and major advocate for SAF, British Airways is working toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The airline has made significant strides in using SAF produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, woody biomass, waste tyres, and agricultural byproducts like orchard and forestry waste. These eco-friendly fuels are expected to play a crucial role in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint, a sector traditionally reliant on fossil fuels.

British Airways is leading the way in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), establishing a pioneering benchmark for the entire airline industry. It became the first airline in the world to utilize SAF produced at a commercial scale in the UK, thanks to a groundbreaking multi-year partnership with Phillips 66. This commitment to SAF is in line with the broader industry trend of decarbonization, where airlines are seeking more sustainable options for jet fuel in the face of growing environmental concerns.

The move to SAF is part of a broader effort within the airline industry to reduce carbon emissions. Governments across the globe have started to impose mandates requiring airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF in their fuel mix. The transition to SAF is expected to have far-reaching implications, particularly in terms of cost. Currently, SAF can be up to seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel, and as these mandates become stricter, the price of SAF is expected to increase. This price increase could lead to higher ticket prices across the board as airlines pass on the costs to passengers.

In anticipation of the rising cost of sustainable fuel, several airlines, including Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, have already implemented surcharges to offset the added expenses of SAF. Lufthansa, Germany’s flagship carrier, has introduced an environmental cost surcharge on all tickets for flights originating from the 27 EU countries, as well as from the UK, Norway, and Switzerland. This surcharge varies based on the route, with prices ranging from 84p (€1) to £60.70 (€72). Similarly, Virgin Atlantic has added a £24 surcharge, aiming to cover the rising costs associated with using SAF in its fleet. The airline’s CEO has also warned that a return flight between London and New York could cost £40 more per passenger as SAF usage becomes more widespread.

However, British Airways is working hard to mitigate the impact of these rising costs on its passengers. By being an early adopter of SAF, the airline has secured long-term contracts that allow it to lock in SAF prices at a lower rate than what is projected for the open market. This strategic move not only positions British Airways as a leader in sustainability but also gives the airline an edge when it comes to pricing. While other carriers are forced to introduce surcharges and hike ticket prices, British Airways may be able to shield its customers from the worst of the price increases associated with the transition to green fuel.

British Airways is betting on SAF to be a key driver in making air travel more sustainable while keeping its pricing competitive. The airline’s early adoption and strategic partnerships with fuel suppliers put it in a favorable position, ensuring that it can offer customers a relatively affordable way to fly while remaining committed to decarbonization goals. The airline’s efforts to push the boundaries of sustainability are a part of a broader shift within the aviation industry, where more companies are taking responsibility for reducing their environmental impact.

The rising cost of SAF, however, does come with challenges. While British Airways may have an advantage in securing discounted fuel prices, the overall industry is likely to see rising fares as SAF becomes more integrated into the aviation sector. The introduction of additional environmental surcharges, like those seen with Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, could become more widespread as airlines pass on the increased costs to passengers.

Despite these challenges, British Airways is working to balance the cost implications with its sustainability goals. The airline’s commitment to SAF and its investment in green fuel technology demonstrate its dedication to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 while remaining competitive in a rapidly changing market. British Airways’ move to outpace its competitors in providing sustainable air travel demonstrates that environmental responsibility can go hand in hand with affordable pricing.

British Airways is set to disrupt the airline industry with its £2.6 billion investment in sustainable aviation fuel, enabling it to offer significantly lower fares than its competitors in the UK, Switzerland, and Norway. This strategic move positions the airline to lead in both affordability and sustainability.

As the demand for greener aviation practices continues to grow, British Airways is setting an example for how airlines can reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing quality or affordability. By making bold moves in sustainable fuel adoption, the airline is not only contributing to the fight against climate change but also positioning itself as a leader in the future of air travel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/British-Airways-3-1-850x567-1-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-01 04:56:11.641061

First Batch at Hong Kong International Airport

The first batch of SAF to leave Hong Kong International Airport was produced by Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) and was uplifted in April of this year. Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company is a key producer of SAF in Asia and is at the forefront of independently manufacturing bio-jet fuel technology.

The initial batch from Hong Kong International Airport was produced from used cooking oil through a process known as HEFA (meaning using hydrotreated esters and fatty acids), and was also recognised by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) as being able to decrease the lifecycle carbon emissions by around 80%, compared to the standard conventional jet fuel.

Last year, two batches were uplifted by Cathay Pacific at Amsterdam Airport Schipol and London Heathrow Airport.

What is SAF?

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) is a sustainable substitute fuel made from waste materials and other renewable carbon sources. Cathay Pacific has shown that SAF can hugely decrease carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels, therefore helping to address the environmental impact that the aviation industry currently has. The cooperation between Cathay Pacific and Sinopec shows the capacity for further collaboration between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability, Grace Cheung, said:

“Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.”

Future Prospects

SAF production and adoption has increased across Asia in recent years, Cathay Pacific is working with different partners to expand the use of SAF across the continent. In March of this year, the airline reached an agreement with a fuel supplier SK Energy, who will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific for 2 years, from 2025 to 2027, in South Korea. Simultaneously, the airline will continue to make use of their experience and knowledge to support Hong Kong scale up its usage with a supportive police to help strengthen Hong Kong International Airport’s status as a leading aviation hub.

This is not Cathay Pacific’s first step towards sustainability as they revealed their 2024 sustainability achievements earlier this year, with a 15% increase in fuel efficiently, and a 20% reduction of onboard waste.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duc-Van-Photo-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 22:56:14.722291

Beginning in the mid 1980s, Dornier 328 (D328) is a turboprop powered commuter airliner manufactured by Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH, evolving over time under several brands such as Daimler-Benz group, Fairchild Dornier and AvCraft Aviation.

In 2006, 328 Support Services GmbH was founded and took over Type Certificate (TC) rights of the D328, a certificate that confirms the airworthiness of an aircraft under national law. It was 328 Support Services GmbH that Deutsche Regional Aircraft GmbH emerged from in 2011. It was then acquired by its parent company Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) in 2015. Deutsche Aircraft is aiming to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. The D328eco is a 40-seat passenger aircraft that is compatible with sustainable-aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrogen-based fuels. The aircraft manufacturer’s main goal is the development of the D328eco.

Roll out of D328eco

In an announcement on May 28, 2025, Deutsche Aircraft unveiled the first D328eco (TAC 1) in Oberpfaffenhofen. The D328eco is an evolved version of the Dornier 328. Compared to the Dornier 328, it has enhanced performance, is more fuel efficient, and is designed to operate with reduced emissions, particularly when using SAF or hydrogen-based fuels while maintaining versatility and reliability. In the announcement, co-CEO of Deutsche Aircraft, Nico Neumann viewed the success of the prototype aircraft as a significant achievement, the aircraft marks their dedication to sustainable aviation. He said:

“The roll-out of our first test aircraft marks a significant achievement in the D328eco programme and an important step towards our physical flight test activities. This milestone represents our transition from conceptual design to practical testing and industrialization. At Deutsche Aircraft, we are proud to introduce an aircraft with the proven DNA of the Dornier 328, enhanced for better efficiency, reduced emissions and a superior customer experience, making it an optimal choice for regional operators worldwide.”",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-5-e1748643169142.png,N,,2025-05-31 18:56:38.423159

Introduction: The Challenge of Air Freight Emissions

As global trade continues to expand, the logistics industry faces a significant challenge: reducing the environmental impact of air freight. Air transportation, while crucial for rapid global delivery, is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. On average, fossil-fueled air freight produces 50 to 150 times more CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per ton-kilometer than ocean freight and 5 to 6 times more than land freight. With aircraft fuel demand expected to double by 2050, it’s clear that we need innovative solutions to address this growing environmental concern.

At FreightAmigo, we recognize the urgent need for sustainable logistics practices. As a digital supply chain finance platform, we’re committed to helping organizations, enterprises, and individuals transform their logistics experiences while prioritizing environmental responsibility. In this article, we’ll explore how Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is revolutionizing the air freight industry and how FreightAmigo is supporting this crucial transition.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a game-changing alternative to conventional jet fuel. It’s derived from sustainable sources such as waste fats, oils, greases, agricultural and forestry residues, and even innovative processes that capture carbon directly from the air. The key advantage of SAF is its ability to significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels.

Here are some crucial facts about SAF:

SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by 70-95% compared to conventional jet fuel.

It can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in current aircraft engines without modifications.

SAF creates a closed carbon cycle, as the CO2 absorbed by the plants used to produce it is roughly equivalent to the CO2e emitted when the fuel is burned.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that SAF will be the most widely-used method for decarbonization in the aviation industry by 2050.

The Environmental Impact of SAF

The adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents a significant step towards reducing the carbon footprint of the logistics industry. By choosing to ship goods with SAF, companies can effectively lower their Scope 3 emissions, which refer to indirect greenhouse gas emissions occurring throughout a company’s value chain.

To understand the impact, it’s essential to consider the different scopes of emissions:

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from an organization’s own operations (e.g., fuel combustion in company-owned vehicles)

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions related to purchased electricity, heating, or cooling

Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect emissions in a company’s value chain, both upstream and downstream

For logistics companies, air transportation emissions typically fall under Scope 3. By utilizing SAF, we can help our clients significantly reduce these indirect emissions, contributing to their overall sustainability goals.

Wizz Air made headlines recently by signing a major deal to purchase sustainable aviation fuel derived from treated human poop. The optics are amusing, but the implications are profound. This isn’t a fringe experiment or a corporate PR stunt. It’s a signal that the aviation industry is moving toward a serious decarbonization strategy grounded in real chemistry, real feedstocks, and real-world constraints. The decision to bet on SAF from municipal waste not only speaks volumes about what airlines think is possible, it also helps dismantle five of the most persistent misconceptions still infecting energy and climate discourse.

The first incorrect assumption is the idea that we are going to need vastly more liquid fuels than we do today. This belief underpins a surprising number of energy transition scenarios, especially those that downplay electrification or assume a strongly increasing demand curve for jet fuel, diesel, and bunker fuel decades into the future. But the numbers don’t support it. Global oil demand for transport is peaking or has already peaked, and all signs point to a rapid contraction over the next 25 years.

In my own modeling, published over the past several years, I’ve projected a scenario where 100% of ground transportation is electrified—cars, buses, trucks, rail, two- and three-wheelers. In that world, the demand for liquid fuels drops by over 80%, and what’s left is concentrated in the hard-to-electrify sectors: long-haul aviation and deep-sea shipping. Aviation fuel demand does grow modestly through 2050 under my model, which is more pessimistic and I think realistic about growth, but hybrid electric regional turboprops take over shorter hops of up to 1,000 km as battery energy densities climb. My projection is for only 110 million tons of liquid fuels required for aviation.

Maritime shipping fuel demand, meanwhile, shrinks dramatically as bulk fossil fuel and iron ore shipments decline. Oil, coal, and LNG shipping collectively represent about 40% of tonnage today, raw iron ore is another 15%, and all four are in structural decline. By the end of the century, I project annual liquid fuel demand for marine shipping is likely to be in the 70 million tons of diesel equivalent range globally. That’s less than a third of today’s shipping fuel volume, and with reductions in aviation fuel demand due to electrification, high-speed rail and other factors, we’re looking at a future where the total global need for liquid fuels might be one-tenth of what it is today.

The second misconception that refuses to die is the notion that biofuels can only come from prime agricultural land. This fear traces back to first-generation biofuels—corn ethanol, soy biodiesel, palm oil—where concerns, some legitimate if overstated, about land use, food prices, and deforestation emerged. But that legacy doesn’t reflect the reality of advanced biofuel production today. The Wizz Air deal is a perfect example. Biosolids—essentially the residual organic matter left over from wastewater treatment—are abundant, underutilized, and pose a methane emissions risk if unmanaged. Converting them to SAF doesn’t displace food crops or use new land. Instead, it turns a municipal waste liability into a high-value, low-carbon product.

And biosolids are just one category. In my comprehensive assessment of viable biofuel pathways, I catalogued at least ten scalable options that rely entirely on waste and non-food biomass: municipal solid waste, forestry residues, agricultural byproducts like corn stover and wheat straw, animal manure, and even landfill gas. The global supply of these materials is vast. The world wastes approximately 2.5 billion tons of food annually. Europe alone generates over 1.5 billion tons of livestock manure per year. At a conservative yield of 0.4 tons of fuel per ton of dried biomass, the waste streams we’re currently mismanaging could supply well over 500 million tons of low-carbon fuel annually. That’s more than enough to meet the residual liquid fuel demand in a maximally electrified transport system. No new farmland required. No tradeoff between food and fuel. Just a redirection of waste into the energy system.

The third false belief is that renewable electricity will become effectively free, enabling a cascade of ultra-cheap electrochemical pathways to dominate. This misconception stems from the marginal cost argument: since wind and solar have no fuel cost, they must eventually drive electricity prices to zero part of the time. It’s true that the marginal cost of generation is low. But the system cost of delivering firm, reliable, high-quality electricity is not. In high-renewables grids like California or South Australia, we do see negative pricing events during solar peaks. But these are short-duration, location-specific artifacts of a misaligned supply-demand curve.

To actually power a process like hydrogen electrolysis or synthetic fuel synthesis economically, you need high-capacity-factor electricity, 60% or more. If you’re relying only on intermittent surplus, your electrolyzers or synthesis reactors are sitting idle most of the time, and your capital costs explode. I’ve run the numbers in multiple regions, and the story is consistent: surplus renewable electricity is not free when you need it at scale, and its temporal distribution makes it unsuitable as the backbone of any major fuel production system. California’s duck curve is not a business model.

This brings us to the fourth fantasy: that green hydrogen will be cheap. It won’t. Hydrogen is a valuable industrial input for very specific contexts—ammonia production, petrochemical refining and perhaps steelmaking. But as a general-purpose energy substitute, it fails the physics and the economics. Electrolyzers are expensive, and their cost per kilogram of hydrogen is highly sensitive to utilization. Hydrogen is expensive to compress, store and distribute.

In transportation, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have a total cost of ownership roughly 2 to 3 times that of battery electric equivalents. I’ve documented multiple real-world cases where hydrogen trucks, buses and other vehicles failed on economics alone, let alone the infrastructure challenges. In energy terms, green hydrogen multiplies the upstream electricity demand by a factor of 3 compared to direct electrification. Every kilowatt-hour routed through an electrolyzer, then compressed, stored, and run through a fuel cell ends up delivering a fraction of the useful energy that a battery does.

That’s playing out now, as every organization that created fantastical projections of cheap green hydrogen adjusts their cost projections to fit the realities that were obvious when they first made them five to ten years ago. BNEF, CSIRO, LUT and more are all finally realizing that their numbers are bogus, but only BNEF has so far had the guts to triple its electrolyzer cost projections for 2050, with the rest only nudging costs up every year since 2020’s projections. Contacts tell me that the IEA gave the task of doing the first projections to an intern, and I find that credible. This wasn’t intentional disinformation, by the way, this was technoeconomic incompetence combined with cognitive biases. It remains indefensible in my eyes, however. Billions of dollars and years of time have been wasted, and more money and time that could be spent on actual climate solutions continue to be thrown at the space.

The reality is that hydrogen is an industrial feedstock that will see significant declines in demand from current levels as 40% of current use is for petroleum refining. Another 30% is used for ammonia, which is also going to see declines as its price increases and agrigenetic nitrogen fixing, precision agriculture, drone spraying and other levers displace its current overuse.

The final myth that needs to be retired is the idea that synthetic fuels—those created from green hydrogen and captured CO₂—will be cheaper than biofuels, perhaps even as cheap as fossil fuels. This one gets a lot of airtime in e-fuel hype circles, particularly in Europe where policy compromises have allowed synthetic fuels to keep internal combustion engines on life support past 2035. But the thermodynamics are unforgiving. Making a synthetic hydrocarbon fuel requires enormous amounts of electricity: to make hydrogen, to capture and purify CO₂, and to run the synthesis process itself. The round-trip efficiency is dreadful—somewhere between 10% and 15% from grid electricity to motion when burned in an engine. That means you’re spending five to seven times more electricity per kilometer than you would with a battery electric vehicle. And that electricity isn’t free, as we’ve established.

Today, synthetic jet fuel costs between $5 and $10 per gallon in pilot quantities. Bio-based SAF, by contrast, is already being produced at commercial scale for $2 to $4 per gallon from used cooking oil, tallow, and now, biosolids. Even as e-fuel technology improves, the gap will persist. Airlines aren’t ideologues, they’ll buy the cheapest low-carbon fuel that meets ASTM specs and avoids reputational risk. Right now, and likely forever, that’s biofuel. Wizz Air knows this. That’s why they’re locking in biosolid-derived SAF, not hydrogen-derived e-kerosene.

Biofuels are always going to be two to three times more expensive than fossil fuels if we let the atmosphere be used as a free sewer, but synthetic fuels will be four to six times as expensive. As a result, no synthetic fuels.

The reality is simpler and more elegant than the myths. We will electrify everything we can—cars, trucks, buses, rail, ferries, short-hop planes—and we will use sustainable biofuels made mostly from waste biomass streams for what we can’t electrify yet. That residual demand is modest, and we have the feedstocks to meet it without touching a single hectare of food-producing land. We will grow a bunch of soy beans and similar things for biofuels simply because we have lots of agricultural land. There’s no shortage or competition for food, as evidenced by us throwing away a full third of the calories we manufacture annually.

The energy transition isn’t about miracle molecules or magic catalysts. It’s about physics, economics, and pragmatic deployment. Wizz Air’s poop-to-jet-fuel deal is just one data point, but it helps illustrate why the five persistent illusions have to be removed from policy and investment decisions.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-31-2025-10_44_04-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-05-31 17:56:55.241785

These movements have unlocked a 40% discount to market prices.

Governments are now setting mandates for airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF to reduce their carbon emissions. Net-zero targets are highly likely to increase fares over the next couple of years as the price of SAF can be two to seven times more expensive than traditional kerosene.

This higher cost is primarily due to the current technology and feedstock costs. The EU SAF blending quota starts at 2% from 2025, 6% from 2030, 20% from 2035 and 70% from 2050.

While SAF's price is expected to decrease as production scales and supply increases, it remains a significant challenge for airlines, many of whom are already rolling out additional costs.

As global trade continues to expand, the air freight industry faces a significant challenge: reducing its environmental impact. Recent data shows that fossil-fueled air freight produces 50 to 150 times more CO2 equivalent (CO2e) per ton-kilometer than ocean freight and 5 to 6 times more than land freight. With aircraft fuel demand expected to double by 2050, it’s clear that we need innovative solutions to address this growing concern.

At FreightAmigo, we recognize the urgency of this issue and are committed to leading the charge towards sustainable logistics. In this article, we’ll explore how Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is emerging as a game-changing solution for reducing air freight emissions and how our Digital Logistics Platform is supporting businesses in their journey towards greener supply chains.

Understanding Scope 3 Emissions in Air Freight

Before diving into the solutions, it’s crucial to understand the concept of Scope 3 emissions in the context of air freight:

Scope 1 emissions: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (e.g., fuel combustion in company-owned aircraft)

Scope 2 emissions: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy

Scope 3 emissions: All other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain

For most businesses using air freight services, the emissions associated with their shipments fall under Scope 3. These indirect emissions are often the largest source of a company’s carbon footprint and can be challenging to measure and reduce. However, addressing Scope 3 emissions is becoming increasingly important as stakeholders demand greater environmental responsibility from businesses across all industries.

The Promise of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a leading solution for reducing air freight emissions. Here’s why SAF is generating so much excitement in the logistics industry:

What is SAF?

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel but with a significantly lower carbon footprint. SAF can be produced from a variety of sustainable sources, including:

Waste fats, oils, and greases

Agricultural and forestry residues

Municipal solid waste

Carbon captured directly from the air

The Environmental Impact of SAF

The potential environmental benefits of SAF are substantial:

Lifecycle carbon emissions reduction of 70-95% compared to traditional fossil fuels

Creates a closed carbon cycle, as the CO2 absorbed by plants during growth is roughly equivalent to the CO2e emitted when the fuel is burned

Can be used as a drop-in solution, requiring no modifications to existing aircraft engines

The Role of SAF in Decarbonization

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF is expected to be the most widely-used method for decarbonization in the aviation industry by 2050. This underscores the importance of investing in and developing SAF technologies to achieve long-term sustainability goals in air freight.

FreightAmigo’s Commitment to Sustainable Logistics

As a Digital Logistics Platform committed to transforming the logistics industry, FreightAmigo is at the forefront of integrating sustainable solutions like SAF into our service offerings. Here’s how we’re supporting our clients in their sustainability journey:

1. Comprehensive Carbon Footprint Analysis

Our Digital Logistics Platform provides detailed insights into the carbon footprint of each shipment, allowing businesses to make informed decisions about their freight options. By clearly displaying the CO2e emissions associated with different transport modes, we empower our clients to choose the most environmentally friendly option for their needs.

2. SAF Integration

We’re working with airlines and fuel suppliers to integrate SAF options into our platform, making it easy for clients to opt for more sustainable air freight solutions. This includes:

Providing transparent information on SAF availability and pricing

Similar to the concept introduced by other logistics providers, FreightAmigo is developing an Environmental Attribute System to simplify the use of SAF for our clients. This system will allow businesses to purchase SAF credits or attributes, ensuring that an equivalent amount of SAF is used in the aviation fuel supply chain, even if it’s not directly used for their specific shipment.

4. Customizable Sustainability Programs

We understand that every business has unique sustainability goals and requirements. That’s why we’re developing customizable programs that allow clients to choose their preferred level of SAF usage or CO2e reduction for their shipments. These programs will be flexible enough to accommodate various budgets and sustainability targets.

5. Comprehensive Reporting and Analytics

Our Digital Logistics Platform provides detailed reports on SAF usage and emissions reductions, helping businesses track their progress towards sustainability goals and comply with reporting requirements. These analytics can be invaluable for companies looking to improve their environmental performance and communicate their efforts to stakeholders.

The Future of Sustainable Air Freight

While SAF represents a significant step forward in reducing air freight emissions, it’s just one part of a broader sustainability strategy. As we look to the future, several trends and developments are shaping the landscape of sustainable air freight:

1. Increased SAF Production and Availability

As demand for SAF grows, we can expect to see increased investment in production facilities and technologies. This will likely lead to greater availability and potentially lower costs for SAF in the coming years.

2. Advancements in Aircraft Technology

Alongside SAF development, aircraft manufacturers are working on more fuel-efficient designs and exploring alternative propulsion systems, such as electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft for short-haul flights.

3. Optimization of Air Freight Operations

Digital Logistics Platforms like FreightAmigo are enabling more efficient routing, load consolidation, and capacity utilization, further reducing the overall environmental impact of air freight.

4. Regulatory Support and Incentives

Governments and international organizations are likely to introduce more regulations and incentives to promote the use of SAF and other sustainable aviation practices.

5. Collaboration Across the Supply Chain

Achieving significant emissions reductions in air freight will require collaboration between shippers, freight forwarders, airlines, and fuel producers. Platforms that facilitate this collaboration will play a crucial role in driving industry-wide sustainability efforts.",https://www.freightamigo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/new-icon-1.png,N,,2025-05-31 19:56:26.458231

‘Dat is aan hen, wij kunnen ons daar niet mee bemoeien.’ Elf procent Voor de Embraer ERJ-familie met de EMB-135 en de EMB-140 koos de vliegtuigbouwer in de vroege jaren ’90 voor Rolls-Royce-motoren.
Daarbij komt nog dat de poten van de stoelen aan de raamkant zich deels op de binnenzijkant van het vliegtuig bevinden in plaats van op de vloer.
‘De ene piloot heeft meer voorkeur voor de sidestick, de andere voor de yoke’, zegt Arjan.
Tussen onze verschillende engineering teams, die over de platformen van de vier business units heen werken, wordt voortdurend kennis met elkaar ontwikkeld, uitgewisseld en geïmplementeerd.’ Ter illustratie noemt hij het fly-by-wire-systeem: ‘De eerste generatie zat op de E-jets, de tweede op de Executive, de derde op de KC-390 en de vierde op de E2.’ Opnieuw vestigt Arjan de aandacht op de E-jet E2-familie.","Na een carrière bij KLM en twee van haar dochters kwam Arjan Meijer in dienst bij Embraer. Bij de blauwe maatschappij was hij betrokken bij zowel de inkoop als de uitfasering van een aantal karakteristieke vliegtuigtypes. Uiteraard weet hij ook het nodige te vertellen in relatie met de Braziliaanse vliegtuigbouwer die zowel verkeersvliegtuigen, militaire toestellen als zakenjets op de markt brengt.

Het was op een Tweede Paasdag dat hij samen met zijn ouders in een Cessna 172 voor de eerste keer het luchtruim koos voor een rondvlucht vanaf Eelde boven Groningen. ‘Vanaf dat moment, twaalf jaar was ik, ben ik de luchtvaart in de gaten gaan houden’, vertelt Arjan. Zijn ouders hoopten dat hij de bakkerij zou overnemen, maar het liep anders. Arjan ging naar Delft voor de studie lucht- en ruimtevaarttechniek aan de Technische Universiteit. ‘In eerste instantie wilde ik piloot worden. Uiteindelijk raakte ik toch meer geïnteresseerd in de operaties van airlines en het beheer van vliegtuigen dan in het daadwerkelijke besturen van een vliegtuig.’

747’s en 737’s

‘Tijdens een van mijn laatste studiejaren kwam ik in aanraking met iemand die werkzaam was bij KLM’, zegt hij. ‘Via dat contact kwam ik daar aan een stageplek op de vlootinkoopafdeling. Dat was in eind jaren negentig toen de Boeing 747-400 en de 737-800 en -900 werden ingekocht. Op het moment van mijn afstuderen in juli 1999 was er bij KLM een aannamestop. Toen heb ik bij KPN een managementtraining gedaan. Ik zat alweer enige tijd bij KPN Satcom in de satellietcommunicatie toen ik door KLM werd benaderd: er kwam een functie vrij op de afdeling waar ik stage had gelopen. Op 1 september 2001 ging ik van start, tien dagen voordat de wereld op Nine Eleven volledig veranderde. Ik sloot niet uit dat dit een vroegtijdig einde van mijn KLM-loopbaan zou inhouden, ik zat immers nog in mijn proeftijd. Maar nee, er volgde een heel interessante tijd waarin KLM overging tot de vervanging van zowel de 767 als de laatste 747-300’s door de A330 en de 777. De beslissing dat het doek voor de MD-11 ging vallen werd eveneens genomen. De laatste 747-400 en vier 747-400F’s werden in diezelfde periode aan de vloot toegevoegd. Volop werk aan de winkel dus.’

Fokker

Ruim acht jaar later ging Arjan bij KLM Cityhopper aan de slag. ‘Dat was de tijd van de uitfasering van de Fokker 100’, vervolgt hij. ‘Bij de ontmanteling van de meeste was ik betrokken. Een aantal zijn bij Fokker uit elkaar gehaald, een aantal ook bij KLM Cityhopper zelf. Een drietal ontkwam aan dit lot. Op Schiphol is de PH-OFE op het Panoramaterras van Schiphol alweer veertien jaar een blikvanger. Een andere is neergezet bij het Aviodome in Lelystad en ook daar nog altijd te zien. Ik was erbij toen de PH-OFA daar de wielen op de grond zette en zijn laatste vlucht tot een goed einde bracht. Een derde exemplaar, de PH-OFF, is naar de Aircraft Maintenance & Training School gegaan om aan te sleutelen.’

Embraers in de plaats

In 2014 maakte Arjan een overstap naar Engeland als directeur van KLM UK Engineering, een onderhoudsbedrijf in Norwich Norfolk. ‘Toen ik er begon vond er behalve aan 737’s en A320’s ook nog groot onderhoud plaats aan Fokker 70’s en BAe 146’s. Later kwamen voor die laatste twee vliegtuigtypes de Embraers in beeld.’ In 2016 keerde hij terug naar Nederland, niet alleen om er te wonen, maar ook omdat hij op uitnodiging een nieuw dienstverband aanging, nu met Embraer. Op het kantoor in Amsterdam begon hij als hoofd Europa, Midden-Oosten, Afrika, Centraal Azië en Rusland. Vervolgens werd hij hoofd verkoop van commerciële vliegtuigen voor Embraer wereldwijd. In juni 2020 kon hij aan de slag President & CEO van Commercial Aviation en dat is hij nu nog steeds.

Dat is aan hen

‘Embraer werkt met vier business units met allemaal hun eigen winst- en verliesrekening: Commercial Aviation, Defensie & Security, Executive (zakenjets; LK) en Service & Support’, legt Arjan uit. ‘Die laatste ondersteunt de klanten van de andere drie takken van sport op dagelijkse basis. Binnen mijn verantwoordelijkheid voor commerciële luchtvaart werk ik met alle klanten wereldwijd die met onze Embraer-verkeersvliegtuigen vliegen of dat gaan doen. Dat betekent dat we die machines bouwen en afleveren, de marketing en verkoop doen, en de strategie voor de business unit uitzetten.’ Arjan schudt zijn hoofd als de vraag komt over zaken doen met Rusland en Wit-Rusland. ‘Embrear houdt zich aan alle internationale sancties, dus wij hebben op dit moment geen enkele interactie met die landen. We leveren geen vliegtuigen, geen onderdelen en geen enkele service. In Rusland vliegt wel een aantal Embraers rond, maar wij kunnen daar niets aan supporten. Hoe ze dat onderling regelen?’ Arjan trekt zijn schouders op. ‘Dat is aan hen, wij kunnen ons daar niet mee bemoeien.’

Elf procent

Voor de Embraer ERJ-familie met de EMB-135 en de EMB-140 koos de vliegtuigbouwer in de vroege jaren ’90 voor Rolls-Royce-motoren. De daaropvolgende E-jets, de E170, E175, E190 en E195 werden twintig jaar geleden voorzien van General Electric-motoren. Onder de E-jet E2—jet-familie kwamen uiteindelijk motoren van Pratt & Whitney te hangen. Arjan: ‘Na met alle motorproducenten te hebben onderhandeld koos Embraer destijds voor de P&W GTF, Geared Turbo Fan. Voor de oplages die wij maken is het heel duur om daarop twee motortypes te certificeren, vandaar de keuze voor één leverancier. In het nieuwe concept van Pratt & Whitney kan de fan van de motor langzamer draaien en de turbine sneller door middel van een gear. Samen met een grotere afmeting van de fan levert dit motor type zeer veel efficiencyvoordelen. In vergelijking met het voorgaande type levert de motor an sich zestien procent brandstofbesparing op. Maar hij is ook zwaarder. Dus zodra we hem onder de vleugel hangen blijft er elf procent over.’

Een plas water op de grond

Arjan stelt nog altijd ‘heel blij te zijn met die keuze’, ondanks de ‘entry into service-problemen’ als gevolg van zogenaamde powder metal-bevindingen die ertoe hebben geleid dat talloze vliegtuigen langdurig aan de grond zijn komen te staan, een lot dat niet alleen de E-jet E2-familie trof maar ook machines van het type Airbus A220 en A320. ‘Powder metal, voluit powder metallurgy en afgekort PM, is een productieproces om componenten, zoals turbineschijven, van metaalpoeder te maken’, legt Arjan uit. ‘Al die motoren moesten terug naar de motorenshop van Pratt & Whitney. Embraer heeft het geluk dat we met onze E2 later op de markt kwamen dan Airbus met de A220 en A320 en daarnaast dat onze machines aanzienlijk lichter zijn. Dit zorgt ervoor dat we relatief minder last hebben van dit probleem. Bij de E2’s die we de laatste jaren hebben afgeleverd is het probleem al niet meer aan de orde. Je kunt het hele issue wel een beetje vergelijken met een kraan die kapot is: er ligt nog een plas water op de grond, die plas water zijn wij aan het opruimen, maar de kraan is inmiddels al lang gerepareerd.’

Opgeschoond

Niet alleen de motoren bewerkstelligen dat de nieuwe E2-serie veel efficiënter presteert dan de vorige. ‘We hebben het hele vliegtuig van voor tot achter vernieuwd en opgeschoond’, zegt Arjan. ‘Niet alleen de staart is compleet nieuw ontwikkeld, ook de vleugels zijn nieuw en volledig geoptimaliseerd. Op diverse locaties zijn in het vliegtuig lichtgewicht materialen geïntroduceerd. Doordat het onderstel nu van deuren is voorzien, is heel veel wrijving weggenomen. Het weerstandprofiel is daardoor veel efficiënter. Dus als een machine van onze nieuwste generatie overvliegt, kan je de wielen niet meer zien zitten zoals van oudsher het geval is bij bijvoorbeeld de oudere E-Jets en de Boeing 737. Het fly-by-wire-systeem heeft eveneens een upgrade ondergaan. Dankzij al die verbeteringen zien we op vliegtuigniveau een brandstofbesparing van bijna twintig procent. Omdat de195-E2 ook langer is dan haar voorganger hebben we bovendien nog wat schaaleffecten in het vliegtuig gekregen. Zo passen er in geval van een maximale configuratie in één klasse 146 in plaats van 124 stoelen in. Ook dat maakt dit toestel efficiënter. Nog een bijkomend voordeel is dat het bereik vergroot is van ongeveer 4.250 naar 5.500 kilometer.’

Wel heel veel uitdagingen

Nu de luchtvaart mega onder vuur ligt als het gaat om uitstoot en lawaai, is ook Embraer drukdoende haar machines steeds meer te verduurzamen in de zin van stiller, zuiniger en schoner. Arjan: ‘Enkele jaren geleden kondigden we Energia aan met een aantal vliegtuigconcepten, dus nog geen prototypes maar concepten op papier, waarbij we kijken hoe bepaalde technologieën toepasbaar kunnen zijn in de toekomst. Bij Embraer zeggen we dat de missie de technologie dicteert. Met andere woorden: afhankelijk van wat je met een vliegtuig wilt doen, zou je toegang kunnen krijgen tot bepaalde technologie. Dat betekent dat we wide-body’s voorlopig echt niet gaan zien op waterstof of elektriciteit. Er gaat zoveel energie in om, dat is veel te complex.

Ook met onze 195-E2 met maximaal 146 stoelen, weliswaar een small narrow-body, maar toch ook nog altijd een groot vliegtuig waarin erg veel energie omgaat, gaat dat niet lukken. Aan het laden van batterijen, de capaciteit van batterijen en het gewicht ervan zitten wel héél veel uitdagingen. Om een beeld te geven: voor een 195-E2 met zijn 5.500 kilometer range heb je zo’n dertig à veertig keer het gewicht van het vliegtuig aan batterijen nodig. Zelfs als je die batterijen twee of drie keer zo klein maakt gaat dat het probleem niet oplossen. Je moet dus naar veel kleinere toestellen kijken om dat werkbaar te maken. Een machine met tien stoelen moet wel kunnen. Embraer’s deelneming EVE Air Mobility bouwt overigens op dit moment een eVTOL, een helikopter die met zo’n vier à vijf personen op batterijen gaat vliegen.’

CO2-neutrale groei

In vliegen op waterstof met een machine met om en nabij de vijftig tot honderd stoelen ziet Arjan op langere termijn nog wel een mogelijkheid. ‘Maar dat brengt technisch een enorme complexiteit met zich mee’, haast hij zich te zeggen. ‘Het omzetten van waterstof met behulp van een fuel cell naar elektrisch geeft immers heel veel hitte. Ook de beschikbaarheid van waterstof en de kosten ervan vormen vooralsnog een enorme barrière. Voor het grotere segment van Embraer, en dat is tot 150 stoelen, zeggen wij dat de eerste stap gewoon bestaat uit het efficiënter maken van vliegtuigen. Wat bijvoorbeeld KLM doet met de aanschaf van de veel brandstofzuinigere E195-E2’s, laat zien dat een vliegtuig met 35 stoelen meer dan de E190 die zij voorheen vlogen, dat je die stoelen erbij krijgt zonder meer brandstof te verbranden. Dat is dus CO2-neutrale groei. Die stap vormt voor ons de eerste prioriteit.’

Een beperkte hoeveelheid

Een andere prioriteit van Embraer is vliegen op Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). De Braziliaanse vliegtuigbouwer streeft ernaar nog voor het einde van het huidige decennium hetzelfde resultaat te bereiken met haar verkeersvliegtuigen, zodat de airlines met volledig recyclebare brandstof kunnen gaan vliegen. ‘Vooralsnog zijn onze vliegtuigen gecertificeerd voor het tanken van maximaal vijftig procent SAF’, licht Arjan toe. De verkrijgbaarheid van SAF is echter nog zeer gering. Hoewel de productie de afgelopen jaren steeg, blijft de wereldwijde beschikbaarheid van SAF nog altijd relatief klein vergeleken met de totale vraag naar vliegtuigbrandstof.

Voor SAF zijn er verschillende productieroutes met verschillende grondstoffen, waaronder frituurvet, reststoffen uit de land- en bosbouw, stedelijk afval en bepaalde gewassen zoals huttentut, algen en moerasgassen. ‘Daar kan je maar een beperkte hoeveelheid mee produceren, zegt Arjan. ‘Aan de andere kant van het spectrum kan je echter ook brandstof maken door groene energie om te zetten in waterstof, en de waterstof vervolgens weer om te zetten in groene brandstof, ook wel eSAF genoemd. Alleen is dat wel een zeer kostbare manier om SAF te maken.’

Bepaald eenvoudig is het dus allemaal niet. In relatie met alle genoemde alternatieven voor de huidige traditionele straalmotoren die uiteindelijk uitstekend zullen kunnen presteren op SAF, kijkt Embraer ook naar hybride vormen. Arjan: ‘Het brandstofgebruik zou bijvoorbeeld verder omlaag gebracht kunnen worden door wat meer gebruik te maken van batterijen. Maar voordat je bij ons segment met waterstof en batterijen aan de slag kunt gaan…’ Hij fronst zijn wenkbrauwen en zegt dan: ‘Met onze projecties kijken we richting laat 2040, wellicht zelfs richting 2050.’

Je kunt heel veel doen

Het gesprek komt terug op E2-serie. Veelvliegers zal het niet ontgaan dat de verkeersvliegtuigen die Embraer levert, in vergelijking met de andere small narrow-body’s van binnen ruimtelijker overkomen. Arjan: ‘Wij zeggen wel: de E2 heeft de ruimte op de juiste plek. De rompen van al onze E-jets bestaan uit een double bubble, dus het is geen cirkelronde of ovale buis, zoals dat bijvoorbeeld het geval is bij de Boeing 737, Airbus A320 of Bombardier CRJ. Ons ontwerp voorkomt dat je bij een raamplaats met je schouder tegen een vliegtuigwand zit. Het betekent ook dat er op de plek waar je benen zitten, relatief veel ruimte is. Daarbij komt nog dat de poten van de stoelen aan de raamkant zich deels op de binnenzijkant van het vliegtuig bevinden in plaats van op de vloer. Dat geeft ook meer ruimte voor extra bagage. Omdat er bij onze twee aan twee-configuratie geen middenstoelen zijn, blijft bovendien het benauwde gevoel uit dat je krijgt als je aan beide kanten iemand naast je hebt zitten.’

‘Ook de introductie van de SlimSeat, een lichtere en dunnere stoel, brengt extra comfort. Deze stoel geeft de passagier ongeveer 1.5 inch extra beenruimte. Verder hebben onze E-jets grote ramen, veertig procent groter dan van de Airbus A320. Dat geeft veel meer licht. En dankzij het ontwerp van de side panels lijken de ramen nog groter dan dat ze feitelijk zijn. Uiteraard zijn nu ook de bagagebakken vergroot, zodat een rolkoffer er gedraaid, wheels first, in kan en je er daardoor veel meer kunt bergen. Je kunt echt heel veel doen in zo’n vliegtuig, niet alleen door te spelen met ruimtes maar ook met optische illusies.’

Yoke en sidestick

De yoke, die overigens met de bull-vormgeving aan de yoke van de Concorde herinnert, is wel behouden. ‘De ene piloot heeft meer voorkeur voor de sidestick, de andere voor de yoke’, zegt Arjan. ‘Het feit dat we nog steeds een yoke hebben op de E2 heeft alles te maken met de pilot commonality die we wilden houden tussen de oude en nieuwe generatie E-Jets. Daardoor kunnen luchtvaartmaatschappijen als KLM, Helvetic en Azul, die als E1-operator de E2 in hun vloot hebben verwelkomd, beide machines door elkaar vliegen op dagelijkse basis. Dat scheelt niet alleen geld qua planningsefficiency en uitvoerbaarheid, maar ook qua impact op vertragingen en daarmee dus op de klant. Maar wij leveren inmiddels ook vliegtuigen met sidesticks, waaronder de Legacy en de KC-390.’

KC-390 omarmd

Niet alleen op het gebied van verkeersvliegtuigen en zakenjets doet Embraer goede zaken. Hetzelfde geldt voor hun militaire paradepaardje, de KC-390, ontwikkeld voor het transport van militairen en het bijtanken van vliegtuigen in de lucht. ‘Op dit gebied doet Joāo Bosco, mijn collega van de business unit Defensie & Security, de zaken met klanten’, zegt Arjan. ‘In eerste instantie is dit vliegtuig, dat in samenspraak met de Braziliaanse luchtmacht is ontwikkeld, alleen verkocht in Brazilië. Maar we zien nu dat het toestel echt omarmd wordt in de rest van de wereld. In Europa maakt het een opmars maar ook inmiddels in Azië, in Zuid-Korea. In oktober 2023 nam de Portugese luchtmacht, de FAP, als eerste afnemer buiten Brazilië, hun eerste KC-390 Millenium in ontvangst, een NATO-variant. De Nederlandse Luchtmacht, de KLu, heeft er ook vijf in bestelling. Verder hebben we in Europa verkocht aan Oostenrijk, Tsjechië en Hongarije. Door Zweden is het vliegtuig al wel geselecteerd maar er is nog geen contract afgesloten.’

Vrachtversies

In 2022 kondigde Embraer de vrachtversies aan van de E190 en E195. De toestellen moeten een alternatief bieden voor oudere vrachtvliegtuigen in het tien tot vijftien ton cargosegment om daarmee in te spelen op de groeiende vraag naar E-commerce en gedecentraliseerde logistiek. Arjan: ‘We zien dat de E-jets ouder worden en dat het voor vrachtmaatschappijen, met name als ze minder uren draaien met vliegtuigen, zinniger is met een gebruikt vliegtuig te opereren dan met een nieuw. Omdat van de E190 meer exemplaren gebouwd zijn dan van de E195, is allereerst gestart met het ontwikkelen van een conversie op de E190.’

‘Het eerste toestel waarin zowel een gat is gemaakt als een cargosysteem is aangebracht, is nu gecertificeerd. Terwijl het tweede op dit moment wordt omgebouwd, zijn we met klanten actief bezig om deze variant ook in de markt te zetten. Dit nieuwe concept heeft voor onszelf als voordeel dat onze vliegtuigen langer gaan doorvliegen en dus ook langer omzet genereren voor onze service en support. Ook voor de airlines met een cargotak kan dit attractief zijn omdat deze configuratie de mogelijkheid biedt met een machine in de eigen operatie langer door te vliegen. De E195F hebben we echter voorlopig gepauzeerd. Gezien de veel grotere feed-stock van de E190, er zijn er immers veel meer van gebouwd, en de grote recente vraag naar gebruikte E195’s, hebben we besloten vooralsnog te focussen op de vrachtversie van de E190.’

Behoorlijk timmeren

In 2018 ging het nieuws de wereld over dat Boeing Embraer gedeeltelijk zou overnemen. ‘Die overname is in 2019 door de Braziliaanse overheid geblokkeerd omdat ze niet wilden dat hun defensie in handen kwam van een ander land’, vertelt Arjan. ‘Boeing stond toen op het standpunt enkel nog onze business unit Commercial Aviation te kopen. Maar in 2020 besloot Boeing de deal af te blazen. Inmiddels zijn we weer vijf jaar verder, is de Commercial Aviation helemaal geïntegreerd en zijn we heel blij met waar we nu staan. We hebben een heel sterke portfolio, Defensie en Executive draaien nu ook uitzonderlijk goed en vorig jaar had Embraer de hoogste revenu’s in haar hele loopbaan van 55 jaar. Voor de markt is dit niet onopgemerkt gebleven want als je naar de aandelenkoers kijkt zie je dat die van ongeveer vier dollar in 2020 gegroeid is naar meer dan vijftig dollar. We timmeren behoorlijk aan de weg.’

Vloot verbreed

Met gepaste trots stelt Arjan: ‘Sinds 2000 heeft Embraer meer dan twintig volledig nieuwe modellen in de markt gezet, dat is ongeveer elk jaar één. Tussen onze verschillende engineering teams, die over de platformen van de vier business units heen werken, wordt voortdurend kennis met elkaar ontwikkeld, uitgewisseld en geïmplementeerd.’ Ter illustratie noemt hij het fly-by-wire-systeem: ‘De eerste generatie zat op de E-jets, de tweede op de Executive, de derde op de KC-390 en de vierde op de E2.’ Opnieuw vestigt Arjan de aandacht op de E-jet E2-familie. ‘De kleinste 737 MAX 7 vertoont evenals de A220-familie wel enige overlap met onze E-jet E2-familie. Logisch dus dat wij die machines tegenkomen in onze discussies met klanten. Maar inmiddels blijkt wel dat niet alleen wij, maar ook steeds meer airlines, de E2 als small narrow-body duidelijk zien als een vliegtuig dat echt iets toevoegt aan de grotere narrow body’s en dat de vloot er dus uitstekend mee kan worden verbreed.’ Dat Arjan het reuze naar zijn zin heeft bij Embraer behoeft verder geen betoog.",https://i0.wp.com/www.upinthesky.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Arjan-Meijer-Executive-Photo-scaled.jpg?fit=1500%2C1000&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-31 15:56:47.505995

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to independently develop bio-jet fuel technology. This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions by about 80%, compared with conventional jet fuel.

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

IAG sustainability head Jonathon Counsell said that investing in SAF early would give the group a “competitive advantage” over its rivals.
SAF can cost anywhere between two and seven times the price of standard jet fuel.
It is claimed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel.","Executives from parent company IAG last week held a low-key summit with investors where it was revealed that the group is currently paying less than 60 per cent of the market rate for SAF. This followed IAG’s high-stakes decision to enter into a glut of “take or pay” long-term contracts with suppliers that are up to 14 years in length.

For new green fuel suppliers, this provides a degree of certainty over their profits. This is because if IAG decides not to “take” the fuel, it would be obliged to “pay” a certain amount instead. For the suppliers, this certainty allows them to unlock financing to scale up projects.

• BA cancels private jet flights perk after greenwashing criticism

The benefit for early adopters such as IAG, meanwhile, is that they can lock in SAF prices at a hefty discount to market rate.

IAG sustainability head Jonathon Counsell said that investing in SAF early would give the group a “competitive advantage” over its rivals. It has committed $3.5 billion to its SAF programme over more than a decade.

SAF can cost anywhere between two and seven times the price of standard jet fuel. It is made in a range of ways: from extracting bioethanol from waste materials, to combining carbon dioxide with green hydrogen. It is claimed to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel.

In the UK, rules state that 2 per cent of jet fuel must be SAF this year, rising to 10 per cent by 2030, and 22 per cent by 2040. The EU mandate works differently, but similarly stipulates a 2 per cent quota this year, rising to 6 per cent in 2030 and 34 per cent by 2040.

• Eco-friendly flights? That’s fuel for thought

Few industry watchers believe IAG’s strategy will reduce fares in the medium to long term; but the hope is that some of the savings of discounted contracts can be passed on to customers.

Like most other airlines, fuel is IAG’s biggest single expense, costing the group €7.6 billion last year. Employee costs, the second largest expense, were €6.4 billion.

IAG executives said that increases in the SAF mandate each year would also benefit the FTSE 100 group by making it hard for new airlines to start up, analysts said. This will lead to merger and acquisition opportunities, they added.

Dakota Spirit AgEnergy produces clean-burning ethanol from corn in addition to distillers grains and corn oil, according to Harvestone Low Carbon Partners, which owns Dakota Spirit.

Zueger said the rate that Dakota Spirit AgEnergy converts corn into ethanol has increased to an average of over 3 gallons per bushel in 2024. Ethanol production has increased by over 20%, rising from 68 million gallons in 2016 to more than 83 million gallons in 2024.

“That's been one of our objectives is to consistently hit above 3 gallons per bushel of ethanol and then incrementally continue to grow corn oil yield at the site because those are a couple of the higher value products,” he said.

Zueger said the corn oil yield has increased to above 1 pound per bushel.

“The corn oil, for example, started off at less than a half a pound per bushel, and today we're getting over a pound per bushel, so pretty significant change in corn oil production at the site, and that's been a continued focus of the team,” he said.

The corn oil produced at Dakota Spirit is used as a feedstock for renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel.

Dakota Spirit has been online for 10 years at the Spiritwood Energy Park Association’s industrial park at Spiritwood. Dakota Spirit received its first delivery of corn from area farmers on May 28, 2015.

“I think it's a tremendous accomplishment for the team out there and also for the community,” Zueger said.

Corry Shevlin, CEO of Jamestown/Stutsman Development Corp., said Dakota Spirit AgEnergy is a “terrific” tenant partner of the SEPA industrial Park and JSDC. Dakota Spirit AgEnergy was the first tenant in the SEPA industrial park.

“They do a pretty incredible job,” he said.

He said Dakota Spirit is a community-based project.

“Spiritwood Energy Park is a development effort in cooperation with Jamestown/Stutsman Development Corporation and originally Great River Energy, and now we're partners in SEPA alongside JSDC so without that community component, this project may not have happened,” Zueger said. “The whole energy park concept was important to getting the project developed and built.”

Since Dakota Spirit AgEnergy came online in 2015, it has produced over 694 million gallons of denatured ethanol and nearly 24 million gallons of corn oil, the company said. The denatured ethanol contributes to U.S. energy independence, and corn oil is a valuable co-product used for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, the company said.

Dakota Spirit AgEnergy has processed more than 235 million bushels of locally-grown corn and purchases an average of 23 million bushels of corn annually, the company said. Corn usage has expanded by 21%, growing from 24 million bushels in 2016 to 28 million bushels in 2024.

“I think that's really important to the region and to farmers by improving corn basis, having a consistent day-in, day-out market as opposed to trying to export the product to other markets outside of North Dakota or significantly transporting it elsewhere,” Zueger said. “I think anytime you can locate a processing facility like Dakota Spirit that will consume 28 million bushels of corn a year, that is obviously very positive for farming in the area, positive for corn growers and positively supports just kind of the overall ag commodity platform because of those acres being committed to growing the crop. That's a feedstock for our production process.”

Dakota Spirit also produces feed products. Zueger said local cattle and dairy farmers purchase feed from Dakota Spirit AgEnergy.

Dakota Spirit supports feeding approximately 180,000 cattle per year through byproduct utilization.

“We believe that feed is high quality and that they get a very good value in that purchase and that transaction,” Zueger said.

He said about 80% of Dakota Spirit AgEnergy’s feed product is exported primarily by rail to mostly the western U.S.

“Those dollars keep turning in the community,” Zueger said, referring to value-added ag processing products. “Then at that point, you continue to build the economy, the regional and local economy.”

Shevlin said it is good when a company can add value to agricultural products in the state, Jamestown and Stutsman County.

“Their impact on our economy is pretty tremendous,” he said.

Zueger said Dakota Spirit is focusing on advancing carbon capture and storage at its site. Using energy coming from Spiritwood Station allows Dakota Spirit to use a lower carbon intensity for the fuel it produces.

“As we advance carbon capture and storage at the site, it will further lower the carbon intensity of the fuel that we produce, thereby enabling it to hit low carbon fuel markets throughout North America and throughout the world and also be attractive for sustainable aviation fuel production,” he said. “When we lower the carbon intensity to near-zero carbon intensity, it becomes a very attractive product to either incent a sustainable aviation fuel project in the region that would further refine that into staff or allow us to serve markets that are higher value to ensure long-term sustainability for our facility.”

Zueger said Dakota Spirit’s plan is to capture biogenic carbon dioxide released from its production process and permanently sequester and store it. He said that plan further removes carbon dioxide from the climate and environment.

Dakota Spirit has about 45 full-time employees, Zueger said.

He said those employees are offered a voluntary time-off program to volunteer at an organization of their choice.

“We think that that's really important in supporting our communities,” Zueger said. “It is saying we're going to pay these folks as if they're at the site, and we're going to encourage them to go and participate in the community.”

He said Dakota Spirit sends information to its employees about opportunities where they can volunteer.

“I think our team has done a tremendous job participating in those kinds of events that help support community needs,” he said.

Zueger also said Dakota Spirit AgEnergy supports requests for donations when they align with the company’s objectives as well as community growth and promotion of good family and business partnerships.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/44101d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1112+0+0/resize/1917x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Ff6%2Fcff605c746bfbeb097f4b5888f7a%2Fdakota-spirit-one-052825.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 08:56:14.228754

In it, they argue £15 billion of private sector investment is ready to be deployed, creating 20,000 jobs for the area and safeguarding one in 10 existing jobs in the area.

According to the signatories, the Humber has the potential to become a world leader in industrial decarbonisation, with huge potential for growth in sectors like AI, advanced manufacturing, and sustainable aviation fuel, if the region receives the necessary government backing for CCS.

Further, it argues the Humber's geographic advantage, with access to over 60 per cent of the UK's licensed carbon storage sites, makes it a key player in the UK's ambition to become a ""clean energy superpower.""

They claim that with CCS, hydrogen, and the expansion of offshore wind, the region could cut emissions by as much as 80 per cent.

Sanctioning the project is the ""first step"" in delivering a sustainable economic future for the region, they say, before stressing the urgency of the situation, warning delays in government decision-making are stalling investment and hindering workforce development.

Richard Gwilliam is the chairman of the Humber Energy Board, and said: “As the country’s biggest industrial cluster, the Humber can lead the UK in generating economic growth while delivering high value regional infrastructure to support the large-scale decarbonisation.

“Transforming the Humber into a world-leading net zero industrial economy will attract new industries to the region, drawn by the prospect of a skilled workforce, abundant development land, robust infrastructure and high-quality education and training.

“Now is the time for the government to support our plans.

“In doing so, we can strengthen and accelerate their clean energy mission, prevent deindustrialisation, protect jobs and create new opportunities in the Humber.”

EOG Resources’ $5.6 billion acquisition of Encino Acquisition Partners shocked the market after it was announced on May 30, but analysts expect investors to come around once they evaluate the assets and the opportunity.

“We believe investors will warm up to the deal as they assess the scale and benefits EOG can extract over a 1.1 million net-acre position in Ohio,” said Tim Rezvan at KeyBanc Capital Markets.

Investors showed little immediate reaction to the purchase from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Encino Energy. By early afternoon, EOG’s stock was down about $1 at $108.98 per share.

The deal, expected to close in the second half of this year, is 10% accretive on an annualized basis to EOG’s 2025 earnings and 9% accretive on an annualized basis for both cash flow from operations and free cash flow, Chairman and CEO Ezra Yacob told investors during a conference call following the announcement.

“After closing, we will continue to have the strongest balance sheet in our peer group underscoring our relentless focus on capital discipline,” he said.

CPP and Encino established EAP in 2017 to acquire high quality oil and gas assets with an established base of production in mature basins across the Lower 48.

“We are pleased with EAP’s success and the strong returns this investment has delivered,” said Bill Rogers, head of sustainable energies at CPP.

The investment group is active globally and holds net assets worth some $26.4 billion (CA$36.3 billion).

EOG’s acquisition has industrial logic, Rezvan said, given the price and the contiguous acreage. Likely year-end leverage of 0.3x is manageable.

“There has been marketplace chatter about Encino’s owners seeking an exit strategy for several years, and EOG is one of a few operators to be able to digest a $5.6 billion acquisition,” he said.

Leo Mariani, managing director at Roth Capital Energy Group, estimated EOG paid about $5,000 per undeveloped acre for Encino, assuming a price close to $15,000 per flowing boe for production with more than half of Encino’s acreage undeveloped.

“This is a good value, in our opinion, compared to what others have recently paid for more competitive basins in North America,” he said.

“However, the basin is still in the early days of proving out the competitiveness of the volatile oil window with other premier shale plays.”

Rezvan, an admitted bull on Utica Shale productivity, noted some market reticence about the play. He said more data points should improve the sentiment.

“The combination of attractive pricing, overlapping acreage and a thoughtful marketing portfolio from Encino all validate the acquisition to us. Lastly, EOG’s low cost of capital and ability to use scale to drive down well costs should not be overlooked as tangible synergies,” Rezvan said.

This time last year, KeyBanc produced a deep dive on the Utica, highlighting EOG’s increasing activity there. In June 2024, about 577 wells had been drilled in the play, and KeyBanc said it would be “premature to judge a play, especially with an O.G. shale operator like EOG Resources entering” and stepping up activity.

The analysts leaned in on well data and found promising results.

“Clients have been skeptical that high initial oil cuts in the volatile oil window of the Utica hold up, with some dismissive comments that oil cuts ‘fall off a cliff,’” Rezvan wrote.

“Our work refutes that bear-case thesis. We see decline rates that compare favorably with those from four other oily shale plays, which we believe debunks the bear case on EOG’s ongoing Utica development.”

Loaded for bear

EOG doesn’t crave the spotlight, its leadership doesn’t jump on bandwagons or trends and the company rarely releases flashy headlines. EOG was noticeably absent from the consolidation frenzy of late 2023 and throughout 2024. Rather, the company has steadily built its diverse footprint, making bolt-on deals for congruent acreage that, in recent years, have positioned them to make a strong case for organic growth.

“Our ability to execute on the Encino acquisition without diluting our shareholders is a textbook example of how EOG utilizes its industry-leading balance sheet to take advantage of countercyclical opportunities to enhance the returns of our business and create long-term value for our shareholders,” Yacob said.

EOG’s last big foray into M&A was in 2016 when the firm bought Yates Petroleum, which more than doubled its presence in the Permian Basin and expanded its Powder River Basin acreage. The $2.5 billion cash-and-stock transaction increased EOG’s Delaware position by 78% to 424,000 net acres, including 86,000 net acres of stacked pay in New Mexico with prospects in the Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Leonard shale formations.

EOG stood out for its silence in 2024 when many public independents—including Diamondback Energy, Coterra Energy and Devon Energy—acquired private producers. By year-end, upstream M&A reached $105 billion, the third highest total tracked by Enverus.

“The transaction answers a long-running question in the industry of if and when EOG would finally commit to a significant acquisition,” said Andrew Dittmar, principal analyst at Enverus Intelligence Research.

Including Occidental Petroleum’s 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, since 2020 EOG’s large-cap peers ConocoPhillips, Diamondback Energy and Oxy have actively consolidated ownership in key U.S. unconventional plays, spending more than $140 billion in the process, he said.

“EOG has stayed firm … in its commitment to organic resource expansion and a focus on its core assets acquired in the early innings of shale,” Dittmar said. “While there is virtue in not pursuing increasingly expensive M&A transactions, it also risked EOG falling behind as undrilled high-quality inventory became increasingly scarce. Successfully executing on large-scale organic resource potential likewise became increasingly challenging as the major plays were discovered and delineated.”

Charles Mead, a Johnson Rice analyst, noted the similarities between the Yates and Encino deals during a conference call following the announcement on May 30. Specifically, both acquisitions targeted a private company in an emerging play.

Yacob confirmed that both transactions are consistent with EOG’s strategy.

“We’ve always talked about the way that we value [deals], whether it’s organic leasing, small bolt-on acquisitions or in this case, a transformative deal,” he said. “We view it through a returns lens, and so oftentimes that makes transactions in established basins a little bit less competitive with our existing portfolio because we’ve built so many things on a low cost-of-entry. Right off the bat, that steers you into potential transactions in emerging assets.”

Moreover, Yacob said, EOG has taken the time to develop relationships and a reputation that supports private negotiating.

“Similar to Yates, the relationship between Encino and EOG has been growing over the last couple of years since we’ve been involved in the basin, [and we] see a lot of similarities and alignments between the two companies.”",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/05/eog-resources.jpg?itok=CQwP6bbr,N,,2025-05-31 09:57:27.633784

The facility announced May 29 will be just south of PIT's terminal and is expected to dramatically enhance access to low-carbon jet fuel for commercial and cargo carriers operating in the region.

While other SAF plants operate elsewhere, PIT's facility situated just south of the terminal will be the first integrated within a major airport's infrastructure.

The facility will use KBR's PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology, developed by Swedish Biofuels and globally licensed by KBR, converting renewable alcohol into jet fuel that meets ASTM certification and global sustainability standards.

KBR's PureSAF technology is an alcohol-to-jet process that converts various feedstocks, including bioethanol, syngas and carbon dioxide, into sustainable aviation fuel.

In addition to processing ethanol, this technology can also convert mixed alcohols, carbon dioxide and synthesis gas to SAF, creating pathways for utilizing captured carbon usage.

""This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,"" Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said. ""With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.""

The process is a low-cost industrial-scale process that produces jet fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel, making it fully fungible. This technology is particularly attractive for its ability to utilize a wide range of feedstocks, including waste biomass and biogenic CO2.

Through multiple development phases, the facility is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually, helping to significantly reduce the aviation sector's carbon footprint.

Much lower carbon intensity

The SAF produced at PIT will have a carbon intensity at least 65% lower than conventional jet fuel, according to project estimates, contributing meaningfully to the industry's decarbonization goals.

""KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it on-site at the airport,"" Hari Ravindran, KBR's Global SVP for Technology, said. ""PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) technology is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.""

The PIT-Avina initiative aligns with broader efforts across the aviation sector to cut emissions and build resilient fuel infrastructure. As airlines face increasing regulatory and market pressure to decarbonize, projects like this may define the next generation of airport operations and fuel logistics in the US.

Construction is set to begin soon, with phased rollout expected to support regional airline partners and national SAF supply chain expansion.

This landmark gathering arrives after a forty-two year hiatus, signaling a dramatic return of global aviation leadership to one of the world’s fastest-growing air travel markets.

But why now? And why India?

As aviation leaders from across the world prepare to land in New Delhi, anticipation is building. The eighty-first AGM isn’t just another annual meeting—it’s a symbol of India’s rising influence in global air transport.

With major developments underway in infrastructure, sustainability, and connectivity, this event is poised to reshape discussions far beyond the boardroom.

Will this World Air Transport Summit redefine the industry’s next chapter?

Or will this forty-two year wait mark a turning point not just for India, but for the future of aviation itself?

The sky, it seems, is just the beginning.

A Skyward Shift: India Welcomes the World as Global Aviation Leaders Gather for IATA AGM and WATS in New Delhi

After a long 42-year gap, the global aviation industry is once again turning its focus toward India. From June 1–3, 2025, New Delhi will host the 81st IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) and the World Air Transport Summit (WATS)—a seismic moment for both India’s aviation sector and the global travel community.

This isn’t just another conference. It’s a declaration. A statement that India’s aviation industry has arrived—not as a developing player, but as a global force reshaping the skies.

More than 1,700 participants, including airline CEOs, government officials, financial leaders, and media professionals, are expected to descend on the Indian capital. The host airline? IndiGo, India’s aviation juggernaut and the region’s most influential low-cost carrier.

A Historic Return with Global Significance

The last time India hosted an IATA AGM was in 1983. Since then, the landscape has changed dramatically. Today, India is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world, with record-breaking aircraft orders, cutting-edge airport infrastructure, and booming passenger demand.

This return is far more than symbolic. It’s recognition of India’s meteoric rise as a vital aviation hub—not just for domestic travel, but for international connectivity and innovation.

Hosting the 81st IATA AGM in 2025 affirms India’s position at the center of global aviation dialogue.

All Eyes on India’s Aviation Engine

The timing couldn’t be more perfect. India’s aviation sector is booming on all fronts. The industry directly employs over 369,000 people and contributes $5.6 billion to the nation’s GDP. When including indirect, induced, and tourism effects, that number soars to $53.6 billion, supporting over 7.7 million jobs.

As aviation drives economic development, job creation, and cross-border connectivity, India is clearly becoming one of the most crucial players in shaping the industry’s future.

Meanwhile, IndiGo, serving as the host airline, stands at the forefront of this transformation. With the largest fleet and widest reach in the country, IndiGo symbolizes India’s evolving aviation story—agile, ambitious, and undeniably global.

WATS 2025: Spotlight on Challenges and Solutions

Immediately following the AGM, the World Air Transport Summit (WATS) will open dialogue on the pressing issues facing the aviation world.

This year’s agenda is laser-focused on economic pressures, geopolitical shifts, energy transitions, and net-zero goals. It also tackles rising concerns around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the cost of payments, and the evolving role of Chief Operating Officers in steering operational strategy amid constant turbulence.

One of the most anticipated sessions is the CEO Panel, moderated by CNN’s Richard Quest, featuring high-caliber names like:

Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo

Joanna Geraghty, CEO of JetBlue

Adrian Neuhauser, CEO of Abra Group

Richard Smith, COO International and CEO Airline of FedEx

This powerhouse panel will examine how airline leaders are responding to volatile demand cycles, shifting global regulations, and the never-ending challenge of modernization.

The Big Themes: Growth, Sustainability, Innovation

India’s own aviation expansion will be a central theme. Topics will explore how the country is strategically using aviation to accelerate national development, connect underserved regions, and create inclusive access to global opportunities.

Also under the microscope is the energy transformation sweeping aviation, especially the production and scalability of sustainable aviation fuel. India’s role as both a producer and adopter of SAF will likely influence global supply chains and cost structures moving forward.

Another major highlight is the urgent conversation around financing net-zero aviation. With climate commitments tightening and consumer awareness growing, airlines must now find sustainable business models that align with environmental targets.

Inclusion Takes the Stage

This year’s event also puts a powerful spotlight on diversity and inclusion, with the sixth edition of the IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards. These honors recognize individuals and organizations making measurable strides in gender balance and equity across aviation.

Through initiatives like 25by2025, IATA and its member airlines are working toward creating a more inclusive, representative industry—from cockpit to boardroom.

This focus on social progress within an industry often seen as traditionally rigid signals a new era for aviation leadership—one rooted in people, purpose, and potential.

Why This Matters Globally

The aviation industry stands at a pivotal crossroads. Mounting costs, evolving traveler expectations, and accelerating environmental demands have forced a reckoning. The IATA AGM and WATS offer a space to regroup, realign, and recommit to innovation and cooperation.

India, as the host, represents what’s possible when an aviation market is given room to thrive. Its success story is one of balancing scale with agility, policy with progress, and ambition with accountability.

By holding this landmark event in New Delhi, the global aviation community will see firsthand how India is becoming a model—not just for growth, but for resilience and reinvention.

A Defining Moment in Aviation History

For three days in June, New Delhi becomes the world’s aviation capital. Every keynote, every panel, every meeting will shape the trajectory of how we fly, where we fly, and why we fly.

India will not just welcome the world—it will help guide it forward.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__17640-1.jpeg,N,,2025-05-31 08:56:36.394974

Egypt’s Minister of Civil Aviation, Sameh El-Hefny, has described civil aviation as a strategic pillar for strengthening economic and cultural integration across Africa. Speaking during the 10th edition of the AFI Aviation Week 2025 held in Zimbabwe, El-Hefny reaffirmed Egypt’s commitment to boosting continental co-operation in air safety, aviation security, infrastructure development, and capacity-building – all within the framework of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

El-Hefny said the gathering reflected Africa’s shared commitment to advancing its aviation industry and positioning it as a driver of sustainable economic growth.

Alongside pilot Amr El-Sharkawy, head of Egypt’s Civil Aviation Authority, the minister took part in a high-level coordination meeting of African civil aviation directors, held with the participation of the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC). Discussions focused on sector-wide challenges, including enhancing operational efficiency, aligning with ICAO’s strategic goals, and launching new initiatives to boost air safety, improve airport services and modernise air navigation infrastructure.

Delegates also explored feasibility studies and commercial implementation mechanisms for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), seen as a key tool in reducing aviation’s environmental impact.

On the sidelines of the event, El-Hefny participated in the 28th Steering Committee meeting of the AFI Plan (Regional Implementation Plan for Aviation Safety in Africa), as well as the 14th meeting of the AFI SECFAL Plan (Security and Facilitation). Both sessions reviewed regional strategies to enhance safety and security while addressing emerging threats and improving compliance with international standards.

The Egyptian minister welcomed the proposal to merge the regional APIRG (Planning and Implementation Group) and RASG-AFI (Regional Aviation Safety Group for Africa), saying it would foster stronger coordination and improve safety outcomes continent-wide.

Egypt, El-Hefny added, has already taken tangible steps to localise the production of SAF, launching a project aligned with international environmental standards. The country aims to become a regional leader in the production and application of sustainable aviation fuels.

El-Hefny said Egypt’s SAF initiative reflects the country’s broader goal of building a climate-friendly aviation sector and reducing the industry’s carbon footprint.

During the forum, the minister also held a bilateral meeting with Zimbabwe’s Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, Felix Tapiwa Mhona. The pair discussed potential co-operation on technical training, airport development, aviation safety, and knowledge exchange.

El-Hefny stressed that Egypt prioritises regional air connectivity as a vital pillar of development and integration, and is keen to support African nations through strategic training and partnerships.

His Zimbabwean counterpart praised Egypt’s technical expertise and longstanding role in the African aviation sector, saying Zimbabwe is eager to enhance co-operation with Cairo in various aviation-related fields.

AFI Aviation Week – held annually under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and in coordination with the African Civil Aviation Commission — is the largest annual gathering of the civil aviation community in Africa. This year’s edition drew more than 400 participants, including top aviation officials, international organisations and industry experts.

The event comes ahead of ICAO’s 42nd General Assembly in September, where Egypt is seeking re-election to the ICAO Council. Cairo’s presence at the summit was widely seen as part of its campaign to reaffirm its leading role in shaping global aviation policy.",https://egyptian-gazette.com/media/2025/05/bf8757d8-7aa5-4294-a620-21a84df7415b-1024x683.webp,N,,2025-05-31 01:56:34.196689

This collaboration underscores the growing influence of SAF from the Chinese Mainland in the global aviation fuel supply chain and promotes green aviation in Asia.

Use of Certified Sustainable Aviation Fuel from Sinopec

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by Sinopec’s Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport. ZRCC, a leader in SAF manufacturing in Asia, converts used cooking oil into bio-jet fuel using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. The batch is certified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), indicating an 80% reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel made from renewable or waste materials that significantly reduces carbon emissions. This initiative with Sinopec strengthens the cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in developing a sustainable SAF supply chain.

Expanding SAF Use in the Region

Cathay Pacific’s General Manager of Sustainability, Grace Cheung, highlighted that the partnership goes beyond fuel supply, aiming to expand SAF production and use regionally. The airline supports increased adoption of SAF to reduce fossil fuel dependency.

Previously, Cathay Pacific uplifted SAF sourced from the Chinese Mainland at airports outside Hong Kong, including Amsterdam and London. This latest project marks the first SAF use on flights departing directly from Hong Kong International Airport.

Regional Collaborations to Boost SAF Supply

The adoption of SAF is gaining traction across Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific signed an agreement with South Korean fuel supplier SK Energy to supply SAF from 2025 to 2027. This collaboration illustrates the airline’s commitment to diversifying its sustainable fuel sources throughout Asia.

Aligning with Climate Goals and Regulations

This SAF initiative supports Hong Kong’s Climate Action Plan 2050 and the aviation industry’s global carbon reduction targets. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) also highlights SAF as key to achieving emission goals.

Environmental Benefits of SAF Adoption

The aviation sector contributes about 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). SAF offers a low-carbon alternative by converting waste products like used cooking oil into fuel, thus supporting circular economy practices and substantially reducing emissions.

Government Support and Policy Framework

Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department promotes cleaner fuels under its Cleaner Air Plan. Meanwhile, China’s national policies under the 14th Five-Year Plan encourage biofuel production, positioning Sinopec as a vital player in the green energy transition.

Strengthening Public-Private Cooperation

The Cathay Pacific-Sinopec partnership exemplifies cooperation between industry and government to develop a sustainable SAF supply chain, addressing challenges related to production scaling and certification.

Future Outlook: Scaling Up SAF Usage

Cathay Pacific aims to increase SAF’s share in its fuel mix to meet its 2050 net-zero target. The airline is investing in technology and partnerships to support broader SAF adoption, reinforcing Hong Kong International Airport’s role as an eco-friendly aviation hub.

Commitment to a Sustainable Aviation Future

Cathay Pacific continues to engage stakeholders across the supply chain to accelerate the shift toward sustainable air travel, investing in innovations that enhance SAF availability and operational efficiency.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/new-app-logo.png,N,,2025-05-31 00:56:10.398771

The tool is designed to help match buyers and sellers more efficiently and improve access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAFc Connect is designed to make the SAF buying process quicker and more flexible for procurement professionals and their organisations.

It allows companies to invest in available SAF while offering suppliers access to active corporate demand.

SABA says its members currently have a combined demand of about US$30m for SAF certificates through the platform. That need is predicted to rise as more companies join SABA and increase investments in order to meet their respective 2030 climate targets.

“To meet the decarbonisation goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near and long-term investment into SAF,” says Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of SABA Secretariat.

“With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.”

Six SAFc providers have already joined the platform: Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group (which owns Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL, and Vueling), JetBlue, Targray and Valero.

SABA predicts that more providers will sign up in the coming months.

Connecting procurement teams and sellers seamlessly

SABA began in 2021 with the aim of aggregating buyer demand to help fund SAF.

It started with a small proof-of-concept pilot procurement, moving to a longer-term agreement in 2023–2024 that supported tens of millions of gallons of SAF.

In early May 2025, the group issued a third request for proposals for next-generation fuels – this plan is meant to support 5- to 10-year supply deals large enough to help fund new production sites.

SAFc Connect is the next step in SABA’s effort to connect procurement teams and suppliers.

Through the platform, buyers can view current SAF certificate offers, all checked by SABA.

Each offer includes data such as emissions performance, certification standard, price, feedstock, fuel type and contract terms.

Only authorised buyers can view this data, and all information is kept confidential. Buyers can then contact providers directly to discuss purchase agreements.

Suppliers benefit by gaining access to a group of buyers and their respective organisations already committed to reducing their aviation emissions. The platform will update regularly with new offers and more participants. Its design is intended to support more SAF production and make longer-term pricing more stable.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/aacca13b80f7cb3e094f7099a0340c1a:da26db374d61b2778cdb2392da51b2c7/the-establishment-of-cado-could-jumpstart-the-production-of-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 22:56:07.080299

A new storm is brewing. The Trump trade war is back, and it’s hitting the global airline industry harder than expected. What once seemed like distant political noise is now grounded in the flight plans of major carriers.

The ripple effect is real. Aircraft deals are being reconsidered. Cross-border maintenance contracts face fresh hurdles. Supply chains are tightening. And the once tariff-free aviation world is now entangled in a maze of uncertainty.

IndiGo is seeing pressure on aircraft costs. Air India is reassessing timelines. United, American, and Delta are juggling unpredictable tariffs while watching demand patterns shift. Air Canada, caught between U.S. policy shifts and international routes, is recalibrating too. This isn’t business as usual—this is a calculated race against rising costs and unstable partnerships.

Meanwhile, the global airline industry is trying to adapt. But with the trade war rewriting rules overnight, strategies must pivot fast. Routes, revenues, and relationships are now in the line of fire. The skies may be clear, but beneath the surface, the pressure is building.

So, how is Trump’s trade war really affecting global aviation? What does it mean for the future of flying with IndiGo, Air India, United, American, Delta, and Air Canada? And why should travelers, investors, and governments be paying attention now more than ever?

Strap in. This is the storm behind the headlines—and it’s gaining altitude fast.

The global airline industry has returned to full capacity, but turbulence lies ahead. As airline CEOs and aviation powerhouses converge in New Delhi for the IATA annual summit, the mood is far from celebratory.

Despite post-pandemic recovery gains, the skies ahead are looking stormy. Mounting cost pressures, new geopolitical flashpoints, and looming sustainability failures are threatening to stall the industry’s momentum in 2025.

Passenger Numbers Are Up, But So Are the Challenges

More people are flying than ever. Global air traffic has roared back, with many markets outperforming pre-2020 levels. Airlines in Europe and Asia report strong demand, while India’s aviation sector is on a record-breaking rise.

However, that positive energy is being undercut by urgent realities. Airfare prices are slipping, plane deliveries are delayed, and supply chains remain tangled. Margins are being squeezed from all sides, leaving even top carriers scrambling to balance growth and survival.

Trade War Turbulence Adds New Uncertainty

Just as the skies began to clear, a fresh storm emerged—an unpredictable global trade war, reignited by President Donald Trump’s evolving foreign policy stance.

The once stable, tariff-free aerospace industry is now rattled by sudden changes. Aircraft manufacturers, maintenance hubs, and airline operations across borders are facing new regulatory hurdles and price hikes.

This shift hits especially hard in an era where airlines need every cent saved to afford new aircraft, upgrade fleets, and adopt sustainable fuel.

SAF Supply Crisis Threatens Net-Zero Dream

Another urgent cloud looms: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In 2021, the industry pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with SAF seen as the cornerstone of that effort.

But three years later, progress is slow. In 2024, global SAF production hit only 1 million metric tons—far short of the 1.5 million target. Airlines are willing to pay, but there simply isn’t enough fuel to meet demand. Prices remain steep, and governments are dragging their feet on regulatory support.

Without a massive production breakthrough, airlines may miss climate goals—and lose public trust.

Asia’s Growth Outpaces the West—but Conflict Zones Raise Costs

Asia is soaring, with India leading the way as the world’s third-largest passenger market. The country’s aviation expansion is reshaping the global map. More routes. Bigger fleets. New airports.

Yet growth here comes at a cost. Rising tensions with Pakistan have forced Indian airlines to reroute flights, leading to long detours and increased operational expenses.

Conflict zones like this don’t just affect schedules—they endanger lives and bleed profits. Airlines must now weigh geopolitical risk alongside weather forecasts and fuel efficiency. War zones are no longer distant news—they’re baked into flight planning.

Safety Under Scrutiny After String of Global Incidents

Safety is also under the microscope. Recent air accidents in Kazakhstan, South Korea, and North America have sent shockwaves through the industry.

In the U.S., strained air traffic control systems are under fire. Delays and errors are becoming more frequent, threatening passenger confidence in the world’s largest aviation market.

IATA has flagged conflict-zone risks and outdated infrastructure as urgent concerns needing global coordination. But with governments distracted by political turmoil and economic instability, airlines are left to navigate these threats on their own.

U.S. Airlines Struggle as Travel Demand Slows

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, U.S. carriers are feeling the pressure. Unlike Asia and parts of Europe, America is seeing a slump in travel demand. Consumers are pulling back. Business travel is stalling. Airlines are finding it harder to predict booking patterns or manage costs.

As demand softens and labor costs rise, many U.S. airlines are slashing forecasts and rethinking route networks. Some are holding off on hiring. Others are delaying fleet upgrades. The once rock-solid American aviation sector is now playing defense.

India Takes Center Stage at Critical Moment

India’s hosting of this year’s IATA summit couldn’t be more symbolic. The country is emerging as a global aviation leader, both in passenger volume and airport development.

IndiGo, the summit’s host and India’s largest airline, represents the scale and ambition of the region. Yet even here, caution is creeping in. Fuel costs are rising. Access to aircraft is delayed. And tensions with neighboring states continue to pose real operational risks.

What happens in India this week could shape aviation strategy across continents. Industry players are watching closely for clarity—and collaboration.

Can the Industry Unite to Weather the Storm?

As the summit unfolds, one question hangs in the air: Can the global airline industry unite to overcome these headwinds?

From SAF production bottlenecks to trade war volatility, from geopolitical flashpoints to climate pressure, airlines face more simultaneous threats than ever before. No single carrier or country can navigate this turbulence alone.

Global coordination, regulatory reform, and investment in innovation are urgently needed. But will they arrive in time?

Conclusion: Aviation Enters Its Most Crucial Phase Yet

The airline industry is at a breaking point—and a turning point.

Demand may be strong, but the foundation is shaking. Supply chains, climate targets, international policy, and safety standards are all in flux. The path ahead is filled with unknowns, but one thing is clear: doing nothing is no longer an option.

What unfolds in New Delhi will not stay in New Delhi. The decisions made at this summit could determine whether the next decade of aviation is defined by progress—or by crisis.

For now, airlines must fly through a perfect storm—one decision, one flight, one reform at a time.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pexels-pixabay-358220-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 09:57:30.032357

Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE Chicago is set to bring together procurement and supply chain's finest from across the US and beyond.

The event, set to be co-located with Sustainability LIVE Chicago, will take place at the iconic Convene Willis Tower on 28-29 May.

It marks a watershed moment for BizClik, the UK-based digital media and events company, which began staging in-person events back in September 2021.

Here, Glen White, CEO of BizClik, discusses the remarkable rise of Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE and Sustainability LIVE, while detailing what industry-leading executives can expect from the Chicago event.

The decision to take Procurement & Supply Chain LIVE and Sustainability LIVE to the US for the first time, with Chicago as the chosen destination, wasn't made lightly.

Glen highlights the city's strategic advantages: ""It's central, a great hub for people to come from the east coast as well as the west coast, but it's an industrial heartland of the US.""

The choice has proven a masterstroke, with the Willis Tower event set to attract around 2,000 attendees.

""We have an entire floor with three very distinct stages, Glen continues. ""It's incredible and our team have worked tirelessly to pull this off.""

Parts Town: Why the Future of Supply Chain is Female

The supply chain and distribution industry faces a major talent crunch, but there remains a major untapped talent pool.

Women, despite making up nearly half the workforce overall, remain underrepresented in these roles.

However, companies looking to stay ahead are rethinking how they recruit and retain female talent – and it’s working. More women are stepping into key supply chain roles, breaking stereotypes and helping businesses build a stronger, more resilient future.

Here, Lisa Backlin, Group Vice President of Supply Chain at Parts Town Unlimited, tells Supply Chain Digital how organisations can better attract and retain female talent in their supply chain teams.

Why are women still underrepresented in supply chain and distribution?

There’s still a lingering perception that supply chain is all hard hats and heavy lifting, work traditionally associated with men. Due to that perception, it hasn't been framed as a strategic dynamic field where women can thrive. That's changed dramatically in the last few years, but we've got miles to go.

US Trade Court Blocks Trump Tariffs: What Happens Next?

A US trade court has blocked most of the tariff orders President Donald Trump has issued since taking office in January 2025.

The move could have significant implications on the US president’s controversial trade policy, which has seen import taxes placed on most of the US’s trading partners and steeper reciprocal tariffs placed on nations and blocs including the EU, the UK, Canada, China and Mexico.

On Wednesday 28 May, the Court of International Trade said that the US Constitution gives Congress the exclusive authority to regulate commerce with other countries.

It added that this was not superseded by the president’s emergency powers to safeguard the US economy — the White House had previously imposed tariffs after invoking an emergency law under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

The Trump administration has lodged an appeal against the ruling.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/697340a8bb2a15c5afc2c6274d423a9a:be3bd4c66e8db84e336888675b7c6c50/gw-headshot-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-31 08:56:50.008984

AFCAC Chief: Egypt plays a central role in shaping Africa’s aviation future

By Mohamed Attia

In a move reinforcing Egypt’s leadership role in the African aviation sector, Minister of Civil Aviation Dr. Sameh Al-Hafni held high-level bilateral meetings with top African and international aviation officials during his participation in AFI Aviation Week 2025, held in Zimbabwe.

During his engagements, Dr. Al-Hafni met with Florent Serge Dzotza, President of the African Civil Aviation Commission (AFCAC), and Adefunke Adeyemi, the organization’s Secretary General. The meetings were attended by Pilot Amr El-Sharqawy, President of the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority, and Ambassador Salwa El-Mowafi, Egypt’s ambassador to Zimbabwe.

Central to the discussions was Egypt’s candidacy for membership in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council, ahead of elections scheduled for September during the ICAO’s 42nd General Assembly. The AFCAC leadership expressed strong support for Egypt’s bid, citing its long-standing contributions to regional aviation development and international standards.

Al-Hafni emphasized that Egypt serves as the voice of Africa within ICAO and is committed to fostering an effective African partnership that supports sustainable development and regional integration. He underscored Egypt’s impressive track record in aviation safety, air navigation, and infrastructure modernization, as well as its regional influence.

The discussions also covered mechanisms for enhancing the strategic partnership between Egypt and AFCAC, with a focus on joint initiatives that strengthen coordination and integration in Africa’s aviation sector. Key topics included the African Common Air Transport Market, the Open Skies Initiative among African nations, and the need for harmonized policies to facilitate the free movement of passengers and goods across the continent.

The clean fuels developer has partnered with Pittsburgh International Airport to build and operate what it calls ""the nation's first on-site SAF production facility.""
The Pittsburgh facility will be the first to produce ATJ SAF, followed by a second facility in East Saint Louis, Illinois.
In addition to this pioneering SAF production project, Avina has other great ideas for clean fuel production in the US.
This includes a world-scale clean ammonia facility in Texas and a clean hydrogen production facility in California.","Statistics show that the production levels of this alternative fuel are not nearly enough to meet current and future demands. This has a lot to do with the fact that only a few companies can be considered big SAF producers right now. Neste, a Finland-based supplier, is the current leader, with refineries operating on three continents. It's also gearing up to produce more than 2 million tons of SAF per year by early 2026.

The lack of domestic production makes SAF an expensive alternative to conventional jet fuel, which discourages wider use across the industry. This is why launching and ramping up on-site production is a strategic priority. In this context, Avina's announcement is excellent news. The clean fuels developer has partnered with Pittsburgh International Airport to build and operate what it calls ""the nation's first on-site SAF production facility.""

Here's what we know so far about the future facility: it will be located south of PIT's terminal, it will use an alcohol-to-jet technology to obtain SAF, and production is expected to eventually reach more than 100 million gallons of fuel annually. This quantity is enough to satisfy the needs of commercial and cargo operations at PIT.

It's important to note that the particular technology used at this new facility is almost a premiere for the US. That's because there are multiple ways to obtain SAF, each with specific benefits and disadvantages. As the name suggests, ATJ turns ethanol or methanol into jet fuel, and its biggest advantage is that the resulting fuel is drop-in ready. More specifically, it's certified by ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) as a 100% drop-in replacement fuel.

The ATJ pathway SAF was also tested and validated by DARPA, the US Air Force, and the Swedish Air Force as military jet fuel. Why the Swedish Air Force? Well, because the PureSAF ATJ technology is developed and owned by Swedish Biofuels AB. KBR exclusively licenses this technology worldwide, and Avina will deploy KBR's technology at PIT.

The Pittsburgh facility will be the first to produce ATJ SAF, followed by a second facility in East Saint Louis, Illinois. The first one is due to become operational by 2027, and the second one should be ready by 2028.

In addition to this pioneering SAF production project, Avina has other great ideas for clean fuel production in the US.

To date, Indigo’s carbon program has generated over 900,000 tons of carbon removal across 28 states, and has prevented over 64 billion gallons of surface water runoff.
We conduct extensive due diligence when choosing projects for our portfolio, and are pleased to support this project as part of Microsoft’s broader portfolio of high-quality carbon removal solutions.
The collaboration aims to protect the economic security of our agri-food system with a measurable and scalable approach to nature-based carbon removal.”","Sustainable agriculture and biological solutions provider Indigo Ag and Microsoft announced their second carbon removal agreement, with a new commitment from Microsoft to purchase 60,000 soil carbon credits generated through the promotion of regenerative agriculture practices by U.S. farmers.

The new transaction follows an initial 40,000 carbon credit purchase agreement by the companies last year.

Founded in 2013, Indigo Ag provides nature-based and digital technologies aimed at helping farmers improve profitability and environmental sustainability. The company launched its carbon program in 2019, helping farmers adopt regenerative agriculture practices including cover crops, diversified crop rotation, reduced tillage and improved nitrogen timing, that enrich soil while sequestering carbon dioxide. Under the program, farmers add the new practices with agronomic support from Indigo, while the company also calculates the carbon credits through the use of soil samples and on-farm data, validates the findings with a verifier, with results submitted to a carbon registry, for issuance of the credits, which can be sold to corporate buyers.

The new transaction is sourced from Indigo’s fourth carbon crop, consisting of over half a million independently verified carbon credits issued through the Climate Action Reserve. To date, Indigo’s carbon program has generated over 900,000 tons of carbon removal across 28 states, and has prevented over 64 billion gallons of surface water runoff.

Indigo Ag CEO Dean Banks said:

“When Microsoft, recognized as the major driver behind the carbon removals market, invests in Indigo’s carbon credits, it affirms their confidence in our science, team, and technology. Our microbial and sustainability portfolio spans 20 million acres across 15 countries, and this deal underscores the trust in farmers’ hard work to create a healthy and resilient agri-food system.”

Microsoft is by far the largest corporate buyer of carbon removal credits globally, with the company recently reporting that it contracted nearly 22 million tons of carbon removal last year alone as part of its efforts to become carbon negative by 2030. In just the past few weeks, the company has announced a series of large-scale carbon removal purchases across a broad range of technologies including biochar, forest management, bio-energy carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and reforestation, among others.

Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy and Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said:

“Indigo’s work to create resilient farms and secure watersheds across the U.S. delivers measurable climate benefits as well as improved soil and water health and new economic development opportunities in rural communities. We conduct extensive due diligence when choosing projects for our portfolio, and are pleased to support this project as part of Microsoft’s broader portfolio of high-quality carbon removal solutions.

The 140-MW electrolyzer - a facility that splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen through electricity - is planned to produce up to 23,000 metric tons a year of green hydrogen.

Expected to start production 2027, the project will use wind, solar and hydro power. It would be the biggest European electrolytic facility to produce renewable hydrogen, OMV said. Hydrogen produced through electrolysis that runs on renewable power is called green or renewable.

On June 30 OMV announced the start of production at its first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility, built with a capacity of 1,500 metric tons per annum at its Schwechat refinery near Vienna. The plant uses a 10-MW PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzer powered by hydro, solar and wind energy. The process avoids up to 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year, equivalent to the CO2 consumption of 2,000 persons per year based on a European Union average, according to OMV.

Output from the newly inaugurated facility will be used to decarbonize the refinery and produce more sustainable fuels and chemicals including sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

Martijn van Koten, OMV executive vice president for fuels and chemicals, said of the incoming project, “With this project, we are re-inventing the production of everyday essential fuels and chemical products - a groundbreaking step that demonstrates how industrial innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand”.

“By using green hydrogen in the future, we are making the processes and production of fuels and chemical products more sustainable and are future-proofing our industry.

“Our planned 140 MW electrolysis plant in Bruck an der Leitha will meet a significant share of the hydrogen demand at the OMV Schwechat refinery, reinforcing our role as a pioneer in industrial transformation”.

Also on June 30 OMV and Abu Dhabi Future Energy Co. PJSC (Masdar) said they had signed a letter of intent to collaborate on producing green hydrogen and derivatives.

The partnership would involve producing synthetic aviation fuel and other synthetic fuels, as well as synthetic chemicals, in Austria, the United Arab Emirates and northern and central Europe.

“By leveraging our combined capabilities, Masdar and OMV are looking to produce green hydrogen and derivatives at industrial scale, supporting decarbonization efforts and building the green hydrogen value chain”, Masdar chief green hydrogen officer Mohammad Abdelqader El Ramahi said.

Along with the 10-MW electrolyzer, OMV also put into operation a plant that uses its proprietary ReOil technology to convert hard-to-recycle plastics into virgin-quality products.

“By strengthening the link between refining and chemical production, we unlock greater efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability”, chair and chief executive Alfred Stern said. “This is how we turn molecules into value - and strategy into meaningful impact”.

The data reveals that some of the biggest risks to airline success are now macro in nature—far outpacing traditional industry concerns like fuel price volatility or pilot shortages.

“In this year’s survey, there is a theme: CEOs are doubling down on the fundamentals they can control,” says Bryan Terry, Aviation leader, Deloitte Consulting LLP. “That means tightening cost structures, boosting operational reliability, and laying the groundwork for sustainable profitability and growth.”

Resilience through cost control and reliability

Airline CEOs are deliberately focusing on the fundamentals they can influence – whether it’s focusing on cost structures or striving for operational excellence. The focus demonstrates a deliberate pivot from growth-at-any-cost toward efficiency

When asked for their top priorities over the next 12 months, 63% of CEOs are prioritizing cost control and financial health

Over half of CEOs cited operational reliability as one of the top initiatives they will prioritize when it comes to customer experience

A majority of CEOs deemed on-time performance (67%) and technical operations (60%) as a priority

A balanced approach to growth and leadership

While cost containment and operational efficiency remain important to the CEO agenda, more than half (53%) are also prioritizing customer experience, signaling that delivering value to passengers should coexist with financial discipline.

To enhance customer experience, CEOs are prioritizing initiatives such as digital and mobile platform enhancements (65%) and operational reliability (58%)

CEOs also cited transformative technology (47%) as the top initiative they are prioritizing over the next 12 months to drive growth.

They identified strategic and visionary thinking (63%), operation execution and resiliency (60%) and employee engagement and culture (60%) as the top three traits to help guide their airlines to long-term success.

Technology investment as a catalyst

With a focus on transformative technology as the top driver of growth, the majority (63%) are prioritizing advanced data analytics over the next year, and many also have an upbeat perspective on AI’s transformational impact over the next three years.

Beyond data analytics, CEOs also cited AI and machine learning (47%), next generation retail solutions (43%), and cyber and IT resilience (40%) as top investments over the next year

A majority of CEOs (80%) expect AI to deliver the greatest gains in revenue management and dynamic pricing over the next three years

Over half (60%) also expect AI to have a significant impact on predictive maintenance and aircraft reliability over that period

Half (50%) see AI’s biggest impact in customer service and irregular operations recovery

Workforce and culture as strategic imperatives

Amid the current economic backdrop, airline CEOs see workforce and culture as one of the key levers to help build resilience. CEOs are selectively prioritizing strategies that create organizational stability and a stronger corporate culture.

Over half of CEOs (53%) said they are prioritizing leadership development and succession planning

And 47% of CEOs are focused on employee experience and well-being

Notably, traditional concerns such as pilot recruitment (30%), reskilling (20%), and flexible work models (13%) have taken a backseat

Targeted sustainability in a cost-conscious era

As the structural shift of the CEO agenda evolves, many are taking a more targeted and practical approach to sustainability.

More than three quarters of CEOs (80%) cited sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a top initiative to achieve their sustainability goals, while carbon offsets now rank near the bottom, with only 13% of CEOs now citing this as a priority

Aligning with the broader focus on operational efficiency, 63% of CEOs said they are prioritizing fuel optimization and block time

More than half of CEOs (53%) are pursuing fleet modernization

“The future of aviation may not be about chasing the next big breakthrough—it may be about becoming resilient in the face of whatever comes next,” says Yvonne Rene de Cotret, Deloitte Global Transportation, Hospitality & Services Sector leader. “Airline CEOs are laying the groundwork for long-term strength, anchored by a commitment to cost control, reliability, and adaptive leadership.”

The tense atmosphere in the United States, from Trump's plans to revoke foreign students' visas to reports of travellers detained at US borders, has also put a dampener on tourism.

""The airline sector is always sensitive to the economic and political climate,"" Paul Chiambaretto, professor of strategy and marketing at France's Montpellier Business School, told AFP.

""Any form of uncertainty will reduce traffic,"" he added, noting it ""especially"" impacted business travellers, the most profitable segment.

The influential International Air Transport Association (IATA) is due to update its traffic and profitability projections as the delegates from the group gathering 350 airlines hold their talks.

In December it forecast a record 5.2 billion air journeys in 2025 -- up 6.7 percent from an already unprecedented 2024. It predicted carriers would generate $36.6 billion in cumulative net profit, on revenue exceeding $1 trillion.

However, the US president's ""Liberation Day"" tariff blitz and his administration's stance on issues from immigration to education could throw a spanner in the works.

Putting up the 'closed' sign

As early as March, the North American air transport market, which represents 23 percent of global traffic, began to decline and several US-based airlines warned they would not meet their financial targets.

A study released this month by the World Travel and Tourism Council and Oxford Economics found that the United States was on track to lose some $12.5 billion in revenue from foreign tourists this year owing to worries about travelling to the country.

The group, made up of leading travel firms, said this ""represents a direct blow to the US economy overall, impacting communities, jobs, and businesses from coast to coast"".

""While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the US government is putting up the 'closed' sign,"" WTTC president Julia Simpson said.

Didier Brechemier, an airline industry expert at Roland Berger, said: ""Today, bookings for the North Atlantic are lower than they were at the same time last year.""

IATA Director General Willie Walsh noted on Thursday ""some signs of fragility of consumer and business confidence with continued weakness in the US domestic market and a sharp fall in North American premium class travel"".

Air transport has for decades benefited from the removal of import taxes, rising living standards -- particularly in Asia -- and open borders, with the number of air trips tripling since 2000.

But the return of protectionism is endangering the industrial model of aircraft manufacturers, whose assembly lines mobilise suppliers worldwide, with costs likely to increase, putting more of a burden on carriers.

Lower energy costs

There's good news for carriers, though, with oil prices falling owing to an anticipated slowdown in economic growth.

That could help firms reduce their fuel bills -- representing between a quarter and a third of their operational costs -- by hundreds of millions of dollars.

Washington's new Republican administration is also fully supporting the development of fossil fuels, in contrast to that of Democratic former president Joe Biden, who subsidised Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Sustainable development ""has largely disappeared from the airline industry's immediate priorities"", says Jerome Bouchard, a partner at consultants Oliver Wyman.

Also likely on the agenda for IATA will be the impact of geopolitical tensions on the industry.

India is experiencing explosive growth, with the number of airports and passengers in the world's most populous nation doubling over the past decade, while major airlines IndiGo and Air India have hundreds of aircraft on order.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address delegates on Monday, organisers said.

The country's recent deadly spat with neighbour Pakistan, which saw the two sides impose airspace bans on each other, highlighted the fragility of civil aviation in the face of such upheavals.

The row poses an additional complication for connections to Asia, as Russia has banned US and EU aircraft overflights in retaliation for sanctions linked to its invasion of Ukraine.

Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel and PIT (the Pittsburgh airport’s official abbreviation) agreed to develop an on-airport SAF facility featuring tested alcohol-to-jet biofuel technology. The Avina plant will be just south of PIT’s terminal and could eventually produce up to 100 million gallons of SAF annually utilizing KBR’s PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology which is owned by Swedish-based AB.

With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure, and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.”

SAF is a biofuel which is refined to meet energy density standards and serve as a drop-in fuel blended with traditional jet fuel. The move at PIT has gained the approval of various aviation industry firms which are participating in the growth of SAF options.

“In pursuit of responsible and resilient growth in aerospace, Boeing supports the development of advanced, synthetic fuels here in the U.S. to power air travel into the future,” said Mike Caston, Director, Americas Partnerships and Policy, Boeing, in a statement.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from non-petroleum feedstocks such as agricultural resources and is measured to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation currently accounts for 2% of all man-made carbon emissions globally and close to 12% of all transportation sector emissions, according to the Alternative Fuel Data Center within the U.S. Department of Energy.

“KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it onsite at the airport,” Hari Ravindran, KBR’s Global SVP for Technology said in a statement. “PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) Technology, is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.”

KBR is licensed to produce the PureSAF technology. Swedish BioFuels invented the process and spent years verifying it through a pilot plant. The feedstocks include ethanol and other alcohols derived from organic resources, then utilizes a synthesis of aromatics. This creates advanced SAF called synthetic kerosene, thus bringing this type of biofuel closer to traditional petroleum jet fuel chemistry, according to reports.

Pittsburgh International Airport has been fortifying its on-site power backups and other distributed energy since the last decade. PIT airport commissioned its microgrid featuring gas-fired gen-sets and solar power in 2021.

The microgrid at PIT was built partially in response to the costly and lengthy power outage at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport a few years earlier, which cost Delta and other airline companies an estimated $100 million. Since then, JFK International, Dallas-Fort Worth and other airport sites have commissioned construction projects around on-site power and microgrids.

Pittsburgh’s PIT has pushed even further into commercial and industrial energy transition technologies. Last month, IMG announced it was installing another 4.7-MW solar farm on-site at PIT, while a new hydrogen production and SAF agreement between PIT, KeyState Energy and CNX Resources was detailed late last year.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/05/6839d3e41a6ca8dea0781318-saf_dreamstime.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-30 12:56:53.203605

SAF is derived from sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, algae and non-food crops. It is chemically parallel to traditional jet fuel, permitting it to be used in existing aircraft engines and fuelling infrastructure without any alterations.

The primary appeal of SAF is implicit in its ability to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. This eco-friendly fuel is certified under international standards like ASTM D7566, which ensures safety and efficiency. With growing global demand and supportive policies, SAF is increasingly becoming an important component of sustainable aviation.

Why SAF is Crucial?

SAF plays a key role in combating climate change by minimizing the carbon footprint of the aviation industry, which accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. With passenger air travel projected to develop gradually, a shift to SAF is necessary to fulfill global net-zero targets. It permits the aviation sector to align with national and international environmental commitments, including the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

F1’s relationship with SAF F1's alternative fuel strategy extends into the skies, too.","The roar of engines, the smell of burning rubber and the thrill of wheel-to-wheel racing at more than 200mph.

It’s fair to say that Formula 1 has never been a sport associated with environmentalism.

The European leg of the 2025 season is set to be a little different, though.

F1 is implementing a comprehensive alternative fuel strategy in service of its 2030 net zero goals as it attempts to transform how the sport operates both on and off the track.

The season’s nine European races, which stretch from May to September, will see the introduction of biofuel-powered lorries delivering freight, renewable energy systems powering entire paddocks and much more.

As the most viewed motorsport series in the world, F1 has a huge responsibility to decarbonise, but it is showing that it is willing to embrace radical, meaningful change.

Powering the paddock with renewable energy

The most visible change arrived in May 2025, at the season’s inaugural European race, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

Here in Imola, the course’s paddock was entirely powered by a low-carbon energy system.

This centralised approach, supplied by F1 partner Aggreko, promises to slash associated carbon emissions by approximately 90% – a figure that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago.

Rather than each team operating their own generators scattered throughout the paddock, a single compound provided renewable energy from multiple sources.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), solar panels and battery energy storage systems (BESS) worked in tandem to power everything from the pit lane to the event technical centre.

This isn't F1 taking a punt on untested technology. The system has been trialled at four previous European races, including the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix and three events in 2024.

Each trial saw impressive carbon reductions, giving the sport the confidence to roll out the technology across all nine of its European races this season.

The benefits extend beyond mere carbon reduction. By eliminating the need for dozens of individual generators, the system also reduces transportation emissions – a crucial consideration for a sport that moves an entire circus across continents throughout the year.

Biofuel lorries and sustainable logistics

Perhaps the most practical demonstration of F1's commitment to sustainability is in its changes to logistics.

This season sees the return of DHL's biofuel fleet, with 37 specially adapted lorries transporting freight across Europe using alternative fuels rather than traditional diesel.

During the 2023 European leg, these biofuel-powered vehicles achieved an average reduction of 83% in logistics-related emissions compared to conventional fuel.

For a sport that requires the precise, time-critical movement of millions of dollars worth of equipment across the world, this represents a quite remarkable achievement without compromising on efficiency.

The fuel of the future

Perhaps most significantly for the sport's future, the 2025 season has seen F2 and F3 cars successfully transition to 100% advanced sustainable fuel, developed by Aramco.

This move builds on the 2024 season's use of 55% sustainable fuel and serves as a crucial testing ground for Formula 1's own transition, which is due in 2026.

The timing is deliberate. Next year's introduction of new hybrid engines in F1 will coincide with the sport's adoption of these advanced sustainable fuels, representing the most significant technical regulation change in years.

But the implications stretch way beyond the circuit.

The sustainable fuel being developed for Formula 1 is designed to be a 'drop-in' replacement, meaning it can also be used in conventional road cars without any modifications necessary.

It could prove transformative for the broader automotive industry, offering a sustainable alternative that requires no infrastructure overhaul or consumer behaviour change.

It’s also further proof that elite level sport is a prolific testing ground for innovations that change life on Earth.

F1’s relationship with SAF

F1's alternative fuel strategy extends into the skies, too.

In 2024, the sport’s governing body made significant investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which delivered an estimated 80% reduction in flight-related carbon emissions compared to conventional aviation fuel.

Working with partners DHL and Qatar Airways, this initiative reduced total emissions by more than 8,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent – roughly equivalent to taking 1,700 cars off British roads for an entire year.

For a sport that operates globally, with races across five continents, aviation emissions are one of the biggest challenges for F1’s net zero prospects.

The 19% reduction in related emissions across the 2024 flyaway events goes to show that meaningful progress is possible even in aviation, traditionally one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7baaf5fc848f025285cc645e0cf680c1:4f5223424a34c67e1c5a77c8c604ca26/the-paddocks-in-the-f1-s-european-circuits-are-getting-a-sustainable-makeover.png.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:56:19.934835

At the ACI Europe Annual Congress in Istanbul, International Airport Review sat down with Kata Cserep, Global Aviation Lead, and Sabire Ipek Demir, Energy Transition Expert at PA Consulting, to explore how airports can transform into data-driven, sustainable hubs of innovation. From electrification and grid constraints to community engagement and AI-powered operations, this interview reveals why PA Consulting sees collaboration, transparency, and innovation as essential to the aviation sector’s next evolution.

As the aviation industry navigates the complex challenges of decarbonisation, digital transformation, and shifting stakeholder expectations, the need for bold, integrated solutions has never been greater. At the forefront of this movement is PA Consulting, a firm leveraging cross-sector expertise to guide airports toward a smarter, greener future. In this exclusive interview, we speak with two of PA’s leading voices Kata Cserep and Sabire Ipek Demir on how airports can move beyond ambition and into actionable, measurable impact. From strategy to implementation, the conversation explores case studies, innovative technologies, and the evolving role of airports as both transport and energy hubs.

Can you tell me about PA Consulting generally and your role within the firm?

Kata: I lead the Global Airports and Aviation team at PA Consulting. I’ve spent the last 20 years working with airlines, airports, investors, and policy makers, and I joined PA in 2023.

Having spent this time in the industry, and generally taking a long-term view, I can see three long-term macro trends that will influence the challenges of airports over the next two decades. The first one is energy transition and decarbonisation. Another one is digital transformation, use of AI, and data science technologies. Last but not least is capacity expansion through capital investments and making the best use of existing capacities through greater operational efficiencies. These also happen to be areas where PA is an exceptionally strong advisor across a number of different sectors.

PA Consulting supports airports as well as other sector clients with their long-term sustainability strategies. We also work with airports to bring AI technologies into their operations, applying data science to manage flows and bring actionable efficiency insights. We also advise them on engagements with investors and regulators on new investments, whether it’s electric fleets, micro-grids, or new technology in the terminal. It’s about being able to assess the business cases and bring about the change – that’s the role we play.

In terms of size and coverage, PA has about 4,000 people. Our aviation team is based in the UK, Netherlands, and the U.S., but we operate globally, so we work with airports of all sizes, in different parts of the world.

Sabire, could you let me know about your role at PA and an example on how you supported UK airports on the road to sustainability?

Sabire: I’m an economist, specialising in energy transition policy design and investment strategies. I advise energy and aviation sectors clients, as we see similar trends across the economic frameworks that govern the energy transition initiatives in both sectors.

The PA team recently completed a project where we helped a major London airport develop a refreshed sustainability strategy. They approached PA with an ambition to be a champion in sustainable aviation: not just by meeting their Net Zero by 2050 targets, but also by meeting the expectations of local government, community, internal teams, and employees. They needed a roadmap and a communications agenda.

The PA team started the project with an extensive stakeholder engagement, interviewing more than a hundred stakeholders that range from airport senior executives, employees, teams, and shareholders, all the way to passengers, partners of the airport, as well as community members and local government. These engagements identified four areas of actions:

Infrastructure: Providing the necessary infrastructure to enable the net zero transition, which is the big and exciting challenge in front of us.

Partners: Having the airport business partners supporting the innovation and implementation of the future of flight.

Teams: Making the airport a great place to work with learning and growth opportunities and the chance to build a fulfilling career.

Community: Being a good neighbour while also providing opportunities for the community around the airport.

The planned work across these areas rests on collaboration, transparency and innovation:

It has to be a collaborative effort for all stakeholders to be onboard and for the plan to be designed in a way that’s implementable and effective for everybody.

Transparency is key. You must back up all initiatives or new measures with data evidence supporting the higher expected benefits.

Finally, innovation that supports sustainable solutions across all aspects of an airport service, from customer satisfaction to working with partners, to working internally within your own teams.

The PA team and our client airport identified commitments and delivery actions across these areas. For instance, the airport now has a strategy to enable the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by increased collaboration with airlines and fuel providers. With regards to the Net Zero targets, they aim to supply 25% of the electricity use at the airport from onsite renewable generation. By 2040, the aim is for 100% of all electricity needs of the airport to be provided by off-grid solutions or self-generation at the airport. There is also a 2030 target for achieving 100% low carbon airport vehicles fleet. These are all exciting goals.

Earlier today at the Congress, a subject that was touched upon was electrification of airports. What do you think is the biggest challenge if we were to see that evolution?

Kata: Grid connection challenge is what we hear most often from our clients, for two reasons.

One, the historical electricity capacity and requirements of airports have been modest in comparison to what the future projected needs are to electrify ground support equipment and fleet, not to mention future electric aircrafts. Further along, the level of ‘charging’ that’s required will be orders of magnitude larger. So, the step-up in electricity demand is larger than what the connections to the grid are currently set up for.

Secondly, outside of the airport, the whole grid is strained because everyone else is trying to electrify as well. That’s the challenge I see as the most consistently heard and voiced, whether in the U.S., in Europe, or anywhere else.

Sabire: Grid constraints are not just a challenge for our airport clients, but also for our renewable energy developer clients, onshore and offshore. We also advise the transmission and distribution networks on their investment strategies to reinforce the grid. There’s currently a high regulatory and policy awareness around this challenge and direct intervention by the government authorities to help alleviate grid constraints and potential overload from increased self-generation. The National Electricity System Operator (NESO)’s ‘Connections Reform’ and the ‘Strategic Spatial Energy Plan’ are steps in this direction.

Many solutions for reducing Scope 2 emissions at airports also consider off-grid generation and electricity storage solutions to bypass the grid connections challenge, converting airports to ‘enerports’.

Do you think that sustainability or the need for more sustainable practice could be framed as an exciting challenge for the industry, one that is driving forward innovation?

Kata: The aviation industry is generally characterised by continuous innovation. There is also increasingly more opportunity and appetite to learn from outside the aviation sector. This merging of expertise from the energy, transport and digital sectors, where different stakeholders are coming together either through commercial incentive, regulation, or that desire to innovate together, is where I see the most exciting opportunities.

You’re allowed one wish for the aviation and airport industry. What is that one wish? If you could wave a magic wand and solve one challenge right away?

Kata: In the area of sustainability, the obvious missing link to me, is the cost of decarbonising aviation. If I could wave a magic wand, I would say, “right, we are going to pay for decarbonisation overnight, and yes, it’s going to add 10% to every ticket globally tomorrow, but we’ll be done”. The reason it’s so expensive is because only a tiny proportion of people are doing it, so my wish would be to decarbonise at once, as a global collective.

Sabire: I would use my magic wand to achieve the required technological innovations overnight. We can achieve a lot with 3rd gen sustainable aviation fuels and the power-to-x technology, or zero emissions flight such as hydrogen or electric used for all private jets and smaller aircrafts. Yet these technologies are at the very early stages of development, and until they reach full maturity their costs will be too high. To be able to make that technological leap of 10 to 20 years overnight, would be my wish.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2510038871-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:56:32.218800

“It’s an exciting time right now for sustainable aviation and there’s a lot of moon-shot technologies being developed with electric aviation being one of those.”","With just two seats, the Velis Electro is the smallest aircraft I’ve ever been in — and one of the most remarkable, shining a light on the future of flight. The 600kg aircraft is being powered solely by two 12kWh batteries, one that is in the nose of the aircraft, the second tucked away behind us (by comparison a Tesla would have a battery pack with a capacity of about 100kWh).

It is also remarkably quiet. At 60db while cruising, the aircraft is no louder than the level of a normal conversation and is also surprisingly simple to fly. “There really are only a few buttons you need to press to get into the air,” Twidell says. “You just don’t have the same complexities as you do with a combustion engine. It has instant power and is extremely nimble.”

While the batteries make it the cleanest way to fly — it is zero-emission while in the sky — they are also its limiting factor. The aircraft, once fully charged, can only fly for about an hour, although Twidell says a flying time of 45 minutes is what a conservative pilot would be happy with.

When I had arrived at the airport, the aircraft had been hooked up to its charging unit, which was only a little bigger than the size of a generator you might see powering a motorhome. At present the plug is unique to the aircraft but work is under way to standardise it — similar to the combined charging system that electric cars can almost universally hook up to — so that a growing number of airports will be able to accommodate the inevitably growing number of electric aircraft. Currently just over a dozen aerodromes in the UK support electric aircraft.

As we circle around the outskirts of the city, Twidell lets me take the controls. “You can’t go wrong,” he says. Tentatively I tilt the aircraft using the yoke — the stick that controls the pitch and roll — and we bank back towards the centre. The River Cam is glistening in the spring sunshine and the limestone on the city’s grand colleges is illuminated.

As well as cleaner flying, the Pipistrel aircraft is considerably cheaper to run — albeit with a purchase price of about £170,000 — compared with traditional aircraft. An hour of flying costs about £5 in electricity, compared with about £100 in fuel in a traditional prop-plane such as a Cessna.

Back on the ground, Kennedy Ricci, the founder of 4AIR, the sustainable aviation consultancy, heralds the aircraft as a “huge step in the right direction”. It is working in partnership with Cambridge University’s Whittle Laboratory, which is running the “Aviation Impact Accelerator” (AIA), researching sustainable aviation.

“There is no single answer in aviation,” Ricci says. “Cars are easy, you can electrify them. In a lot of industries, electrification just works. It’s much more complex in aviation. There’s going to need to be a mix of solutions; electric for short flights, sustainable aviation fuel for long-haul. It’s a mixed picture.”

The race is on to develop electric technology. Last week the Bristol-based company, Vertical Aerospace, which is developing flying taxis, made its first flight over the UK countryside in its VX4 prototype.

It marked a milestone on the company’s road to commercial deployment of so-called eVTOLs, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. The company says its aircraft will be able to take passengers from Battersea, in southwest London, to Heathrow in just 12 minutes.

This week scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology unveiled a new fuel cell they believe has “revolutionary” potential for electric flying. They say that a prototype achieved energy densities of more than 1,500 watt-hours per kilogram — far beyond the 250 to 300 Wh/kg typical of lithium-ion batteries. In a real-life system, they believe that would translate to more than 1,000 Wh/kg — a threshold seen as necessary to make electric-powered regional aviation viable.

Dr Deepanshu Singh, a researcher in sustainable aviation at the AIA, is also excited about the prospects for green flying in the coming decades. He said: “Right now, it’s limited to short ranges and one of the reasons which kills range is the safety reserve requirement. However, there’s a way to extend that through hybrid configuration, just like a Prius, where you can save the reserve as fossil jet fuel, but not use it.

Formula 1 has never been regarded as a particularly sustainable sport.

However, the 2025 European racing segment is looking to be different.

F1 is deploying an extensive alternative fuel initiative to support its net zero objectives by 2030, working to revolutionise the sport's operations both during races and behind the scenes.

The nine European races, scheduled from May through September, will feature biofuel-operated trucks for freight transport, renewable energy infrastructure powering complete paddock facilities and additional sustainable innovations.

As the world's most-watched motorsport competition, F1 bears significant responsibility for decarbonisation.

Renewable energy integration in paddock operations

The most noticeable transformation debuted in May 2025 during the European season opener, the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.

At Imola, the circuit's paddock operated entirely on a low-carbon energy infrastructure.

This unified system, provided by F1 partner Aggreko, is projected to reduce corresponding carbon emissions by roughly 90% – a reduction that was unimaginable a few years ago.

Instead of individual teams running separate generators distributed across the paddock, one centralised facility delivered renewable energy from various sources.

Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), photovoltaic panels and battery energy storage systems (BESS) collaborated to supply power for everything from pit areas to the event's technical facilities.

This represents F1's adoption of proven technology rather than experimental systems. The infrastructure underwent testing at four prior European races, including the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix and three 2024 events.

Every trial demonstrated substantial carbon reductions, providing the sport with confidence to implement this technology throughout all nine European races this season.

The advantages go beyond carbon reduction alone. By removing the requirement for numerous individual generators, the system also decreases transportation emissions – an essential factor for a sport that relocates an entire operation across continents year-round.

Next-generation fuel development

The 2025 season has witnessed F2 and F3 cars successfully adopting 100% advanced sustainable fuel, created by Aramco.

This transition builds upon the 2024 season's implementation of 55% sustainable fuel and functions as an essential testing platform for Formula 1's own conversion, scheduled for 2026.

Next year's introduction of new hybrid powertrains in F1 will align with the sport's sustainable fuel adoption, marking the most substantial technical regulation modification in recent years.

Yet the ramifications extend far beyond racing circuits.

The sustainable fuel under development for Formula 1 is engineered as a 'drop-in' substitute, allowing use in standard road vehicles without requiring modifications.

This could prove revolutionary for the wider automotive sector, providing a sustainable option that demands no infrastructure restructuring or consumer habit changes.

It additionally demonstrates that elite sports serve as productive testing environments for innovations that transform everyday life.

F1's sustainable aviation fuel initiatives

F1's alternative fuel approach reaches into aviation as well.

During 2024, the sport's governing organisation made substantial investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), achieving an estimated 80% reduction in flight-related carbon emissions compared to standard aviation fuel.

Collaborating with partners DHL and Qatar Airways, this program reduced total emissions by more than 8,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent – approximately equal to removing 1,700 cars from British roads for one year.

For a globally operating sport with races spanning five continents, aviation emissions represent one of the greatest obstacles to F1's net zero ambitions.

The 19% reduction in associated emissions across 2024 flyaway events demonstrates that significant advancement is achievable even in aviation, historically among the most challenging sectors to decarbonise.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7baaf5fc848f025285cc645e0cf680c1:4f5223424a34c67e1c5a77c8c604ca26/the-paddocks-in-the-f1-s-european-circuits-are-getting-a-sustainable-makeover.png.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 11:56:52.811476

As the world’s leading SAF producer, Neste is at the forefront of efforts to bridge this gap and drive sustainable aviation forward.
Beyond airlines, Neste is deepening its collaboration with logistics companies.
While SAF is currently blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, Neste is actively working toward 100% SAF certification.
“We aim to support our customers in reducing their GHG emissions by 20 million tons per annum by 2030.","With the aviation industry pushing toward net-zero emissions by 2050, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a key solution. Despite its potential, SAF still accounts for less than 1% of total global jet fuel consumption, underscoring the urgent need to scale production. As the world’s leading SAF producer, Neste is at the forefront of efforts to bridge this gap and drive sustainable aviation forward.

“SAF is a key lever to decarbonise aviation, but its current production capacity is limited,” says Alexander Kueper, Vice President Renewable Aviation Business at Neste. “We simply don’t have the luxury to wait anymore. This requires action and cooperation across the whole aviation ecosystem, including airlines, airports, fuel producers, governments, businesses using aviation for travel and cargo, and even individual travellers.”

Scaling SAF production: Meeting global demand Neste is rapidly expanding its SAF production capacity to meet growing global demand. “Neste is the world’s leading producer of SAF with a current SAF production capability of 1 million tons per annum, which is roughly 1.25 billion litres,” says Kueper. “This will increase to 1.5 million tons per annum once the modification to our existing Rotterdam refinery in the Netherlands is completed this year, and further to 2.2 million tons after the ongoing expansion of our refinery in Rotterdam.”

With production facilities in Finland and Singapore, Neste operates the world’s largest SAF production facility in Singapore, enabling the company to serve customers in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. However, scaling production remains a challenge. “Governments play a crucial role in creating a market and demand for SAF, as demand certainty is needed to attract investment into new production capacity,” Kueper explains.

Driving adoption: Partnering with airlines & expanding infrastructure Neste has partnered with numerous airlines and logistics companies worldwide to integrate SAF into operations. “A good example is our cooperation with Singapore Airlines, to which we supplied SAF at Changi Airport last year, produced at our Singapore refinery and supplied into the airport via our integrated supply chain in the country,” shares Kueper.

Beyond airlines, Neste is deepening its collaboration with logistics companies. “A more recent example is the further strengthening of our existing cooperation with DHL Group, to which we already supply SAF, but with whom we will develop a holistic, joint approach to tackling GHG emissions in transportation, both by air and by road,” he adds.

To enhance SAF accessibility, Neste is expanding fuel availability at major airports. “Neste has its own SAF supply capabilities at a selected number of international airports such as Amsterdam, San Francisco, and Singapore but is working together with partners to enable access to SAF at other airports across the globe—for example, with ITOCHU in Japan or Signature Aviation and Avfuel in the US,” says Kueper.

While SAF is currently blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, Neste is actively working toward 100% SAF certification. “For example, our cooperation with Airbus and Rolls Royce is researching the impact of using 100% SAF on aviation emissions,” he notes.

Policy & market dynamics: Unlocking SAF’s full potential Government support is crucial in accelerating SAF adoption, particularly through policies like the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the UK SAF mandate, which require airlines to incorporate a minimum percentage of SAF into their fuel mix. “Both have started with 2% in 2025, with the EU increasing to 6% in 2030 and the UK to even 10% by 2030,” Kueper explains.

Countries in the Asia-Pacific region are also moving towards similar mandates. “We see governments in Japan and Singapore implementing or developing similar policies,” he adds. “The availability of SAF to support the European mandates is there, with Neste alone increasing its SAF production capability to 1.5 million tons per annum this year, and we are not the only producer around.”

Global policy alignment is another critical factor. “Aviation is a global industry, introducing the need for global alignment. It is positive that ICAO has set an intermediary target for international aviation to be 5% less carbon-intensive by 2030, through the use of SAF,” Kueper highlights.

The next generation of sustainable aviation fuels While SAF is currently the most viable alternative to conventional jet fuel, Neste is also exploring future technologies such as Power-to-X. “SAF is basically a category of more sustainable fuels that can be produced from non-fossil sources in several ways,” explains Kueper. “Neste uses HEFA technology, which is currently the only commercially viable technology. Most of the SAF produced globally today is HEFA-SAF.”

Other production pathways, such as alcohol-to-jet, are scaling, while Power-to-Liquids technology, which combines green hydrogen and captured carbon to produce synthetic fuel, is in early development. “Neste is not only looking into these future technologies but also into new future raw materials such as novel vegetable oils and lignocellulosic residues,” Kueper adds.

The circular economy also plays a major role in Neste’s strategy. “SAF is already a good example of circularity, as we’re reusing carbon already in the atmosphere for its production via the raw materials used,” he says. Expanding feedstock availability will be crucial for ramping up production. “Independent reports like the World Economic Forum/Clean Skies of Tomorrow report estimate the global availability of waste and residue oils and fats to exceed 40 million tons by 2030. This will provide enough raw material to significantly ramp up SAF production,” he notes.

The road ahead for Neste and the aviation industry Neste’s sustainability roadmap is ambitious. “As far as SAF is concerned, the future milestones will be increasing our SAF production capability, first to 1.5 million tons per annum and then further to 2.2 million tons per annum,” says Kueper. “This will support mandates but also voluntary demand from businesses aiming to reduce emissions from their business travel and transport.”

Beyond SAF, Neste has set broader climate and sustainability targets. “We aim to support our customers in reducing their GHG emissions by 20 million tons per annum by 2030. We are well underway, having passed the 12 million tons mark,” he adds. “Additionally, we are working towards carbon-neutral production by 2035 and have set aspirational targets for climate, biodiversity, human rights, as well as our supply chain and raw materials.”

Neste’s push for sustainable aviation extends beyond just increasing SAF production—it’s about reshaping the entire industry’s approach to decarbonisation. With growing policy support, expanding airline partnerships, and ongoing advancements in alternative fuels, the company is driving the aviation sector closer to a low-carbon future. While challenges remain, Neste’s commitment to scaling SAF, broadening feedstock availability, and pioneering new technologies positions it as a key player in transforming aviation for generations to come.

The Adani Group’s Mumbai International Airport has changed its payment policy, requiring airlines to provide cash deposits instead of traditional bank guarantees to cover fees. The move has triggered opposition from major carriers IndiGo and Air India, documents reviewed by Reuters reveal.

The airport in India's financial capital of Mumbai, run by the Adani Group, has triggered a lobbying effort by top carriers IndiGo and Air India after it changed payment rules, citing financial needs and a risk of airline defaults, documents show.

The airport is one of India's busiest at a time when dozens are being added in one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets. It is the biggest of seven managed by a group led by billionaire Gautam Adani.

Confidential letters seen by Reuters show the intense pushback to the change, which seeks a compulsory cash deposit in a bank as security against charges such as landing and parking fees, instead of a long-standing practice of bank guarantees.

""None of these airlines normally pay on time ... we want to align our cash flow with the airlines' cash flow,"" said Arun Bansal, the chief executive of Adani Airport Holdings, which has a stake of 74% in the airport.

""They have taken advantage of our niceness,"" he added, referring to resistance to the new payment system from IndiGo and Air India since the change eight months ago in October.

Live Events

Airlines often delay payments beyond a due date at month-end but the airport has to pay authorities earlier, creating working capital challenges that can be resolved by using the security deposit when needed, Bansal said.

IndiGo and Air India, which together have a share of 91% of the market in India, did not respond to queries from Reuters.

A source with direct knowledge of the matter said the new policy would require the two airlines to make deposits of about 2 billion rupees ($23 million), taken together.

For Air India, owned by the Tata Group conglomerate, such payments could strain its finances after racking up losses of $521 million last year, in addition to monthly costs of $50 million after Pakistan closed its airspace to Indian airlines.

The Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), which serviced 53 million passengers last year, also faces financial challenges, after posting losses of $71.11 million on revenues of $461 million last year, disclosures show.

In a December 31 letter to an airlines body, the airport justified the change by pointing out its ""deteriorating financial position"" and ""significant debt obligations"".

""The deposits will help MIAL's financial stability and credit rating,"" it added.

DEFAULT RISK, AIR INDIA PUSH

The change also aimed to protect the airport from risks such as an airline going bankrupt, as carriers Jet Airways, Go First and Kingfisher Airlines have done in the last few years, Bansal said.

The Mumbai airport has the right to cancel the slots of airlines that do not follow the new policy, but does not intend to do so in the interest of passengers, he added.

The International Air Transport Association, representing both Air India and IndiGo, wrote to India's civil aviation ministry in December, calling the change a bid to use airline deposits to fund the airport's need for working capital.

India's civil aviation ministry did not respond to Reuters' queries. The government has a stake of 26% in the Mumbai airport.

In a letter on April 2, the Federation of Indian Airlines told the airport it disagreed with the contention that airline payments were not timely.

Air India has lobbied the Indian government, saying the industry was already facing ""immense financial pressure"" in an April 15 letter.

""It is highly likely that other airports across the country could adopt similar measures, leading to widespread financial strain,"" Air India said in the letter, seen by Reuters.

US tariff ruling could revive biofuel feedstock trade

US tariff ruling could revive biofuel feedstock trade

New York, 29 May (Argus) — A sweeping court ruling Wednesday against President Donald Trump's emergency tariffs could make foreign biofuel feedstock imports, which have wavered this year, more attractive. A three-judge panel on the US Court of International Trade struck down tariffs Trump set under a little-used economic emergency law, including bilateral tariffs on China, ""reciprocal"" tariffs on nearly every country, and levies on some Canadian and Mexican products to combat drug trafficking. The tariffs upended global trade flows, including by making recently fast-rising inputs for renewable diesel production like Chinese used cooking oil and Brazilian beef tallow more expensive. The trade court gave the government ten days to comply, though the Trump administration has asked for a pause on the ruling and pledged to appeal. Tariffs enacted under other laws, including sectoral tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, would remain intact. Trump could also still eye different authorities to revive his broader tariffs, which he sees as a crucial negotiating tool to counter what he has called unfair trade practices abroad. But the court's decision, if it holds, would still be a significant barrier to Trump's efforts to rewire global trade. The US could even be required to offer refunds of emergency tariffs that have already been paid. US levies on Chinese products imposed under the emergency law at one point reached 145pc, raising fears of a protracted trade war and global economic slowdown. Fewer options for foreign biofuel feedstocks because of tariffs also helped increase the price of domestic alternatives like US soybean oil, where futures were down 2pc in early trading Thursday, and compounded the pain for refiners struggling with major changes to biofuel tax credits. Biomass-based diesel production in the US has been down sharply this year because of all the policy shifts. Formerly fast-rising flow Before this year, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers along the US Gulf and west coasts were expanding capacity and increasingly looking abroad for inputs. Waste feedstocks like used cooking oil and beef tallow are considered lower-carbon feedstocks than crops and thus generally fetch larger government subsidies — even if sourced from abroad. The US imported nearly 5.4bn lbs of used cooking oil in 2024, a record-high and with more than half that total coming from China. But Trump's tariffs sharply reduced the incentive to import foreign feedstocks. Duties on Chinese products have varied significantly but were last at 30pc before the court ruling, adding to existing 15.5pc charges on Chinese used cooking oil. Reciprocal tariffs of 10pc on nearly every country added new costs to Australian and Brazilian tallow too. US import data is only available through March, before Trump imposed his most far-reaching tariffs as part of an April ""Liberation Day"" announcement . But global feedstock traders more recently have said that the tariffs — and the unpredictability of future policy — have made global inputs riskier. While some tariffs are eligible for duty drawbacks, creating options for biofuel producers targeting foreign markets, US imports of Chinese used cooking oil were down 27pc in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Other barriers remain Even if the court ruling holds, other policies could deter US biorefineries from relying too heavily on foreign feedstocks. For one, current government guidance around a new US clean fuel tax credit prevents refiners from claiming any subsidy for road fuels derived from foreign used cooking oil . Those rules also pin the carbon intensity of canola-based fuels as too high to claim any subsidy, choking off interest in Canadian canola oil imports that had been rising significantly before this year. And farm groups, worried that foreign feedstocks are hurting demand for US crops, are lobbying regulators and lawmakers for more severe limits. A party-line budget bill that passed the House this month would restrict clean fuel tax credit eligibility to fuels derived from North American feedstocks, a win for US oilseed crushers but a major blow to refiners reliant on foreign tallow. While that bill still needs Senate approval and changes would only kick in next year, the proposal is a clear signal from Republicans that refiners should start looking closer to home for renewable diesel inputs.

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to independently develop bio-jet fuel technology. This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions by about 80%, compared with conventional jet fuel.

What is SAF?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

Adoption of SAF from the Chinese Mainland

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: ""Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.""

Last year, Cathay Pacific also adopted two batches of SAF from the Chinese Mainland, which were uplifted at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow Airport respectively.

Looking to the future

In recent years, the production and adoption of SAF has gained momentum across Asia. ​ Cathay Pacific is working closely with different partners with the aim to expand the use of SAF in Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific reached an agreement with fuel supplier SK Energy, which will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific from 2025 to 2027 in South Korea.

By doing so, they can not only meet ambitious sustainability targets but also gain a competitive edge in the evolving aviation landscape.

The high stakes of SAF adoption

SAF offers unparalleled environmental benefits, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. However, its high production costs present a major barrier to widespread adoption. Today, many airlines pass these costs on to customers, and while the initial impact on customer willingness to pay (WTP) may be minimal, this dynamic is likely to shift.

As regulatory mandates for SAF increase and airlines voluntarily adopt higher levels of SAF to meet decarbonization targets, the financial strain could grow. This may ultimately affect airline profitability and competitiveness, making it imperative for airlines to develop robust strategies to mitigate costs and maximize returns.

Together, these mechanisms empower airlines to obtain SAF at economically viable prices, while instilling the confidence and risk-sharing needed to drive production growth and facilitate the opening of new facilities.

Monetization strategies: Turning sustainability into a revenue opportunity

Procurement alone is not enough to unlock the full potential of SAF. Airlines must also focus on monetizing sustainability by aligning their offerings with the unique motivations and WTP of different customer segments. This involves creating tailored solutions for:

Cargo customers: These customers are typically businesses with their own public sustainability targets, often taking on the roadmap outlined by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Given that the net cost of SAF is relatively low compared to the value of the transported products – especially since air cargo is often used for high value density goods - even using 100% SAF can be quite affordable. For example, considering typical values for goods transported by air, we estimate that 100% SAF uptake can be achieved with a

~0.5% price increase for a laptop,

~1% price increase for an item of clothing, or

~2% price increase for a bouquet of flowers

etc.

However, passing on the cost is insufficient: operators must effectively communicate this advantage to unlock demand. Airlines can implement strategies ranging from three-way agreements where they are compensated for SAF purchases through handling fees to full WTP approaches that include green offerings tailored to meet the specific needs of cargo customers (see “De-risking to generate value throughout the SAF supply chain” below for more details).

Corporate clients: Similar to cargo customers, corporate clients often have publicly announced sustainability targets, frequently with ambitious commitments for 2030-2040. In many industries – such as banking, professional services, legal, etc – flying can often represent a significant share of companies’ total emissions, meaning that any near-term meaningful action requires aviation decarbonization, generally through SAF. Roland Berger is itself a case-in-point as flying represents ~60% of our total annual CO2 emissions: to meet our ambitious SBTi targets, we follow a two-pronged approach: avoid air travel where possible, and abate remaining flight emissions through SAF procurement. By rethinking offer management, airlines can align with these customers’ decarbonization goals, creating compelling narratives that appeal to their sustainability objectives.

Leisure customers: Recent findings indicate that customers exhibit a notable willingness to pay when prompted; however, the conversion rates remain relatively low. This trend can be partially attributed to the absence of compelling offers that resonate with customers' perceptions of value. Through our comprehensive research, we have developed significant expertise in understanding what customers truly regard as valuable within the framework of sustainability. We are well-positioned to assist airlines in harnessing this knowledge to create customer-value-driven offerings, which can enhance customer satisfaction while mitigating the impact of regulatory challenges in the market.

Importantly, this approach does not solely apply to SAF, it also encompasses other sustainable goods and services as long as real action is being taken and can be proven accordingly.

De-risking to generate value throughout the SAF supply chain

Combining together procurement and monetization strategies is key: by aligning characteristics of SAF procured with SAF certificates sold (e.g., in carbon intensity, pathways/feedstocks, volumes, costing/pricing, contract duration and terms, logistical considerations, etc), airlines can align incentives and expectations through the SAF supply chain. There is indeed a continuum of structures for agreements that is possible here in the B2B space (with cargo and corporate customers):

From unlinked (not de-risked) deals,

to “back-to-back” deals where airlines contract separately but in close alignment with SAF suppliers and B2B customers,

to 3-way agreements involving the SAF supplier, airline and B2B customer,

to full special purpose vehicles dedicated to risk management, with equity investments from all parties involved.",https://www.rolandberger.com/img/og/Roland_Berger_25_2167_WEB_Unlocking_the_potential_of_aviation_sustainability_OG.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 10:56:08.813180

The airline uplifted a batch of SAF produced by the Sinopec Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company (ZRCC) at Hong Kong International Airport in April. ZRCC is one of the leading SAF manufacturers in Asia to independently develop bio-jet fuel technology. This batch of SAF was converted from used cooking oil using the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway. As part of the first batch of SAF exported by ZRCC to Hong Kong, it has been certified by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) that it can reduce the lifecycle carbon emissions by about 80%, compared with conventional jet fuel.

What is SAF?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel produced from waste materials or other non-fossil carbon sources. As demonstrated by this batch, SAF has the potential to significantly lower its lifecycle carbon emissions as compared with fossil fuels, helping address the environmental impact of passenger and cargo air transport. This agreement with Sinopec demonstrates the potential for further cooperation between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong in the SAF supply chain.

Adoption of SAF from the Chinese Mainland

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: ""Our purchase and use of SAF products from ZRCC goes beyond just a fuel uplift; it marks our initiative to expand the upstream and downstream value chain of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland. Through cooperation with Sinopec, we hope to support greater adoption of SAF produced in the Chinese Mainland and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.""

Last year, Cathay Pacific also adopted two batches of SAF from the Chinese Mainland, which were uplifted at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and London Heathrow Airport respectively.

Looking to the future

In recent years, the production and adoption of SAF has gained momentum across Asia. ​ Cathay Pacific is working closely with different partners with the aim to expand the use of SAF in Asia. In March 2025, Cathay Pacific reached an agreement with fuel supplier SK Energy, which will supply SAF to Cathay Pacific from 2025 to 2027 in South Korea.

To achieve the worldwide net-zero aviation goal by 2050, yearly output needs to hit 185 million tonnes of SAF.
Gupte stated that India, utilizing its diverse feedstock such as used cooking oil and agricultural waste, can generate 8–10 million tonnes each year.
“This means that India can actually provide over 5 per cent of the world’s SAF requirements… India can be an exporter of SAF.
This means India can help decarbonise the civil aviation industry,” Gupte said, adding that turning agricultural waste into SAF will be a tremendous opportunity.","A senior Boeing executive stated that India could become a net exporter of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as worldwide initiatives aim to cut carbon emissions in the aviation industry.

During the CII Annual Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi, Salil Gupte, President of Boeing India and South Asia, highlighted the plentiful supply of feedstock, like agricultural waste, that can be utilized for SAF production.

Aviation accounts for about 2–3 percent of worldwide carbon emissions, making SAF an essential approach to reducing them. Gupte remarked that India is set to incorporate 2,500 new civil aircraft in the coming 20 years, solidifying its status as one of the quickest expanding aviation markets. Indian airlines have placed orders for over 1,000 planes in the past few years.

Gupte noted that India’s modern aircraft fleet would support decarbonisation initiatives and proposed that the nation could spearhead the expansion of biofuel production for aviation. He stated the primary challenge would not be in aircraft or engineering technology but in securing an adequate and economical supply of SAF, which presently costs 2.5 to 3.5 times more than conventional Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).

The company, known for providing pipe services in the O&G sector, currently focuses on engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) for renewable energy projects. Now, it is considering becoming an asset owner in the biomass space, reports The Edge Malaysia.

Speaking after the company’s 25th annual general meeting, managing director and group CEO Giancarlo Maccagno said that the goal is to move past just building plants for clients. He explained that by securing long-term feedstock supply and energy offtake agreements — such as selling power to utility giant Tenaga Nasional — the company could build a more stable and recurring revenue stream.

Maccagno described the move as a natural progression for Wasco, and one that fits well with its current renewable energy operations. At present, the company is involved in full EPCC projects for biomass facilities, including steam turbine supply, mainly serving the palm oil industry. In both Malaysia and Indonesia, empty fruit bunches (EFB) from palm oil mills present a largely untapped source of biomass energy.

Despite the opportunity, Maccagno stressed that Wasco will only commit to projects once it has secured both supply and demand. “The risk is if either the feedstock provider pulls out or the energy buyer fails to follow through. We won’t proceed unless all key aspects are in place,” he said. He added that each plant could cost between RM30 million and RM40 million.

Wasco is not setting a deadline for its first biomass investment, preferring to wait for the right conditions. “There’s no urgency. Our existing business is performing well. But this strategy offers a promising future, as it can reduce the ups and downs of project-based income,” Maccagno noted.

This move aligns with Malaysia’s broader energy policy, which is increasingly supporting renewable sources like biomass and small hydro, in addition to solar power.

As of the end of financial year 2024, Wasco reported a group order book of RM2.5 billion, with 85% coming from the O&G sector and the remaining 15% from renewable energy. Its tender book currently stands at RM13 billion.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biomass-3.jpeg,N,,2025-05-30 06:56:38.070459

The SAF market is still in its infancy, and those that scale first stand to command premium valuations.","The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is at a crossroads. With global airlines under pressure to slash emissions and governments tightening regulations, companies like LanzaTech (NASDAQ: LNZT) are racing to scale production of cost-effective, low-carbon alternatives to traditional jet fuel. But can LanzaTech's recent leadership shakeups and cost-cutting measures position it to dominate this $300 billion opportunity? Let's dissect the operational and financial shifts—and why investors should take note.

Leadership Transitions: A Focus on Financial and Legal Strength

LanzaTech's leadership overhaul in 2025 signals a sharp pivot toward operational discipline. The promotion of Sushmita Koyanagi to CFO—replacing interim CFO Justin Pugh—brings critical expertise. Koyanagi's deep financial reporting experience and track record in team leadership could be pivotal as LanzaTech navigates its ambitious growth plans. Meanwhile, Amanda Fuisz stepping into the interim General Counsel role stabilizes governance amid a period of rapid expansion.

But the most significant move? The retirement of Gary Rieschel, a longtime board member and champion of LanzaTech's circular carbon economy vision. While his departure marks the end of an era, it also clears space for a board more focused on execution rather than vision-building—a necessity as the company shifts from R&D to commercialization.

Cost-Cutting: A $30 Million Gamble on Focus and Scale

LanzaTech's cost optimization initiatives are no minor tweak. The planned $30 million in annual operating expense reductions—achieved through workforce consolidation (10–15% globally) and strategic reallocation—aims to free capital for high-impact projects. But this isn't just about trimming fat. By spinning off its LanzaX synthetic biology platform and exploring partnerships for its LanzaTech Nutritional Protein (LNP) division, LanzaTech is doubling down on its core competency: Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology for SAF production.

This focus is strategic. The company's LanzaJet subsidiary is already advancing 30-million-gallon-per-year SAF facilities in the U.K. and EU, leveraging waste carbon and biomass. Partnerships with BioD in Colombia, Eramet in Norway, and Air New Zealand in New Zealand further cement its global footprint. By sidelining less profitable ventures, LanzaTech is channeling resources into projects with clear scalability and regulatory tailwinds.

The SAF Market: A Gold Rush with Clear Winners

The SAF market is projected to grow at a 22% CAGR through 2030, driven by mandates like the U.S. Clean Air Act and the EU's ReFuelEU initiative. LanzaTech's ATJ technology is a standout, converting ethanol from industrial emissions and agricultural waste into SAF—a process that slashes lifecycle emissions by up to 70% compared to fossil fuels.

Regulatory support is stacking up, too. The Expanding Clean Fuel Production Act in the U.S. could extend tax credits critical to SAF's competitiveness, while LanzaTech's DOE-backed CO2-to-ethylene projects add diversification. Yet the path isn't without hurdles: project delays, capital constraints, and competition from traditional oil giants.

Why This Matters for Investors

LanzaTech's restructuring isn't just about cutting costs—it's about prioritizing profitability in a winner-takes-all market. By streamlining operations, securing partnerships, and focusing on its proprietary technology, the company is positioning itself to capitalize on SAF's explosive growth. The $30 million in savings alone could fund critical expansions, while spinning off LanzaX could unlock synergies for both entities.

The risks? Yes. The SAF market remains nascent, and execution is far from guaranteed. But with $1 billion in secured project funding, a growing pipeline of partnerships, and leadership now laser-focused on commercialization, LanzaTech is emerging as a leader in a sector that's primed to boom.

Final Take: A Buy Signal for the Bold

LanzaTech's moves are risky but purposeful. For investors willing to bet on a company that's aggressively pivoting from innovator to industry player, the rewards could be substantial. The SAF market is still in its infancy, and those that scale first stand to command premium valuations.

The verdict? LanzaTech's restructuring isn't just about survival—it's about dominance. With the right execution, this could be the moment the company transitions from a promising idea to a profit-driven titan. For investors ready to back a carbon-negative future, the time to act is now.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-1ac25ea756d38002.png,N,,2025-05-30 09:56:09.174974

A one-size-fits-all SAF index isn’t fungible in this complex emerging market.
A key enabler to overcoming this challenge is bringing transparency and a level playing field to the industry through the creation of new SAF price indexes, developed by General Index.
Neil Bradford, CEO and founder, General Index, said, “Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets.
That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies.","General Index (GX) and ATOBA Energy are excited to announce their strategic partnership, bringing a brand-new vision of how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) benchmarks are built. SAF indexes need to be tailored to the unique cost profiles of diverse production technologies, delivering the right information required to scale the SAF industry for aviation goal of net zero by 2050.

For more than half a century, the aviation industry has relied on traditional price reporting services to manage exposure to price risks in the fossil jet fuel market. But the SAF revolution demands a new approach. Unlike traditional fuels, SAF can be produced from a wide variety of certified technologies, each with distinct feedstocks, costs, CO2 reduction capabilities and production scalability – and, at the end, producing similar drop-in aviation fuels. A one-size-fits-all SAF index isn’t fungible in this complex emerging market.

ATOBA recognizes that the immediate hurdle to overcome is unlocking investment and building confidence in bankable long-term offtake agreements for new production facilities. A key enabler to overcoming this challenge is bringing transparency and a level playing field to the industry through the creation of new SAF price indexes, developed by General Index. Each index will be designed to reflect the unique cost profile of the diverse SAF technologies and aggregated to create a benchmark that aligns with regulatory frameworks, regional nuances and market needs.

Neil Bradford, CEO and founder, General Index, said, “Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets. We’re already a benchmark partner to the European Commission for the official 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Now, by partnering with ATOBA Energy, we’re helping to build the foundational infrastructure needed to attract investment, support offtake agreements, and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero.”

Arnaud Namer, CEO & co-founder ATOBA Energy, said, “Unlocking investment in sustainable aviation fuel starts with transparency, market confidence, and trusted pricing tools. That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies. These benchmarks are critical to ensuring SAF is competitively priced for airlines—an advantage we deliver thanks to our diversified portfolio of best-in-class SAF producers and long-term offtake aggregation strategy.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Atoba_General_Index_945fca3b32.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 02:57:20.838606

Author: Anna Simet Director of Content & Senior Editor Biodiesel Magazine","It seems that every day this magazine is in production, something changes policywise. Just this week, we’ve seen lots of movement with the release of President Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful bill” and its potential 45Z implications, as well as the U.S. EPA’s delivery of two Renewable Fuel Standard rulemakings to the White House Office of Management and Budget. One of those rulings for the 2026 renewable volume obligations and purportedly “also contains several regulatory changes to the RFS program intended to improve the program’s implementation.”

I haven’t yet come across any speculation as to what these changes are, but rumors allege that the renewable volume obligation proposal for biomass-based diesel will not be set at the industry’s ask of 5.25 billion gallons, but short of that. It’s expected we’ll know in late May or early June, so the waiting game continues.

In any case, I’ve had to make some updates to feature article “Ready to Bounce Back” on page 14, and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if by the time this magazine hits desks, even more has changed. The policy pieces that the industry has been waiting for are long overdue, so these movements are very welcome. My main interview for this article was with Grant Kimberley of the Iowa Biodiesel Board and Iowa Soybean Association. Iowa has the most biodiesel plants of all the states at 10, with a collective production capacity at 416 MMgy. In the article, he discusses the impact that policy inaction has had on Iowa’s biodiesel industry, and what is needed overall to get back to a healthy state. In particular, he emphasizes the critical impact of strong RVOs. “All indications from experts and marketplace are that a strong RVO would reset the RFS in a very positive way, strengthen RIN prices and be a huge boom to the marketplace,” Kimberley says.

Changing gears a bit, our page-21 feature shifts the focus to Canada. In “Fueling Canadian Decarbonization,” associate editor Katie Schroeder takes a deep dive into the Canadian biofuel sector—what it looks like and where it’s headed, the policy and incentives available (and needed) to help with the buildout, and how the United States’ biofuel policy has impacted development there.

Finally, we’re about three weeks out from the International Fuel Ethanol Workshop being held in Omaha, Nebraska, June 10-12. Being held in conjunction with that is the Sustainable Fuels Summit, which is focused solely on biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. It’s great timing to connect with stakeholders and learn about the impacts impending policy could or will have on the industry, among many other things.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) – An unpredictable trade war and daunting environmental targets are on the agenda for global airline bosses at an annual summit in India, as the industry’s outlook is clouded by concerns that geopolitical uncertainty will dampen travel demand and raise costs.

More people are flying than ever before after a full post-pandemic passenger market recovery, but airlines globally are facing rising cost pressures, extended plane delivery delays, lingering supply chain bottlenecks and falling airfares.

On top of this, President Donald Trump’s evolving trade war has upended the global aerospace industry’s decades-old tariff-free status and added a new layer of volatility and risk.

While carriers in Europe and Asia report strong demand for flying, the U.S. airline sector has been hit by a recent slump in travel demand, with carriers struggling to forecast passenger behaviour and operational costs.

The influential International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents more than 300 airlines and over 80% of global air traffic, will hold its annual three-day meeting from Sunday in New Delhi.

The summit, hosted by India’s largest carrier IndiGo, comes as the world’s third-largest air passenger market rapidly expands its aviation industry, and as air travel growth in Asia is expected to outstrip Europe and North America for the next few decades.

India’s recent hostilities with neighbour Pakistan, which is causing Indian airlines to take large, expensive detours around Pakistani airspace, highlights how conflict zones are an increasing burden on airline operations and profitability.

IATA said in February that accidents and incidents related to conflict zones are a top concern for aviation safety requiring urgent global coordination.

Aviation safety will also be in focus after a spate of air accidents in Kazakhstan, South Korea and North America over the past six months, and rising concerns about air traffic control systems in the United States.

NET-ZERO DOUBTS

IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will not meet their sustainability goals, and that it is not clear how the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and new technologies will be financed.

Airlines agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF, which is made from waste oil and biomass and costs more than conventional jet fuel.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh has in recent weeks said the industry will need to re-evaluate the commitment.

Airlines are being expected to bear the cost of the more expensive fuel and are not getting the support they need from SAF manufacturers, Walsh has said. Delays by Airbus and Boeing in delivering new, more fuel-efficient aircraft are also causing headaches for airlines.

IATA said 1 million metric tons of SAF was produced globally in 2024, below forecasts of 1.5 million tons, and described production as disappointingly slow.

“Demand for SAF continues to outstrip supply, and costs remain prohibitively high. Regulatory frameworks to encourage SAF production are still underdeveloped, inconsistent, or insufficient,” said Subhas Menon, the director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.

""Boeing has been a pioneer in making sustainable aviation fuels a reality.","The Covid-19 pandemic has captured the attention of the travel and tourism industry, due to the challenges it has posed. This year the situation will improve until reaching 2019 levels, in fact, a new investigation by the World Travel and Tourism Council reveals that the sector's contribution to the world economy could reach 8.6 billion dollars during 2022, only 6.4% per below pre-pandemic levels.

The study highlights that the industry could generate 58 million jobs this year, to reach the number of more than 330 million jobs, that is, only 1% below pre-pandemic levels and 21.5 % more than in 2020.

With these data in hand, the focus can begin to be placed on other urgent issues to be resolved, such as caring for the environment. It is clear that without a healthy planet, there is no tourism. Climate change causes considerable and often irreparable damage.

Commercial aviation has taken a new big step after the Toulouse Aviation Summit, held under the auspices of the French Presidency of the European Union, the event concluded with a new Declaration calling on all countries to take action to achieve a decarbonized aviation sector by 2050.

The Declaration was signed by 42 States, including the 27 member countries of the European Union, as well as Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Morocco and Georgia. It was also adopted by 146 industry stakeholder groups that participated in the event, including the top five European aviation associations represented through Destination 2050.

The signatories to the Declaration called on all public and private stakeholders to work together in preparation for the 41st ICAO Assembly later this year, where countries are expected to adopt a new global long-term goal applicable to the reduction/elimination of emissions from international flights.

MarketsandMarkets' new report ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market by Fuel Type"" estimates that in 2021 it could reach $219 million and is expected to reach $15,716 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 60.8% over the period forecast. The growing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the increase in passenger air traffic and the high fuel efficiency of biofuels are some of the key factors driving the market for sustainable aviation fuel. Government initiatives, such as tax reductions on the use of green and clean aviation fuels, will drive the growth of sustainable aviation fuel in the future.

By type, the sustainable aviation fuel market has been segmented into biofuel, hydrogen fuel, and power-to-liquid. The biofuels segment is estimated to account for the largest share during the forecast period. Reaching the GHG emission reduction targets proposed by the aviation industry and by organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will require a significant increase in the production and consumption of biofuels, thus boosting the market. In addition, the ability to incorporate unchanged aircraft infrastructure drives demand for biofuels.

Based on biofuel manufacturing technology, the Hydroprocessed Fatty Acid Esters and Fatty Acids – Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) segment is projected to lead the sustainable aviation fuel market during the forecast period.

There have been several initiatives taken by airlines to test and implement blended fueling in their aircraft fleet. For example, in June 2019, United Airlines took a flight from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles, powered by a 30% blend of sustainable aviation fuel produced by World Energy. The blended fuel met the same fuel specifications as Jet A with added environmental benefits.

Boeing determined to make the leap

The manufacturer announced a supply agreement for two million gallons (7.5 million liters) of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with EPIC Fuels to power its commercial aircraft operations in the state of Washington and South Carolina through 2022. The deal is the largest SAF acquisition announced by an aircraft manufacturer and further demonstrates Boeing's commitment to decarbonizing aviation.

""SAF is an immediate, safe and proven solution that will help achieve our industry's long-term commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" says Sheila Remes, Boeing's vice president of Environmental Sustainability. ""Boeing has been a pioneer in making sustainable aviation fuels a reality. Through this agreement, we will reduce our carbon footprint and have SAF available for deliveries to customers, as well as for our own operations.""

The Covid-19 pandemic has captured the attention of the travel and tourism industry, due to the challenges it has posed. This year the situation will improve until reaching 2019 levels, in fact, a new investigation by the World Travel and Tourism Council reveals that the sector's contribution to the world economy could reach 8.6 billion dollars during 2022, only 6.4% per below pre-pandemic levels.

The study highlights that the industry could generate 58 million jobs this year, to reach the number of more than 330 million jobs, that is, only 1% below pre-pandemic levels and 21.5 % more than in 2020.

With these data in hand, the focus can begin to be placed on other urgent issues to be resolved, such as caring for the environment. It is clear that, without a healthy planet, there is no tourism. Climate change causes considerable and often irreparable damage.

Commercial aviation has taken a new big step after the Toulouse Aviation Summit, held under the auspices of the French Presidency of the European Union, the event concluded with a new Declaration calling on all countries to take action to achieve a decarbonized aviation sector by 2050.

The Declaration was signed by 42 States, including the 27 member countries of the European Union, as well as Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Morocco and Georgia. It was also adopted by 146 industry stakeholder groups that participated in the event, including the top five European aviation associations represented through Destination 2050.

The signatories to the Declaration called on all public and private stakeholders to work together in preparation for the 41st ICAO Assembly later this year, where countries are expected to adopt a new global long-term goal applicable to the reduction/elimination of emissions from international flights.

According to the new research report, the ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market by Fuel Type (Biofuel, Hydrogen Fuel, Power to Liquid Fuel, Gas to Liquid), Biofuel Manufacturing Technology (FT-SPK, HEFA-SPK, ATJ-SPK, HFS-SIP, CHJ), Biofuel Blending Capacity, Platform, Region - Global Forecast to 2030"", published by MarketsandMarkets™, the market is estimated at USD 219 million in 2021 and is expected to reach USD 15,716 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 60.8% during the forecast period. The growing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the increase in passenger air traffic and the high fuel efficiency of biofuels are some of the key factors driving the market for sustainable aviation fuel.

Based on fuel type, biofuel is expected to account for the largest share of the sustainable aviation fuel market in 2020

By type, the sustainable aviation fuel market has been segmented into biofuel, hydrogen fuel, and power-to-liquid. The biofuels segment is estimated to account for the largest share during the forecast period. Reaching the GHG emission reduction targets proposed by the aviation industry and by organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will require a significant increase in the production and consumption of biofuels, thus boosting the market. In addition, the ability to incorporate unchanged aircraft infrastructure drives demand for biofuels.

Based on biofuel manufacturing technology, the Hydroprocessed Fatty Acid Esters and Fatty Acids – Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) segment is projected to lead the sustainable aviation fuel market during the forecast period.

There have been several initiatives carried out by airlines to test and implement blended fuel in their aircraft fleet. For example, in June 2019, United Airlines took a flight from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles, powered by a 30% blend of sustainable aviation fuel produced by World Energy. The blended fuel met the same fuel specifications as Jet A with added environmental benefits.

Reporting from San Francisco

US green fuel company HIF Global has a big vision for Texas's Matagorda County: a $7bn (£5.2bn) commercial scale e-methanol factory to supply the world market.

The plant, which it claims would be the largest to date anywhere, would make e-methanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced on site using renewable energy.

Its construction would create thousands of jobs and the product would power ships and planes in a far cleaner way.

But the company has yet to make its final investment decision. It is waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production.

The fate of the subsidies is part of a sweeping budget bill currently under consideration by the Senate.

A version of the legislation passed by the lower house cuts the hydrogen tax credit, amongst others, and scales back more.

The clean hydrogen tax credit would help reduce the cost of the American technology going into the facility, and aide in competing with Chinese e-methanol producers, says Lee Beck, HIF Global's senior vice president for global policy and commercial strategy.

""The goal is not to be dependent on tax credits over the long run, but to get the project started.""

Ms Beck can't say yet what the outcome for the Matagorda facility will be if the tax credit is ultimately killed, except that it will make things hard – and the US isn't the only location the company operates in.

The Trump administration has been particularly hostile to green energy.

Amongst the President's actions since taking office in January include initiating the US's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and temporarily suspending renewable energy projects on federal lands (he has a particular disdain for wind power).

Trump has also directed agencies to pause Green New Deal funds, which he regularly calls ""Green New Scam"" funds: grants and loans being made under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden's presidency in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

Those grants and loans, together with the clean energy tax credits that are also part of the IRA, have been funnelling billions of new federal and private dollars into developing clean energy.

""It is tumultuous time,"" says Adie Tomer, of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""We are doing the exact opposite of our developed world peers.""

Court battles are ongoing over the President's order to pause green funding, which might ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, agencies are conducting their own reviews and making their own decisions.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which represents companies involved in carbon capture and storage, laments the lack of clarity from the administration.

Members, she explains, have won project funding under the IIJA – including, for example, to build direct air capture facilities. But while projects generally have been able to access funds already awarded to earlier phases, it is unclear if they will be able to progress to additional phases where additional funds are supposed to be made available.

""It is causing uncertainty, which is really bad for project deployment,"" says Ms Stolark. ""If you endanger the success of these first-of-a-kind projects it just takes the wind out of the sails of the whole [carbon management] industry long term.""

Meanwhile, the fate of the IRA, which the Congress has the power to amend or repeal along with the IIJA, is being decided, in part, by the budget bill, which aims to permanently extend President Trump's first term tax cuts by making savings elsewhere.

What exactly will remain of the Federal green energy agenda when both the House and Senate agree a compromise version remains to be seen.

It seems likely the IRA's tax credits, which are generally scheduled to expire at the end of 2032, though some extend beyond that date, will take a heavy hit, even if the IRA dodges the bullet of outright repeal.

Also marked for termination include the tax credits for consumers buying EVs and making their homes more efficient.

Many others, such as those for producing clean electricity and manufacturing clean energy components like wind turbine parts, solar panels and batteries, would be phased out earlier or made harder and less worthwhile to secure.

That many of the projects set to benefit from the tax credits are in Republican areas seems to have had little sway in the House, notes Ashur Nissan of policy advice firm Kaya Partners.

But critics say that the Biden green energy initiatives are too expensive.

The IRA's energy tax credits are ""multiple times"" larger than initial estimates, and expose American taxpayers to ""potentially unlimited liability"" noted a recent report from the libertarian Cato Institute advocating their full repeal.

Meanwhile, actual clean energy investment in the US including from both government and private sources (the far larger share) dropped 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $67.3bn, a second quarterly decline, according to new figures released by the Clean Investment Monitor.

""Momentum is sagging a bit which is a little concerning,"" says Hannah Hess of the Rhodium Group research firm, which partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce it. She attributes the trend to a mix of high inflation, high interest rates, global supply chain issues and uncertainty in the policy environment created by the new administration.

There was also, she observes, a record number of clean energy manufacturing projects cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 – six projects mostly in batteries and representing $6.9bn in investment– though it is difficult to say to what extent the new administration was a driver.

More worrying to Ms Hess is the decline since the last quarter in announcements for some types of new projects, which she believes can be ""more strongly"" attributed to the policy situation, with companies lacking confidence there will be demand for the clean products their projects would produce.

Tariffs, which will increase factory construction costs if components need to be imported, are an extra factor that may negatively influence project decisions going forward, notes Anthony DeOrsey of the Cleantech Group research and consulting firm.

Investment aside, companies are also making shifts in how they market their products.

The homepage of LanzaJet – which produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol – used to emphasise how scaling SAF could ""meet the urgent moment of climate change"". It now focusses on its potential to ""harness the energy of locally produced feedstocks"".

SAF has never been about just one thing, notes CEO Jimmy Samartzis. Tailoring messaging to be ""relevant to the stakeholders we are engaging with"" makes sense.

The company is current waiting on a $3m grant it was awarded by the Federal Aviation Authority last August as part of a nearly $300m program designed to help aviation transition to SAF and which was funded under the IRA.

""It is approved funding, but it is stuck at this point,"" says Mr Samartzis.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2b61/live/52a048b0-3bb9-11f0-a20d-1b53273f2a3b.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 19:56:47.190036

The pump in Urbandale is now the second station in the country with the high blend of biodiesel fuel, but the first station with an above-ground pump.

Biodiesel supports the soybean industry Biodiesel in Iowa is made primarily from soybean oil, which means biodiesel demand is directly linked with soybean demand.
According to 2024 figures from the Iowa Biodiesel Board, the industry added $2.2 billion in total sales and $123 million in labor income to the state’s economy.","URBANDALE— The Des Moines region is now home to the first above-ground B99 fueling pump, an action that was celebrated Thursday morning by leaders in the biofuels, trucking and soybean industries.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the new pump, which allows certain semi trucks to fill up with a 99% biodiesel blended fuel, shows a completion of the ag supply chain, from the field to the biofuel refineries and now into a truck.

“Every time I see this, or think of an infrastructure investment, I just know that that’s more demand pulling through, and what that ultimately means is more demand for the things that we grow,” Naig said. “It adds value every single step throughout the chain.”

The pump is located at a Pilot fuel station in Urbandale, near the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Interstate 35, and for now will be used primarily by PepsiCo trucks which are equipped to utilize the fuel.

Eric Fobes, head of renewables for Pilot, said the new biodiesel pump is an adherence to the company’s commitment to “shaping the future of energy.”

“To me and our customers, it’s important that we are offering decarbonized solutions,” Fobes said. “This is one of those offers.”

The trucking company launched the first B99 pump at a travel center in Decatur, Illinois in March. The pump in Urbandale is now the second station in the country with the high blend of biodiesel fuel, but the first station with an above-ground pump. The company has plans to open another pump in Texas this summer.

PepsiCo has committed local trucks to using the biodiesel from the station, which is several minutes away from the beverage and snack company’s Urbandale plant.

Sarah Towles, senior director of government affairs for PepsiCo, said the partnership with Pilot represents “real scalable solutions” for long haul transportation. Towles said PepsiCo has about 20 trucks prepared to use the station currently, but plans to equip other trucks in the future.

Karl Thomas with Optimus Technologies, the company that helped to outfit the PepsiCo trucks to use the fuel, said decarbonizing the industry requires collaboration.

“Together, we’re building an ecosystem for sustainable trucking by introducing a new fuel to the commercial trucking market in the U.S.” Thomsas said.

Thomas said Optimus developed a vector system in the trucks which keeps the biodiesel from gelling during colder months. Thomas said this technology, and equipping long haul trucks to run on higher blends of biodiesel is “one of the lowest cost technologies to decarbonize heavy duty trucking.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates 23% of transportation related carbon dioxide emissions came from medium and heavy-duty trucking. The agency encourages the industry to transition to lower emission fuels, like biofuels, hydrogen or compressed natural gas to lower emissions.

Biodiesel supports the soybean industry

Biodiesel in Iowa is made primarily from soybean oil, which means biodiesel demand is directly linked with soybean demand.

Dave Walton, a director for both Iowa Soybean Association and Iowa Biodiesel Board, said the pump represents, “real on the ground, progress in Americans’ transition to cleaner fuels.”

“By fueling their Des Moines based fleet at this B99 pump, PepsiCo is showing that high blends of biodiesel aren’t just a future concept, they’re here and now, and working,” Walton said.

Walton said biodiesel is critical to the farm economy and that the industry adds a 13% value to each bushel of soybeans produced by Iowa farmers.

According to 2024 figures from the Iowa Biodiesel Board, the industry added $2.2 billion in total sales and $123 million in labor income to the state’s economy.

“Projects like today’s expands consumer access to affordable domestic homegrown fuels that increase good paying jobs for our hardworking Americans,” Walton said.

Walton also commended Iowa lawmakers, specifically Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale and Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale who were in attendance, for supporting state incentives on biodiesel blends.

Calls for federal support

While the industry a high performing year, with a total of 350 million gallons of biodiesel produced in 2024, Walton said several plants in the state are idle due to the uncertainty of federal tax credits.

Walton said he also hopes EPA will approve 5.25 billion gallons of biodiesel for the upcoming Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. This standard sets the minimum amount of renewable fuels required to be blended, annually, into diesel and gasoline. According to EPA, the 2025 requirement for biodiesel was 3.35 billion gallons.

Naig echoed the call for “strong” Renewable Volume Obligations under RFS and said producers also need clear guidance on tax policy.

Renewable fuel producers in Iowa have been advocating for, and waiting on, definitive guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury on the 45z tax credit, which would incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel and other plant-based fuels.

A bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines, could also impact the biofuels industry’s ability to use these credits, which is a major reason why the industry has opposed the legislation, which is currently sitting on Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk.

Naig said he has heard from folks on both sides of the issue, but the decision on the bill rests with Reynolds and her council.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8869-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:56:34.116026

The May 21 flight and landing at Edwards AFB, Calif., came about five months later than the Atlanta-based company had hoped. The main goal of the company’s test campaign is to validate high-speed takeoff and landing.

The company said the successful test campaign and flight of the Mk 1 “validated design and performance models, including aerodynamics, stability and control. Testing also validated performance of vehicle subsystems including propulsion, fuel systems, hydraulics, power, thermal management, avionics, flight software, telemetry, flight termination, and command and control.”

The Mk 1 is powered by the GE Aerospace J85 engine. The Mk 2 will be powered by the RTX Pratt & Whitney F100-229 turbofan engines used on the Air Force’s F-15 and F-16 fighters. The F100 will feature a precooler to give the engine more speed, a feature of the startup’s future Chimera engine this is a hybrid of a turbojet for takeoff to get an aircraft to supersonic speeds, and a ramjet that will allow an aircraft to reach hypersonic speeds.

A successful flight is also seen as important to demonstrate the business perspective for investors and customers.

Design of the Mk 1 began in the fourth quarter of 2023.

But the potential could be “very significant"" if stepped-up to commercial levels, said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger, speaking to Canada’s National Observer.
These sustainable aviation fuel projects are clearly addressing a need articulated by government and industry,"" said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger.
SAFs can produce 80 per cent lower emissions than conventional jet kerosene.
This could reduce emissions by 15-20 per cent for aircraft departures from Canada.","Aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing has invested almost $17.5 million with a trio of Canadian sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pioneers aiming to accelerate development of technologies that could help convert the country’s lumber waste and CO2 emissions into low-carbon jet fuels.

Boeing will invest $10 million in a joint venture between Quebec companies Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables to advance a project that will turn sawmill by-products into biocrude for SAF, and $7.5 million in a pilot plant being built in BC by Dimensional Energy that can capture CO2 directly from industrial facility emissions and transforms it into green synthetic fuel.

The volumes of SAF produced by the pilot projects will be relatively small: a total of 50 million gallons a year compared to the almost 100,000 million gallons currently burned annually by passenger airlines, according to Statista, a data portal. But the potential could be “very significant"" if stepped-up to commercial levels, said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger, speaking to Canada’s National Observer.

Chris Lohman, Boeing Canada’s head of sustainability, added: “These two projects were selected because of the enormous latent energy sources in Canada that they have the potential to unlock: sawmill waste residue that in years gone by went into the pulp and paper industry but is now looking for new uses and end-products, and CO2 that comes from heavy-emitting industry.”

“We are a global company and committed to supporting Canada’s objective of being net-zero by 2050. These sustainable aviation fuel projects are clearly addressing a need articulated by government and industry,"" said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger.

Canada Transport’s climate action plan targets 10 per cent of aviation fuel being replaced by SAF by 2030 to decarbonize a sector that globally accounts for over two per cent of all CO2 emissions, according to the Air Transport Action Group, a lobbyist. SAFs can produce 80 per cent lower emissions than conventional jet kerosene.

“SAF is a very complicated nut to crack and each concept has its own unique challenges so it is important Boeing support companies to move these technologies down the field,” said Lohman.

SAFs — which can be generated from a range of industrial and commercial feedstocks as well as captured carbon — have the potential to make up 65 per cent of the emissions reduction needed by the aviation sector to reach net-zero in 2050, according to figures from the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade body.

Technology ‘valley of death’

The SAF generated by the two projects backed by Boeing will first be trialled in 16 P-8A Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance military aircraft ordered from Boeing by the Canadian government in November 2023, but Meinzinger said it was targeting future use in commercial airliners.

“These projects are aimed at the broadest possible market. We want to help these technologies traverse the ‘valley of death’ [between innovative concepts to commercial production] and get over the key engineering challenges so that they can get to economic scale,” he said.

Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables’ project, called Projet Avance, points to Canada’s “unique opportunity” with SAF, said Lohman, given the “vast, ready-made biomass resource” that can be found in the forested regions across the country “not just to create a useful low-carbon fuel for use in Canada but also one that is exportable.”

The Dimension Energy project, which will capture CO2 straight off a flue stack at a Lafarge cement facility in Richmond, BC, he added, is “highly replicable anywhere you have greenhouse gases being generated by heavy industry.”

The Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels — made up of 60 airlines operating in the country — laid out a roadmap in 2023 aiming to have 265 million gallons of SAF being produced domestically by 2030 and by 2035 enough to meet 25 per cent of total demand. This could reduce emissions by 15-20 per cent for aircraft departures from Canada.

Meinzinger believes Canada is “not going to get anywhere” in its energy transition without moving away from its historical focus on energy-intensive fossil fuel-based products and services: “The world is energy-hungry but, in the long term, also sustainability-hungry.”

Lohman added that Canada “needs to make more of what we need here with what we’ve got,” adding that SAF is “at the intersection of this reality.”

SAF technologies, he said, can “disentangle” Canada from its dependence on petroleum for jet fuel by using biomass and CO2 to build more sustainable industries.

“This investment in new industries will bring enormous rewards if it bridges the gap between innovative technology and commercial products – jobs, economic development, expanded export markets,” he said.",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/05/29/dimension_energy_saf_2.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 17:56:50.646335

“The way we make cars, the way we make TVs, the way we make semiconductor chips should be the same way we make chemicals plants,” Brix said.
Much of the world’s supply of the chemicals is from factories that are part of China’s expanding coal-fed chemicals industry.
But OCOchem doesn’t need a ​“green premium” for its low-carbon bona fides, Brix said.
That causes cost problems and safety problems,” Xu said, especially for chemicals being transported by truck or train.","The global chemicals industry is big, and it’s dirty. Chemical plants consume lots of fossil fuels, both to power the high-temperature, high-pressure processes involved and often as a feedstock for the chemicals produced. And to maximize production, those plants are typically built to be as large as possible.

Todd Brix, CEO of startup OCOchem, has a different vision for how to build a modern chemicals industry: Manufacture lots of small machines that are powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels to do the work.

“The way we make cars, the way we make TVs, the way we make semiconductor chips should be the same way we make chemicals plants,” Brix said.

Last week, the company’s pilot plant in Richland, Washington, started producing a class of chemicals known as formates, used in everything from deicing airplanes to preserving animal feed. But instead of the conventional hot, dirty method of combining methanol with carbon monoxide derived from fossil fuels, OCOchem makes formate with just water and carbon dioxide inside four 1.5-meter electrolytic modules.

OCOchem fills those modules with water and carbon dioxide and then zaps the solution with electricity, causing an electrochemical reaction that yields formic acid, a combination of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. Chemically speaking, it’s ​“one of the simplest molecules you can imagine,” Brix said — basically, ​“CO2 with two hydrogen atoms attached to it.”

The $5 million project can make up to 60 tons of formic acid per year. That’s not a lot, compared with the roughly 1 million tons per year of formates produced globally. But being able to deliver an industrial chemical cost-effectively in such small amounts is one of the selling points, Brix explained.

“Once you want to scale out and make more formate, you just make more modules. That’s the power of economies of scale of mass production,” he said. ​“We can rapidly scale that technology out, and make a lot of little chemical plants, and stack them together.”

Factory-built modular devices are being tried out across various industries, from fertilizer to steel — and they are even being considered for nuclear power. It’s already a winning pathway in the renewable energy sector, where mass-produced solar panels and lithium-ion battery cells have seen costs drop steeply as production volumes increase and manufacturers consistently improve each new generation of products.

“What the solar industry does is mass-produce solar panels — and what we are trying to do is mass-produce chemical plants,” Brix said. ​“That allows you to dramatically lower the costs over time.”

Tiny chemicals-production cells are a bit more complicated than solar panels, of course. But OCOchem’s electrolytic cells aren’t taking on anything as dangerous as nuclear fission. Brix described the process as akin to ​“artificial photosynthesis.” Plants use water, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the energy from sunlight. OCOchem cells, which operate at ambient temperatures and pressures, electrify water and carbon dioxide and emit only formic acid, which is corrosive but not flammable or explosive.

Using electrolysis to produce formate is far from a unique idea, said Brix, who worked at Chevron, Intel, and Microsoft before founding OCOchem in 2020. In fact, researchers have been trying to do it for decades. But the efforts he’s aware of have struggled to expand cells to a size that can support commercially viable volumes.

“We started with a reactor that was 10 square centimeters in size,” Brix said. ​“We’ve scaled that up by a factor of 1,500.” OCOchem has developed patented technologies that can handle the required current density, or electrical throughput, to achieve this increased size and manufactures these key components itself. It then works with a contract manufacturer to assemble them into cells, which otherwise use off-the-shelf equipment from other electrolysis-based industries.

OCOchem raised $5 million in 2023 and has secured federal and state grants for its early technology development, as well as an undisclosed amount of early-stage support from Halliburton Labs, the tech accelerator of oil services company Halliburton. The four cells in the pilot facility are the first it’s produced via this assembly-line process, Brix said, but the company is preparing to scale up its manufacturing to meet orders for more than $300 million in prepurchase contracts.

Those contracts are for the formate it will make, not for the equipment itself, he noted. ​“Our goal is to be the developer of the technology and operator of the plant and share ownership of the plant with various partners.”

A cleaner — and cheaper — path to bigger chemicals markets?

OCOchem’s process emits no carbon dioxide, unlike the fossil-fuel-based processes used to make formates today, Brix said. Much of the world’s supply of the chemicals is from factories that are part of China’s expanding coal-fed chemicals industry. Whether OCOchem’s formate is considered low-, zero-, or negative-carbon depends on two key factors: the carbon footprint of the electricity used to make it and the carbon dioxide going into its cells.

Right now, OCOchem plans to get its CO2 ​“from the highest purity and cheapest sources we can find,” Brix said. ​“That turns out to be biogenic CO2,” or gas captured from ethanol plants, breweries, wastewater-treatment facilities, and similar sources. Some of that CO2 is used today as coolant in refrigeration and for carbonating beverages. CO2 that can’t find industrial purchasers is either captured at the expense of its emitter or, far more often, vented into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change.

Plenty of industries, ranging from sustainable aviation fuel to lower-carbon cement, are planning to rely on captured CO2 to decarbonize. Consulting firm EcoEngineers studied OCOchem’s process and found that every ton the company produces could avoid a combined 7.2 tons of CO2 emissions, compared with fossil-fuel-fed formate production, both by displacing fossil fuels and fixing captured CO2 in the formic acid it makes.

But OCOchem doesn’t need a ​“green premium” for its low-carbon bona fides, Brix said. Instead, it’s relying on offering customers a cost-competitive alternative to formate shipped from overseas. That’s not possible with its pilot-scale facility today, he stressed. But ​“even at 10,000 tons per year, which is a small chemical plant, we’ll have lower cost of production” than typical fossil-fuel-fed plants. ​“We can say, ​‘Whatever your market price is, we’ll meet it.’”

More chemical markets beckon. Formic acid can be processed into a number of organic compounds, including many now made from fossil fuels, he said — ​“not because they’re higher performance, or cleaner, or cheaper, but because they do the job good enough.”

Formates and formic acid could also serve as ​“hydrogen carriers,” Brix said. Hydrogen, when it’s produced in ways that don’t cause greenhouse gas emissions, can be used to cut the carbon impact of industries from steelmaking to shipping. It’s unlikely that OCOchem’s formates would be a cost-effective source of hydrogen at large volumes, but they could serve as a convenient medium for transporting hydrogen in trucks, he said.

The trick is to find cost-effective ways to separate the hydrogen molecules from the formates once they reach their destination, said Ye Xu, associate professor of chemical engineering at Louisiana State University. Xu specializes in research in ​“surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis” — the fundamental study of the interaction of solid catalysts with molecules. He’s been working on a project to crack hydrogen from formates in a way that’s economically viable—one of many being funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“If you need to transport huge quantities of hydrogen atoms, you have to compress hydrogen gas under extremely high pressure. That causes cost problems and safety problems,” Xu said, especially for chemicals being transported by truck or train. Hydrogen-bearing formates, by contrast, are ​“not flammable. They don’t explode. They are not toxic. These are some very attractive characteristics.”

When it comes to separating the hydrogen atoms from formate molecules at the end of the journey, so far ​“the stumbling block is the speed of the reaction,” he said. ​“Formates are stable substances and slowly decompose on their own.” Speeding up the process requires a catalyst, and ​“according to the scientific literature, the only catalyst that works is palladium” — a costly metal, which, like the chemically similar platinum, is already in high demand for electronics, automotive, and many other industrial uses.

Xu’s search for substitute catalysts to make formate a viable hydrogen carrier involves massive computational research as well as collaboration with scientists doing real-world research. In a way, Brix noted, it’s a similar process to the years of research that have gone into OCOchem’s core technologies, such as the gas-diffusion electrodes that allow it to electrolyze water and CO2 at commercial-scale volumes.

Taking such experiments from laboratory to pilot project to commercial production may be labor-intensive and costly. But building, testing, and redesigning the next generation of technologies is a lot easier and faster on an assembly line than as part of a complicated, yearslong engineering, procurement, and construction project to build large-scale facilities, Brix said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/OCOchem-cell-assembly-indoor-framing.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=18f1b215d9eb4728fdc775a7965fa035,N,,2025-05-30 00:56:21.750256

SABA, a joint initiative of RMI and Environmental Defense Fund, with support from the Center for Green Market Activation, said that the development of the platform gives buyers a ‘more flexible pathway to invest in high-integrity, commercially available SAF‘, as well as enabling firms to meet aviation decarbonisation goals.

Decarbonisation targets

“To meet the decarbonisation goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near and long-term investment into SAF,” commented Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of the SABA Secretariat. “With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.”

According to SABA, its member companies accessing SAFc Connect have an immediate demand for approximately $30 million worth of SAF certificates.

To date, some six SAFc providers, including Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group (the parent company of airlines including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL, and Vueling), JetBlue, Targray, and Valero, have committed to participating in SAFc Connect, with SABA expecting to double that umber in the coming months, as its membership numbers expand and companies ramp up 2030 decarbonisation efforts.

The unveiling of the new platform follows on from SABA launching a third RFP for next-generation fuels, designed to facilitate 5- to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members, earlier this month.

SAF certificates

Since launching in 2021, SABA has worked with corporate buyers to aggregate demand for over $400 million in SAF certificates – initially through a proof-of-concept pilot procurement, followed by 2023-2024’s groundbreaking multi-year procurement that supported tens of millions of gallons of SAF.

The SAFc Connect platform is open exclusively to SABA members.

‘The platform will be updated on a recurring basis with additional platform participation and offer volumes,’ SABA commented. ‘The enhanced flexibility and responsiveness built into the system is expected to encourage new SAF production and capture long term pricing benefits associated with economies of scale.’ Read more here.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSarYrCRgtflDS1W/188b56ad066f2933f9c65a6ce7bf27950d0e41027213cf3acfa97ae71ac84ff3/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=news-1&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%231e6000%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2024%252F12%252Flogo-white.png%253Ffit%253D1000%25252C141%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F05%252Fpexels-joerg-mangelsen-337913024-28513293.jpg%253Ffit%253D900%25252C600%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Sustainable%2520Aviation%2520Buyers%2520Alliance%2520unveils%2520SAFc%2520Connect%2520programme%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainabilityonline.net%2Fnews%2Fsustainable-aviation-buyers-alliance-unveils-safc-connect-programme,N,,2025-05-29 17:56:55.143908

White House seeks to suspend tariffs ruling: Update

White House seeks to suspend tariffs ruling: Update

Adds White House reaction, additional court action Washington, 29 May (Argus) — President Donald Trump's administration is asking a federal court to suspend a ruling issued late Wednesday that blocked emergency tariffs on nearly all imports, warning that failure to do so will be a foreign policy ""disaster"" and ""shatter"" trade negotiations with dozens of countries. The administration is asking the US Court of International Trade to stay its ruling — which would permanently enjoin tariffs now set at 10pc for much of the world, but which are set to revert to higher rates in July absent intervention by Trump — until it has time to pursue an appeal. The harm to foreign affairs from leaving the court ruling intact during an appeal ""could not be greater"", the administration said, whereas putting the decision on hold will preserve the status quo during an appeal. ""It is critical, for the country's national security and the president's conduct of ongoing, delicate diplomatic efforts, that the court stay its judgment,"" the administration wrote in a legal filing after the court issued its sweeping ruling. The White House said the three judges on the trade court panel behind the ruling, two of whom are Republican appointees, ""brazenly abused their judicial power to usurp"" Trump's authority. The administration expects appealing the unfavorable ruling ""all the way to the Supreme Court"" but believes other countries will continue to negotiate on trade agreements with the US as a way to prevent tariffs. In a further setback for the administration, the US District Court for the District of Columbia today ruled in a separate lawsuit that Trump did not have authority to impose the tariffs, which were issued under a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The effect of that ruling is far more limited and would only freeze tariffs on two small toy companies behind the lawsuit, in the event the broader ruling on Wednesday is put on hold. Trump began imposing the emergency tariffs at issue in the case just weeks into his second term, starting with a 25pc tariff from Canada and Mexico and a 10pc incremental tariff on China, claiming they were in response to the threat of drug trafficking. Trump vastly expanded his use of tariffs on ""Liberation Day"" on 2 April on nearly every country based on an alleged ""emergency"" of trade imbalances, raising tariffs to as high as 145pc on China before lowering them to 30pc. The Court of International Trade, in its ruling on Wednesday, found all of those tariffs were unlawful and gave the administration 10 days to implement its ruling. IEEPA did not offer Trump ""unbounded"" authority to put unlimited tariffs on nearly all goods imported in the US, the court said, but instead set limits on tariff authority that the administration did not follow. If that ruling is upheld on appeal, the US will be required to offer refunds of emergency tariffs that have already been paid. The ruling does not affect separate ""section 232"" tariffs that Trump has imposed on steel, aluminum and automobiles, and that are being planned for pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and critical minerals. Trump could also pursue non-emergency ""section 122"" tariffs that would allow tariffs of up to 15pc, but those could only be used for 150 days. The Trump administration, in its request for a stay, said the court's invalidation of emergency tariffs under IEEPA poses an immediate and ""grave"" harm to the US because those alternative tariff authorities do not allow the president to take ""swift and flexible"" actions that are needed to address national emergencies. At a minimum, the administration said the tariff suspension should only apply to the handful of manufacturers and states that filed the lawsuit. To support its stay request, the administration included a declaration by US secretary of state Marco Rubio saying the injunction would cause ""irreparable harm"" to foreign policy and national security, while US trade representative Jamieson Greer said it will be a ""foreign policy disaster scenario"". US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick wrote it would ""would destroy"" a carefully negotiated agreement with China. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned the ruling ""will threaten to shatter our negotiations with dozens of countries"" and create a risk that trading partners ""feel a renewed boldness to take advantage of"" a new ability to retaliate against the US. The White House did immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of the collection of the emergency tariffs. The Trump administration, in its legal filing, said a stay of the ruling would not harm those who brought the tariff lawsuit because the US ""will issue refunds"" along with any interest that accrues during the appeal.

Both companies are reinforcing their longstanding commitment to the Canary Islands, where they have been present for nearly a century, by leading the decarbonization of the maritime sector in the region

Moeve has reached a strategic agreement with Grupo Armas Trasmediterránea to supply 2G marine biofuels in the Canary Islands, with approximately 40,000 tons to be delivered through December 2025 under a long-term contract, with the potential for extension into 2026.

This deal marks Moeve’s largest biofuel supply to date, and its first in the Canary Islands, reinforcing the company’s leadership in the production and sale of sustainable solutions for maritime transport. This agreement also marks a major step in advancing decarbonization in the Canary Islands, a region where Moeve has maintained a nearly century-long presence and remains committed to driving the maritime sector’s energy transition.

Sergio Vélez, CEO of Armas Trasmediterránea, said that the signing of this agreement marks a new milestone in the company’s roadmap toward more sustainable shipping. “We’re not starting from scratch, we’ve been implementing measures to reduce our environmental footprint for years, from route optimization to becoming pioneers in the use of biofuels,” he emphasized. This step forward in biofuel adoption reinforces Armas Trasmediterránea’s commitment to decarbonizing the maritime transport sector and, in particular, protecting the marine environment. “It’s not only our natural working environment, it’s also a heritage we have the responsibility to preserve,” Vélez added.

As part of this pioneering agreement in the Canary Islands, both companies have visited Autoridades Porturias to reaffirm the value of the agreement in advancing the decarbonization of the sector. Beatriz Calzada, President of Autoridad Portuaria of Las Palmas, stated that the agreement “aligns perfectly with our strategy to transition toward green fuels. Our goal is to deliver operational excellence and offer a diverse range of services to our clients.” Meanwhile, Pedro Suárez, President of Autoridad Portuaria of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, emphasized, “We’ve spent years proactively positioning ourselves in the energy transition, with a strong commitment to sustainability. This first fuel supply marks a key milestone toward enabling more sustainable port calls and a more competitive port overall.”

Moeve produces these biofuels at its San Roque Energy Park (Cádiz) and La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, and already supplies Spain’s main ports, including Algeciras, Barcelona, Ceuta, and Huelva. Second-generation (2G) renewable biofuels can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 90% throughout their life cycle compared to traditional fuels, accelerating the energy transition and enabling sustainable mobility in hard-to-electrify sectors such as maritime transport. Additionally, they can be used immediately with existing infrastructure and engines, without the need for modifications or major investments, facilitating the sector’s rapid decarbonization.

Moeve has 90 years of experience in supplying maritime transport, with operations in over 60 Spanish ports, enabling full presence across the value chain, optimizing processes, and offering the most competitive products possible.

This progress is part of Moeve's 2030 Positive Motion strategy, through which the company seeks to lead sustainable mobility and promote the decarbonization of heavy transport (air, sea, and land) via the production of green molecules.

We're part of the E2E program. It stands for English to Engineering. That program is composed of five smaller undergraduate research teams, and we all share the common goal of furthering sustainable propulsion in the aerospace industry. So this is the SAF team. SAF stands for sustainable aerospace fuels. What we're looking at is how do the SAFs on the market, particularly HEFA-SPK, which is our most popular SAF right now. How do they work in traditional jet infrastructure and can they be drop in? Drop in means that a fuel can be basically dumped into an engine and they don't have to change any of the mechanisms. The main goal of this year specifically is to look at the interaction between the sustainable aviation fuel and the O rings and how that might be different than regular jet fuel. Basically to see, can we use normal HEFA-SPK, which is the sustainable aviation fuel, on current engines without the O rings breaking down or losing their performance. Two years ago, we found that the specific O rings we tested, which were Buna-N O rings, were quite reactive to the fuel. We're finding this year that that's not quite the case. With these Viton O rings, which are different compound. The sustainable aviation fuel O rings react a lot more similarly to the Jet A O rings than we thought. We like to call this program something that is vertically integrated, which means that we build off of each semester, and we develop our students to stay with the program throughout their undergrad years. I think it's cool that undergrads get the opportunity to lead a team, choose what they want to do, and publish a paper.

Veto this bill. Let’s get it right next year.

Iowa’s ethanol industry stands at a crossroads. For decades, we’ve fueled America’s cars with homegrown energy. But as electric vehicle sales rise — 1.3 million in 2024 alone, now nearly 10% of new cars — we must evolve to stay competitive.

Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel — the biggest opportunity Iowa agriculture has seen in decades. Planes won’t run on batteries anytime soon, and SAF needs low-carbon, liquid fuel. That’s a lane Iowa ethanol can dominate, but only if we have the infrastructure to compete.

Carbon capture unlocks that path. By storing CO2 emissions from ethanol plants, we lower the carbon intensity of ethanol and qualify for the booming SAF market — a market projected to demand billions of gallons annually. That means stronger corn demand, more stability for farmers, and long-term investment in Iowa’s future.

This isn’t theoretical. More than 1,320 Iowans have voluntarily signed easements with Summit Carbon Solutions to make this future real. In some counties, voluntary participation is 70%, 80%, even 90%. These are farmers and landowners — people who understand exactly what’s at stake and are choosing to lead.

That’s what makes the legislation passed by the Iowa House and Senate so disappointing. It doesn’t get the job done. It doesn’t solve the problem. And it sets back the very industry it claims to support.

Today I am asking Gov. Reynolds to veto this bill.

Not because she supports any one company, but because she supports Iowa’s largest industry — agriculture — and one of its most important products — ethanol. She knows what’s at stake for our state, and for the 42 ethanol plants already producing 4.6 billion gallons annually. Without access to SAF markets, we’re cutting off their future.

This bill is a step backward. It adds confusion, weakens our competitive edge, and threatens the kind of private investment Iowa needs to grow. And the unintended consequences are real. This bill doesn’t just apply to carbon pipelines—it affects all hazardous liquid infrastructure. If we start blocking one type of project, what’s next? Today it’s ethanol infrastructure — tomorrow it could be broadband, transmission lines, or even rural water systems. That’s a slippery slope Iowa can’t afford.

Let’s come back next year and do it the right way. Let’s bring agriculture, ethanol producers, landowners, and lawmakers to the table and find a real solution that balances property rights with progress. That protects our rural communities while paving the way for market access and long-term growth.

The sky’s the limit for Iowa — but only if we clear the runway. Gov. Reynolds, veto this bill.

Make learning great again

President Trump says foreign students at Harvard are occupying spots rightfully belonging to Americans. Therefore, a recent Executive Order bans Harvard from accepting international students.

Trump’s inability to see beyond his latest DEI revenge tour has blinded him to the myriad ways in which the world has benefitted from the contributions of Americans who made the arduous journey to Paris from 1830-1900, seeking experiences unavailable to them then in the U.S. Historian David McCullough’s 2011 book, “The Greater Journey” could enlighten him about this.

What if Samuel Morse had not braved the ocean journey, homesickness, harsh Paris winters, and the language barrier in pursuit of improving his art to then return home with his idea for the telegraph?

What if Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. had not formed his infection theories in France and put them into practice here, henceforth saving women from childbed fever? What if Holmes had not learned enough there to return here to teach evidence-based medical practices at Harvard?

What if James Fenimore Cooper had not lived in France and then returned home to write uniquely American fiction like “The Last of the Mohicans?”

What if Napoleon III had refused entrance to Morse, Holmes, Cooper, and other Americans whose knowledge gained in France has enhanced lives world-wide?

It seems to me that the greater journey for Americans living now is to make learning great again, to instill those values in our children, and to resist the short-sighted revenge of Trump and his loyalists.

Trump’s failed promises

On Inauguration Day, Trump said, “Our power will stop all wars.” He promised to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. World peace turns out to require a bit more than Mr. Trump has to offer, apparently.

He also said, “We will make Martin Luther King’s dream come true.” I wonder if MLK ever contemplated inviting white refugees from South Africa to America to save them from “genocide” at the hands of blacks there. Likely not, since 10,000 or so blacks get murdered here each year as opposed to about 30-50 white farmers per year in South Africa.

Trump announced, “I will bring back free speech to America.” He forgot to mention that free speech will not be extended to international students, mayors like Newark’s, media companies he is suing, etc.

He also prophesied, “There will be no crime.” That has been problematic, as blue-collar crime, white collar crime and Presidential “high crimes and misdemeanors” have continued unabated.

Finally, the most messianic promise of all: “I will fix every single crisis affecting our country.” Unfortunately, the crisis that most everybody agrees is the worst of all is the one Trump himself is creating — the constitutional crisis.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/storm/original/20240625-113453-bbe-letters-to-the-editor.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 15:57:10.087745

This cuts the embodied carbon footprint of new facilities by 65 percent compared with traditional processes.
Microsoft’s new code of conduct includes a requirement for its biggest supply chain partners to transition to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2030.","Microsoft remains “pragmatically optimistic” that it will meet its commitment from five years ago to become carbon negative by 2030, despite reporting a 23.4 percent cumulative increase in its total greenhouse gas emissions since that time.

That’s according to the company’s May 29 2025 environmental sustainability report, in which two of the tech giant’s senior executives describe that increase as “modest” compared with its 168 percent increase in energy use and 71 percent growth in revenue over the same time period.

“Microsoft remains steadfast in our dedication to achieving the company’s 2030 environmental sustainability commitments,” said President Brad Smith and Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa, in a joint foreword.

Microsoft has promised to cut its emissions in half by 2030, compared with 2020, and to remove more carbon dioxide than it emits during that time frame. It has also promised to be water positive, achieve zero waste and protect ecosystems.

The company doesn’t have a corporate net-zero commitment, as defined by the Science Based Targets initiative, the de facto standards setter. It was one of nearly 250 well-known companies to have its “target removed” in spring 2024, after failing to submit a plan that would meet SBTi’s standard. “We remain engaged with SBTi and hope this entity involves practitioner feedback more comprehensively going forward while maintaining a robust governance process and remaining in close coordination with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol updates,” the company said in a statement responding to questions from Trellis.

Pragmatic optimism explained

Microsoft does have near-term SBTi goals: to cut the emissions intensity for its Scope 3 footprint from things like productions and use of its products by 30 percent as a percentage of revenue compared with a 2017 baseline year; to avoid an absolute growth in Scope 3, which accounted for 97.3 percent of its footprint in FY2024; and to source 100 percent renewable electricity.

So far, it has met just the last one, by procuring more than 34 gigawatts in carbon-free energy since 2020 — 19 in 2024 alone.

The company’s confidence comes from its long experience in creating entirely new markets, Nakagawa said during an interview. Microsoft, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, is spending billions to make sustainability a core value. Among other things, it’s buying low-carbon steel, concrete and construction materials. It has allocated more than $793 million for new climate technologies and is now the largest single buyer of carbon removal credits, worth more than 30 million metric tons.

Those investments have helped cut Microsoft’s footprint from purchased energy and its own operations by 30 percent since 2020.

“We remain pragmatically optimistic, and over the next few years, we want to continue to scale these markets, not only to reach our goals and for our benefit, but frankly, for the world,” she said.

Signs of progress

Microsoft actually reported a modest 1.8 percent year-over-year decrease in its carbon footprint for its 2024 fiscal year, which ended June 30. The company disclosed total emissions of 14,857,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent compared with 15,130,000 for FY2023.

That achievement is barely discussed as part of the report narrative, and that’s intentional. As more countries and regions adopt policies for mandatory corporate disclosure, Nakagawa explained, corporations will be required to report more thoroughly on progress since their baseline year. Companies must show that they are making the sorts of investments that steer emissions reductions in the right direction, she said.

There are also bright spots in Microsoft’s Scope 3 data, i.e., cumulative decreases in emissions related to these categories:

Waste generated in operations

Business travel

Employee computing

Downstream transportation and distribution

Use of sold products

End of life treatment of sold products

Downstream leased assets

Most of these categories account for less than 2 percent of Microsoft’s Scope 3 breakdown, except for use of sold products, which adds up to almost 12 percent of the total.

Microsoft’s two biggest Scope 3 categories are purchased goods and services (about 34 percent of the 2024 total) and capital goods (almost 41 percent).

What’s in store

To chip away at its two biggest Scope 3 categories, Microsoft is turning to its suppliers.

For example, the company is adopting a hybrid approach to data center construction that substitutes mass timber materials for concrete. This cuts the embodied carbon footprint of new facilities by 65 percent compared with traditional processes. Microsoft is also adopting chip-level cooling technologies. That one design change will help the company slow down the pace of new construction (because less space is needed for cooling equipment); decrease the amount of energy required for operations; and avoid significant evaporation of freshwater.

Microsoft’s expectations of suppliers are being built into contracts. One of its power purchase agreements with renewables developer Engie, for example, requires that solar panels be reused or recycled.

Microsoft’s new code of conduct includes a requirement for its biggest supply chain partners to transition to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2030. So far, 89 facilities that manufacture Microsoft’s hardware — such as tablet computers, gaming consoles or accessories — have bought into renewables. That helped cut 232,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Next up: a program, coming in July, that will help Microsoft suppliers procure certificates that give them credit by supporting sustainable aviation fuel.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cross-laminated-timber-being-used-in-two-new-Microsoft-datacenters-.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 12:56:47.138363

Accelerating AI for sustainability: Our AI for Good Lab, sustainability science, and research teams collaborate globally to accelerate solutions and develop climate resilience with AI.","Today, Microsoft published its 2025 Environmental Sustainability Report. This report covers our fiscal year 2024, and measures progress against our 2020 baseline. You can read the foreword below and explore the report in its entirety here.

As Microsoft continues to grow and innovate, our commitment to environmental sustainability remains a core value. This year, we reflect on our progress towards our ambitious 2030 goals: to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste, while protecting ecosystems. As we enter the second half of the decade, Microsoft remains steadfast in our dedication to achieving the company’s 2030 environmental sustainability commitments.

Since we announced our goals in 2020, we have made meaningful progress while seeing major changes in both the technology sector and in our understanding of what it will take to meet our goals. We are learning as we go, and we are proactively working to address sustainability challenges and accelerate solutions. We remain resolute in our commitment not only to meeting our climate goals but also to empowering others with the technology they need to build a more sustainable future.

At the heart of our approach is an understanding that sustainability is not simply a set of isolated initiatives, but a fundamental principle that must be integrated into every aspect of our business. Our cross-company Climate Council brings together leaders from across Microsoft to drive innovation, accelerate progress, and identify ways to build sustainability into our operations, products, and partnerships.

We remain pragmatically optimistic because of the promise of new sustainability technologies, innovations in AI, and market solutions that are emerging which can accelerate progress across challenging sectors like steel, concrete, and energy transitions. This annual report is our opportunity to share our learnings to help accelerate these markets, be transparent about our progress, and explore how we can ultimately scale solutions across our value chain.

We are sharing details about the progress made in each of our core commitment areas: carbon negative, water positive, zero waste, and protecting ecosystems. Our report also highlights a number of our breakthrough innovations, drawing insights from the leading edge of climate innovation.

Our progress

In 2020, Microsoft made bold sustainability commitments. At this halfway point to our 2030 goals, we are reaching key milestones and making progress that includes:

Ecosystems. In 2022, we met our target of protecting more land than we use by 2025, a target we’ve since exceeded by more than 30%. AI innovation is now driving biodiversity conservation through research efforts led by the AI for Good Lab and tools like the Microsoft Planetary Computer.

Zero waste. We exceeded our annual target to divert 75% of construction and demolition waste six years early by diverting 85% of this waste in FY24. We have also surpassed our target for our reuse and recycling rate for servers and components, reaching 90.9%. The Surface Copilot+ PCs now feature our most sustainable packaging design yet. Packaging from over 30,000 server racks was processed through recycling programs in FY24—diverting over 2,500 metric tons of waste from landfills.

Water positive. We met our target to provide more than 1.5 million people with clean water and sanitation solutions. We are also on track to replenish more water than we consume across global operations and improve datacenter water use efficiency, including through a new innovative datacenter design that optimizes AI workloads and consumes zero water for cooling to avoid the use of an estimated 125,000 cubic meters annually per facility.

Carbon negative. To date, we have contracted 34 gigawatts (GW) of carbon-free electricity (CFE) across 24 countries, about an eighteenfold increase since 2020. We have also entered long-term agreements to procure nearly 30 million metric tons of carbon removal since the start of this program.

Carbon negative: a marathon, not a sprint

As we remain focused on sustained progress towards our 2030 goals, it has become clear that our journey towards being carbon negative is a marathon, not a sprint. While our total emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) have increased by 23.4% compared to our 2020 baseline due to growth-related factors such as AI and cloud expansion, we are encouraged by the fact that this increase has been modest compared to the 168% increase in energy use and 71% revenue growth that has taken place over the same period.

For Microsoft to be carbon negative by 2030, we will need to reduce our value chain emissions. Starting with our direct operational emissions, as we shared earlier this year, since 2012 our carbon strategy has included a combination of procuring environmental attributes leveraging our corporate carbon fee and overall carbon emissions reduction efforts. This enabled us to decrease our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 29.9% from our 2020 baseline in FY24. At the same time, as we shift away from procuring non-additional environmental attribute certificates, we recognize that we must also bring more carbon-free electricity onto the grids where we operate.

We are also implementing strategies to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 2030, which increased in FY24 by 26% from our 2020 baseline. We are prioritizing addressing these emissions through supplier engagement programs including establishing standards via our Supplier Code of Conduct. Through the latter, select large-scale Microsoft suppliers are required to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity for their delivered goods and services as well as forthcoming guidance, launching in July, to target usage of sustainable aviation fuel, where possible, for Microsoft business-related air travel by 2030. We also remain committed to developing and supporting innovative solutions to reduce emissions from key datacenter and operational inputs including building materials, chips, and fuels, focusing on long-term solutions over short-term stopgaps. To do this, we have been adapting our strategies to use new sustainability technologies and address the challenges of expanding energy demand.

We see significant progress in several key areas, demonstrating potential for global impact:

Powering operations with carbon-free electricity (CFE):

In 2024, Microsoft contracted 19 GW of new renewable energy across 16 countries through power purchase agreements (PPAs), which are central to our carbon reduction strategy, driving down our Scope 2 emissions. Microsoft has taken a first-mover approach to making long-term investments to bring more CFE online.

We continue to advocate for expanding clean energy solutions globally to support not only our power needs but also those of our supply chain. We are addressing challenges with permitting, interconnection delays, and fluctuating interest rates by innovating through circularity and contracting. For example, we signed groundbreaking PPAs with Engie requiring that 100% of photovoltaic modules will be reused or recycled.

Transforming datacenters and campuses:

In FY24, we launched our first datacenters constructed with mass timber, a strong, ultra-lightweight wood in a hybrid construction model. This approach is projected to reduce the embodied carbon footprint of these new datacenters by up to 65% compared to typical precast concrete. We also doubled our rate of power savings and are transitioning from traditional air-cooled datacenters to chip-level liquid cooling designs at all owned datacenters. As the World Economic Forum highlighted in Innovation and Adaptation in the Climate Crisis, “Data-driven and digital technologies are uniquely suited to build adaptive capacity.”

We believe technology can be a powerful tool to address some of society’s toughest challenges, including environmental sustainability. As demand for AI and cloud services grows, we are advancing how we design, build, and operate our datacenters and campuses. Decarbonizing the built environment is a crucial element in this process.

Accelerating carbon removal initiatives:

In FY24, Microsoft signed long-term agreements to procure more carbon removal than all previous years combined, achieving nearly 22 million metric tons in contracts for carbon removal. We are committed to helping build the markets we buy from, translating leading science into commercial innovation and regularly updating our Criteria for High-Quality Carbon Dioxide Removal. We also know we cannot accelerate this market alone, which is why we co-founded the Symbiosis Coalition with industry partners. The Symbiosis Coalition is targeting up to 20 million metric tons of high-quality, nature-based carbon removal credits by 2030.

Improving operational efficiency and logistics:

In FY24, among facilities that manufacture devices for Microsoft, we saw a tenfold increase over the previous year in transitions to 100% CFE. This was accomplished, in part, by partnering with 3Degrees to launch the Supplier REach portal to support suppliers making their CFE transition. Our drive to reduce datacenter emissions extends to transforming the logistics operations of these facilities.

Through strategic partnerships and targeted initiatives, Microsoft continues to reduce emissions across transportation, warehousing, and the broader logistics supply chain, setting new benchmarks for operational efficiency and environmental impact. We adopted alternative fuels and electric vehicles to reduce emissions, collaborating with several leading logistics service providers (LSPs).

Renewable diesel is now in use in our road freight operations in Europe and California, cutting emissions by 50% for these shipments while keeping existing equipment in use. We also have partnered with airlines and shipping lines to expand the use of sustainable aviation and marine fuels. These efforts have reduced emissions by over 17,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions, comparable to avoiding the combustion of nearly 40,000 barrels of oil.[1]

Accelerating global solutions

At Microsoft, we understand that driving meaningful sustainability progress goes beyond our own practices and requires global collaboration, investment, and innovation. Across our operations, we are working to empower customers, build impactful partnerships, and invest in breakthrough solutions that drive progress worldwide.

Investing in innovation: A hallmark of this effort has been our Climate Innovation Fund (CIF)—our $1 billion commitment set in 2020 to advance innovation beyond Microsoft’s four walls. To date, CIF has made significant investments in innovative climate technologies including commercial direct air capture technologies, sustainable aviation fuel, industrial decarbonization, and more. CIF has invested over $793 million in capital in new climate technologies, expanding to 63 investments across CFE, sustainable fuels, carbon removal, and advanced building materials.

Empowering customers: We help customers and organizations centralize, analyze, and act on their data with AI-powered platforms for advanced analytics and reporting insights. For example, the Howden Resilience Laboratory supported by Microsoft and our Planetary Computer uses technology and data platforms to help investors understand climate risks to critical infrastructure, improve resilience, and contribute to better-informed investment decisions.

Partnering for impact: Partnering to scale our impact is a critical component of our sustainability efforts. Today GitHub fosters a thriving community that is home to over 150 million developers and 60,000 climate-focused open-source projects, advancing climate technology, greener software, and device sustainability. Xbox has made significant investments not only to reduce the environmental footprint associated with the production of our devices, accessories, and console packaging, but also to reduce the energy usage of the console itself. For example, Xbox became the first console to release a dedicated energy consumption and carbon emissions measurement tool designed for game creators.

Accelerating AI for sustainability: Our AI for Good Lab, sustainability science, and research teams collaborate globally to accelerate solutions and develop climate resilience with AI. For example, we have partnered with the United Nations to apply AI to climate challenges through programs like the Early Warnings for All initiative, which seeks to better understand which populations may be at risk of extreme weather events and other threats. By sharing our progress, tools, and learnings with the world, we aim to accelerate the pace of innovation, improve overall operational efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and find new solutions with long-term results.

Sustained momentum and future impact

There is no issue today that connects everyone on the planet more than climate change. As we strive to build a more sustainable future, we remain inspired by the dedication of our employees and partners and committed to transparency, accountability, and collaboration.

While the road to a sustainable future is challenging and not linear, we are encouraged by the progress we have made in FY24. By strategically focusing on CFE, carbon removal, water stewardship, waste reduction, and ecosystem protection, we are building an efficient, sustainable engine that drives us closer to our commitments.

We encourage you to read further to learn more about our progress and learnings across all of these areas, and we look forward to engaging in continued dialogue as we learn and develop new ways to help us meet our goals. We will continue to adapt our strategies, utilize emerging sustainability markets, and scale innovative technologies for even greater impact.

We recognize that achieving our ambitious goals requires sustained momentum, and we are dedicated to driving that momentum forward.

This article analyzes the current state of the SAF market, its core challenges, and key growth points based on data from the SMM industry database and global authoritative institutions.

I. Rigid Demand: Policy Drivers and Airline Commitments Form the Foundation of the Market

EU ReFuelEU Regulation: Clear roadmap for mandatory blending: 2% by 2025, 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050 (based on the 2020 aviation fuel consumption baseline). This alone will result in EU SAF demand exceeding 6 million mt/year by 2030 (IEA data).

US IRA Policy Leverage: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides strong tax credits for SAF (up to $1.25-1.75/gallon) and sets a production target of 3 billion gallons (approximately 9 million mt) by 2030 (US Department of Energy).

Major Airlines' Bets: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) target: SAF usage to reach 7-8% of total aviation fuel by 2025 (approximately 7 million mt) and 10% by 2030 (approximately 23 million mt). Leading airlines such as Delta, United Airlines, and Lufthansa have already signed multi-decade long-term offtake agreements to secure future supply.

II. Supply Bottlenecks: Capacity Ramp-Up Lags Far Behind the Demand Curve

Current Capacity Severely Insufficient: Global SAF production was only approximately 600,000-650,000 mt in 2023 (IEA), accounting for less than 0.2% of global aviation fuel demand (~300 million mt).

Limited Short-Term Increments: SMM's tracking of global projects under construction/planned indicates that global SAF capacity is expected to reach 3-4 million mt/year by 2025, still falling significantly short of policy targets (such as EU demand by 2030).

Prominent Raw Material Constraints:

Mainstream HEFA Route (accounting for over 85%): Highly dependent on used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats. The global annual collectable amount of UCO is approximately 8 million mt (Argus Media), facing issues such as an imperfect catering recycling system and competition in the gray market for waste cooking oil. High prices: The average price of UCO in Europe was approximately $1,200/mt in 2023, significantly driving up SAF costs.

Advanced Routes (PtL/eFuels): Dependent on green hydrogen (produced via water electrolysis using renewable energy) and carbon sources (direct air capture (DAC) or point-source CO₂). The current global green hydrogen capacity is insufficient, with electrolyzer costs (~$700-1,200/kW CAPEX, BNEF) and extremely high energy consumption (~50 MWh/mt SAF) constraining large-scale deployment.

III. Cost Gap: Economic Viability Remains the Biggest Challenge

Significant Price Disparity: The current price of traditional aviation kerosene (Jet A1) is approximately $800-1,000/mt (2023 average, Platts). The price of commercial SAF is 3-5 times higher:

HEFA-SAF: $2,500-3,500/mt (including raw materials, processing, and certification)

PtL-SAF: $4,000-8,000+/mt (dominated by the costs of green electricity, electrolyzers, and DAC)

High reliance on policy subsidies: The US IRA tax credit can cover up to ~$600/mt of costs; the EU ETS price (~€80-90/mt CO₂) and mandatory blending obligations provide support, but this is still not enough to fully bridge the price spread.

Disproportionately high proportion of raw material costs: In the HEFA pathway, the cost of waste oil and fat raw materials can account for 70-80% of the total SAF production cost, indicating significant supply chain vulnerability.

IV. Competition among technological pathways: Diversifying to seek breakthroughs

HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids):

Current status: The only pathway to achieve large-scale commercialization (led by Neste and World Energy), with high technological maturity and capable of 100% blending (ASTM D7566 Annex 2).

Limitations: Obvious ceilings in raw material sustainability and scalability. Unable to independently support the industry's decarbonization goals in the long run.

FT-SPK (Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene):

Representatives: Velocys, Fulcrum BioEnergy. Utilizes gasification synthesis of biomass/municipal solid waste.

Progress: Multiple demonstration projects are in operation (e.g., the Fulcrum Sierra project in the US), but high CAPEX (>$1 billion per million-ton scale) and technological complexity restrict rapid replication.

ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet):

Raw materials: Cellulosic ethanol or waste ethanol.

Current status: LanzaJet (US) will commission its first commercial plant (in Georgia) in 2024, with a capacity of 10 million gallons/year (~30,000 mt). The technology is feasible, with raw material supply and cost being the key factors.

PtL / eSAF (Power-to-Liquids / e-SAF):

Core: Green hydrogen + CO₂ (from DAC or industrial capture) → converted into aviation fuel via the Fischer-Tropsch or methanol synthesis pathway.

Strategic significance: Theoretical capacity has no raw material constraints, and the product can 100% replace traditional aviation fuel, making it the ultimate technological option for the aviation industry to achieve net-zero emissions.

Challenges: Current costs are extremely high, heavily dependent on green electricity prices (competitive only at <$20/MWh, according to IEA) and a sharp drop in electrolyzer/DAC costs. Demonstration projects are emerging (e.g., Norsk e-Fuel in Norway, the Lufthansa-Siemens joint project in Germany), but large-scale commercialization is expected after 2030.

V. Project Dynamics and Regional Landscape

North America Leads: Benefiting from the strong IRA policy, the US has become a hotspot for project investment. Companies like World Energy, Gevo, and LanzaJet are accelerating capacity expansion. SMM statistics show that the US accounts for nearly 40% of global SAF capacity under construction or planning.

Europe Follows: Major players such as Neste (expanding its Rotterdam facility to 1.2 million mt/year), TotalEnergies, and Shell are making moves. Nordic countries focus on PtL (e.g., Sweden, Norway) leveraging abundant green electricity resources.

Asia-Pacific Starts: China is pushing policies (the CAAC's 14th Five-Year Green Development Plan outlines SAF pathways), with Sinopec, PetroChina, and Air China conducting pilot production and applications (e.g., Zhenhai Refining's bio-jet fuel project). Japan (Eneos, ANA) and Singapore (Neste's facility) are also advancing. Raw material (especially UCO) procurement capability is a key variable for Asia-Pacific players.

VI. Key to Breakthrough: Overcoming Cost and Scale Barriers

Continued Policy Reinforcement and Optimization: Beyond mandatory blending and fiscal support, efforts should focus on:

Green Premium Sharing Mechanism: Explore ""certificate separation"" (e.g., the EU’s Draft SAF Certificate system) to involve non-airline entities in cost-sharing.

Dedicated Raw Material Support: Establish sustainable waste oil collection and certification systems, combat adulteration, and ensure supply.

Disruptive Cost-Reduction Technology Breakthroughs:

Electrolyzers: Improve efficiency (>80%), lifespan (>80,000 hours), and reduce CAPEX (target <$250/kW, US DOE Hydrogen Shot).

DAC: Break energy consumption barriers (currently ~1,500 kWh/mt CO₂), targeting <500 kWh/mt CO₂.

Biotechnology: Mature next-generation biomass technologies like efficient cellulosic ethanol and algal lipids.

Building Resilient Supply Chains:

Diversified Raw Material Pool: Accelerate pathways for agricultural/forestry waste, energy crops, and municipal solid waste conversion.

Regionalized Production: Locate PtL projects near cheap green electricity (wind and solar power bases) or carbon sources (industrial zones).

Infrastructure Adaptation: Synchronize compatibility upgrades for airport storage and transportation facilities.

Deep Industry Capital Involvement: Energy giants (BP, Shell, Total), chemical firms (BASF, Johnson Matthey), airlines, and aircraft manufacturers (Airbus, Boeing) must form investment alliances to share high-risk, long-cycle projects.

Conclusion: A promising market with rapid growth is unstoppable.

The SAF market has moved beyond the conceptual stage and entered a period of growth driven by mandatory policies and capacity competition. In the short term (2025-2030), the HEFA route will remain the most-traded contract for supply, but the constraints of raw material supply are difficult to resolve. In the medium and long term (post-2030), PtL/eSAF will be the key to unlocking unlimited capacity and achieving deep decarbonization. Its commercialization process will depend on the speed of cost reduction in green hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, as well as the availability of green electricity resources.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-05-29 11:56:10.062290

Shell has ceased the production of jet fuel from crude oil at its Wesseling, Germany facility, a move in its broader ambition to become a net zero emissions energy business by 2050.

By 2030, the company aims to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions under its operational control on a net basis compared with 2016.

It also aims to reduce the net carbon intensity of the product it sells by 15-20% by 2030.

Ending crude based jet fuel

Conventional jet fuels derived from crude oil are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in aviation.

Combustion of these fuels release CO₂ alongside pollutants including particulates and aromatic compounds.

In early 2024, Shell made a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker at its Wesseling site into a production unit for Group III base oils.

Instead, this production unit will be used to make lubricants such as engine and transmission oils.

On the announcement of the final investment decision, Huibert Vigeveno, Shell’s Downstream and Renewables Director, said: “The repurposing of this European refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils.

“This investment is part of Shell’s drive to create more value with less emissions.”

Crude oil processing as a whole will end at this site in 2025, Shell said.

At the time of the final investment decision, Shell said that the high degree of electrification of the base oil plant, alongside the ceasing of crude oil processing into fuels at the Wesseling site, is expected to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by around 620,000 tonnes each year.

Shell’s emissions targets

Shell’s roadmap to net zero includes a set of targets across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

This includes halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions under its operational control on a net basis compared with 2016.

By the end of 2024, the company said it had achieved a 30% reduction, meeting 60% of that target.

Shell reduced its Net Carbon Intensity by 9% from 2016 levels by the end of 2024, hitting its short-term milestone ahead of schedule.

Scope 3 emissions from the use of Shell’s oil products were down 14% compared to 2021, showing traction in curbing end-use emissions.

Decarbonising products

Shell says it is focusing on diversifying its energy offering to include more sustainable options.

Its initiatives to decarbonise its energy mix include:

Replacing oil products with biofuels and renewable power

Unlike previous shows shaped by the rebound in global air travel demand and sustainability, this year’s show will reflect an industry that is navigating growth amid persistent headwinds. The focus will shift from a recovery in demand to addressing structural challenges on the supply side of the industry.

Aircraft Orders and the Strategic Positioning of OEMs

A defining feature of the Paris Air Show is the unveiling of major aircraft orders. With global passenger traffic now exceeding pre-pandemic levels and continuing to rise, Airbus and Boeing are expected to compete actively for new commitments from airlines across various regions.

Despite a more cautious market outlook shaped by geopolitical uncertainty, tariff risks, and signs of softening demand from airlines, there is still a strong appetite for fleet modernization and new technology aircraft. However, low-cost carriers are no longer pursuing capacity-driven growth due to a slowdown in travel bookings, making it likely that order volume from this segment will be softer than in previous years. In contrast, full-service network carriers are increasingly focused on replacing aging aircraft, many of which are affected by ongoing shortages of spare parts and serviceable engines. As a result, a portion of new orders is expected to come from these legacy operators.

Forecast International anticipates a healthy level of order announcements, although not at the record-setting volumes seen during the surge of 2022 and 2023. So far this year, Boeing has recorded only 249 gross orders, and Airbus has secured only 291. For context, 2024 closed with 569 orders for Boeing and 878 for Airbus. A more moderate order environment is expected at this year’s show, though we still do expect significant announcements from airlines across the globe. The narrowbody segment, led by the A320neo family and 737 MAX variants, will likely see the most activity. However, developments in the widebody market will also be closely monitored, particularly as long-haul travel strengthens its recovery and airlines look to grow their international networks.

Supply Chain Disruptions and Production Ramp-Ups

While aircraft orders generate headlines, the deeper industry conversation centers on delivery schedules and manufacturing constraints. While demand remains strong and order books are full, OEMs have not been meeting that demand, and the spotlight is shifting from backlog size to delivery performance. The post-pandemic delivery environment has exposed structural weaknesses in the commercial aerospace system. From 2015 to 2018, global aircraft deliveries steadily climbed from 1,692 to 1,842 units. Since then, delivery levels have not recovered. After collapsing to just 844 units in 2020, the recovery plateaued at 1,386 in 2023 and slid further to 1,264 in 2024. These are not blips in performance but rather reflect deeper issues tied to supply chain fragility and production bottlenecks across the sector.

The delivery shortfalls at major OEMs illustrate the magnitude of the problem. Airbus, though regaining volume to 767 deliveries in 2024, continues to miss targets for ramping up production. Boeing remains under pressure from regulatory scrutiny and persistent quality control issues, with 2024 output totaling only 350 units, less than half of its 2018 high. Embraer and COMAC are rebuilding steadily, but most other manufacturers remain well below their historical production levels. Forecast International’s outlook reflects this constrained reality. Civil aircraft production is forecast to rise from 1.65K units in 2025 to 2.42K by 2029, a more tempered trajectory than earlier projections. These figures suggest that although OEMs intend to rapidly ramp up production rates, the timeline in which this occurs remains limited by systemic challenges. In Paris, we expect stakeholders to look for clearer answers on realistic delivery rates, supplier resilience, and how OEMs intend to restore industrial capacity. The discussion has shifted from sales to execution, and the credibility of OEMs now hinges not on who takes the most orders, but on who can actually deliver.

Trade Policy De-escalation

Although recent developments suggest a de-escalation in aircraft-related tariffs, the issue remains fluid. The global trade environment is still adjusting to a volatile geopolitical backdrop and changing policy stances from key economies.

While tariff headlines may take a back seat during the 2025 show, trade frictions continue to pose latent risk. Any future shifts, particularly from newly elected administrations or evolving international alliances, could reignite tensions and impact cross-border commercial aerospace activity. Trade policy will remain an important undercurrent, even if it does not dominate the formal agenda.

eVTOLs and Urban Air Mobility: Advancing Toward Operational Maturity

The eVTOL sector arrives at Paris 2025 with a sense of momentum. Key players including Joby Aviation, Archer, and Vertical Aerospace have advanced their flight-testing programs and are targeting certification windows within the next 24 months.

The conversation is transitioning from technical feasibility to operational integration. Updates at the show are expected to focus on certification timelines, infrastructure development, and airspace management strategies. Regulatory harmonization, public acceptance, and urban planning constraints are emerging as critical factors in determining the pace of deployment. The challenges are no longer solely technical; they are now systemic.

Next-Generation Narrowbodies

Discussion around clean sheet narrowbody aircraft is gaining traction as the industry begins to look beyond the current A320neo and 737 MAX platforms, which are expected to remain in production into the 2030s.

At this year’s show, attention may turn to propulsion concepts such as open-fan architectures, hybrid-electric systems, and sustainable composite materials. While no major program announcements are expected, engine manufacturers and systems suppliers may provide early indications of the capabilities and efficiency targets that will define the next generation of narrowbody platforms.

Sustainability: No Longer the Front Page, But Still in the Story

While sustainability continues to be a long-term strategic priority, it may not command center stage in 2025. The industry’s current focus is shifting toward operational stability, including resolving production bottlenecks and restoring supply chain robustness.

This evolving emphasis is evidenced by Airbus’s recent extension of its ZEROe hydrogen aircraft development timeline beyond 2035. Furthermore, announcements regarding sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen propulsion, and electric aircraft have become more measured.

That said, sustainability will not disappear from the conversation. Progress reports on SAF partnerships, hydrogen infrastructure, and emissions targets are still expected. However, these updates are likely to play a supporting role rather than leading the narrative.

India has the opportunity to become a net exporter of sustainable aviation fuel as efforts continue to decarbonise aviation globally, a top Boeing executive said on Thursday (May 29) and highlighted the ample availability of feedstock, including agricultural waste, for producing the fuel.

Aviation accounts for around 2-3% of the global carbon emissions, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help in reducing these emissions.

At the industry body, CII’s Annual Business Summit 2025 in the national capital, Boeing India and South Asia President Salil Gupte also said that 2,500 civil aircraft will be coming into India over the next 20 years.

India is one of the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets and Indian airlines have placed orders for more than 1,000 aeroplanes over the past few years.

While mentioning that the country will have a newer and younger aircraft fleet in the coming years that will also help in decarbonisation, Gupte also said it can be looked at how India can play a role in industrialisation of biofuels for aviation.

The barrier for SAF is not going to be aeroplane technology or engineering technology but the supply factor and how the fuel can be made more economical, he noted.

Currently, SAF costs 2.5 to 3.5 times more than Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).

If the world is to reach the net zero goal for aviation by 2050, it needs to have 185 million tonnes of SAF per year. India’s feedstock, whether it is used cooking oil, agricultural waste or the like, will be able to make 8-10 million tonnes of SAF per year.

”This means that India can actually provide over 5% of the world’s SAF requirements… India can be an exporter of SAF. This creates an opportunity. This means India can help decarbonise the civil aviation industry,” Gupte said and added that turning agricultural waste into SAF will be a tremendous opportunity.

Boeing, a leading aircraft maker, has a significant presence in India.

This report focuses on examining the prospects for renewable fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which are types of biofuels manufactured from inedible biomass sources.

Government policies and international regulations are driving biofuel adoption across multiple sectors, but policy support remains uneven globally. Many countries have implemented mandates for blending biofuels with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to curb emissions. Even in shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is promoting biofuel use, while aviation sector is also gaining regulatory momentum. However, policy approaches vary widely around the world.

The oil and gas industry's energy transition must incorporate transition fuels and low-carbon energy sources within their portfolios to reduce their carbon footprint. This includes the use of biofuels, either directly or through blending with petroleum fuels to help decarbonize the transportation sector. Although biofuels are predominantly used in transportation, they also have other applications, including heating and aviation. Unlike conventional fuels, biofuels are produced mostly from plants and animal sources, which can be replenished quickly.

India has the opportunity to become a net exporter of sustainable aviation fuel as efforts continue to decarbonise aviation globally, a top Boeing executive said on Thursday and highlighted the ample availability of feedstock, including agricultural waste, for producing the fuel.

Aviation accounts for around 2-3 per cent of the global carbon emissions, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help in reducing these emissions.

At industry body CII's Annual Business Summit 2025 in the national capital, Boeing India and South Asia President Salil Gupte also said that 2,500 civil aircraft will be coming into India over the next 20 years.

Advt

India is one of the world's fastest growing civil aviation markets and Indian airlines have placed orders for more than 1,000 aeroplanes over the past few years.

While mentioning that the country will have a newer and younger aircraft fleet in the coming years that will also help in decarbonisation, Gupte also said it can be looked at how India can play a role in industrialisation of biofuels for aviation.

The barrier for SAF is not going to be aeroplane technology or engineering technology but the supply factor and how the fuel can be made more economical, he noted.

Currently, SAF costs 2.5 to 3.5 times more than Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).

If the world is to reach the net zero goal for aviation by 2050, it needs to have 185 million tonnes of SAF per year. India's feedstock, whether it is used cooking oil, agricultural waste or the like, will be able to make 8-10 million tonnes of SAF per year.

""This means that India can actually provide over 5 per cent of the world's SAF requirements... India can be an exporter of SAF. This creates an opportunity.

The platform, launched this week by the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) and called 'SAFc Connect', aims to help companies meet their aviation decarbonisation goals by connecting them with providers of SAF certificates, a market mechanism similar to renewable energy certificates for aviation fuel.

SAF certificates decouple the environmental benefits of sustainable aviation fuel from its physical volume (one metric tonne per unit), allowing companies to claim emissions reductions even if they do not have direct access to SAF.

The platform aims to support the development of the SAF market by allowing certificate providers to tap into near-term corporate demand through a more flexible commercial cycle. Authorised buyers can access SABA-vetted offers all in one place, with key details such as carbon intensity performance, sustainability certification standard, pricing, feedstock, fuel type, and term length. After reviewing these details, they can get in touch with providers to complete offtake discussions.

According to SABA surveys, the alliance’s member companies (which include Bank of America, Boeing, Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, McKinsey & Company, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix and Salesforce) have an “immediate demand for approximately US$30 million worth of SAF certificates”.

Six SAF certificate providers committed

SABA notes that six SAFc providers (Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group, JetBlue, Targray, and Valero) have committed to participating in the SAFc Connect platform, and expects that number to increase in the coming months.

""To meet the decarbonisation goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near and long-term investment into SAF,"" said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of SABA Secretariat. ""With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.""

SAFc Connect gives participants a more flexible pathway to invest in high-integrity, commercially available SAF and is designed to support a faster offer-to-sale cycle that lets SAFc providers tap into near-term corporate demand.

SABA surveys indicate that SABA-member companies accessing SAFc Connect have an immediate demand for approximately $30 million worth of SAF certificates.

The annual-demand volume is expected to grow significantly year-on-year as SABA membership expands and companies ramp up investment to meet 2030 climate targets.

Approximately six SAFc providers—including Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group, JetBlue, Targray and Valero—have committed to participating in SAFc Connect with up to double that number expected to come on board in the coming months.

“To meet the decarbonization goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near- and long-term investment into SAF,” said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA secretariat. “With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF-procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.”

Since launching in 2021, SABA has worked with corporate buyers to aggregate demand for over $400 million in SAF certificates, first through a proof-of-concept pilot procurement and followed by 2023-’24’s groundbreaking multiyear procurement that supported tens of millions of gallons of SAF.

Earlier this month, SABA launched a third request for proposal (RFP) for next-generation fuels designed to facilitate five- to 10-year forward-purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final-investment decision (FID) for a new production facility.

SABA said SAFc Connect represents a next evolution of its commitment to aggregate demand and connect SAF suppliers with buyers seeking to invest in decarbonized aviation.

With the May 28 go-live, both buyers and providers stand to benefit, according to SABA.

Upon logging in, SAFc buyers can view posted offers all in one place, with each offer vetted by SABA and accompanied by key details such as carbon-intensity performance, sustainability certification standard, pricing, feedstock, fuel type and term length.

User-level permissions ensure that only authorized SAFc buyers can view sustainability and commercial information associated with the offers, which are subject to strict confidentiality requirements.

After reviewing available offers, buyers can then contact providers to complete offtake discussions.

Participating SAFc providers gain access to a committed community of buyers who want to make near-term purchases to meet their ambitious climate targets.

The platform will be updated on a recurring basis with additional platform participation and offer volumes.

The enhanced flexibility and responsiveness built into the system is expected to encourage new SAF production and capture long-term pricing benefits associated with economies of scale.

SAFc Connect will leverage SABA’s existing book-and-claim model that separates SAF’s environmental benefits from the physical fuel and captures them as a SAFc.

Purchasing SAF certificates allows corporate travelers to invest in SAF and capture the environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on.

The travelers’ investment allows them to make a greenhouse-gas emissions-reduction claim on their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF flows to an aircraft operator.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_28111cba61764e9591ed1066d536ac67~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_895,h_459,al_c,q_85/80995f_28111cba61764e9591ed1066d536ac67~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-29 11:56:44.585331

Wheat has always been a staple at Larson Seed Farm, started by Laird and Kathy Larson.
Grain farming was new to Briggs when he came to work for the Larsons after high school.
Much of their crop is trucked to Hamlin County Cooperative or AgWrx Cooperative in Garden City, South Dakota.
Soybean planting started April 15, and corn April 19 and wrapped up May 10, a record at Larson Seed Farm.","When South Dakota farmer Casey Briggs isn’t in the field, he’s often on the road making other farmers look good.

In the last year, his photo and video-making hobby took him to five states and 18 farms that grew nearly a dozen crops. He’s striped cotton in Oklahoma and Texas, cut milo in Kansas and harvested beets in North Dakota.

“It’s a hobby that has given me a lot of cool opportunities,” Briggs said from his home office at Larson Seed Farm near Clark, South Dakota.

Briggs, 32, will serve as Tri-State Neighbor Crop Watcher for the northeastern part of the state this year, providing bi-weekly reports and some top-notch photos.

The self-taught videographer picked up his camera during COVID.

“Everybody needed something to do back then,” he said.

Since then, he’s gotten some sponsored deals to showcase farm equipment or seed brands, and he’s provided footage for commodity organizations. Mostly though, he shares his photo and video work on social media for other farmers, some of whom have become good friends.

Each time he visits a new operation, he takes back a nugget of wisdom to improve his own business.

“If we all take some time, we can learn something from everybody we meet,” he said.

His goal is to show that there’s more to farm fields than corn and soybeans.

“That’s what I love about South Dakota, the diversity in agriculture,” Briggs said.

At Larson Seed Farm, Briggs has a four-crop rotation. It’s something that’s becoming rare on eastern South Dakota farms. He typically strip tills and plants corn into wheat stubble. That’s followed by no till soybeans or sunflowers.

Wheat has always been a staple at Larson Seed Farm, started by Laird and Kathy Larson. From 1984 to 2021, Laird Larson raised public variety wheat and soybean seed for South Dakota State University. He sold seed corn, too.

Grain farming was new to Briggs when he came to work for the Larsons after high school. He grew up in West River in northeastern Haakan County, where his family has raised cattle since the 1890s.

He met the Larsons when Laird hunted turkey at their ranch. For the last 10 years, Briggs has been part owner of Larson Seed Farm and is now the major decision maker in day-to-day operations. Laird is mostly retired, and Briggs works with another full-time employee and an intern from Lake Area Technical College to handle the work.

Last season brought good corn yields and a good winter wheat crop. Spring wheat was “dismal,” Briggs said, and soybeans were a little light. Much of their crop is trucked to Hamlin County Cooperative or AgWrx Cooperative in Garden City, South Dakota. Spring wheat went to Ardent Mills in Hastings, Minnesota, and sunflowers to Sunbird in Huron, South Dakota.

Briggs works with a marketing firm out of Lincoln, Nebraska, to shop around for the best grain price. Eventually he would like to build more on-farm storage to allow more flexibility in marketing.

The last growing season had a wet start from May into July. It began drying out in August, allowing for a quick harvest.

Planting season 2025 played out ahead of schedule, too. Spring wheat was planted in early March. Soybean planting started April 15, and corn April 19 and wrapped up May 10, a record at Larson Seed Farm.

Hot and windy conditions early in the season caused some of the soybeans to crust in. Then after a warm start to May, freezing temperatures crept in around May 19, coupled by 50 mph winds. Some corn and sunflowers were frozen, Briggs said.

With cooler temperatures came about an inch of rain each day over five days. The wet weather disrupted spraying work, and the crops could use some sunshine, Briggs said.

Farming in Clark and Hamlin counties, in the prairie pothole region and prairie coteau, fields are never too dry.

“We always say, ‘too wet, too cold, too long,’” Briggs said.

Many farmers’ answer to that is heavy tillage to warm up and dry the soil, Briggs said, but he uses no till and strip till management in an effort to keep the soil structure and increase water filtration.

Earlier this year, Briggs joined in on another venture, forming an LLC called Agland Technologies and selling an autosteer system that can work with older tractors. Between farming, the business and his video hobby, Briggs is following his mentor’s advice.

“Laird said it’s always good to have at least three augers running at once so you have something to come back to,” Briggs said. “I like to have a lot of projects.”

Builders Vision has a track record of delivering key finance to catalyse cutting-edge global-scale carbon mitigation technologies. This funding signals confidence in Firefly’s novel SAF technology as a high impact venture that centres environmental responsibility alongside long-term economic value.

This strategic funding will enable Firefly Green Fuels to accelerate the development and commercialisation of its proprietary technology, which converts biosolids—organic matter recycled from sewage—into drop-in SAF. As global demand for low-carbon aviation solutions intensifies, Firefly’s innovative process offers a scalable pathway to decarbonize the aviation industry while contributing to a circular waste economy.

“We are thrilled to welcome Builders Vision as a key partner in our journey to redefine how the world thinks about waste and fuel,” said James Hygate, CEO of Firefly Green Fuels. “Their support validates the potential of our technology to disrupt the SAF market and underscores the critical role that innovative financing plays in addressing climate change.”

We see Firefly as part of a new wave of industrial innovation—building real infrastructure to solve real emissions challenges,” said James Lindsay, Director of Investments at Builders Vision. “This pilot is a foundational step in proving a resilient, scalable pathway for low-carbon fuels in aviation. Securing a massive offtake agreement from Wizz Air a strong signal of market demand and sector readiness that encouraged us to invest in technology with a clear path for scale. It’s exactly the kind of early project that can unlock durable climate and economic value. Over the past decade, climate infrastructure funds have outperformed traditional energy benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis—proving that the future of energy is not just cleaner, but stronger.”

With this funding, and the backing of Builders Vision, Firefly plan to continue scaling operations at pace, with a UK-based first of a kind (FOAK) facility expected to be operational by 2028/29. The company also continues to develop global partnerships, with plans to quickly expand into further territories.

Michael Grunwald reports for Yale Environment 360.

In short:

President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” aims to expand subsidies for crop-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), despite cutting most other clean energy incentives.

The bill forbids including indirect land-use change (ILUC) in emissions accounting, allowing fuels from corn and soy to qualify as sustainable even though they drive deforestation.

Though the bill has no Democratic backers overall, the SAF provision has bipartisan support, particularly from lawmakers aligned with U.S. agricultural interests.

Key quote:

“Agriculture has an extremely well-oiled lobbying machine. So even as Congress guts all these things that reduce emissions to save money, they get Congress to spend lots of money to expand the one thing that increases emissions.”

— Dan Lashof, climate scientist and senior fellow at the World Resources Institute

Why this matters:

Growing corn and soy for fuel doesn’t come free. Globally, forests and grasslands are being cleared to make way for new farmland — releasing massive amounts of stored carbon and stripping the planet of vital carbon sinks. This land-use change, often invisible in simplified emissions models, makes many biofuels worse for the climate than the fossil fuels they’re supposed to replace. The U.S. government’s move to ignore these land-use emissions when calculating the climate impact of so-called sustainable aviation fuels effectively writes them out of existence — on paper, if not in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, taxpayer dollars are being funneled into subsidies for fuels that scientists say will accelerate global warming.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60333736/origin.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 07:56:10.077789
