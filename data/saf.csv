With the news that the government is backing Heathrow's £49 billion plan for a third runway, the long running debate over airport expansion is back at the top of the agenda.

Supporters say the move is vital for UK competitiveness and future connectivity.

Critics question the environmental and community impact.

So what does this decision really mean for Britain's place in global aviation? And what happens if we don't expand?

Aviation expert and special advisor to the Secretary General of UN Tourism, Anita Menderrata, speaks to The Standard’s Tech and Science Daily podcast to help unpack the story.

The expansion of Heathrow, namely the addition of a third runway, is incredibly important to the UK as a whole.

Not just Heathrow, because it strengthens the competitiveness of the UK both in terms of travel and tourism, but also importantly trade.

A computer image of an expanded Heathrow Airport after the third runway has been built

Heathrow

Any airport that operates will have a busyness factor. It's all about the efficiency of how the busyness is managed, and this is where airport operations, airlines, and air traffic control needs to come in incredibly effectively.

So the beauty of adding in a third runway, which will only be operational in 2035, is that you can actually elevate the efficiency of the aircraft taking off and landing rather than having the risk of bottlenecks, because you now have the flexibility of a third runway, especially if for any reason any of the other runways come into any operational challenges.

The net effect will be very good because when it comes to a project like this, which is core infrastructure for a nation, it's always about the opportunity cost. It's not just should we; it’s if we don't make this investment, what will this mean for the UK economy, for all of its productivity and its identity?

So there is potentially some big national upside, but what about the people living around the airport?

The entire process of developing the third runway at Heathrow is very much about upgrading the entire infrastructure itself.

If we look at other airports in the world, whether it's JFK, Charles de Gaulle, Schiphol, those are in high density areas. Heathrow has the benefit of being outside of central London, so it actually has the environment around it to be able to stretch with minimal disruption.

Any community living on the edges effectively of an airport is going to be impacted by growth of the airport, and it's understandable that there's frustration.

The consultation process and the engagement process with the local community is vital, so they actually understand the benefits of this, not only some potential hardships they may face.

Lib Dem MPs gathered in Westminster to oppose a third Heathrow runway

.

From the middle of next year, the public consultation process is going to begin. Heathrow is needing to put through not just an economic impact assessment, but an environmental and a social impact assessment that will allow the casemaking to be clear, because once again it's about the opportunity cost of if we don't do this. Communities might stay in place, but there will be a limitation to their own growth.

It's very important that Heathrow as an airport establishment and the ecosystem around it work very closely with the community ecosystem so it's very clear the benefits. Equally, communities must be able to voice concerns they might have, in order to have those concerns answered.

But more planes equals more pollution, right? What are the environmental implications of adding a new runway to Heathrow Airport?

What's very important is that the expansion of Heathrow and the third runway actually strengthens the UK's ability when it comes to reaching net zero by 2050.

Not only is it more effective operations of the runway, it's going to be a completely electric powered terminal itself.

It's using much more efficient air traffic control, and it's bringing in the aircraft that are allowed to utilise a sustainable aviation fuel, which cuts emissions by 80%.

There will be higher traffic flows of people. But a third runway that allows for larger aircraft could actually mean fewer aircraft taking off with more people and cargo rather than increasing the number of smaller aircraft.

The interesting thing, and something that is often completely underestimated and under-celebrated, is how much the aviation industry per se is at the forefront of innovation in sustainable engineering for all other industries.

The investment that aviation has been putting into sustainability for decades now and the billions that have gone into it have gone into other modes of transport have gone into other industries. So in many ways aviation almost becomes an incubator for innovation itself.

So much learning from the Heathrow expansion will be cascaded through the UK as a whole. So this is very important.

When we look at any nation's competitiveness, productivity growth is essential. But scaling up growth does not have to mean scaling up negative environmental impact.

So ironically, while people might question why aviation is not damaging to the environment, it's actually going to help the environment because it's going to catapult the UK's ability to continue to grow through essential aviation, but through smart green aviation that works towards net zero by 2050.

Airlines across Asia Pacific are enjoying a strong rebound in passenger demand, but beneath the headline growth, chief executives are grappling with persistent supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability, and outdated air traffic management systems.

In November, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) held its 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, bringing together airline CEOs and senior leaders from across the region. The event, hosted by Bangkok Airways, was supported by major aircraft and engine OEMs, aviation experts, and international media, including Aerospace Global News.

Nearly 200 delegates attended, representing carriers including Air Astana, Air India, Air New Zealand, ANA, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, EVA Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Lion Group, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, Royal Brunei, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Vietnam Airlines.

Strong passenger growth masks mounting operational pressures

With global passenger numbers now exceeding pre-pandemic levels, it would be easy to assume commercial aviation is firmly back on track. Conversations with Asia Pacific airline leaders, however, paint a more complex picture.

Across the region, airlines are struggling with delayed aircraft deliveries, engines stuck off-wing, shortages in maintenance and repair capacity, constrained spare parts availability, and difficulties sourcing trained personnel. These challenges are limiting growth just as demand accelerates.

Supply chain disruption, tariffs, and airspace closures compound costs

Opening the assembly, AAPA Director General Subhas Menon warned that fragile supply chain recovery is now being undermined by rising tariffs, driving up supplier costs while simultaneously dampening demand through inflation.

He added that regulatory burdens and military conflicts are further inflating operating costs. At various points over the past year, airspace across more than 14 countries has been closed, forcing longer routings, delays, and cancellations.

“It is an inefficient operating environment,” Menon said, warning of the risks posed by civil aircraft operating near active conflict zones, including spoofing of air navigation systems and the threat of aircraft being caught in military crossfire.

SAF ambitions clash with limited supply and high costs

Sustainability featured prominently on the agenda. AAPA airlines have committed to a collective target of 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) utilisation by 2030, but concern is growing over the slow pace of supply development.

“Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector for carbon emissions, yet we are asked to rely mostly on a hard-to-get commodity called SAF,” Menon told delegates, arguing that fuel suppliers must shoulder greater responsibility for delivering SAF at scale and at competitive prices.

IATA highlights Asia Pacific growth and air traffic management risks

IATA data presented at the assembly underlined Asia Pacific’s role as the fastest-growing aviation market globally. October passenger demand grew 8.1% year-on-year in the region, compared with 2.5% in North America and 6.7% in Europe, with international traffic to and from China, Japan, and Vietnam all posting double-digit growth.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh described the region as “the largest market in the world,” accounting for around 35% of global commercial traffic. However, he warned that airline expansion and airport investment risk being constrained by outdated air traffic management systems.

Walsh also addressed safety concerns, including lithium-ion battery risks and passenger behaviour during evacuations, noting an increase in incidents involving travellers attempting to retrieve cabin baggage.

Resolutions focus on safety, sustainability, and supply chain resilience

The assembly concluded with the adoption of four resolutions covering aviation sustainability, safety, taxes and charges, and supply chain strengthening. Looking ahead, AAPA signalled a clear focus on collaboration with regulators and suppliers to improve resilience and maintain connectivity across the region.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4-Singapore-Airlines-Boeing-777-scaled.png,N,,2025-12-21 08:57:08.866635

Marine works in Bagnoli-Coroglio

This contract win further strengthens DEME’s portfolio of major marine projects in Italy. The project in in the Bay of Naples focuses on the remediation and redevelopment of the Bagnoli–Coroglio industrial area. A consortium of DEME and Italian companies Savarese Costruzioni and Iterga Costruzioni Generali will perform marine works including 900 meters of offshore breakwaters, the removal of approximately 130,000 m³ of sediments, and demolition of the decaying central pier and former steel plant service buildings. Substantial completion is scheduled by next summer to enable urban regeneration and preparations for the preliminary regattas of the America’s Cup.

Valencia beach nourishment

In Spain, DEME has been awarded the Valencia beach nourishment project by the Ministry for Ecological Transition (MITECO) in a joint venture with Rover Maritime. The project will restore and protect three popular beaches (Sagunto, Sueca, and Cullera) which have suffered severe erosion over recent decades. Works include dredging and placing approximately 3 million m³ of sand using DEME’s advanced trailing suction hopper dredger Bonny River, which can operate at depths beyond 100 meters. Additional measures such as dune restoration and new groins will ensure long-term coastal stability, allowing residents and visitors to enjoy the coastline in its natural splendor once again.

The corps said its preferred alternative grants the easement, allowing the pipeline to keep operating, but with some additional conditions.

“After eight years of operating safely, the Dakota Access Pipeline has become an essential part of our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Gov.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Friday, Dec. 19 issued a long-awaited Dakota Access Pipeline environmental impact statement, recommending that the pipeline keep operating, but with some new conditions for its Missouri River crossing in North Dakota.

The pipeline has been operating since June 2017, carrying crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oil field to Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has opposed the project and challenged it in court, citing concerns about impacts to the tribe’s Missouri River water supply.

A federal judge in 2020 revoked the easement for the pipeline crossing under the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock reservation, requiring additional environmental study.

The 464-page environmental impact statement evaluated five alternatives, including denying the easement or rerouting the pipeline. The corps said its preferred alternative grants the easement, allowing the pipeline to keep operating, but with some additional conditions.

The recommendation is not official until after a 30-day waiting period required under the National Environmental Policy Act. After that period concludes on Jan. 20, 2026, the corps may issue a record of decision.

The options evaluated were:

Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline by removal.

Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline in place.

Grant the easement with the same conditions as the previous easement, which Dakota Access LLC prefers.

Grant the easement with additional conditions.

Construct and operate a pipeline reroute north of Bismarck.

In its analysis, the corps wrote that the fourth option, granting the easement with conditions, protects environmental resources and responds to comments raised by tribal nations.

The conditions aim to prevent an oil spill and minimize the impacts of a spill, such as implementing new leak detection technology as it becomes available and conducting groundwater monitoring and surface water sampling.

The corps held two meetings in Bismarck in November 2023 to collect public comment on the environmental impact statement. At the time, corps officials said the final statement was expected in 2024.

In interviews after those 2023 meetings, the chairs of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said the Dakota Access Pipeline was operating illegally without a permit and should be shut down. Tribal leaders and environmental groups have also raised concerns about an inadequate spill response plan.

North Dakota officials, meanwhile, have supported the continuing operation of the pipeline.

“After eight years of operating safely, the Dakota Access Pipeline has become an essential part of our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement. “Its continued operation will ensure energy security and affordability for the country while providing positive economic impact that touches every North Dakotan.”

But, there’s also a huge push by soybean growers to expand biodiesel as well.
“We are certainly working everyday on both fuels demand and opportunities,” says Caleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA).
“The American farmer is growing a product that is getting used here domestically.
It’s good for the economy.","You’ve been hearing a lot lately about the efforts by corn producers to expand the use of ethanol in 2026. But, there’s also a huge push by soybean growers to expand biodiesel as well.

“We are certainly working everyday on both fuels demand and opportunities,” says Caleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA). He is also a farmer based in Magnolia, Kentucky.

“Whether it be biodiesel, renewable diesel—there are opportunities with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), and there’s different feed stocks that can be used in SAF,” says Ragland. “As the saying goes, ‘The rising tide lifts all boats,’ and biofuels are such an exciting opportunity for the soybean industry that we must be pursuing.”

He tells Hoosier Ag Today that he and other soybean producers will continue to press your lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass legislation in 2026 to further expand the biofuels industry.

“We have opportunities right now that need to be completed by Congress,” says Ragland. “We have the 45Z tax credit that’s hanging out there that needs to be done. We have the Renewable Volume Obligations, RVO’s, that need to be completed. That number has been debated and beaten to death. It’s time to get the deal done.”

“We need Congress to step up and make it happen. That’s good for demand, and it brings stability and some certainty to our industry, as well, that we desperately need,” he says.

Ragland adds that the expansion of biodiesel would truly be a win for everyone.

“The American farmer is growing a product that is getting used here domestically. It’s creating fuel that is good for the environment. It’s good for the economy. It brings jobs. It brings economic opportunity to our farms, which ties back to economic opportunity for all of our rural communities. That local farmer dollar gets turned over 6-to-8 times, at least, locally. It’s also good for all of the small businesses and it’s just good for everybody involved,” says Ragland.

Indiana is home to one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in the U.S.—which is Louis Dreyfus near Claypool in Kosciusko County. The facility currently produces around 99 million gallons of biodiesel each year.

Brazil closes 2025 with a decisive step toward the decarbonization of aviation. In early December, Petrobras announced the first production and delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) fully produced in the country.

The milestone gained further relevance with the official participation of Anac (Brazil’s National Civil Aviation Agency) in the launch, reinforcing that the product meets the most rigorous international sustainability standards.

The initiative places Brazil among the countries that have taken effective steps to transform the aviation sector, one of the most complex industries when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

What SAF is

SAF – or Sustainable Aviation Fuel – is designed to replace conventional jet fuel partially or entirely.

Its main advantage is full compatibility with aircraft and existing airport infrastructure, without the need for technical adaptations.

In practice, this allows airlines to reduce carbon emissions immediately by using a certified fuel that is internationally recognized as one of the leading solutions for decarbonizing air transport.

Fully Brazilian SAF production with international certification

Petrobras’ SAF was produced through coprocessing at the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc), in Rio de Janeiro, using technical corn oil (TCO), a residual vegetable-based feedstock.

According to official data, the fuel can reduce net CO₂ emissions by up to 87 percent in the renewable portion of the product.

The Brazilian SAF received ISCC-CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), confirming its compliance with the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

This certification is essential for the fuel to be accepted in international operations, ensuring sustainability, traceability and quality standards recognized worldwide.

Anac reinforces regulatory certainty and credibility

Anac attended the ceremony marking Petrobras’ first SAF production and delivery, highlighting the relevance of the fuel for the future of aviation in Brazil.

According to the agency, the fact that SAF is produced entirely in the country and already meets international criteria represents an important step forward for the development of the domestic market.

In this first phase, 3,000 cubic meters (m³) of SAF were produced and sold to distributors operating at Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport. This volume corresponds to approximately one day of aviation fuel consumption across airports in the state of Rio de Janeiro, demonstrating the product’s operational viability.

Contribution to global decarbonization targets

The launch of SAF comes at a strategic moment for the aviation sector.

From 2027 onward, airlines will be required to comply with CORSIA, ICAO’s global program aimed at reducing emissions from international flights. In Brazil, the use of sustainable fuels is also aligned with the guidelines established by the Future Fuel Law (Lei do Combustível do Futuro).

By anticipating SAF production and certification, Petrobras offers the domestic market a solution ready to meet future regulatory requirements, reducing dependence on imports and strengthening Brazil’s energy industry.

A tangible step forward in the just energy transition

With institutional backing from Anac and compliance with international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, sustainable aviation fuel moves beyond promise and becomes a tangible part of the present and future of air transport in Brazil.

This strengthens the country’s industry and energy sovereignty, opening the way for a new cycle of innovation and sustainability in the national aviation sector.

By closing the year with this major achievement, Brazil demonstrates that it is prepared to lead the global decarbonization agenda with real, certified and competitive solutions.",https://bricsbrasil.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BRICS-Brasil-SAF-da-Petrobras.png,N,,2025-12-20 20:56:34.753940

Houthi attacks in the Red Sea forced shipping companies to reroute vessels around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, avoiding the Suez Canal entirely.
The crisis sent shipping rates soaring and forced businesses relying on just-in-time manufacturing to reconsider fundamental assumptions about supply chain design.
If the Red Sea crisis tested maritime logistics, infrastructure vulnerability exposed different weaknesses.","The first quarter of 2025 unfolded as a defining period for global procurement – marked by competing priorities of equity and efficiency, regulatory upheaval and resilience tests that challenged even the most prepared organisations.

The conversation began with vision. The World Economic Forum, alongside Deloitte and the Schwab Foundation, released research spotlighting equity's role in green and digital transformation.

WEF: The Role of Equity in Green & Digital Transformation

The report emphasised that social enterprises – businesses prioritising impact over profit – could be instrumental in ensuring inclusive growth during these transitions. With 10 million social enterprises globally generating US$2tn annually, the message was clear: procurement professionals hold considerable power in directing resources toward equitable outcomes.

Yet vision alone wouldn't sustain progress. The aviation sector grappled with translating sustainable ambitions into operational reality as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) confronted scaling challenges.

Can Aviation Overcome SAF Scaling and Cost Challenges?

Despite offering an 80% reduction in lifecycle emissions, SAF production remained hampered by feedstock scarcity, concentrated production facilities and costs exceeding traditional jet fuel.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President of Sustainability, articulated the urgency: ""We need the whole world to produce as much renewable energy as possible for everybody. Airlines simply want to access their fair share of that output.""

The bottleneck revealed a fundamental procurement challenge – securing diverse, sustainable feedstock whilst building logistics networks capable of supporting global distribution.

Meanwhile, businesses faced more immediate concerns as political transitions reshaped cost structures. When President Donald Trump took office, proposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico threatened to raise US grocery prices and disrupt established sourcing strategies.

How Costco Wholesale Will Deal With Tariffs Uncertainty

Costco's response illustrated pragmatic procurement leadership.

CFO Gary Millerchip acknowledged the challenge candidly: ""Tariffs raise costs so that's not something that we see as a positive in general.""

Yet the company's approach – pulling forward inventory, working with vendors to mitigate costs, exploring alternative sourcing locations and pivoting SKUs when value disappeared – demonstrated how experienced procurement teams navigate policy uncertainty.

His predecessor's wisdom echoed through the strategy: ""When it rains, it rains on everybody.""

Andreas Rasche, Professor at Copenhagen Business School, expressed concern: ""This is very disappointing and not at all proportionate. The document gives no evidence-based reasons for the changes.""

For procurement teams, the implications were significant – reduced access to sustainability data could create blind spots in responsible sourcing efforts, particularly in complex global networks.

Regulatory upheaval wasn't confined to Brussels. In the UK, plans to abolish NHS England and integrate its functions into the Department of Health marked a pivotal shift in healthcare procurement.

NHS England Reform: What Does It Mean for Procurement?

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer positioned the move as streamlining administration, yet the restructuring threatened to disrupt ongoing procurement reforms and delay purchasing of essential medicines and medical devices.

With approximately 9,000 job losses expected and a £7bn deficit to manage, procurement teams faced budgetary constraints whilst navigating decentralised decision-making through local Integrated Care Boards. The challenge became clear: achieving efficiency improvements without undermining supplier relationships or equitable patient care.

Beyond regulatory shifts, physical disruptions tested supply chain resilience. Houthi attacks in the Red Sea forced shipping companies to reroute vessels around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, avoiding the Suez Canal entirely.

How the Shipping Crisis in the Red Sea is Impacting Trade

Container shipments through the region dropped 75% as companies navigated the trade-off between security risks and the costs of detours adding 10 to 14 days to transit times.

Xeneta's Chief Analyst Peter Sand stated: ""All ships transiting the Suez Canal must sail through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and the Houthi militia has made clear that any vessel is a target.""

The crisis sent shipping rates soaring and forced businesses relying on just-in-time manufacturing to reconsider fundamental assumptions about supply chain design.

If the Red Sea crisis tested maritime logistics, infrastructure vulnerability exposed different weaknesses. A fire at an electrical substation forced Heathrow Airport's closure until midnight on 21 March, affecting more than 1,300 flights.

How the Heathrow Airport Closure Impacted Supply Chains

The incident disrupted not just passenger travel but cargo operations at the UK's largest port by value, handling more than 1.6 million metric tonnes of freight annually.

John Manners-Bell, CEO of Transport Intelligence, criticised the apparent oversight: ""A fire at a single power sub-station bringing one of the world's busiest airports to a complete halt? Someone has been asleep at the wheel.""

The event served as a stark reminder that even the most sophisticated supply chains remain vulnerable to infrastructure failures beyond procurement's direct control.

These individual disruptions converged into a broader pattern. QIMA's 2025 Sourcing Survey revealed that three-quarters of businesses expected supply chain disruptions to persist, whilst nearly 90% still lacked full visibility into their supply chains.

Businesses Dealing with Escalating Supply Chain Disruptions

Companies responded by diversifying sourcing strategies – two-thirds maintained or expanded Chinese supplier operations whilst half of US businesses shifted volumes closer to home through nearshoring.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8628c3f40169c454f8fa452f3a23619a:8e1915f0f9ebf64a1f030a451272b3c5/gettyimages-1347183021.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 10:57:00.864302

Table: Summary of New Routes by Air New Zealand

The Economic Impact of Air New Zealand’s New Routes

One of the most significant aspects of Air New Zealand’s route expansion is its economic impact on both New Zealand and Australia. New routes generally bring an increase in tourism, which boosts local businesses, job creation, and infrastructure growth.

For Queenstown, the new seasonal route from Brisbane not only makes it more accessible for adventure tourists but also enhances local employment in the tourism and hospitality sectors. Air New Zealand’s additional capacity on routes between Brisbane and Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch opens up more opportunities for international business travelers, fostering cross-border trade and collaboration.

The flight marks the restart of the assembly entirely with domestic components, as part of ongoing efforts to replace foreign suppliers.

The maiden flight lasted 1 hour and 10 minutes. The aircraft, which subsequently flew from Kazan to Minsk on 17 December, supports the Russian government’s import-substitution policy for the aviation sector.

This Tu-214 was initially reported as intended for Tatarstan-based UVT-Aero. However, UVT-Aero has stated it will focus on other aircraft types in coordination with the federal air transport regulator Rosaviatsia.

UVT-Aero’s chief, Pyotr Trubaev, has said the carrier is examining the Ilyushin Il-114-300 and the Yakovlev SJ-100, both featuring significant domestic content. Aeroflot Group previously considered adding Tu-214s but is reportedly prioritizing MC-21s instead, said Flight Global.

State lessor GTLK committed to over 40 Tu-214s last year, reflecting broader fleet modernization efforts. Red Wings has recently taken delivery of Tu-214s, but these were older aircraft refurbished from storage rather than newly manufactured.

The Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade launched a restoration and airworthiness program for the Tu-204/214, Il-96, and An-124 in October 2022, initially targeting 12 aircraft for return to service by 2024.

The program has been extended to 2027 to accommodate delivery delays and modernization needs, underlining the Tu-214’s role in sustaining Russian domestic air transport.

The Tu-214, developed as a variant of the Tu-204 and first flown in 1996, features higher gross weight and additional fuel capacity compared to its predecessor.

Os autarcas Luís Filipe Menezes e Pedro Duarte são dois dos principais entusiastas do regresso dos aviões ao Douro. Menezes falou do assunto durante a campanha e logo após a sua eleição para a presidência da autarquia gaiense, sempre com o objetivo acolher iniciativas a abranger as duas autarquias.

O programa engloba corrida de aviões, acrobacias aéreas, demonstrações militares pela Força Aérea Portuguesa, demonstrações policiais pelo Grupo de Operações Especiais/PSP, um festival de aeromodelismo, festivais de drones com a tentativa de bater o recorde da Europa na praia do Titan (Matosinhos); exposições de meios aéreos e militares com batismos de voo e festivais de música, entre outras iniciativas.

A Força Aérea Portuguesa é o parceiro oficial do Air Invictus e irá envolver diversas aeronaves como o KC 390, C 295, F 16 e os Super Tucanos. Haverá um F16 colocado na margem de Gaia e dois outros aviões do lado do Porto.

Um dos eventos associados é o “Eyes in the sky”, a primeira feira e “summit” da indústria de defesa aérea e aeroespacial, que irá mostrar na Alfândega do Porto, em 5000 m2 de exposição, “o que de melhor as empresas portuguesas estão a inovar, produzir e exportar para todo o mundo, e que trará ao nosso país visitantes, expositores, especialistas e cientistas para várias conferências”. Estará patente até ao dia 23 de junho. Haverá uma forte promoção internacional com ativações, campanhas na televisão e nas redes sociais, entre outras.

O regresso das aeronaves ao Douro “engloba uma componente de literacia aeronáutica para as escolas da região Norte, com visitas, palestras, contacto com pilotos e aviões, bem como batismos de voo, onde se pretende que os mais novos voltem a ganhar a paixão pelo espaço e pela aviação”, como explica a organização.

Earlier this year, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, officially ditched net zero by 2050 as a Tory policy.
Labour was even forced to defend its net zero policy after an attack by its former leader, Tony Blair.
Traditional European carmakers were delighted, but manufacturers focused on electric cars said it would benefit Chinese rivals in the long term.
The UN-backed programme, launched in 2021, had committed firms to achieving net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.","Almost a year since Donald Trump returned to the White House with a rallying cry to the fossil fuel industry to “drill baby, drill”, a backlash against net zero appears to be gathering momentum.

More companies have retreated from, or watered down, their pledges to cut carbon emissions, instead prioritising shareholder returns over climate action.

In the UK, the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has helped fracture the political consensus that had helped make Britain the first big economy to enshrine a commitment to cutting carbon emissions into law, in 2019. Earlier this year, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, officially ditched net zero by 2050 as a Tory policy. Labour was even forced to defend its net zero policy after an attack by its former leader, Tony Blair.

Big players in retail and automotive this week became the latest businesses to weaken pledges – a retreat that threatens devastating consequences for the climate.

Running counter to this, many countries – notably China – have continued the march towards renewable power (which surpassed coal generation this year). Investment in clean energy, at $2tn a year, is now double that going into fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency.

Here we look at how important industries are treating net zero.

Cars and planes

For a few years after the pandemic, carmakers made bold promises that they would switch their factories to electric cars within a few years. Yet that momentum for change petered out by 2024 amid disappointing growth in battery car sales. In the US, EU and UK the lobbying campaign for weaker regulations has been intense – and successful.

Trump has torn up US electric vehicle subsidies – costing carmakers billions of dollars – and eased emissions rules to allow them to sell more cars with polluting petrol and diesel engines. This week, Ford said it would take a $19.5bn write-down and is scrapping several EV models.

The UK government said in April it would ease its zero-emission (ZEV) mandate. The rules still force carmakers to sell more electric cars each year, but new loopholes mean they can sell more hybrids, which combine a smaller battery with an internal combustion engine.

And the EU this week said that 10% of carmakers’ sales could be petrol or diesel after 2035, in a significant climbdown.

Traditional European carmakers were delighted, but manufacturers focused on electric cars said it would benefit Chinese rivals in the long term. Chris Heron, secretary general of E-Mobility Europe, a lobby group representing electric carmakers such as Tesla, Rivian and Polestar, said: “While China accelerates, Europe is hesitating, and hesitation is not a strategy.”

If the transition is stalling for ground transport, in the air things have not even started to take off. Airbus and Boeing, the global plane-making duopoly, have both made clear that their next planes will use gas turbine engines running on kerosene.

Airbus this year delayed plans to fly a plane using zero-emission “green” hydrogen by 2035, while supplies of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – the solution of choice for many in aviation – remain nugatory compared with the vast size of global demand.

Neither did UK government policy on aviation inspire confidence that net zero remained front and centre. Two London airports, Gatwick and Luton, had significant expansion plans signed off by ministers, meaning tens of thousands of additional flights a year at each.

Meanwhile, the chancellor gave resounding backing for Heathrow expansion – despite previous official work making clear that only limited growth, allied with swift progress on decarbonisation, could make a third runway in any way compatible with 2050 targets.

Energy

For now, UK green energy investors remain buoyed up by Labour’s aim to create a virtually carbon-free electricity system by 2030, to stick with the net zero target and its pledge for no new North Sea drilling (with caveats).

However, the government’s green targets were dealt a blow earlier this year when the struggling Danish renewable energy company Ørsted cancelled plans for one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, Hornsea 4, off the Yorkshire coast.

Europe’s oil majors, including BP and Shell, have retreated from their climate commitments in favour of refocusing on oil and gas production. BP’s boss, Murray Auchincloss – who was dramatically ousted this week – said the company’s optimism in the energy transition had been “misplaced” and promised the company’s disillusioned shareholders that he would “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy after its failed attempt to go green. His successor appears unlikely to change tack. Shell set out plans to pump more oil and gas while halving its green spending.

Banks and financial services

A swathe of financial firms have been watering down climate commitments following Trump’s return.

The most public sign of the U-turn has been the collapse of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in October, after a wave of departures by US banks including JP Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as well as UK lenders Barclays and HSBC. The UN-backed programme, launched in 2021, had committed firms to achieving net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.

HSBC had months earlier announced it was delaying omportant parts of its climate goals by 20 years and watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.

Large investment houses such as Vanguard and BlackRock have also pulled membership from a sister group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, as the sector comes under pressure from Republican politicians.

Meanwhile, there are fears Labour could water down plans to require FTSE 100 firms and financial services to adopt “credible” climate transition plans, and disclosing their carbon footprints after City lobbying.

Retail

Retailers and their suppliers are among those taking a hard look at net zero ambitions amid rising costs.

Morrisons, the supermarket chain, this week delayed its ambition for net zero by 15 years until 2050, having previously set a deadline of 2035.

The British Retail Consortium industry body set out a roadmap to next zero by 2040 but its latest stocktake indicates the industry has only met the 2025 milestone on one measure – data on logistics. Only 38% of top suppliers have committed to meeting net zero.

Many retailers have reduced emissions in stores – with renewable energy and technology such as LED bulbs and electric vans – but most of their emissions are generated by their suppliers.

Even within stores the cost and complexity of shifting from gas to low-carbon heating , including the higher price of electricity compared with gas, has held back progress.

Local authorities

In the public sector, local councils have often taken net zero more seriously than even central government. Bristol was the first to declare a climate emergency in 2018 – a year before the government – and more than 300 other councils followed, with 90% setting net zero targets.

But as the political landscape has changed with the rise of Reform, some local authorities, led by those dominated by Farage’s party, are rolling back on net zero commitments. In Reform-led Lincolnshire, mayor Andrea Jenkyns has vowed to block any renewables projects in her jurisdiction (putting 12,000 jobs at risk if she succeeds), while Staffordshire county council, also Reform-controlled, has rescinded its declaration of a climate emergency.

Reform-controlled Durham council has scrapped its heat pump and solar panel scheme for government buildings, and energy efficiency upgrades such as insulation have been ditched in Kent, which is also under Reform.

Derbyshire county council disbanded its climate change, biodiversity and carbon reduction committee the week after Reform took power, and West Northamptonshire county council abandoned its net zero target.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b09b001d3eef92a03e30674799947d7384f81b2/468_0_4680_3744/master/4680.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48ee899d2264555f6f639914314d7316",N,,2025-12-20 05:57:23.244625

In its publication “Energy Demand of the Transport Sector,” part of the 2035 Ten-Year Energy Plan (PDE), the state-owned entity reports that SAF consumption will account for roughly 12% of domestic energy demand linked to passenger air transport by 2035.
EPE notes that 2027 marks the start of mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts for domestic operations by Brazilian airlines.
The PDE anticipates diesel oil B will remain the dominant fuel in the transport sector, with demand projected to reach 57.5 billion liters in 2035, growing 1.9% annually.
While electrification is gaining traction in specific areas such as last-mile freight, its share of total sector consumption is expected to remain limited through the end of the decade.","Brazil is poised for a major shift toward sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) beginning in 2027, with consumption projected to reach 0.03 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2035, according to the Energy Research Company (EPE), reports bnamericas.

In its publication “Energy Demand of the Transport Sector,” part of the 2035 Ten-Year Energy Plan (PDE), the state-owned entity reports that SAF consumption will account for roughly 12% of domestic energy demand linked to passenger air transport by 2035.

The expected expansion is attributed to emission reduction targets under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) and ProBioQAV, established by the federal Fuel of the Future program. EPE notes that 2027 marks the start of mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts for domestic operations by Brazilian airlines.

Petrobras and Acelen are among the companies advancing research and planning SAF production in the country. In contrast, Brasil Biofuels (BBF) has paused its plans as the company undergoes court-supervised reorganization following a filing earlier this year.

The PDE anticipates diesel oil B will remain the dominant fuel in the transport sector, with demand projected to reach 57.5 billion liters in 2035, growing 1.9% annually.

While electrification is gaining traction in specific areas such as last-mile freight, its share of total sector consumption is expected to remain limited through the end of the decade. For light vehicles, gasoline C use is projected to decline as hydrous ethanol gains ground, aided by improved vehicle efficiency and public transport expansion. Between 2023 and 2035, hydrous ethanol consumption is set to grow 5.3% annually, offsetting part of the demand for gasoline.

In maritime transport, emerging fuels—including biodiesel, liquefied natural gas (LNG), ammonia, hydrogen, and electricity—are projected to gain adoption, particularly after 2030.

Overall energy demand in the transportation sector is forecast to reach 115 Mtoe in 2035, driven primarily by road transport, which will account for 93% of total consumption. This rise is supported by expected GDP growth averaging 2.8% annually and increased population mobility.

Freight transport will continue to rely heavily on trucks, with the segment projected to grow 2.8% per year, fueled by agribusiness, industry, and construction.

Rail transport is set for notable expansion, with the network expected to increase by around 20% to reach 36.9 thousand kilometers by 2035, boosting sector activity by 5.5% annually.

Waterway freight is also expected to advance, growing 3.2% annually, backed by investments in vessels, shipyards, and ports, and strengthened by cabotage in oil logistics.

On the passenger side, individual vehicle use is projected to grow 2.4% per year, with registrations estimated to reach 3.8 million units by 2035.

The study indicates a gradual but steady rise in light-vehicle electrification, especially in major cities. By 2035, electrified vehicles are expected to represent about 6% of the national fleet, while flex-fuel vehicles will remain dominant at approximately 87%.

Public transportation is also set to expand, supported by investments under the Novo PAC program. Urban bus services are projected to grow 3.7% annually through 2035, while metro-rail systems are expected to increase by 3.6% per year, boosted by the anticipated launch of the Intermunicipal Train (TIM) and parts of the Intercities Train (TIC) in São Paulo.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-12.png,N,,2025-12-20 05:57:31.142110

Back when the US had a completely different administration in charge, the supply chain conversation began at the highest levels of government. The US Quadrennial Supply Chain Review set the tone, revisiting national logistics priorities after years of pandemic-induced volatility.

Inside the US Government's Landmark Supply Chain Review

Its release highlighted a renewed emphasis on technological modernisation and resource diversification – a bid to make the nation’s critical infrastructure more resilient and less dependent on single points of failure.

Meanwhile, in the consumer sphere, Amazon celebrated its billionth sustainable package delivery in the US – a landmark proving that circular logistics and sustainable packaging can coexist with high-volume e-commerce.

Already Racking Up The Hours

According to present fleet data made available by ch-aviation, United Airlines has a grand total of 167 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets in its current order book, with those that have already been produced clocking in at an average age of 2.6 years old. The oldest of these is N27751, which, having first flown in June 2021, is now 4.5 years old. Its most recent test flight, a circular journey from Boeing Field (BFI), took place on December 16.

This month has also seen two other United Airlines-bound Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft take to the skies, with N27752 in the air as recently as December 17 when it flew from Boeing Field to Eugene, Oregon, and back. Meanwhile, N27753 made a circular test flight from Boeing Field on December 4. Needless to say, plenty more flight hours will be racked up before these jets can join United, which said back in 2017 that:

""The 737 MAX 10 will enable us to continue using larger and more efficient aircraft within our domestic network and better meet the needs of our customers today and into the future.""

One Of The Aircraft Has Been Used As A Boeing ecoDemonstrator

Arguably the most notable use of a Boeing 737 MAX 10 jet that is destined for United Airlines has been the deployment of N27602 as part of the US planemaker's 'ecoDemonstrator' research program. This was announced by Boeing in 2023, and saw the manufacturer team up with NASA to conduct tests.

As part of this initiative, the special aircraft, which, as seen in the picture embedded above, wore a colorful striped livery in this role, operated test flights powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). When in the air for this purpose, it was trailed by a Douglas DC-8 from NASA to measure its emissions.

This allowed researchers to gather data concerning the differing emissions levels produced by SAF compared to conventional jet fuel, as well as the differences in contrail ice particles. Boeing added that ""the researchers' aim [was] to understand how advanced fuels, engine combustor designs, and other technologies may reduce atmospheric warming,"" given that ""some research has suggested certain contrails can trap heat in the atmosphere.""

Edge AI refers to the phenomenon of bringing AI-powered computing and functionality to the border of a network. For example, a company would use edge AI to enable sensors in a facility to process information sourced on-site in real time.

Typically, devices within edge AI infrastructure are more secure and private because data is housed locally, rather than in the cloud — although saving information to this infrastructure is also an option. Unfortunately, cloud infrastructure costs are rising, with some companies investing $1,000 monthly for the convenience. Eventually, edge could become a smarter financial investment.

This works by running AI models locally on a device. The machine could be a battery energy storage system or a solar panel. Nearby users can have access to the AI’s power within the equipment for real-time, hands-on access and monitoring. For energy tech, this could be helpful in several ways, including managing loads or boosting performance.

4 Ways Edge AI Improves Renewable Energy Operations

With these capabilities in mind, these are the most likely ways edge AI could influence and expand the possibilities of renewable energy.

1. Proactive Wind Turbine Maintenance

Edge AI could assist energy workers with the cumbersome tasks associated with wind turbine operations. The models can be directly located on the farms, eliminating the need for staff to travel long distances to diagnose maintenance concerns.

Machine learning achieved a 95% effectiveness rate in detecting turbine faults compared to normal samples. It could observe essential parameters, like vibration intensity, temperatures and noise levels, sending information to technicians about likely actions without wasting time.

2. Better Solar Power Forecasting

The unpredictability of solar has dissuaded some areas from adopting it, but incorporating edge AI could convince citizens of its reliability. It utilizes algorithms to identify extremely localized weather patterns, sun ray angles and cloud cover, enabling technology to harness as much energy as possible.

Alongside this information, it can leverage usage trends of connected assets to determine how much to send to battery storage and how much to reserve for peak hours. One case study at a photovoltaic plant proved that machine learning-informed operations improved maintenance, better integrated the grid and enhanced forecasting.

3. Access to a More Stabilized and Responsive Grid

Connecting renewable energy technologies closer to the grid will help manage the power supply more effectively. Edge AI can automatically adjust distribution to bring more to in-use electric vehicle chargers or send resources to homes with power outages. Fewer interruptions occur, and citizens experience better uptime.

Additionally, optimizing grid peripherals could make them last longer. Lithium-ion batteries have an estimated 10 to 15-year lifespan, but AI improvements could extend it further by reducing electrical and mechanical stress with unexpected disruptions or overloads.

4. Reductions to System Costs

Operating renewable energy could become cheaper with edge AI. It lowers power consumption as machine-to-machine communications are optimized. This could make smart vehicle-to-grid efforts more cost-effective by distributing less expensive electricity to its destinations. The energy from stored batteries can help during periods of high demand, and the grid can support the restoration of these fuel reserves when it makes the most logistical sense.

AI’s Renewable Role, From the Grid to the Edge

AI on the edge could be the reason more on-site renewable energy is installed at companies or how grid development expands to help communities. The advantages are inarguable, providing households and commercial buildings with greater energy security without the need for fossil fuels. Instead of delegating all AI assets to the cloud or other infrastructure, placing them on the edge will make insights more precise, responsive and impactful for the future of zero-carbon power.",https://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/ficheroenergias/fotos/photovoltaic-6239403_1280.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 09:56:24.838738

Globally, the Paysandú e-Fuels project is being watched as a potential template for how countries can leverage their renewable energy resources to produce clean fuels at scale.
With strong partnerships, clear goals, and a commitment to innovation, Uruguay is betting big on clean fuels.","On December 19, 2025, Uruguay took a decisive step into the future of clean energy, as HIF Global and the Government of Uruguay signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accelerate the development of an ambitious e-Fuels project in Paysandú. The agreement, announced in Montevideo and reported by EIN Presswire, is more than just a formality—it’s a comprehensive roadmap designed to bring the country’s vision for sustainable fuel production to life.

At the heart of the deal is a shared commitment to a project that could reshape Uruguay’s energy landscape and put the nation at the forefront of the global push for decarbonized transportation. The MoU, as outlined by HIF Global, sets out the technical and institutional milestones needed to reach a final investment decision. This includes not just the construction of a state-of-the-art e-Fuels production facility, but also the development of two major renewable energy parks—the Lucía Solar Park and the Elena Wind Park—which will power the entire operation with clean electricity.

But the agreement goes even further. Recognizing the importance of logistics, the MoU includes provisions to revitalize key railway lines. These upgrades are crucial for transporting the synthetic fuels from Paysandú to the Port of Montevideo, integrating Uruguay’s strategic infrastructure into the project’s operations and ensuring the finished product can reach global markets efficiently.

According to EIN Presswire, the MoU also establishes a High-Level Committee and a Technical Committee. These bodies, composed of government officials and HIF representatives, will coordinate everything from energy agreements and environmental permits to easement definitions and railway infrastructure. In other words, they’re tasked with making sure every piece of the puzzle fits together, so the project can move from blueprint to reality without unnecessary delays.

The scale of the project is nothing short of staggering. HIF Paysandú’s vision is to construct an industrial facility capable of producing up to 880,000 tons of e-Fuels per year. These synthetic fuels are made using green hydrogen—produced from renewable energy—and recycled CO₂, creating a closed-loop system that could decarbonize more than 400,000 vehicles annually. That’s not just a number on a page; it’s a real, measurable impact on global emissions, and a potential model for other countries grappling with the challenge of greening their transportation sectors.

The financial commitment is equally impressive. The project is expected to require an investment of over US$5.3 billion, a sum that underscores both the complexity and the promise of this endeavor. And it’s not just about money—there’s a significant human dimension too. During the construction phase, the project is projected to create approximately 1,400 jobs, with a further 300 permanent positions once operations commence. For the people of Paysandú and the wider region, that means new opportunities and a tangible economic boost.

Topsoe, a global leader in sustainable technology, has also joined the effort as a technology supplier for a related sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in Uruguay, according to a December 19, 2025 report by Sladjana Djunisic. This partnership brings world-class expertise to the table, ensuring that the latest advances in fuel technology are integrated into Uruguay’s clean energy push. Topsoe’s involvement signals confidence in the country’s ability to deliver on its ambitious goals and further strengthens Uruguay’s position as a hub for next-generation fuels.

HIF Global, for its part, is no stranger to the world of e-Fuels. The company’s name—short for Highly Innovative Fuels—reflects its mission to advance global energy sustainability. HIF is already producing e-Fuels at its Haru Oni facility in Chile and is developing commercial-scale projects in the United States, Brazil, Australia, and now, Uruguay. The company’s experience and track record lend credibility to the Paysandú project, giving stakeholders reason to believe that this ambitious plan can move from concept to completion.

“The agreement establishes the technical and institutional milestones required for the pre-investment decision phase and confirms the signatories’ intent to move forward with the project,” HIF Global stated in its official release, highlighting the seriousness of both parties in turning vision into action.

Uruguay’s government, meanwhile, sees the project as a way to reinforce the country’s reputation as a renewable energy leader. With nearly 98% of its electricity already coming from renewables, Uruguay has long been a darling of the clean energy world. This new venture—focusing on e-Fuels and synthetic fuels—represents the next logical step, taking the country’s expertise in green power and applying it to the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors: aviation, shipping, and heavy transport.

The project’s design is as ambitious as its goals. Construction will proceed in four stages, allowing for careful scaling and integration of new technologies as they become available. The plant’s use of green hydrogen and recycled CO₂ means that, once operational, it will not only reduce emissions from vehicles but also help recycle carbon that would otherwise contribute to global warming. It’s a win-win, both for Uruguay and for the planet.

Of course, no project of this scale is without its challenges. The MoU’s emphasis on environmental permits, easements, and infrastructure upgrades makes it clear that the road ahead will require careful navigation of regulatory, technical, and social hurdles. But the establishment of dedicated committees and the involvement of experienced partners like HIF Global and Topsoe suggest that Uruguay is taking a methodical, well-coordinated approach.

For local communities, the promise of jobs and investment is significant. The construction phase alone will bring more than a thousand positions to the region, and the operational plant will provide hundreds of stable, skilled jobs in a future-oriented industry. That’s no small matter in a world where economic transitions can often leave workers behind.

Globally, the Paysandú e-Fuels project is being watched as a potential template for how countries can leverage their renewable energy resources to produce clean fuels at scale. If successful, it could inspire similar efforts elsewhere, helping to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable future for transportation.

As the ink dries on the MoU and work begins in earnest, all eyes will be on Uruguay to see how this bold experiment unfolds. The stakes are high, but the potential rewards—for the country, its people, and the planet—are even higher. With strong partnerships, clear goals, and a commitment to innovation, Uruguay is betting big on clean fuels. The world will be watching to see if that bet pays off.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 07:56:54.941131

Two Young Climbers Begin Winter Ascent of McKinley

Two Young Climbers Begin Winter Ascent of McKinley Lane Christenson, 22, and Dalton Borton, 20, both students at the University of Alaska Anchorage, have embarked on a demanding winter ascent of Denali, also known as Mt. McKinley, which rises to 6,190 meters. The pair arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier two days ago, preparing to spend Christmas isolated on the mountain’s icy slopes. Their expedition takes place during the harshest season, when Denali’s severe cold and limited daylight render it one of the most formidable climbs worldwide. Experience and Preparation for Extreme Conditions Despite their youth, Christenson and Borton possess considerable experience navigating Alaska’s challenging mountain terrain. Borton first summited Denali in 2022 at the age of 17 and returned in March 2023 to tackle the technical Cassin Ridge under wintry conditions. Christenson reached Denali’s summit earlier this year during the conventional late spring season and also summited Bashful Peak, Anchorage’s highest point, in 2023. Nevertheless, a winter ascent of Denali presents a significantly greater challenge, with temperatures often colder than those encountered in the high Himalayas and the added difficulty of near-constant darkness due to the mountain’s northern latitude. The climbers will face the vast Alaska Range entirely alone, confronting not only the physical rigors of the climb but also the psychological strain of isolation. Their meticulous preparation includes specialized gear such as down suits and boots designed for 8,000-meter Himalayan peaks, as well as sleds, skis, and sufficient food and fuel to sustain their journey. Each will begin the ascent hauling approximately 200 pounds (91 kilograms) of equipment. The Rarity and Risks of Winter Ascents Winter ascents of Denali are exceptionally rare. According to Denali National Park records, only 17 people have reached the summit during winter, with six fatalities recorded in these attempts. The first successful winter ascent occurred in 1967, completed by Art Davidson, Ray Genet, and Dave Johnston over a 42-day expedition. In the past decade, only two climbers—both solo—have summited Denali in winter: Lonnie Dupre in 2015 and Jost Kobusch in 2023. Such high-profile expeditions often have broader implications beyond the climbing community. Companies specializing in winter mountaineering equipment may experience increased interest and sales as attention focuses on the specialized gear required for such extreme conditions. Meanwhile, the insurance industry, already contending with economic challenges, may be indirectly affected as businesses supporting adventure tourism and extreme sports reassess risk and coverage in light of these demanding undertakings. As Christenson and Borton commence their ascent, they join a select group of climbers who have dared to confront Denali’s winter extremes, pushing the limits of endurance and adventure.

The update also highlights continued foundational work to address Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect impacts associated with activities such as purchased goods and services, business travel, commuting, and construction materials.

During FY ’25, the Office of Campus Sustainability worked with external experts and campus partners to strengthen data quality, develop consistent tracking approaches, and synthesize feedback from more than 350 community members. In collaboration with the Center for Sustainable Systems in the School for Environment and Sustainability, the university advanced targeted analysis in four priority areas: business travel, food, capital goods (construction), and purchased goods and services.

As part of this work, U-M renewed a three-year partnership with Delta Airlines to advance the use of sustainable aviation fuel, a certified alternative jet fuel that can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The partnership supports efforts to address emissions associated with university-related air travel and complements broader Scope 3 analysis underway.

This phased work established a strong analytical foundation for future goal setting. Following recent senior leadership transitions, the university plans to complete Scope 3 goal-setting work in 2026.

Operations as learning opportunities

The update also reflects how major operational investments support U-M’s commitment to life-changing education. In FY ’25, the associate vice president for campus sustainability, the vice provost for sustainability and climate action, and the Office of the Vice President for Research established cross-functional campus as living learning lab working groups to better align campus energy, infrastructure, and resource-management projects with research priorities and educational opportunities.

“These efforts reinforce Michigan’s long-standing commitment to using the campus as a living-learning lab,” Weber said, “where operational systems are envisioned to intentionally support interdisciplinary research, applied learning, and real-world problem solving.”

Looking ahead

Looking ahead, the university will continue implementing on- and off-campus solar through Maize Rays, advancing geoexchange systems and energy-efficiency projects, expanding low-carbon transportation, and completing Scope 3 goal-setting work.

A more comprehensive update will be released this spring through the Sustainability Leadership Council.",,N,,2025-12-19 15:56:53.940549

The transition to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is critical for reducing the environmental footprint of the aviation sector. This study presents a comparative analysis of two promising pathways for SAF production - One via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis and the second one via Methanol-to-Jet. The assessment includes technical, economic, and environmental aspects to provide a holistic evaluation of both routes, with a particular focus on the methanol route, using the FT route as a benchmark. The technical analysis examines feedstock flexibility, process efficiency and fuel quality and highlights key operational considerations and challenges. Economic feasibility is assessed based on capital and operating costs, while the environmental impact is assessed based on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, energy requirements and potential sustainability benefits. A detailed study of the MTJ route explores its advantages in terms of reduced process complexity, potential for cost reduction and compatibility with existing methanol production infrastructure. The study includes detailed kinetic models for the main process steps in order to assess the composition of the fuel examines reaction conditions and integration strategies to optimize efficiency and output quality. Using FT-SAF as a benchmark, the research illustrates the comparative advantages and challenges of the MTJ route, highlighting its potential to become a leading SAF production pathway. Preliminary results indicate that both routes offer viable SAF production options, but MTJ offers specific economic and environmental advantages that merit further exploration. The study identifies key factors influencing the selection of SAF production routes and provides insights into optimizing process configurations for improved sustainability. For the data basis, the processes are modelled using the flowsheeting software AspenPlus® coupled via the in-house tool aspenparserDLR for automated data exchange between the simulation software and python. Additionally, the direct interaction allows to include own optimizer algorithms for reactor design and complex kinetic models while performing parameter variation to identify the ideal process designs. Combined with the python-based tool pyteea for techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) a holistic evaluation of the production pathways is realized. This work contributes to the strategic decision-making process for SAF deployment, supporting the aviation industry's decarbonization goals. The findings offer valuable guidance for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers seeking to advance sustainable fuel technologies.",,N,,2025-12-19 17:57:36.185414

Bombardier today announced that the Global 8000(1), the world’s fastest business aircraft, received U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification. The FAA certification marks the latest in a series of achievements over the past year that continue to illustrate the exceptional pedigree of this industry-defining ultra-long-range business aircraft – the fastest and most luxurious business jet in the skies. The Global 8000 received Transport Canada (TC) Type Certification on November 5, 2025 and entered into service in December 2025. Certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is pending.

“This accomplishment is a direct result of the commitment to excellence and dedicated work of our highly skilled employees, suppliers, Transport Canada and the FAA for a collaborative, effective process,” said Stephen McCullough, Senior Vice President, Engineering and Product Development, Bombardier. “Attaining the Global 8000 certification from the FAA sets new performance standards in the industry and marks one of the final chapters in our very successful development program for this groundbreaking business jet.”

In addition to entering into service and attaining certifications from both Canadian and American regulatory authorities as per schedule, the Global 8000 has redefined business aviation due to its unbeatable performance attributes and exquisite cabins.

With the lowest cabin altitude in business aviation production at 2,691 ft., customers will feel like they are standing atop the Burj Khalifa as they cruise at 41,000 ft. This significantly reduced cabin altitude minimizes the physiological stress typically associated with high-altitude travel, helping passengers arrive feeling refreshed, alert, and ready to perform.

The Global 8000 also boasts a top speed of Mach 0.95, enabling customers to fly farther, faster than any competing true four-zone business jet in the industry.

The Global 8000 is also the only true four-zone business jet to offer a range of 8,000 NM, enabling nonstop travel between more city pairs than ever before.

Mr. Bloom, a board director who joined Gevo in 2021, inherits a company increasingly focused on scaling low-carbon fuels alongside carbon management.

“I am honored to be leading Gevo into its next phase of critical growth,” Mr. Bloom said, adding that his focus will be “increasing profitability from our active businesses while leveraging our technology, business system, and intellectual-property portfolio to accelerate Gevo’s growth.” Mr. Gruber called the moment “an exciting new chapter,” saying Mr. Bloom’s experience will be “instrumental as Gevo continues to scale and deliver on its mission to fill the critical market need for jet fuel.”

A Rating Sets the Stage for the Next Gevo CEO

Days after outlining the succession plan, Gevo disclosed that BeZero Carbon upgraded its North Dakota carbon capture and storage project to an “A” rating, placing it among the top tier of independently assessed carbon-removal assets. The facility issues carbon dioxide removal credits under the Puro.earth standard and is the only ethanol-based project to earn certification for thousand-year geological storage.

“CORCs are gaining traction in the growing VCM and are expected to provide valuable co-product revenue for our operations,” said Alex Clayton, Gevo’s chief business development officer. He said the “A” grade should “simplify the due diligence process for buyers” and improve credit value. Sustainability chief Nancy Young said the company is expanding its Verity data platform to deepen measurement and verification of farm practices tied to its feedstock.

The three-day event included a trade show, awards presentations and educational sessions that briefed farmers on policy and production issues affecting Georgia’s major commodities.

The convention’s theme, “Rise and Thrive,” emphasized how the organization and Georgia’s agricultural community has worked together to help Georgia farmers hit by Hurricane Helene, last year, recover from the storm.

GFB President Tom McCall delivered his annual address, and GFB Chief Administrative Office Jeffrey Harvey gave an organizational update.

Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tyler Harper, Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns and U.S. Navy Retired Commander Frank “Walleye” Weisser addressed convention delegates during the general session on Dec. 8.

McCall discusses GFB leadership programs & legislative efforts

Tom McCall reiterated the organization’s commitment to helping Georgia farmers recover from Hurricane Helene, outlined how GFB is developing future agricultural leaders and discussed the legislative issues GFB advocated for on behalf of farmers this year.

“We are not defined by the number of times we fall, but rather by how many times we rise and how we thrive afterwards. This message hits home after what we all went through with Hurricane Helene, which devastated farms, families and entire communities,” McCall said. “Helene also revealed something powerful: the faith, endurance and unity of Georgia farmers. Our faith, determination and unity define us. That’s what Georgia Farm Bureau stands for – protecting your right to farm and protecting your family from loss.”

On Oct. 1, GFB announced the launch of a new program, Leadership GFB, which will equip rising and current GFB leaders with the tools they need to successfully advocate for agriculture, develop leadership skills, and embody the organization’s grassroots mission. Participants will attend sessions focused on leadership development, understanding the county, state and national structure of Farm Bureau and its grassroots network, policy work on agricultural issues, and the importance of agricultural literacy. GFB is expected to announce the class by Dec. 22.

McCall outlined how GFB is also laying the foundation for its next generation of leaders through chapters of Collegiate Young Farmers & Ranchers at ABAC and UGA. Officers from both chapters are being given opportunities to experience Farm Bureau from the inside out.

GFB also offers leadership programs through its Young Farmers & Ranchers Program for farmer members ages 18-35 and for female agriculturalists of all ages through its Women’s Leadership Program.

McCall stressed that GFB’s primary focus will always be to serve as the voice of farmers in the legislative arena.

In 2025 GFB supported tort-reform legislation, secured protection from unfair pesticide liability, secured practical truck-weight limits, fought for a common-sense federal definition of navigable waters, and for state deer-management improvements.

“We also pushed hard on the farm bill and disaster relief funding for Hurricane Helene victims. Every year bad pieces of legislation surface that could hurt your farms and families. GFB’s advocacy team helps stop them all while advancing the good bills to the governor’s desk.”

Savannah Port vital to U.S. ag exports

Georgia Ports Authority Chairman Kent Fountain gave an informative overview of the Savannah/Garden City port while addressing GFB convention attendees during the Dec. 8 general session of the GFB convention.

“We want to be the easiest port to do business with,” Fountain said. “We want to help you move your product throughout the world. Our mission is to be the economic engine for agriculture.”

Fountain said the Savannah port is second in the U.S. for ag exports behind the Los Angeles port. In the past year, 13% of all U.S. ag exports were shipped via the Savannah port while the Los Angeles port shipped 16% of U.S. ag exports. He said about 45% of Savannah’s exports are agricultural products. Raw cotton accounts for 15% of Savannah’s ag exports followed by poultry at 9%, pet and animal feed at 7%, logs and lumber at 6%, field seeds & bulbs at 4%, grain & flour products at 1%, meat at 1%, and other ag products at 3%.

Fountain said 70% of the United States’ population is served by products that move through the Georgia Ports Authority. The Savannah/Garden City port is the 43rd most connected port in the world and is the second most connected port in the U.S.

“On average, we can get products from the ship onto the rail within 24 hours to be moved to their next destination. We’re very proud of this,” Fountain said.

The port is the only one in the U.S. that has a customs facility onsite, he said.

Harper discusses USDA Hurricane Helene block grants & Farmer Bridge Assistance

While speaking at the convention, Georgia Agricultural Commissioner Tyler Harper said Georgia Department of Agriculture employees have spent hundreds of hours crafting a block grant plan to disperse the $531 million the USDA announced in September it will allocate to the state to help farmers who suffered loss to Hurricane Helene on Sept. 27, 2024. Georgia’s block grant program will cover future economic losses, infrastructure losses and timber losses caused by Hurricane Helene in Georgia’s more than 100 disaster-declared counties.

“USDA has our final agreement and plan in their hands, and we expect to make an announcement on the details of the program and how to apply any day now,” Harper said.

Visit www.farmrecovery.com for program details, such as a list of eligible counties and the types of documents applicants will need to submit with their application. Eligible timber producers and farmers should periodically check the website in the days to come to download an application.

As the general session ended, Harper returned to the podium to say he had just been notified that USDA was announcing the rollout of a $12 billion relief package designed to help farmers nationwide manage rising production costs and ongoing market disruptions. Most of the funds - up to $11 billion - will flow through the new Farmer Bridge Assistance Program, aimed at row crop producers including corn, cotton, peanuts, soybeans, wheat, oats, sorghum, canola, and other row crops.

Another $1 billion will be directed toward specialty crops and other commodities, with additional program details expected in the coming weeks.

According to USDA, payments are scheduled to begin rolling out by Feb. 28, 2026. Producers must ensure their 2025 acreage reports are filed with their local USDA Farm Service Agency by 5 p.m. ET on Dec. 19, 2025, to remain eligible.

Burns: Chopping away at timber issues

Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns reviewed steps the state legislature took during its 2025 session to aid farmers in the recovery from Hurricane Helene that includes reforestation tax credits and harvest tax suspension for 2025 related to Helene damage. Timber owners must apply by Dec. 31, 2025, to receive the exemptions. Visit https://gfagrow.org/helene-resources/ for more information and to download the applications.

Burns also discussed avenues the state is pursuing to help Georgia’s timber sector and forestry stakeholders through long-term solutions with new-product-development at research institutions regarding sustainable aviation fuel and modern timber-based building materials.

“These opportunities represent long-term solutions. You can’t do them overnight,” Burns said. “I can assure you that I and my colleagues in the House have been working for the last few months on solutions that … I believe will have an immediate impact and provide urgent relief to timber growers, timber owners and forestland owners in the state.

Burns noted collaborations with state house speakers in Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and other states, congressional delegations from Georgia and other southern states, federal agencies and the Trump administration. He mentioned conversations with Small Business Administrator (SBA) Kelly Loeffler to let her know that recent timber mill closures affect businesses of all sizes.

“There’s a ripple effect,” Burns said. “It’s across all of our communities. We want to inform them that we need some help.”

As a result, Burns said, SBA is helping in the development of strategies to adjust policies and regulations to provide relief.

The engagement has included work with United States Trade Representative Jameson Greer to make small changes to trade policy to remove what Burns called arbitrary trade barriers.

One such barrier is the export to the European Union of forest products fumigated with sulfuric fluoride. Burns said the product is licensed and widely used in the U.S. and the EU.

Another is tariffs relating to the transship clause, which Burns would like to see clarified to exempt wood that was grown in the U.S., shipped to other countries as manufacturing material, then returned to the U.S. as finished products.

“We’re asking for a slight clarification that will reassure importers when the products are imported back into this country that those products can be tariff-free and tariff-exempt, if they can provide documentation that the raw products that were utilized to prepare and manufacture those products originated here in this country,” Burns said.

Burns noted that the federal government is being asked to establish a 90-day notice before a changed tariff goes into effect.

“These are nothing but slight adjustments to existing language and policy that will provide the forest industry with a little breathing room,” Burns said.

Weisser: Failure is necessary for growth

Keynote speaker Frank “Walleye” Weisser shared his experiences as a Navy pilot, including two stints as a member of the Blue Angels and as pilot for Tom Cruise’s aerial scenes in the movie Top Gun: Maverick.

Weisser discussed the detail and focus required to do what Navy pilots do, driving home how difficult it is. He attended the U.S. Naval Academy and originally wanted to be a Navy SEAL. But, when Weisser got to service selection – when the Navy informs cadets what form their service will take – he was assigned to be a Navy pilot.

“To say I felt like a failure would be an unbelievable understatement for me,” Weisser said. “I called all my friends, and I said, ‘Everything you watched me strive for, I failed out.’ ”

Once enrolled in flight school, there is no transition to become a SEAL.

“The lesson I learned at that point was that up until that time, I was being selfish. It’s not selfish to serve your country. It’s not how I serve. It’s just that I serve.”

Flight school offered no smooth sailing. He failed his first test. When he got into a plane, he never got it off the ground. Once he got off the ground, more mistakes followed.

“I kind of failed into aviation and accelerated the failures from there. But at some point, it turned around,” Weisser said. “I share this with you, especially for individuals in this room who are young and have been successful at everything you’ve done, because at some point if you push yourself, you will fail.”

Failure, he said, isn’t final.

“You have to have the willingness and the desire to keep going. For me, these failures became unquestionably the biggest blessing in my life,” he said.

After Blue Angels shows, the pilots and flight crews go through debrief that includes a dose of self-review of all the mistakes each person made.

Admitting mistakes, he said, allows teams to move forward and builds trust.

“If you sit in front of people who work for you, who are junior to you, who are less experienced, and you’re willing to say, ‘I screwed this up,’ that’s really, really powerful.”",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/griceconnect/images/articles/tom-mccall.png;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-12-19 15:57:04.147942

Yet today, SAF accounts for just 0.7% of airline fuel demand despite doubling in 2024. Key findings: - The core barrier is economic viability, not technology readiness. - Early adopters face €800-4,000 per tonne premiums, creating a structural first-mover disadvantage. - Historic precedent shows mandates work: EU battery recycling rose from 33% to 51% following compulsory targets and enforcement. - Policy instability is the single greatest risk to SAF becoming a scalable climate solution.

‘There’s a political debate about development finance and concessional finance all over the world, including in Europe.
Reframing the narrative The MDBs noted that part of the answer lies in reframing narratives around financing to align with priorities that are closer to those of the US administration.
Moving away from perceptions of risk Several MDBs noted that they are looking to switch from predominantly providing debt financing and guarantees to offering risk taking equity.
‘I’m not pessimistic, but the degree of complexity has increased dramatically.’ This was originally published in OMFIF’s Transition finance working group report: ‘The next frontier in transition finance’.","The world’s multilateral development banks have been in the vanguard of both financing the global response to climate change and in developing and funding blended finance vehicles that aim to overcome market failures and structural barriers to that response. Those efforts are at risk from a US government that is hostile to the energy transition and is a major shareholder in some of the largest MDBs.

To better understand how these institutions are responding to the new climate, and what this means for their approaches to blended finance, OMFIF spoke with leading MDBs during New York Climate Week in September 2025.

The participants agreed that raising funds from their government shareholders had got harder – but noted that this trend pre-dated President Donald Trump’s re-election and is the case across developed economies. ‘We were already seeing a tightening in the fiscal space, and the concessional financing pool was already dwindling. This has just made the trend clearer.’

One European MDB noted that the Trump administration’s unwillingness to fund overseas development has its echoes across the Atlantic. ‘There’s a political debate about development finance and concessional finance all over the world, including in Europe. It’s understandable – governments are accountable to their own electorates.’

This means that MDBs and other advocates of development finance have to work harder to sell the benefits to politicians and the general public in donor countries. ‘We have to be clearer in our communication and explain why this is in the best interests of Europe, or in the best interests of the US,’ they added.

Reframing the narrative

The MDBs noted that part of the answer lies in reframing narratives around financing to align with priorities that are closer to those of the US administration. Several gave the example of the Mission 300 initiative, which seeks to provide 300m people in Sub-Saharan Africa with electricity by 2030, aiming to promote clean energy, economic growth and job creation through infrastructure investment, sector reform and public-private partnerships, including blended finance vehicles.

‘This is not only about climate, it’s about access to energy,’ one MDB said. ‘It’s not ideological, it’s good for energy resilience and economic growth.’ They added that, in many parts of the world, renewables can provide the cheapest source of energy, meaning that economic development and climate priorities remain aligned.

However, given the constraints on government funding for MDBs, they are also looking elsewhere for sources of finance for their priorities. For one MDB, government subsidies are a big focus. ‘We are having a big push on subsidy repurposing. We’re not against subsidies – that’s how governments signal investment priorities. But they aren’t necessarily helping where they are needed.’ The speaker noted that Nigeria has been successful in redirecting subsidies away from fossil fuels, and that the MDB is also making good progress supporting agricultural subsidy reform.

Moving away from perceptions of risk

Several MDBs noted that they are looking to switch from predominantly providing debt financing and guarantees to offering risk taking equity. ‘What we’re hearing from lower middle-income countries, particularly, is that the de-risking is helpful, but it’s not enough without a serious equity play,’ said one.

Another MDB observed there has been an assumption that the problem facing developing countries was not a lack of liquidity, but a specific risk preventing that capital being deployed. ‘We’ve learned that there isn’t excess liquidity, by and large.’ To overcome this, there needs to be ‘liquidity injected as more patient capital to signal which sectors we believe have long-term upside potential.’

This is also about encouraging co-investors – particularly in the private sector – to think about the climate transition in terms of investment opportunity. ‘We’ve been so focused on de-risking. We need to stop talking about risk all the time in the transition space and start talking about opportunity.’

Numerous sectors within the climate transition are already profitable, and MDBs’ equity investments provide a means of encouraging private sector co-financing. ‘It’s about signalling and catalysing’ coinvestment, one MDB noted.

Crowding in private capital

MDBs are well-positioned to do much of the heavy lifting in terms of due diligence and providing a stamp of approval that helps to bring in private sector investors. ‘We have entire teams just doing sustainability checks, which these private sector investors can benefit from,’ said one. ’We can absorb the transaction costs to give a check mark on an investment’s broader ESG. That reputational rigour is really important. And, in these transition sectors, particularly those in the early stages of development, it does help to bring in the private sector,’ another said.

MDBs are focusing efforts on developing country transition platforms that promise to bring in a wide range of host country stakeholders – government, the energy sector, industrial companies and local financiers – with a range of providers of various types of development and concessional finance.

‘There is a problem around the fragmentation of these concessional funds and it can be very difficult to combine different instruments to achieve impact,’ noted one MDB, given that they often have different eligibility constraints, tenors and risk tolerances. By developing programmatic country platforms, MDBs can bring this financing together with pipelines of projects and investments that require different types of capital.

In one example, the MDB directed grant funding to decommissioning coal-fired power plants, concessional finance to electricity grid development, while the renewable energy investment was left entirely to the commercial sector. ‘This combination worked very well.’

But despite finding innovative mechanisms, new sources of funding and common ground with sceptical donors, MDBs will inevitably have to be less ambitious when it comes to funding climate solutions that are further from commercialisation. ‘Those technologies that clearly require a “green premium” to become economically viable – sustainable aviation fuel, green cement, green steel – have become more difficult,’ one MDB said.

And, undoubtedly, it’s a much more difficult environment to navigate. ‘I’m not pessimistic, but the degree of complexity has increased dramatically.’

Through major investments in next-generation aircraft and steadying labour relations, Smith has been responsible for steering the group back to profitability after the coronavirus pandemic.

He joined our editorial director, Tyler Brûlé, in Studio 5 on Rue Bachaumont, Paris, to discuss how he restored profitability and improved efficiency, luxury and sustainability.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Listen to the full interview on ‘The Chiefs’ from Monocle Radio.

Earlier this year, you launched La Première, your newest first-class experience. What has the response been like?

It has been fantastic and exceeded our expectations. We’re going to expand the footprint by 50 per cent, adding more aircraft to the fleet with La Première cabins. We keep adding to the amenities that our customers are asking for. We believe that we can give the Gulf carriers a good run for their money but we view the Gulf carriers not as companies and instead as countries.

Can Air France compete against a country? I guess it depends on what the country wants. In Asia, we don’t have the same work rules. There are two or three in Asia that are a bit of a challenge but we went from number 26 in the world to number eight. We want to be number one in Europe in every cabin and I think we can get there.

Looking ahead, where is Air France-KLM focusing its growth? What new routes can passengers expect in 2026?

Prior to our decision to expand the fleet equipped with La Première cabins, the US was our number-one market. We’ve just announced that we’re going to add Boston and Houston in the US, as well as Atlanta – the home base of our partner Delta. We’re going to add more services to Asia: we’ll go to Hong Kong and perhaps we’ll see how Tel Aviv goes. Maybe one or two more in the Middle East. But if you look at the major GDP cities of our long-haul network, you can pick the next five or 10. The destinations we announce won’t be a surprise.

It has been a complex year for global aviation. What were the defining issues of 2025 for you?

We’re looking closely at overflight rights, taxes and mandates for fuels such as SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] and for ETS [Emissions Trading System] charges. We are advocating for European-based carriers to have a total level playing field. We have lost customers because of our inability to fly over Russia. But, for the most part, our best customers are staying with us. They’re happy with our service. What is impactful is the cost of operating.

Climate change adherents believe technology and industrialization caused the climate change problem.","Cerebri AI in 2022 began developing a CO2 calculator for air travel. It’s also been deploying traditional AI throughout its travel data engineering platform and large language model-based agents in its agentic solutions for managed travel. Here, founder and CEO Jean Belanger explains the worrying connection between AI and CO2 emissions, and argues that the travel industry is focused on the wrong climate solutions.

According to current climate change thinking in the corporate travel industry, to meet the goals of governments and NGOs, we have to decarbonize air travel, which is 70 percent to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions for a typical business trip, and/or reduce travel via higher fees and taxes.

Decarbonizing air travel means replacing jet fuel, a wonder product in terms of its power-to-weight ratio. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels are horrifically expensive for the modestly profitable airline industry to develop and use on a global basis. Ticket prices will have to go up given how difficult it is to scale these initiatives, even with bleeding-edge technology. Increased fees and, yes, taxes to reduce demand are meeting a lot of expected resistance.

SAF premiums and increased fees and taxes for air travel will only exacerbate current affordability issues being exposed by our political process. And that is before we deal with the massive power requirements of new agentic AI and large language model (LLM) technology that inhales electricity in vast quantities.

AI and climate change are on a collision course, with the impact coming long before a solution to reducing CO2 emissions in corporate travel. I believe that AI may sponsor the solution to both problems and we all come out as winners. Let me explain.

Background

Over 30 percent of our global annual CO2 emissions is from electricity generation (17 billion tons). As many industries “electrify” (electric vehicles, for example), it is easy to see this increasing to over 50 percent of future CO2 emissions.

That 30 percent was calculated before factoring in the impact of the tsunami of AI data centers announced in the past 24 months. Anthropic, Google, Meta, OpenAI and X.AI are the key U.S. vendors driving the current AI revolution with their LLMs.

Anthropic estimated that the AI data centers needed by 2028 would consume 50 gigawatts of power. That’s enough to power many millions of homes.

LLMs and agentic AI are changing electricity generation forever. AI data centers require high-quality, reliable and stable electricity — characterized by voltage stability, low harmonic distortion, consistent frequency and minimal power spikes, and delivered with redundancy to support continuous, mission-critical operations.

But what proof do we have that this AI revolution will actually happen? First, AI works. Second, national security. Governments want in. They want their own national AI champions. The race is on.

Where Climate Change And AI Intersect

Silicon Valley innovators market a simple message: Buy our technology and good things happen. Governments and NGOs drive climate change actions with another message: Do what we say or bad things happen.

Silicon Valley will not invest in anything related to fossil fuels to power its AI revolution because it believes climate change is a serious problem. And renewables don’t meet the stiff technical power requirements of new AI data centers.

So, what are Bill Gates, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey doing? They are investing in next-gen nuclear power startups.

What?

Silicon Valley wants to go nuclear, believing the world cannot generate enough power fast enough to satisfy the needs of data centers powering LLMs and agentic AI.

They are investing in small modular reactors (SMR) that range in size from 10 megawatts to 300 megawatts, emphasize safety and industrial design, and enable factory production of nuclear equipment, thereby improving quality while reducing costs. Manufacturing nuclear reactors rather than building them onsite reduces costs at scale, and locating SMRs next to large power users minimizes the need to invest in distribution infrastructure (e.g., transmission lines delivering power hundreds of miles).

Robert Bryce’s team has tracked 46 entities from 19 countries that are developing 60 types of SMRs. Market pressure from SMR startups is forcing vendors of traditional 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactors to follow suit, with greater emphasis on safety and cost controls. Manufacturing nuclear reactors “at scale” will more than likely obsolete other methods of producing the high-quality electricity that AI data centers need.

The Bottom Line

Climate change adherents believe we must reduce our CO2 emissions by 2050 or face dire consequences – 25 years to solve the problem. Twenty-five years ago, the internet was struggling for acceptance. Twenty-five years before that, mobile phones had yet to appear. From a technology point of view, 25 years is a very long time.

We already know that the cost of fixing the climate change problem, sector by sector, varies massively. Replacing jet fuel is going to cost far more per pound of CO2 saved than attacking emissions in other sectors, like electricity generation.

If we want to accommodate the stunning requirements of both the “new AI” and the desire for developing countries to increase their standard of living, we can only do this one way: generate emissions-free, high-quality electricity, at scale and at affordable prices.

Climate change adherents believe technology and industrialization caused the climate change problem. Maybe it should be no surprise that our best and brightest in Silicon Valley might solve the climate change problem over the next 25 years by fixing their AI electricity generation issues, reinventing nuclear power generation with SMRs and forcing large-scale nuclear providers to get their act together.

Currently nuclear energy generates 18 percent to 19 percent of the electricity in the United States. We know it works. We should count on our brilliant technologists who have more than likely found the answers we need rather than on faceless government/NGO bureaucrats issuing regulation after regulation.

By investing alongside Silicon Valley, the travel industry and aviation can reduce CO2 emissions far faster — and in a less expensive fashion — than investing in the promise of high-cost SAF, e-fuels and green hydrogen.",https://www.thecompanydime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jean-Belanger-200-200.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 11:57:29.155222

The trade group, which represents the world’s airlines, argues this competition could delay aviation’s climate goals to become net-zero by 2050.
“With AI passing up the airlines, we’re falling behind on CO2 emissions,” said Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman.
The Money Problem IATA estimates airlines need about $174 billion in annual investment to produce enough sustainable fuel and meet their 2050 net-zero target.
In Europe, IATA says oil companies are charging airlines extra fees that exceed actual SAF costs by more than double.","Airlines warn the explosive growth of artificial intelligence could stall aviation’s green transition by consuming the renewable energy needed to produce cleaner jet fuel.

In a new report, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) points to two issues:

Data centers are “adding strong and rising demand for electricity, both renewable and other, to the already supply-constrained electricity and renewable-energy markets, pushing up prices.”

At the same time, they’re increasing CO2 emissions as AI expands faster than renewable-energy supply.

“Hence, this sector is causing double trouble,” IATA said. “Pushing up energy prices, and secondly by increasing CO2 emissions as it expands faster than renewable-energy supply.”

SAF is made from sources such as used cooking oil and crops, and renewable energy is needed to process the materials into jet fuel. IATA claims SAF emits up to 70% less emissions when compared to traditional jet fuel, and sees it as the main lever to reduce airline emissions.

The trade group, which represents the world’s airlines, argues this competition could delay aviation’s climate goals to become net-zero by 2050.

“Without coordinated policy to prioritize renewables and safeguard liquid fuel needs, this could delay aviation’s decarbonization and divert investment away from critical climate solutions.”

IATA claims AI data centers now account for up to 4% of global emissions, which is about the same as the aviation industry.

‘Go After AI. Don’t Go After Us’

Airline executives are frustrated.

“With AI passing up the airlines, we’re falling behind on CO2 emissions,” said Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman. “You have so much power generation to generate all the AI stuff, that they’re going to create so much CO2.”

“AI is the new bad guy. So go after AI. Don’t go after us airlines.”

He criticized the cost of aviation’s climate requirements, saying they threaten jobs across the industry while doing little to solve the problem given aviation’s “small percentage” of global emissions.

The Money Problem

IATA estimates airlines need about $174 billion in annual investment to produce enough sustainable fuel and meet their 2050 net-zero target.

But right now, investment in low-emissions fuels sits at just $30 billion globally, IATA said.

Meanwhile, AI is attracting $200-400 billion in investment this year alone, with that figure expected to hit $500 billion in 2026, according to the report.

“Clearly the reallocation of capital to renewable energy in general, and to renewable fuels and SAF in particular, is not happening at the scale that is commensurate with its standing as a global priority,” IATA writes.

A Different Picture

However, recent research paints a different picture of AI’s climate impact.

A study published in the journal Patterns this month found that AI accounts for around 0.1% of global electricity demand and 0.04% of global emissions.

The research, led by scientists at institutions including the University of Massachusetts Amherst, acknowledges AI’s energy use is growing rapidly but says current claims about its emissions are “significantly overestimated.”

The International Energy Agency recently estimated that renewable energy has overtaken coal as the world’s largest source of electricity.

Skift contacted IATA for additional information but did not receive a response.

The SAF Shortage

IATA expects sustainable aviation fuel to make up less than 1% of total jet fuel use in 2026 — “an unambiguous verdict on how ineffective the current policy environment is,” the report says.

Airlines are also facing higher costs due to new mandates.

In Europe, IATA says oil companies are charging airlines extra fees that exceed actual SAF costs by more than double.

The group calls for “coordinated policy to prioritize renewables and safeguard liquid fuel needs,” warning that without it, aviation’s shift away from fossil fuels will take longer and cost more.

In this exclusive Invezz interview, Symes – an Oxford University chemistry graduate with deep experience in climate tech investing at BP Ventures and IP Group – explains how the Oxford spin-out’s novel catalysis is de-risking eSAF production just months after raising $28 million from major aviation and energy players.

With the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at Oxford Airport now operational since 2024 and producing jet-range hydrocarbons directly from waste carbon and hydrogen, Symes argues that innovating on conversion chemistry, rather than relying solely on feedstocks or policy, will drive the economics needed for mass adoption.

He further highlights the strategic involvement of investors like Aramco Ventures, noting that incumbents see a role in the transition to waste-based SAF.

Additionally, Symes predicts that direct CO₂ utilisation pathways will dominate long-term as mandates tighten toward 2050.

Below are edited excerpts from the interview:

Targeting cost parity: economics of one-step PtL

Invezz: The price of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still 3–6× higher than fossil jet fuel. Your new demo plant at Oxford Airport just started producing real PtL SAF—when do you realistically see OXCCU’s fuel hitting price parity with conventional Jet A-1?

Andrew Symes: Today, advanced SAF is typically around 5–10× the price of fossil jet fuel. Our mission is to bring that down to around 2× fossil jet fuel, which we believe is achievable with the right technology and scale.

Independent third-party techno-economic modelling shows our one-step process can reduce CAPEX by ~50% and cost per tonne by ~25% compared to conventional routes.

At that level, the impact on ticket prices is modest and manageable. Reaching true price parity with Jet A-1 would require further reductions in feedstock and green electricity costs, and increased scale.

Aramco ventures

Invezz: Aramco Ventures just co-led your $28M Series B. How does it feel to have one of the world’s biggest oil companies betting on a technology that could make their core product obsolete?

Andrew Symes: Aramco Ventures became an investor in OXCCU in 2023 and reinvested in the company’s Series B.

The Series B round was co-led by new investors Safran and Orlen, alongside Aramco and other aviation and energy players, including IAG and Eni.

From the beginning, we have wanted to engage with the existing industry.

The partners we work with recognise that aviation needs a scalable solution to reduce emissions, and that they can be part of that solution.

Many of the core capabilities remain the same. The skills required to deliver jet fuel to airports and to use it in aircraft do not change.

Existing refinery, pipeline and tank assets can also play a role in co-processing, transport and blending.

Fossil jet fuel will still be sold during the transition, but technologies like ours allow that system to shift over time towards waste-based SAF.

Scaling SAF: overcoming feedstock and process bottlenecks

Invezz: IATA says we need 450 billion litres of SAF per year by 2050 to reach net-zero. What’s the one bottleneck—hydrogen cost, CO2 supply, policy, or something else—that’s still keeping us from scaling that fast?

Andrew Symes: Feedstock availability sits at the centre of everything because it drives cost.

For HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) SAF, used fats and oils used are clearly limited. For advanced bioSAF, biocarbon waste is difficult to aggregate and therefore, can be costly.

For eSAF, green electricity is the key feedstock, as it drives the cost of green hydrogen.

What is often overlooked though, is how important the processes are that convert these feedstocks into SAF. Unlike HEFA, which is a fairly simple and proven process, advanced SAF and eSAF require new conversion routes.

Innovation to reduce the number of steps and improve selectivity toward jet fuel is critical.

This is what we are focused on at OXCCU. Feedstock availability will always be somewhat of a challenge for SAF compared to fossil fuels, and that is hard to change.

What we can focus on are the conversion processes. That is why our focus is relentlessly on simplifying the chemistry and reducing capital intensity.

Policy and regulation matter enormously because they create demand certainty, but even with strong mandates, SAF will only scale if the economics work.

Invezz: Europe’s ReFuelEU mandate is ramping up aggressively from 2025. Is the regulation moving fast enough, or is it actually now pulling the market faster than technology can respond?

Andrew Symes: ReFuelEU is not a mistake. Aviation needs a solution, and it needs it to start scaling now, not in 2035.

Without early policy support, costs will never come down, and the technology will not be ready when demand arrives.

That said, regulation must remain pragmatic and overly rigid rules around feedstocks risk slowing deployment rather than accelerating it.

Policy should create the market, while allowing technology the flexibility to evolve.

Market momentum: take-off moment for power-to-liquids

Invezz: United Airlines just signed the biggest SAF offtake deal in history with CEMEX for power-to-liquid fuel. Are we finally seeing the “take-off” moment for PtL, or is this still early hype?

Andrew Symes: We are moving out of the hype phase and into early execution. Power-to-liquids is now backed by regulation, sub-mandates, and real offtake interest, particularly in Europe.

That said, this is still early. Building commercial plants takes time, capital and engineering effort.

What will determine success is who can deliver cost-competitive fuel at scale over the next decade.

Invezz: You’ve talked about making jet fuel for “a few pence per litre” at scale. Give us your boldest prediction: what will OXCCU’s production cost per litre be in 2030 and in 2035?

Andrew Symes: Our stated ambition is to reduce advanced SAF from today’s 5–10× fossil jet fuel to around 2× fossil jet fuel, using genuine waste carbon feedstocks and simplified process design.

Future of SAF

Invezz: A lot of SAF today still comes from used cooking oil and animal fats. When do you think direct CO2-to-jet-fuel routes like yours will overtake HEFA as the dominant SAF pathway?

Andrew Symes: HEFA plays a crucial role today, but it is fundamentally constrained by land use and feedstock availability. Just using oils cannot meet long-term demand at scale without serious environmental trade-offs.

We believe CO₂ and/or CO with H2 to SAF via iron-based Fischer-Tropsch will dominate.

The flexibility to work with CO2 directly as well as CO means it is applicable to converting: gasified solid carbon waste, reformed biogas, and CO2 and green H2.

These waste-based pathways are essential for reaching high blending levels in the 2030s and beyond.

As mandates rise towards 2040 and 2050, these routes will become increasingly dominant because they are not limited by the same land constraints as HEFA SAF.

The reason investors engage is that cost and complexity are the real barriers to SAF. Our approach is a simplification of existing routes.

By avoiding intermediates such as carbon monoxide via RWGS or methanol, we can reduce capital intensity and improve hydrogen efficiency, which is where the cost reduction lies.

Technical breakthrough: single-reactor catalyst demonstration

Invezz: Your catalyst does the Fischer-Tropsch and upgrading steps in one reactor. Without giving away the secret sauce—what’s the one breakthrough in the last 18 months that suddenly made investors say “this is real”?

Andrew Symes: Demonstration. We have shown, through our OX1 plant and independent testing, that it is possible to produce jet-range hydrocarbons directly from waste carbon and hydrogen in a single step, without a separate RWGS or methanol stage.

Fuel testing partner Intertek confirmed our fuel sits within the jet fuel range and, after simple hydrotreatment, is comparable to FT-SPK specifications.

This de-risks both cost and complexity. Fewer steps means lower CAPEX, lower energy losses and a more provable pathway to scale.

We have already demonstrated this at our OX1 facility at Oxford Airport, which has been operating since 2024 and has produced samples of synthetic SAF blend components.

That plant provided the data needed to validate the chemistry and inform scale-up.

We are now building OX2, our second demonstration plant, which will operate at a larger scale and produce greater volumes of fuel for testing and certification, ahead of commercial scale plants.

Invezz: If Donald Trump wins again in 2028 and pulls the US out of global climate deals a second time, how damaging would that actually be to the global SAF market?

Andrew Symes: It would slow the US market, but it would not stop SAF globally. What we are already seeing is a divergence.

Europe and the UK have clear blending mandates and increasing revenue certainty; the Middle East and Asia are following suit. While the US outlook is more volatile.

Capital follows visibility. Inconsistent policy makes it harder to finance large infrastructure, but aviation decarbonisation will still move forward across global regions.

Long-term vision: path to lower-carbon flying

Invezz: Last one, big picture: by 2040, will flying commercially be carbon-neutral by default, or will it still be the “guilty pleasure” industry that everyone loves to hate?

Andrew Symes: People are going to keep flying, and demand is likely to grow. The question is whether we choose to build the fuel system that allows aviation to keep delivering its economic and social benefits with a much lower climate impact.

Because of its energy density, aviation will continue to rely on liquid hydrocarbons for decades.

That is why SAF matters. It is a drop-in route to reducing fuel emissions without asking airlines to redesign aircraft or airports.

In the UK, aviation emissions are already higher than those from the electricity supply sector. If we wait until 2035 or 2040 to scale solutions, it will be too late.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 11:57:45.745061

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor spoke with Farm Director KC Sheperd, highlighting the strong momentum for E15 (a 15% ethanol blend) and the industry’s focus on securing permanent regulatory fixes and expanding global markets.

E15 Growth and Legislative Push

The industry is seeing unprecedented momentum, making a push to update a 35-year-old regulation that currently limits year-round sales of the fuel:

National Reach: E15 is now legally able to be sold in all 50 states following recent legalization in California.

Retail Expansion: The number of retailers selling E15 has increased by almost 25% this year, the largest growth since 2018.

Legislative Priority: Securing a legislative fix to allow year-round E15 sales nationwide remains a top priority, with conversations ongoing on Capitol Hill and with the White House. This permanent fix would eliminate the current need for the EPA to issue emergency waivers each summer to allow E15 sales due to fuel volatility restrictions known as Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) limits.

Bipartisan Effort: The push has strong bipartisan support. For instance, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act has been introduced in Congress to permanently extend the RVP waiver to E15, eliminating seasonal restrictions.

Current Status: While a permanent fix remains the goal, recent legislative attempts, such as including the fix in a broader short-term funding bill, have faced opposition from some House Republicans concerned about the impact on the U.S. refining sector.

Economic and Agricultural Benefits

E15 is being positioned as a solution for both consumer costs and farm oversupply:

Consumer Savings: Higher blends of ethanol make fuel more affordable. Consumers typically save 10 to 30 cents per gallon with E15, with some reports showing savings as high as 80 cents to a dollar.

Corn Demand: If every vehicle drove on a 15% ethanol blend, it would utilize 2.5 billion bushels of U.S. corn every year, providing a vital market for corn producers who are seeing fantastic crops and need a home for their grain.

Political Focus: The two main drivers in Washington supporting the E15 fix are the need to address the state of the farm economy (providing markets, not handouts) and the national attention on consumer prices and the cost of fuel.

The company saw its operating income nearly double, climbing to $1.38 billion from $0.74 billion in the previous year. According to the company, the growth was primarily fueled by higher yields in U.S. domestic and international priority shipping, alongside increased domestic package volumes.

The bottom line also benefited from aggressive cost-saving measures through ongoing transformation initiatives and a reduction in business optimisation expenses.

“I am extremely proud of our team members worldwide for their commitment to make every FedEx experience outstanding this Peak season,” said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx President and CEO,

However, the quarter was not without its challenges. The gains were partially offset by the financial fallout from shifting global trade policies, rising wage rates, and increased variable incentive compensation. FedEx also navigated higher purchased transportation costs and the operational impact of grounding its MD-11 aircraft fleet.

The performance across business segments was mixed. The Federal Express division saw improved operating results, benefiting from the same yield and volume trends driving the consolidated growth. Conversely, the FedEx Freight segment experienced a decline in results.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawaii, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawaii, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific through its Pono Energy subsidiary, to study camelina as a multipurpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaii’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle-carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.

Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaii’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,” said Alanna James, the sustainability innovation director for Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. “Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net-zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaii’s energy independence.”

Ed Sniffen, the director of Hawaii’s state department of transportation, said, “We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawaii’s transportation needs. We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean-energy goals.”

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private-resource company, will launch Pono Energy Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks.

Its oilseeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens.

This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawaii by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawaii to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,” said Chris Bennett, the vice president of sustainable energy solutions for Pono Pacific Land Management LLC. “By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawaii’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture and a win for the environment—an example of how Hawaii can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.”

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaii’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy.

Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawaii’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state’s largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

Earlier this year, Par Pacific, the parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawaii Renewables and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Eneos, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly,” said Eric Wright, the president of Par Hawaii. “With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.”

James added, “We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year. This is an important milestone for our company and Hawaii, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported a slowdown in the growth of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, warning that policy frameworks need urgent correction ahead of upcoming e-SAF mandates.

According to IATA’s latest estimates, global SAF production is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025, doubling from 2024 levels. However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with output rising to only 2.4 million tonnes. SAF will account for just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, increasing marginally to 0.8 per cent in 2026. At current prices, the SAF premium is estimated to add USD 3.6 billion to industry fuel costs in 2025.

IATA said the 2025 forecast represents a downward revision due to limited policy support and high costs. In mandated markets, SAF prices can reach up to five times that of conventional jet fuel.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further. The decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

IATA highlighted that EU and UK mandates have increased costs without ensuring adequate supply. Airlines paid an estimated $2.9 billion premium for limited SAF volumes in 2025.

Looking ahead, IATA cautioned that without strong incentives, upcoming e-SAF mandates in the UK and EU could further raise costs and limit supply.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://static.businessworld.in/Copy of Copy of Slider for website Final.ai - 2025-12-19T164812.029_20251219164836_ogImage_49.png,N,,2025-12-19 08:58:18.594778

The airline, which was founded in Macon, Georgia, is having one of its most progressive 12 months to date, making considerable progress on its fuel efficiency targets, forming new partnerships to develop aircraft prototypes and reducing the use of unsustainable materials.

The Atlanta-based carrier also surpasses its near-term fuel savings objective, delivering in excess of 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in the first quarter alone. This achievement results in savings of more than US$125 million and advances its net zero ambitions.

Manufacturing partnerships and aircraft design

In March, Delta announced a partnership with aerospace startup JetZero to support the development of its blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft. This futuristic plane design is anticipated to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than the average aircraft currently in service.

Delta is lending its operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to help bring the BWB aircraft closer to commercial viability.

Later in September, Delta partners with Maeve Aerospace to expedite the development of hybrid electric aircraft for regional flights.

Fuel efficiency through innovative engineering

Elsewhere, Delta strengthens its collaboration with Airbus, testing a flying technique called fello'fly, which is inspired by migrating geese.

This method involves a pair of aircraft flying together, where one creates an uplift that can improve the fuel efficiency of the other. According to Airbus, this practice could reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights.

Delta also adds MicroTau, an Australian aerospace technology company, to its Sustainable Skies Lab. MicroTau creates an external cladding for planes that mimics shark skin, which the startup claims reduces drag and saves fuel.

The technology can be applied to an aircraft's fuselage, wings and tail and may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Delta is on track to increase its usage of SAF by 50% compared to the previous year. In 2025, the carrier collaborates with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland on a project that sees the first commercial-scale delivery of SAF to an airport, Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80%.

One of Delta’s primary goals for the year is to procure more than 35 sustainable aircraft. On average, these new planes are over 25% more fuel-efficient per seat mile than the aircraft Delta has retired since 2019.

In 2024, emissions from UK flights grew faster than the number of flights.","As we explained in our previous article in September 2025, the CAA is responsible for implementing the UK’s environmental reporting obligations, which it does through publishing the Aviation Environmental Review (the “AER”). In our previous article, we provided an overview of the CAA’s new approach towards the AER; now, just a few months later, we have the first example of how the CAA has put this approach into practice with the publication of its latest AER using data from up until 2024.

Read on below for our brief overview of CAP 3198 and what it can tell us about the state of UK aviation.

What is the aim of environmental reporting, and how does the AER help achieve it?

As a carbon-intensive industry, aviation plays a crucial role in the UK’s efforts to meet its international environmental commitments. As we recognised in September, the AER provides an important tool for monitoring the industry’s performance with regard to the UK’s environmental objectives and for providing industry stakeholders with usable and detailed data.

What was the direction of travel in 2024?

CAP 3198 confirms that 2019 was the peak year for UK aviation in terms of flight numbers and CO2 emissions. The AER therefore uses 2019 aviation data as its benchmark for measuring performance. CAP 3198 also makes it clear that, if Net Zero is to be achieved by 2050, the baseline levels from 2019 cannot be exceeded.

In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution and air quality, road transport remains the largest contributor in the UK; for instance, 97% of greenhouse gas emissions are generated by road transport. Domestic civil aviation is, comparatively, a much smaller contributor at only 1%. However, emissions and pollution from road transport have fallen significantly overall. For example, from 2005 to 2023, emissions from passenger cars reduced by 23% despite the number of miles travelled increasing. A similar trend has been observed in the rail sector.

This is not the case for aviation. In 2024, emissions from UK flights grew faster than the number of flights. Accordingly, aviation is on track to become one of the highest-emitting sectors in the UK as other modes of transport decarbonise more quickly.

What about sustainable fuel?

Despite being one of the key areas identified in CAP 3153 for future reporting, the report does not include data on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This is unsurprising given the historic nature of the data considered and accounting for the fact that the UK’s SAF Mandate has only recently come into force (see our overview of the SAF Mandate regime here). We can expect that it will take some time for the impact of SAF to filter through, and that the next edition of the AER will include more data on this point.

What does it mean for airlines?

The report uses a combination of pre-existing data sources and newly developed databases to analyse the emissions of aircraft departing the UK. The new database has greater accuracy by using the time spent actually in the air by each aircraft, rather than estimates, to measure emissions.

This allows the AER to provide more granular detail on aviation’s environmental impact. This includes greater transparency as to the relative environmental impacts of domestic and short-haul flights on the one hand, and medium-to-long-haul flights on the other. For example, the report confirms that while ultra-short and short-haul flights of under 1,500km account for 63% of all flights in the UK, they only account for 17% of total emissions. By contrast, long-haul flights are responsible for generating 63% of all emissions but represent the smallest proportion of flights in the UK (11%) overall.

It is possible that greater awareness in this area may lead to shifts in passenger behaviour and increased pressure for investment in more sustainable aircraft types and SAF. However, it is also possible that the increased transparency provided by the AER will provide new opportunities for airlines to strategically differentiate themselves in the market by improving resource efficiency and demonstrating leadership in sustainability.

What does it mean for airports?

The report includes detailed findings on air quality (broken down into NOx, SO2, PM2.5 and NMVOCS) and noise pollution around airports, which are individually named.

The results of this analysis come as no surprise. They indicate that flights from the busiest 10 airports across the UK generate more than 95% of all emissions, with Heathrow alone generating more emissions than the other top 10 airports combined.

There is positive news, however: while air traffic has not quite regained 2019 levels (94%), the level of noise pollution has actually fallen at a faster rate, leaving fewer people exposed to daytime aviation noise in 2024. Additionally, the level of SO2 emissions recorded across UK airports in 2023 was 67% lower than in 2019.

That notwithstanding, the air quality data reported in the AER suggests that other sectors are decarbonising more quickly than aviation. This may lead to increased scrutiny for the sector.

The CAA is required to publish an AER at least every three years. We can therefore expect the next edition to be published by no later than December 2028.

It will be interesting to see what story the next installment of data analysis tells us about the progress made by the industry following developments including the UK SAF Mandate, the increasing adoption of more fuel-efficient aircraft and the ongoing airspace modernisation programme. It will also be interesting to monitor whether the AER framework will account for other decarbonisation improvements across the sector, including the impact of the CAA's ongoing Hydrogen Challenge. This aims to increase sustainability by preparing UK aviation for the adoption of hydrogen as a zero-carbon fuel, both for use by new aircraft types (primarily on domestic regional routes) and within airport infrastructure.

Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Swiss cleantech company Synhelion have signed a long-term offtake agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). From 2027, SWISS will purchase at least 200 tons of solar jet fuel from Synhelion annually, pioneering the use of this innovative fuel in civil aviation. The agreement marks an important milestone on the road to more sustainable aviation.

SWISS is the first airline to sign a binding five-year SAF offtake agreement with Synhelion. This marks a pioneering step toward defossilizing aviation. From 2027, Synhelion will produce renewable synthetic crude oil, known as “syncrude”, at its first commercial plant. The syncrude will be processed in an existing refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

A strong signal for sustainable aviation

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

With this offtake agreement, SWISS is actively supporting the scaling of Synhelion’s technology for the production of renewable synthetic fuels as a customer, investor, and strategic partner. This long-term planning certainty enables targeted expansion of production capacity and helps reduce costs over time.

Pioneering partnership

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Expanding the partnership with Kuehne+Nagel

Part of the renewable jet fuel produced by Synhelion will be resold by SWISS to the logistics service provider Kuehne+Nagel. The company will use the sustainable fuel for air freight transportation with Swiss WorldCargo, offering its customers a tangible solution to reduce their carbon footprint in global logistics.

First delivery already completed

In July 2025, SWISS became the first airline in the world to use solar fuel from Synhelion in regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered its first barrel of syncrude from its DAWN plant to a refinery in northern Germany, where the syncrude was processed into certified jet fuel (Jet-A-1) and subsequently fed into the fuel supply system via Hamburg Airport.

“And this is SAF,” Haas says, holding up another sealed bottle filled with crystal-clear liquid.
“It’s jet fuel – though most people wouldn’t guess it, since it looks just like water.
And a key part of his job is to accelerate SAF adoption at Cathay Pacific.
SAF attributes are the environmental benefits that result from a specified amount of SAF used to replace conventional jet fuel.","“Do you know what this is, or what this might be – the dirty-looking one?” asks Oliver Haas, the head of sustainability – commercial and innovation at Cathay Pacific, holding up a laboratory bottle filled with dark, murky liquid. The bottle contains used cooking oil, Haas explains, which is one of the raw materials most widely used for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“And this is SAF,” Haas says, holding up another sealed bottle filled with crystal-clear liquid. “It’s jet fuel – though most people wouldn’t guess it, since it looks just like water. But it’s incredibly refined and packed with high-performance chemistry.”

“The magic of SAF is that basically you can turn this into this,” Haas says, holding the two bottles side by side. “You can turn a waste product into jet-grade fuel.”

Having been obsessed – in his words – with aircraft since he was five years old, Haas now sits in an office filled with models of them. And a key part of his job is to accelerate SAF adoption at Cathay Pacific.

In addition to used cooking oil, raw materials used to produce SAF include municipal waste, agricultural residue and even carbon dioxide. The chemical properties of SAF are almost identical to those of conventional jet fuel, and both types can be safely combined for use in aircraft.

“The benefit of SAF is that it is a so-called ‘drop-in fuel’,” Haas says. “Today, it has to be blended by up to 50 per cent with jet fuel, and there are various tests happening in the industry to allow 100 per cent of it to be used. But fundamentally, it can be dropped into an existing aircraft.”

While there are other options for powering an aircraft in a more sustainable way, including hydrogen and electricity, “the big challenge in aviation is that it is very difficult to find alternatives that can compete with jet fuel,” Haas says.

While small electric aircraft are under development, Haas points out they are more suited for regional, short-haul routes in markets such as Europe, the United States and Australia. And though hydrogen can fuel larger aircraft, the challenge lies in producing it cleanly and at a scale that makes it viable.

According to technical analysis conducted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency, SAF has the greatest potential to reduce carbon emissions produced by air travel.

Haas cites a typical flight from Sydney to Hong Kong as an example: “That is a nine-hour flight, which Cathay Pacific currently flies with aircraft that carry more than 300 passengers. There simply aren’t many options to move that many people over that distance in that time, other than by using liquid fuels.”

While SAF is, for now, the most viable option for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions while maintaining current numbers of flights, it also comes with significant challenges, such as high production costs. And SAF supply is still limited – in 2024, it made up just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade body with 350 member airlines. At these levels, costs will remain high at all points of the SAF supply chain.

Cathay Pacific has launched a new platform that allows passengers to estimate the carbon emissions generated by their flights and make a voluntary contribution to buy SAF attributes. SAF attributes are the environmental benefits that result from a specified amount of SAF used to replace conventional jet fuel.

Each contribution made is used to purchase SAF that is in addition to the airline’s mandated requirement of the percentage of SAF to be mixed into conventional jet fuel. Some countries and trading blocs have now mandated a minimum usage requirement for SAF. The United Kingdom, for instance, has set a SAF usage target of 10 per cent by 2030, while the European Union has set a minimum mandate of 2 per cent this year, to be increased to 70 per cent by 2050.

Eligible members of the Cathay membership programme can earn one Asia Mile for every HK$1 contribution they make to the SAF programme – a special rate offered to passengers to encourage them to take meaningful action and contribute to scaling up the use of SAF.

However, the use of SAF continues to remain a mystery to many people. Haas explains that unlike an electric car, which feels different in the way it sounds, drives and accelerates, SAF is effectively invisible to passengers.

“Even if I put SAF in the aircraft you are sitting in, you don’t have an emotional relationship with that. You can’t touch it. You can’t smell it. You can’t feel it. The whole point of SAF is that it is made to be as close to an equivalent of conventional jet fuel as possible,” he says.

With this in mind, Haas and his team are working on ways to make SAF more relatable to passengers, with most ideas still in their early stages.

No airline can do this alone, and Cathay Pacific’s approach to scaling SAF also includes the Corporate SAF Programme, established in 2022 for its corporate customers. It allows them to purchase SAF attributes with the airline and supports companies in reducing indirect emissions from business trips, while helping the airline to scale SAF usage.

Recently, the airline also announced its participation – as a founding investor – in a new fund, alongside several Oneworld alliance members and Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), an investment firm founded by Bill Gates that funds climate technology. The Oneworld BEV Fund will address difficulties around the production and cost of SAF, and invest in new technology to that end. Cathay Pacific also announced a joint investment agreement with Airbus, valued at HK$545 million (US$70 million), to drive the development of SAF production globally.

And at its home base, Cathay Pacific has co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition, working with partners to support policy and infrastructure development that will facilitate the use of SAF at Hong Kong International Airport.

However, it is the need to increase general awareness of SAF that Haas says keeps him awake at night and gets him up in the morning.

“Aviation connects people, culture and ideas, and I want to see more of that happen,” he says. “And as individual fliers, we carry a responsibility when we fly. The future of aviation is about continuing to make global travel possible, not just for ourselves, but for others and other generations too.”

The agreement, witnessed by the minister of petroleum and mineral resources, marks a structural shift in how Egypt’s energy and petrochemical sectors approach climate goals, industrial value creation, and export-oriented growth.

Unlike pilot programs or memoranda of understanding, this deal authorizes actual production, signaling that SAF is moving from concept to infrastructure in Egypt.

Why sustainable aviation fuel matters now

Aviation accounts for a growing share of global emissions, and airlines face mounting pressure from regulators, investors, and customers to cut carbon intensity. SAF has emerged as the most viable near-term solution, as it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without requiring new aircraft or airport infrastructure.

For Egypt, SAF is strategically attractive for three reasons:

Immediate emissions impact without disrupting aviation operations

Alignment with international climate and aviation standards, particularly in Europe

Creation of a high-value green fuel export, not just domestic substitution

By entering SAF production early, Egypt positions itself within a global supply chain that is still capacity-constrained but rapidly expanding.

What the Alexandria project will deliver

The SAF facility will be built in Alexandria and designed to convert used cooking oil into aviation-grade fuel. This choice of feedstock is economically and environmentally significant.

Key project characteristics include:

Annual production capacity: up to 120,000 tons

Feedstock: waste oils, primarily used cooking oil

Estimated emissions reduction: around 400,000 tons of CO₂ per year

From an industrial standpoint, the project does more than produce cleaner fuel—it upgrades waste into a premium energy product, reinforcing circular-economy principles while reducing reliance on virgin fossil inputs.

Technology as the critical enabler

At the heart of the project is advanced hydrotreating technology capable of converting waste oils into fuel that meets international aviation specifications. Conversion rates of up to 80 percent significantly improve project economics, making SAF more competitive against conventional jet fuel.

This matters because SAF’s biggest challenge globally is cost. Higher conversion efficiency directly reduces unit costs and strengthens the business case for scaling production.

By adopting proven global technology platforms rather than experimental solutions, Egypt reduces execution risk and accelerates time to market.

Economic returns beyond emissions reduction

While climate benefits are central, the SAF project has broader economic implications:

1. Value-added manufacturing

Instead of exporting raw hydrocarbons or low-margin products, Egypt is moving into advanced fuel processing with higher margins and technical complexity.

2. Export potential

European airlines and airports are under regulatory pressure to increase SAF usage. Egypt’s geographic proximity gives it a logistics advantage in serving Mediterranean and European markets.

3. Job creation and skills transfer

SAF production requires specialized chemical, engineering, and operational expertise, strengthening Egypt’s industrial skill base.

4. Waste management benefits

Scaling used cooking oil collection formalizes waste streams that are often informal or underutilized, creating new micro-economies around collection and logistics.

A signal to investors and global partners

Beyond the plant itself, the agreement sends a broader message: Egypt is open to commercial-scale green energy investments, not just renewables like solar and wind, but also low-carbon fuels that serve global industries.

This diversification matters. As countries compete for climate-aligned capital, projects that combine technology, exports, and measurable emissions reduction are increasingly favored by international investors and development institutions.

SAF as part of Egypt’s energy transition strategy

The petroleum sector’s involvement is particularly notable. Rather than viewing decarbonization as a threat, Egypt’s energy authorities are positioning traditional institutions as drivers of the transition, using existing infrastructure, expertise, and partnerships to enter new markets.

SAF fits neatly into this approach:

It leverages petrochemical know-how

It supports national climate commitments

It preserves Egypt’s relevance in a lower-carbon global energy system

A first step with long-term implications

While one plant will not transform aviation overnight, this agreement establishes a blueprint. If successful, it can be replicated, expanded, and integrated into a broader ecosystem of green fuels, including marine fuels and synthetic alternatives.",https://egbc-images.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content/w620/438450.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 05:56:53.670326

So we already have a mix of federal and state incentives.” The net effect for private jet operators, both commercial and private, is that compliance has become more intensive.
Those studies will first be proven out using private aviation, he says.
Think of those winglets – they were born in private aviation.
According to recent research among Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers, 42.3% of respondents who are not flying privately yet but are considering it say sustainability programs will be important in choosing a flight provider.","The change in the U.S. political climate is not sidetracking private jet sustainability initiatives or affecting the need for high-profile private jet users to stay focused on the issue.

In a wide-ranging interview, 4Air founder and CEO Kennedy Ricci discussed why the changing winds in Washington, D.C., are not affecting the business aviation segment’s leadership in reducing emissions.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced rollbacks for auto fuel emissions standards.

President Donald J. Trump said at the time, “We’re officially terminating Joe Biden’s ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions.”

Global Industry

However, the global nature of private jet activity means private aviation suppliers from OEMs to MROs and end users are still highly focused on sustainability, Ricci tells Private Jet Card Comparisons.

Ricci notes, “A lot of our industry is international.”

He continues, “Even if you’re based in the U.S. and, if you’re flying overseas, Europe’s obviously a big destination point, (sustainability regulations) matters to you as a U.S. operator.”

Ricci notes, “We’ve seen the rest of the world continue to march ahead.”

Beyond Europe, there are more than a dozen mandates for sustainable aviation fuel.

The United Arab Emirates is the most recent country to introduce a SAF mandate.

Other mandates come from China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Australia, Brazil, “pretty broadly across the world.”

Even in the U.S., Ricci says, despite the rhetoric in Washington D.C., “what we’ve really seen is things went back to the state level. So we already have a mix of federal and state incentives.”

The net effect for private jet operators, both commercial and private, is that compliance has become more intensive.

“It’s kind of increased the complexity of what you have to look at,” he says.

For example, California’s latest disclosure requirements apply to companies with over $500 million in revenue that do business in the state.

While 4Air launched in 2020, focused on helping source carbon credits, the web of regulations and incentives means “how do we support (customers)…knowing the requirements (and complying).”

Ricci says that failing to take the measures seriously, comply, and report can be costly.

“If you don’t, you get an angry letter at the end of the year that says, ‘Hey, you didn’t comply, and here’s what you owe, plus 100% penalty.'”

4Air also helps identify and obtain incentives to use SAF and reward decarbonization efforts.

Increasing Disclosures

Over the past five years, Ricci says the percentage of large companies disclosing their emissions has increased.

The 2025 State of Corporate Sustainability Disclosure Report, published by the UCLA Anderson Center for Impact, reports a “notable uptick” in emissions and climate risk reporting.

The UCLA Report adds:

‘Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG-emission-disclosure rates remain high at over 88% for S&P 500 companies, while Scope 3 disclosures have improved to 69.5%. Net-zero and carbon-neutrality commitments are becoming increasingly common, with almost 57% of S&P 500 companies having announced such goals. Companies are also beginning to lay important groundwork for climate transition planning: 24.4% of firms have publicly disclosed a transition plan outlining their intended pathways toward decarbonization.’

Ricci says, “A lot of our work of 4Air has actually been building reports for our customers’ customers of what their emissions were? How much did they fly? How much fuel did they consume? What was their carbon impact?”

While 4Air does work directly with UHNWs in some cases, it primarily serves end users through their aircraft management companies, corporate flight departments, and charter and fractional operators.

Private Aviation Sustainability

While anti-private jet groups have called into question the industry’s sustainability initiatives from SAF to carbon credits and eVTOLs as being a mix of greenwashing and pie in the sky, Ricci takes a more measured view.

He points to 4Air’s work identifying and reducing non-carbon emissions, which can have twice the warming effect as carbon emissions.

4Air has been leading several studies about how future flight planning can reduce those contrails.

Those studies will first be proven out using private aviation, he says.

In fact, Ricci notes that business aviation is the incubator for fuel-saving and emissions-reducing technology that is later applied to wider air travel.

Think of those winglets – they were born in private aviation.

Ricci says it will be the same story with both SAF and eVTOLs.

While acknowledging questions about the validity of some carbon offset programs, he sees the criticism as an opportunity to put projects under a microscope and better communicate how and over what period they deliver the desired impact.

Ricci says, “We are taking those higher integrity kind of diligence processes into mind.

We’re very thoughtful about the project types that we’re working with.”

He adds that in the area of future fuel, the industry is investing in everything from new SAF sources to alternatives such as hydrogen.

Ban Private Jets

While aviation, private aviation, and even the broader travel industry are often the target of climate campaigners, Ricci says, “The atmosphere doesn’t care that it came from aviation or that it came from shipping or that it came from forestry. We need to identify reductions and align the types of incentives and willingness to pay with the actual solutions.”

Studies show aviation accounts for about 2% of all global carbon emissions.

Private jets are just 2% of that 2%.

Thinking about groups that are focused on banning private jets, Ricci says, “I’d want to communicate that our desire to decarbonize is genuine.”

Ricci adds, “We want to find good solutions that are meaningful and impactful. We want to make sure we’re thoughtful about the types of programs we’re working on. We want truly sustainable innovations. So the interest we have is genuine.”

To those groups, he says, “If there are ways that you can help us make sure that what we’re doing is actually driving impact, then we’re all for that.”

Next Generation Flyers

What’s more, private jet flight providers will also have to consider the next wave of new customers.

According to recent research among Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers, 42.3% of respondents who are not flying privately yet but are considering it say sustainability programs will be important in choosing a flight provider.

That compares to 28.4% of all respondents.",https://cdn.privatejetcardcomparisons.com/uploads/Flexjet-Sustainability-Program-1-e1621219957967.jpeg?w=1200&h=628&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-18 21:56:58.230566

Partnership advances book and claim models to scale sustainable aviation fuel use beyond physical trade lane constraints

Agreement supports DHL Group’s target to reach 30 percent sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030

DHL Global Forwarding and Air France KLM Martinair Cargo have expanded their partnership with a new framework agreement aimed at accelerating decarbonization across the air freight sector, shifting the focus from transactional fuel purchases to structured, verifiable emission reduction rights.

The agreement builds on a collaboration launched in 2022 and introduces a clearer commercial and governance framework for emission reduction claims. Central to the deal is the development of market ready book and claim models designed to scale sustainable aviation fuel adoption while providing transparency and credibility for corporate climate reporting.

Moving Beyond Transactional SAF Procurement

Under the new framework, DHL Global Forwarding has signed a work order covering 35,000 metric tons of well to wheel CO2e emission reduction rights. The approach reflects a broader shift in how large logistics players are addressing aviation emissions, particularly in a market where physical access to sustainable aviation fuels remains uneven across routes and regions.

Rather than tying emission reductions solely to where fuel is physically uplifted, book and claim mechanisms allow environmental benefits to be allocated independently of specific flights. This structure is increasingly viewed as essential for scaling SAF in the near term, especially for multinational shippers with complex global networks.

“This framework agreement shows what collaborative decarbonization in air freight can look like,” said Henk Venema, Executive Vice President of Global Air Freight at DHL Global Forwarding. “Emission Reduction Rights provide predictability, scalability, and transparency, three critical factors for sustainable aviation fuels to make a real impact within the market. Together with AFKLMP, we are establishing a foundation that can serve as a model for the entire industry.”

A Strategic Carrier Relationship

Air France KLM Martinair Cargo has been one of DHL Global Forwarding’s leading carriers for the past five years and a top performer in DHL’s GoGreen Carrier Evaluation Program. The airline group has also been an active participant in industry initiatives, conferences, and working groups focused on transparency, standard setting, and practical pathways for reducing air freight emissions.

The renewed agreement formalizes a long term collaboration that extends beyond fuel sourcing to include digital verification processes and standardized emissions accounting. For DHL, this strengthens its position as a provider of emission reduced air freight products for customers facing rising regulatory and investor scrutiny of Scope 3 emissions.

“We are proud to renew this partnership with DHL Global Forwarding, a clear sign of leadership,” said GertJan Roelands, SVP Commercial at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo. “Our shared ambition and continued collaboration on SAF are fundamental to scaling the solutions needed to reduce the carbon footprint of the air freight industry. This new agreement reflects mutual trust, operational commitment, and a firm belief that only through close cooperation can we drive meaningful change across the air freight value chain.”

Governance, Reporting, And Scope 3 Pressures

The agreement comes as companies face growing pressure to demonstrate credible progress on indirect emissions, particularly from transportation and logistics. Book and claim systems are gaining attention from regulators, standards bodies, and corporate buyers as a pragmatic interim solution while global SAF supply ramps up.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus products sit at the center of this strategy. The offering enables true value chain decarbonization by replacing fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within DHL’s network and allocating the resulting environmental benefits to customers, even when shipments are not physically moved on low carbon assets.

This allows DHL customers to reduce reported Scope 3 emissions from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, while supporting voluntary greenhouse gas reporting and progress tracking against decarbonization targets.

Implications For The Global Air Freight Market

The DHL AFKLMP framework agreement aligns with DHL Group’s broader goal to raise sustainable aviation fuel use to 30 percent by 2030. By anchoring SAF deployment in long term contracts and standardized emission reduction rights, the partnership aims to provide the scale and predictability needed to attract further investment into low carbon aviation fuels.

The agreement was formally marked at a ceremony in Amsterdam attended by senior executives from both companies, including Venema and Patrick Bongers, Head of AFR Growth at DHL Global Forwarding.

For the wider air freight industry, the deal reflects a shift toward collaborative, system level solutions that address both physical fuel constraints and the governance challenges of emissions accounting. As regulators and customers demand clearer evidence of climate impact, frameworks that combine operational commitment with credible verification are likely to play a growing role in how aviation decarbonization is financed and delivered globally.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DHL-Air-France-KLM-Cargo-Expand-Emissions-Reduction-Framework-For-Air-Freight.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 02:58:07.203735

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025.
Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance.
Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit.","The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec. 17 delivered a proposed rule to set 45Z clean fuel production credit guidance to the White House Office of Management and Budget. OMB review marks a final stage before a proposed rule is released for public comment.

According to information released by the OMB, the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) includes guidance regarding 45Z implementation, including the calculation of emissions factors for transportation fuel, the determination of clean fuel production credits, and producer registration.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly when compared to last year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.

Also in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is designed specifically to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions to meet the requirements of section 45Z.

The DOE in July 2025 issued a notice soliciting public comments on a preliminary plan for determining provisional emissions rates (PER) for the purposes of the 45Z clean fuel production credit. A PER must be determined for any fuel not addressed in the emissions rate tables.

According to information published by the OMB, the upcoming NPRM is expected to address public comments gathered by Treasury and the IRS in response to the January 2025 notices. “These notices were published in early 2025 to meet the statutory deadline of January 1, 2025, however the rules need to be further formalized in an NPRM and then finalized,” according to the OMB’s summary of the NPRM.

One of the things that I think I love the most about Formula One is the sheer amount of innovation and research and development that comes from this space, then find themselves applied in other industries. When we got to our carbon footprint, we realised about 1/3 of it comes from the fact that we are a global business. We fly around the world both things cars, garage equipment and people. Kernels are committed to major investments in sustainable aviation fuel funding 1,000,000 US gallons of sustainable aviation fuel certificates to cover all of its business flight travel. This helped them achieve. The 23% reduction in emissions per race back in 2024 versus 2023. In the US, 12% of transportation emissions is from aviation. And so this gives us a chance to really make an impact in an area that enables us to reach our net zero goal as a world, but also through the work that we're doing together in our respective industries. And on top of that, cutting Rd. freight emissions by 48%. So large scale demands from companies like McLaren absolutely help scale. These markets like the sustainable aviation fuel market, absolutely it's about creating demand signals to create an early market. We need to have partnerships like this that can drive the volume we need to see to really make this really a business valuable endeavor.

The European-backed project is expected to cost between $4B and $6B

A proposal for an industrial plant on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore that would produce a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel has passed its first regulatory hurdle, acquiring environmental approval from the province.

In a news release, Nova Sustainable Fuels – a company backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy Generation – called it “one of Eastern Canada’s most ambitious energy projects,” and said the approval is an important step forward.

The plan is to use solar and wind farms as well as biomass to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable methanol. The company describes the products as “two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

Nova Scotia Environment Minister Tim Halman signed off on the project Thursday, with some conditions.

Halman’s conditions include that the project has to get underway within two years (although it can apply for extensions), the company has to submit additional information to support conservation and it has to develop a plan for engaging with the Mi’kmaq.

The approval deals with the first phase of Nova Sustainable Fuels’ plans: a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, N.S.

The second phase of Nova Sustainable Fuels’ plan is to build wind and solar farms that would connect to the plant. That will require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The facility would require 60 truckloads of biomass – that is, woody byproducts from the forestry industry – per day and 586 cubic metres of fresh water per hour. The plan is to pull the water from two nearby lakes, Meadow Lake and Ocean Lake, through pipelines.

The project will require industrial approval and water withdrawal approval before it can proceed.

The company has estimated the project will cost between $4 billion to $6 billion to launch. It’s expected to take about three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 16:57:34.037726

“Projects like this are crucial to helping to reduce global carbon emissions, while creating jobs and growing our economy,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “And when we welcome projects like this, it continues to position Nova Scotia as a leader in climate change action, innovation and the global clean energy transformation.”

The company will need a second environmental assessment approval for its second phase – a proposed wind energy and solar farm and a transmission line to supply renewable energy for fuel production.

The company expects the project will create about 1,000 jobs during the construction phase, up to 80 jobs during its operation (expected to end in 2081) and direct and indirect economic benefits for local businesses, communities and residents.

The project must comply with 34 stringent terms and conditions in its environmental assessment approval that are designed to protect the environment and human health. The project will also require an industrial approval and a water withdrawal approval.

Quick Facts:

the company would create a new market for Nova Scotia’s oversupply of biomass from forestry activity, including wood chips and bark that are the byproduct of silviculture, harvesting and sawmilling

the Minister of Environment and Climate Change – the province's environmental regulator – uses the Environment Act and is guided by science and evidence when reviewing environmental assessment requests

if a project is approved, the regulator typically includes terms and conditions which are designed to ensure the environment and people remain protected throughout the life of the project, while also allowing viable, safe and responsible development to take place

the Department's inspection, compliance and enforcement staff ensure companies comply with the terms and conditions of their various approvals; in 2024, they conducted about 6,400 inspections to ensure companies were complying with Nova Scotia’s environmental rules and laws

In China, the price of waste cooking oil, often called “gutter oil”, has risen around fourfold in two years, said Feng Yu, president of aerospace conglomerate Honeywell China.
China’s gutter oil problem first came to prominence in 1998, when Southern Metropolis Daily published a series of reports on the illegal processing of waste grease from sewers and restaurant drains back into cooking oil.
In 2010, reportedly in response to media investigations, regulators issued an emergency notice to block gutter oil from entering the catering sector, noted China News.

In China, the price of waste cooking oil, often called “gutter oil”, has risen around fourfold in two years, said Feng Yu, president of aerospace conglomerate Honeywell China.

Speaking at a roundtable in Beijing, Feng pointed to the “severe shortage” for this resource worldwide, reported Caixin. Waste oil is a key feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), a hydrogenation and refining process that is currently the most commercially mature method of producing SAF.

China’s gutter oil problem first came to prominence in 1998, when Southern Metropolis Daily published a series of reports on the illegal processing of waste grease from sewers and restaurant drains back into cooking oil. In 2010, reportedly in response to media investigations, regulators issued an emergency notice to block gutter oil from entering the catering sector, noted China News. After tighter enforcement, waste cooking oil has increasingly been instead redirected into regulated industrial uses such as biodiesel and, more recently, SAF.

In recent years, SAF has gained strong momentum as a near-term option to reduce aviation emissions, being able to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Cost, however, is a problem. SAF trades at two to five times the price of fossil jet fuel in several markets, and according to the International Air Transport Association’s estimates, this price gap could add USD 3.6 billion to airline cost burdens in 2025, noted S&P Global.

Even so, production capacity is growing. Chinese companies that have or are in the process of obtaining airworthiness certification for their SAF have over one million tonnes of production capacity per year, Caixin reported. Additionally, a new facility was inaugurated earlier this month by Honeywell and Jia’ao Environmental Protection that uses proprietary technology to turn about 500,000 tonnes of waste oil into SAF daily, the outlet noted.

Global policies, such as that of the EU, have been a major driver of the SAF push. The bloc has set targets requiring 2% SAF use by 2025 and 70% by 2050. China has no mandatory blending rule, but plans to have consumed 50,000 tonnes of SAF between 2021 and 2025.

Critics remain unconvinced. The co-author of a 2024 report by the Washington-based Institute of Policy Studies called SAF a “huge greenwashing exercise” by the aviation industry, arguing it cannot scale fast enough to replace fossil jet fuel, noted The Guardian. Heavy reliance on bio-based feedstocks could also bring serious risks, including pressure on food supply, damage to natural carbon sinks, and higher pollution from land-use change, the outlet reported.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2024/04/China-news-digest_THUMBNAIL_Alamy_2EKJEG3.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:12.699245

This achievement represents the company’s full-scale entry into the rapidly growing global clean energy and SAF markets, reinforcing its strategic focus on energy transition technologies.
The value of the FEED contract is approximately KRW 23 billion (around USD 15.7 million), and the engineering phase is expected to take roughly 10 months to complete.
Securing the FEED contract positions SAMSUNG E&A favorably to participate in subsequent engineering, procurement, and construction stages.
This latest contract follows SAMSUNG E&A’s successful acquisition of a KRW 1.4 trillion SAF project in Malaysia late last year, confirming its formal entry into the global SAF market.","SAMSUNG E&A, a comprehensive solutions provider serving the global energy sector, has taken a significant step forward in its clean energy expansion by securing a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) contract for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in the United States. This achievement represents the company’s full-scale entry into the rapidly growing global clean energy and SAF markets, reinforcing its strategic focus on energy transition technologies.

The company announced on the 15th that it formally signed an agreement on the 12th with DG Fuels, a U.S.-based developer specializing in sustainable aviation fuel projects. Under this agreement, SAMSUNG E&A will carry out the FEED scope for the Louisiana SAF Production Project, a major clean energy initiative planned for the southern United States. The contract covers one of two primary design packages, with SAMSUNG E&A responsible for the clean hydrogen production package. The value of the FEED contract is approximately KRW 23 billion (around USD 15.7 million), and the engineering phase is expected to take roughly 10 months to complete.

Upon successful delivery of the basic engineering work, SAMSUNG E&A plans to pursue a follow-on contract for the project’s main execution phase. The total investment size of the overall project is estimated at nearly USD 3 billion (approximately KRW 4.5 trillion), underscoring the scale and strategic importance of the development. Securing the FEED contract positions SAMSUNG E&A favorably to participate in subsequent engineering, procurement, and construction stages.

The SAF facility will be constructed in St. James Parish, Louisiana, and is designed to produce approximately 600,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel per year. The plant will utilize regionally abundant waste-based feedstocks, including agricultural residues and woody biomass, supporting both carbon reduction and local resource utilization. This approach aligns with global efforts to decarbonize the aviation sector by replacing conventional fossil-based jet fuel with bio-derived alternatives.

As part of its scope, SAMSUNG E&A will oversee advanced blue hydrogen infrastructure, including facilities such as Air Separation Units (ASU), Auto Thermal Reformers (ATR), and carbon dioxide capture systems. In addition, the company will deliver green hydrogen facilities based on water electrolysis technology, enabling the project to integrate both blue and green hydrogen pathways to support low-carbon fuel production.

This latest contract follows SAMSUNG E&A’s successful acquisition of a KRW 1.4 trillion SAF project in Malaysia late last year, confirming its formal entry into the global SAF market. Sustainable aviation fuel is increasingly viewed as a critical solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in air transport, and global mandates requiring SAF blending are expected to drive consistent market growth in the coming years.

SAMSUNG E&A’s progress is anchored in its future-oriented E&Able strategy, which focuses on securing and deploying key energy transition technologies such as SAF, carbon capture, hydrogen, ammonia, and LNG. Through targeted investments and strategic collaborations, the company has already delivered concrete results, including SAF facilities in Malaysia, a biodegradable plastics plant in the UAE, eco-friendly LNG projects in Indonesia and North America, and a low-carbon ammonia plant in the United States.

Commenting on the achievement, Hong Namkoong, President and CEO of SAMSUNG E&A, stated that the company will strive to secure additional orders by successfully completing the FEED phase. He emphasized that the project will strengthen SAMSUNG E&A’s foothold in North America while expanding its role in next-generation energy transition sectors such as SAF, hydrogen, and carbon capture.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:17.611397

The EU-backed research effort, coordinated by Austria’s Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), reportedly aims to develop a waste-free, climate-neutral biorefinery.

Called ToFuel, the four-year, innovative project aims to convert tomato processing residues into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while also producing valuable by-products such as fertilizer, animal feed, and nutritional oil.

“According to estimates, around three per cent of the sustainable aviation fuels required in Europe by 2030 could be covered from the amount of tomato pomace produced throughout the EU, i.e., the residues from tomato processing,” Marlene Kienberger, PhD, a professor at TU Graz and project manager, explained.

Powering jets with tomatoes

According to the research team, the approach could support Europe’s efforts to reduce aviation emissions while creating economic value from agricultural waste that is currently discarded or burned.

Meanwhile, tomatoes are the second-most-consumed vegetable in the world, after potatoes. The EU produces around 17 megatons annually, resulting in large volumes of residual biomass.

This includes materials like leaves, stems, peels, seeds, and unripe or spoiled fruit, most of which are considered low-value waste despite being rich in energy-dense compounds that can be converted into fuel.

To achieve this, the researchers are exploring two advanced processing routes. The first uses extrusion, in which the biomass is heated and pressurized before undergoing rapid decompression.

This breaks down plant cell structures and prepares the material for fermentation. Microorganisms then convert it into lipid-rich oils suitable for fuel production.

The second approach uses hydrothermal liquefaction to convert wet biomass into bio-oil and biochar under high temperatures and pressures. The resulting bio-oil is then purified to remove nitrogen-containing compounds that would otherwise interfere with fuel synthesis.

Decarbonizing air travel

The purification and fractionation steps are being developed jointly by scientists from TU Graz, the University of Zagreb in Croatia, and Portugal’s national energy laboratory (LNEG).

The lipids and bio-oil are then converted into a fuel that fulfils the international quality standards for sustainable aviation fuel using the HEFA (Hydrogenated Esters and Fatty Acids) process at the Technical University of Leoben in Austria.

HEFA is a well-established method for producing sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable, animal, or recycled fats and oils that meets international aviation fuel standards.

“Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price,” Kienberger stated in a statement. “Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuels simply have to be economically viable.

During the project, the two technologies will be scaled up toward pre-industrial demonstration as researchers evaluate their environmental, economic, and social impacts. The utilization of tomato residues also creates new sources of income for food processing companies.

Officially launching on January 1, 2026, the ToFuel project will bring together 11 partners from seven European countries. It will operate with a budget of USD 4.1 million (EUR 3.5 million).",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/A1_bf9fd9.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:28.030706

This year, we're counting them down from Dec. 18 to Dec. 31. On Jan. 1 and Jan. 2, we will look at some of the runners-up for this year. Today, we begin the countdown with No. 10: How biofuels court cases and government policies drove continued change in the market for biofuels.

**

LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- From a Supreme Court ruling in favor of biofuels groups, to a new Renewable Fuel Standard volumes proposal and more debate on small-refinery exemptions, biofuels news this year was highly consequential and starts our Top 10 Ag Stories of 2025 countdown.

As President Donald Trump took office for a second term, the year started with the U.S. Supreme Court hearing oral arguments from biofuels and petroleum industry groups on the proper court to hear court challenges to small-refinery exemptions to the RFS. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The Supreme Court ruled later in the year that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was indeed the proper venue. It was considered a win for biofuels because it is expected to bring consistency to future cases.

Unlike the first go-round with the Trump administration that saw the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant numerous SREs without considering how it affected the RFS, the second Trump administration decided to take a different approach.

The administration released proposed RFS volumes for 2026 and 2027 that gave a significant boost to renewable diesel volumes. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…) That proposal sparked a jump in the soybean futures price.

In August 2025, the Trump administration granted full exemptions on 63 small-refinery exemption petitions, partial exemptions for 77 and denied 28 others. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The following month, the EPA proposed several options to reallocate biofuels gallons lost through SREs to other obligated parties including petroleum companies, also announcing the RFS volumes proposal could be further delayed because of the SRE issue. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The first Trump administration took a lot of heat for granting more than 80 SREs without trying to reallocate biofuels gallons lost -- by some estimates at 4 billion gallons.

Also in September, the California Senate voted unanimously on a bill to sell E15 in the state for the first time. The legislation was later signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move opened a 600- to 800-million-gallon market for ethanol. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

E15 in California was welcomed news in a year that passed without federal lawmakers addressing national E15 legislatively.

Despite repeated calls from biofuels groups, the Trump administration did not provide additional tax guidance on the 45Z Clean Fuels Production tax credit as companies continued to wait for certainty on their investments in sustainable aviation fuel. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

Even with a lack of 45Z certainty, companies like Summit Carbon Solutions continued to move on to next steps in building a carbon pipeline to connect to nearly 50 ethanol plants across the Midwest.

Summit not only announced that it hired Joe Griffin as a new chief executive officer, but Griffin then launched a campaign to improve relationships with landowners along the future path of the pipeline. The pipeline is considered an important avenue to help ethanol companies lower their carbon footprint enough for ethanol to be considered a good feedstock for SAF production.

The Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) confirmed on Thursday that all facilities and industrial areas under its jurisdiction are state-owned. The $200m figure previously cited represents the project’s investment costs rather than a purchase price for the land, the authority said in a statement issued via the cabinet’s media centre.

The government said the project will generate both direct and indirect returns, including land usufruct fees, Sokhna port handling charges, and administrative fees. Indirect benefits include the procurement of local raw materials, the involvement of Egyptian construction firms, and the creation of thousands of direct jobs for Egyptian workers.

“The land for the Al Mana Holding project… is granted to the company under the usufruct system, as is customary with the authority’s other investment contracts, without ceding any part of it,” the SCZone stated.

The authority also clarified that tax and customs exemptions granted to the project are standard investment incentives provided under the SCZone law for special economic zones, rather than specific concessions for a single investor.

Regarding the project’s commercial viability, the statement noted that Al Mana had secured an agreement with Shell to supply its entire production output prior to signing the contract with the SCZone. This arrangement was based on extensive financial studies to ensure marketing and return on investment.

The SCZone highlighted that Sokhna was selected due to the integration between the industrial zone and the port—recently recognised by Guinness World Records as the world’s deepest man-made port basin. The location serves as a pivotal gateway to the Red Sea and Africa, reducing production and transport costs for target markets.
