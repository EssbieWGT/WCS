In a study recently published in Biomass and Bioenergy, the yeast Rhodotorula toruloides PYCC 5615 was found to be highly promising for the bioconversion of eucalyptus bark hydrolysate to intracellular lipids which were further thermochemically processed to intermediaries for SAF production. Yeast cultivation on medium formulated with hydrolysate and corn steep liquor maximised fatty acid content in the biomass and lipid productivity. Yeast biomass, whole or after lipid extraction (de-oiled biomass), was subsequently converted by hydrothermal liquefaction into bio-crudes. These and the extracted yeast lipids were further processed by hydrodeoxygenation into upgraded bio-crudes containing up to 40.7 % of C15-C17 hydrocarbons.

These results demonstrate the potential of an integrated process based on microbial oils from R. toruloides PYCC 5615 to produce SAF precursors from eucalyptus bark residues, contributing for sustainable jetfuel production.

This work was carried out by a team at the Bioenergy and Biorefineries Unit of LNEG, led by Teresa Lopes da Silva and Francisco Gírio and comprising the researchers Francisca Dutra, Susana Marques, Miguel Gomes, Paula Costa and Filipe Paradela. The yeast strain was selected at iBB-BSRG by Isabel Sá Correia and Paula Mugica and further contributions on yeast growth media design were given by iBB-2BRG members Nuno Faria, Frederico Ferreira and Helena Pinheiro.

His pioneering work has led to the development of seeding rate, tillage, and fertilizer recommendations that farmers in the Southeastern United States are now using to grow carinata successfully during the winter.
The significance of Dr. Iboyi’s research to farmers in the United States cannot be overstated, since farmers are generally known to explore ways to generate new revenue streams.
Dr. Iboyi is currently based in the United States.
He earned his Master’s in Agronomy from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, followed by a PhD in Agronomy from the University of Florida, United States.","Nigerian scientist and member of the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America, Dr. Joseph Iboyi, has identified the the need to utilise biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel to help achieve sustainable, carbon-neutral growth for the aviation sector.

In a statement he made available to PUNCH Online on Wednesday, Dr. Iboyi said the non-food biofuel crop called carinata, is one of the leading biomass feedstocks that can help reduce the carbon footprint of several countries’ aviation sectors, and was recently introduced to the Southeastern United States to assess its suitability for growing during the winter and incorporate it into existing rotations in the region.

He said biomass feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel is an area of active research globally, including the United States, pointing out that he has pioneered groundbreaking research focused on developing agronomic management practices to establish carinata into existing cropping systems in the Southeastern United States.

His pioneering work has led to the development of seeding rate, tillage, and fertilizer recommendations that farmers in the Southeastern United States are now using to grow carinata successfully during the winter.

Dr. Iboyi also conducted the first comprehensive research investigating the possibility of double-cropping carinata with summer-planted crops, including cotton, soybean, peanut, and sorghum, as part of diversified crop rotations in the Southeastern United States.

His findings revealed that carinata can successfully replace winter fallow, and can be double-cropped with summer-planted summer crops (typically cotton, peanut, soybean, and sorghum) with no adverse effect on yield.

The significance of Dr. Iboyi’s research to farmers in the United States cannot be overstated, since farmers are generally known to explore ways to generate new revenue streams. His research which focused on helping farmers achieve this goal, highlighted the opportunity for row crop growers in the Southeastern United States to increase profitability by double-cropping between summer crops instead of leaving winter fallow land vulnerable to weeds, nutrient leaching, and runoff.

According to him, double-cropping carinata between summer crops not only has the potential to generate extra offseason income for growers and downstream processors in the United States but may also contribute to increased land-use efficiency, annual net primary production, and soil carbon sequestration.

This research holds particular relevance in regions such as Africa, where resource constraints often limit farmers’ ability to optimize their agricultural inputs.

By developing tangible field-based agronomic and practical solutions to farmer problems, Dr. Iboyi’s work offers actionable insights for improving agronomic management practices, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Dr. Iboyi is currently based in the United States. He earned his Master’s in Agronomy from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, followed by a PhD in Agronomy from the University of Florida, United States. Currently engaged in agronomic research on carinata, corn, peanuts, soybeans, and cotton, Dr. Iboyi’s expertise has positioned him at the forefront of significant agricultural innovations.

His contributions are helping to address critical challenges in modern crop management. His achievements exemplify the potential of interdisciplinary thinking and global collaboration in addressing pressing agricultural challenges.

Erkki Liikanen, Chair of the IFRS Foundation Trustees, said:

“We are delighted to be formalising our partnership with TNFD to ensure that the ISSB gives due consideration to the work TNFD have put into creating recommendations for nature-related financial disclosures.”

The TNFD was launched in 2021, building on the success of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), to support organizations in reporting and acting on their nature-related risks. The organization published its final recommendations for nature-related risk management and disclosure in September 2023, centered around 14 recommended disclosures, aimed at helping inform better decision-making by companies and capital providers on nature and biodiversity-related risks, opportunities, dependencies and impacts. The organization recently reported that more than 1,700 organizations have joined as members of the TNFD Forum, its network of aligned institutions, and more than 520 companies and financial institutions have committed to begin nature-related corporate reporting, based on the TNFD recommendations.

The IFRS Foundation’s International Sustainability Standards Board was launched in November 2021, with the goal to develop IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards to provide investors with information about companies’ sustainability risks and opportunities. The IFRS released the inaugural general sustainability (IFRS S1) and climate (IFRS S2) reporting standards in June 2023.

As part of its 2024 – 2026 work plan following the release of its initial standards, the ISSB is researching risks and opportunities associated with sustainability topics beyond climate, including exploring information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities associated with biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services (BEES), and deciding whether to pursue standard-setting for disclosure requirements on these topics.

Under the new agreement, the organizations said that the ISSB and TNFD will share research, knowledge and technical expertise to inform the ISSB’s BEES initiative, as well as the nature-related aspects of its industry-focused SASB standards enhancement work. The ISSB and TNFD also said that they will further explore joint market engagement and capacity-building initiatives, including with other key partner organizations.

TNFD Co-Chair Razan Al-Mubarak said:

“Nature is essential to our economies and our future. Our collaboration with the ISSB is a major step toward making nature visible in businesses reporting and how capital is allocated. Climate-related standards have already moved markets, and we are pleased to continue to support ISSB efforts that bring the rest of nature into global reporting practice.”

The formalized agreement follows a long-time collaboration between the organizations, with the ISSB serving as a TNFD Knowledge Partner since the inception of the TNFD, and the TNFD already working to support the ISSB’s BEES project. The organizations said that the new agreement will deepen their collaboration as the ISSB considers the TNFD recommendations in its research into the needs of global capital markets for information about nature-related risks and opportunities.

Sue Lloyd, ISSB Vice-Chair, said:

“Our collaboration with the TNFD is a clear signal to the market that we are committed to reducing fragmentation in sustainability disclosure while meeting the need for relevant and high-quality information for capital markets.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IFRS2.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 13:57:14.928220

As airlines and regulators aim for carbon neutrality, SAF has emerged as a critical component for reducing aviation-related emissions. However, while the science and sustainability of SAF have advanced, the political and economic landscape has not always been supportive. One significant disruptor was the era of U.S. protectionism under the Trump administration, where sweeping tariffs altered the dynamics of global trade. In this blog, we analyze how Trump-era trade policies affected the sustainable aviation fuel market—shaping innovation, supply chains, and competitive positioning across the globe.

Trump Tariffs and the SAF Market: A Direct Economic Collision

The Trump administration's tariff campaigns, particularly against China and the European Union, were intended to revive domestic manufacturing and address trade imbalances. However, these actions inadvertently affected the aviation fuel sector. SAF production often relies on international collaboration for feedstocks, technologies, and processing equipment. Imposing tariffs on raw materials like soybean oil, waste oils, and even refinery technology meant higher production costs and longer timelines. U.S. companies producing or researching SAF faced challenges sourcing affordable inputs and components, leading to delayed investments and slower scaling.

The SAF market, while still emerging, requires delicate policy handling due to its reliance on cross-border resources and partnerships. Tariffs disrupted these interdependencies, making it difficult for startups and innovators to operate efficiently. Some producers turned inward, attempting to localize their supply chains—a process that increased capital expenditure and operational risk.

Winners and Losers of the Trade War: SAF’s Uneven Playing Field

During the trade war, certain SAF producers—particularly those heavily reliant on imports—struggled with cost increases and regulatory confusion. Conversely, firms that had vertically integrated domestic supply chains benefited in the short term. U.S. biofuel refiners that sourced locally found temporary pricing advantages as imported alternatives became less competitive due to tariffs.

However, the long-term impact was more nuanced. While protectionist measures may have offered domestic SAF producers a short-lived edge, they also restricted access to superior international technologies and partnerships. Moreover, retaliatory tariffs from affected countries made it harder for U.S. SAF firms to export or license their solutions abroad, shrinking market opportunities.

Can the U.S. Lead the SAF Market After Trump’s Trade War?

Despite setbacks, the U.S. remains a contender in the global SAF race. The question is whether it can lead. Post-tariff, there's been a concerted effort to boost domestic SAF production through new federal incentives, such as the Inflation Reduction Act's biofuel tax credits. However, leadership in this market goes beyond production volume. It demands technological innovation, resilient supply chains, and international cooperation.

The Trump-era tariffs encouraged U.S. companies to localize, which could pay dividends if domestic feedstock supply becomes more stable. Still, the SAF market is global by necessity. Sustainable feedstocks like used cooking oil or agricultural waste are geographically dispersed. Therefore, international trade must remain a core pillar of SAF strategy. If the U.S. hopes to lead, it must harmonize domestic strength with global openness.

Economic Fallout of Tariffs on SAF Growth and Investment

The uncertainty triggered by the trade war caused a measurable dip in SAF-related investments. Companies were reluctant to commit capital amid fears of unstable input costs and unclear regulatory trajectories. Venture funding into green aviation projects slowed between 2018 and 2020, reflecting broader investor caution in the face of policy unpredictability.

In addition to deterring private capital, tariffs strained public-private partnerships. State and federal agencies, uncertain about international cooperation or material costs, postponed or scaled back green aviation initiatives. The broader economic impact was a deceleration in SAF R&D and pilot projects, delaying the industry’s ability to scale production affordably.

SAF Supply Chains Under Siege: A Case of Protectionism Backfiring

One of the most profound impacts of Trump’s tariffs was on the SAF supply chain. While the intent was to reduce reliance on foreign goods, the immediate outcome was increased friction in acquiring key feedstocks and technologies. For example, many U.S.-based SAF developers depended on imported feedstocks such as palm fatty acid distillates and tallow from Asia or Latin America. Tariffs made these imports prohibitively expensive or logistically complex.

Supply chain delays rippled across the SAF ecosystem, affecting fuel certification timelines, blending logistics, and end-user pricing. Airlines, facing costlier fuel alternatives, reduced their demand for SAF, opting to delay sustainability goals. This circular impact—from tariffs to supply chains to demand—illustrates how trade policy and clean energy development are intricately linked.

Did Trump Tariffs Delay SAF Adoption in Commercial Aviation?

Commercial aviation’s adoption of SAF is driven by a mix of regulatory pressure, corporate sustainability goals, and economic feasibility. During the Trump era, tariffs increased costs for SAF producers, which were passed on to airlines in the form of higher prices. As a result, carriers that had pledged to increase SAF usage slowed their timelines or limited adoption to pilot programs.

Additionally, the policy uncertainty made airlines cautious about long-term procurement contracts. Without predictable SAF pricing, airlines couldn’t forecast operating costs accurately. In effect, the trade war created a psychological and economic barrier to SAF adoption in one of its most important customer segments.

The Global SAF Outlook: Bouncing Back from Trade Shocks

Today, the SAF market is in recovery mode. Global demand is resurging as governments, particularly in Europe and Asia, push for net-zero aviation emissions. The U.S., too, is refocusing on green fuel initiatives under new leadership. Investment is flowing back into SAF technologies, and supply chains are being reconfigured to prioritize resilience over mere cost-efficiency.

Lessons from the Trump-era tariffs are shaping current strategy. Many SAF companies now hedge against geopolitical risks by diversifying their sourcing regions and investing in modular, mobile production units. Moreover, the global SAF market is increasingly looking toward bilateral agreements that guarantee feedstock flow and avoid tariff entanglements.

U.S. vs. EU: Diverging Policy Paths and Global SAF Leadership

The Trump tariffs starkly contrasted with the European Union’s approach to sustainable aviation. While the U.S. embraced protectionism, the EU doubled down on green energy subsidies and cross-border collaboration. As a result, European SAF developers gained momentum, attracting international investors and building scalable supply chains.

Now, the U.S. is attempting to catch up through legislative incentives and industrial policy reforms. However, regaining global leadership requires more than money. The SAF market thrives on interoperability, certification alignment, and technological standardization. Rebuilding international trust and trade bridges—damaged during the trade war—is essential for American SAF firms to compete globally.

Long-Term Impact on SAF Innovation and Commercialization

The trade war's chilling effect on innovation may not be fully reversed for years. Startups that failed to secure funding or had projects delayed during the tariff period lost valuable time in a fast-evolving market. Some companies pivoted away from aviation fuels altogether, weakening the innovation pipeline.

However, adversity also breeds resilience. Some firms emerged stronger, having developed proprietary feedstock processing technologies or secured domestic feedstock partnerships. These innovations are now feeding back into a leaner, more agile SAF ecosystem. Still, the pace of SAF commercialization would have been faster without the policy roadblocks introduced during the Trump years.

Trade Policy Must Support Green Innovation

The sustainable aviation fuel market is a cornerstone of aviation’s climate future. Yet its growth is deeply intertwined with global trade flows, technology partnerships, and cross-border investment. The Trump-era tariffs, while aimed at economic revival, imposed unintended burdens on SAF producers, airlines, and investors. As the world accelerates its energy transition, this episode serves as a reminder: trade policy must be aligned with climate policy.

In 5–10 years, we expect XCF to be a global leader in Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Mihir Dange, CEO

By Prakash Jha

April 8, 2025

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rapidly emerging as one of the most viable low-carbon solutions for the aviation industry, offering a pathway to significantly reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. With growing regulatory support, increased corporate demand, and airlines’ commitments to achieve net-zero emissions, SAF is gaining attention. The market for SAF is expected to grow substantially in the coming years as it addresses the aviation industry’s critical need for sustainable, scalable alternatives to traditional jet fuel.

In an exclusive interview with our Editor Prakash Jha, Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, shed light on how his company is positioned to take advantage of this market boom. Dange discussed XCF Global’s unique role as a dedicated SAF producer, its operational advantages, and the strategic initiatives the company is undertaking to meet the growing demand. As XCF Global prepares for its upcoming NASDAQ debut, Dange highlighted the company’s commitment to sustainable growth and its vision for the future of aviation fuel.

Q. The market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to experience substantial growth. What makes this market so attractive to institutional investors, and how does XCF Global plan to capitalize on this growth?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents one of the most commercially viable low-carbon solutions for aviation in the global energy transition. Investors are increasingly seeking assets that combine strong fundamentals with measurable ESG impact. The SAF market does exactly that. It is backed by regulatory momentum, growing corporate demand, and decarbonization mandates from governments and airlines around the world.

At XCF Global, we offer early access to SAF as a dedicated, pure-play producer. Our New Rise Reno production facility is operational and has an expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF. We have a long-term agreement in place with Phillips 66 to provide non-food feedstock and offtake of renewable fuels, providing cash flow visibility and stability. XCF’s early-mover advantage and rapid scalability are compelling.

Q. What do you believe are the key factors driving the increasing demand for SAF, and how can investors ensure that they are getting the best return on their investments in this space?

Several converging forces are driving SAF demand: airline net-zero commitments, regional SAF blending mandates (especially in Europe), the rise of corporate ESG targets, and, most notably, the aviation industry’s lack of viable alternatives to liquid fuels. SAF is no longer an idea for decarbonizing the aviation industry – it’s the solution.

We believe stakeholders need to look at producers with real offtake agreements, proven production capacity, and scalable infrastructure. XCF is already delivering SAF. Our ability to monetize carbon credits, the opportunity to secure advantageous pricing in international markets, and deploy capital efficiently gives us a financial and operational edge in this space.

Q. XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut. How do you envision this public listing benefiting the company in both the short and long term?

Our NASDAQ listing is a milestone that positions us for scale, visibility, and access to growth capital. In the short term, it allows us to broaden our shareholder base, attract institutional coverage, and deepen investor engagement. It also enhances credibility with customers, regulators, and trade partners.

Long term, being a Nasdaq listed company provides us with a platform to expand our production footprint, explore new technologies, and solidify our position as a leading pure-play SAF company globally. We’re committed to delivering sustainable returns to shareholders – financially and environmentally.

Q. As the only public pure-play SAF producer in the U.S., what specific advantages does XCF Global have over competitors in this rapidly growing sector?

We are operational today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF output from our New Rise Reno production facility. That head start matters – especially in a market where demand vastly outpaces supply and bringing new facilities online is challenging.

We also benefit from:

•

Project pipeline: Our Reno, Nevada facility and an adjacent plot for SAF facility development is strategically located within proximity to SFO, LAX, and other west coast airports. This second facility in Reno is expected to come online in 2027. Additional plants in Florida and North Carolina are expected to service the Southeast and East Coast regions of the US and provide convenient access to deepwater ports that facilitate export. The Florida and North Carolina facilities are expected to come online in 2028 after which XCF expects to have the ability to produce 159 million gallons of annualized neat SAF production.

•

Feedstock flexibility: Our pre-treatment process allows for multiple non-food feedstock inputs, improving stability and reducing CI scores.

•

Fortune 50 partnerships: Partnership with Phillips 66 validates our model and provide supply chain stability.

•

Scalability: New Rise Reno has a pending utility patent related to the design, layout and configuration of its production facility. This site design requires less area to build a production facility and can be efficiently replicated as modular design allows for rapid expansion.

Q. Many clean energy companies have gone public in recent years. How does XCF Global’s strategy differ from other clean energy plays, and what sets you apart in the market?

Many clean energy IPOs have focused on long-term R&D or future-forward concepts. XCF is different—we’re built to deliver. We have an operating SAF facility, a long-term supply and off-take agreement with a Fortune 50 Company, and are generating revenue. Our unit economics work because we’ve designed our business around flexible feedstocks and offtake certainty.

Q. Airline net-zero commitments are driving the adoption of SAF. How quickly do you see the airline industry transitioning to SAF, and what role do you believe XCF Global will play in this transition?

Several major airlines around the world have committed to achieving 10% SAF usage by 2030. The transition is accelerating as carbon reduction becomes a competitive and regulatory imperative. However, the biggest bottleneck is supply—and that’s where XCF comes in.

We’re one of the few producers prepared to meet this demand. Our role is to bridge the supply gap, de-risk procurement for airlines, and provide low-CI SAF that helps them meet their sustainability goals. We’re not just a supplier—we’re a strategic partner in their net-zero journey.

Q. What challenges do airlines face in terms of SAF supply, and how is XCF Global positioned to help bridge that gap?

Airlines face three primary challenges: availability, cost, and carbon intensity. Many facilities won’t be online until the end of the decade, leaving a multi-year supply shortage. Pricing remains volatile, and not all SAF is created equal—many options still have high CI scores.

XCF addresses all three:

•

Availability: Our flagship facility, New Rise Reno, is online today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF

•

Cost: Our ability to diversify feedstock types allows us to effectively manage input costs.

•

Carbon impact: Our fuel helps customers earn value in carbon markets.

Q. Can you provide insights into the company’s strategic expansion plans in Nevada, Florida, and North Carolina? How do these regions align with the company’s broader vision for growth?

Our site strategy is designed for scale and resilience. Reno, Nevada is our first operational site, providing immediate production and proximity to West Coast aviation hubs.

XCF is developing an additional site, New Rise Reno 2, located directly adjacent to New Rise. This site will leverage existing infrastructure at New Rise, including pretreatment, electrical, water, and logistics, eliminating the need for a full ground-up build.

The site in Florida will expand our reach into Southeastern markets, while the site in North Carolina will serve as an East Coast conduit.

These locations facilitate logistics, permitting ease, feedstock availability, and access to major transportation corridors. Our patent-pending, 10-acre design allows us to replicate production quickly, enabling a modular path to bringing our projects to life.

Q. There is a significant gap between SAF supply and demand. What specific steps is XCF Global taking to ensure it can meet the surging demand for SAF over the next few years?

We’ve taken a proactive approach to close that gap:

1.

Near-term production: New Rise Reno is already operational. A second facility adjacent to New Rise is projected to come online in 2027 with the Florida and North Carolina facilities expected to commence operations in 2028.

2.

Replicable design: Our patent-pending facility design enables rapid deployment at future sites across the U.S. and globally.

3.

Strong partnerships: Our agreement with Phillips 66 ensures stable feedstock and off-take, enhancing predictability and stability for our trade partners.

Q. As one of the first movers in the SAF space, where do you see XCF Global in the next 5–10 years? How will you maintain your competitive edge as the industry evolves?

In 5–10 years, we expect XCF to be a global leader in SAF, recognized for delivering clean, reliable, low-carbon fuel solutions in aviation.

Tuesday, 8 April 2025

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rapidly emerging as one of the most viable low-carbon solutions for the aviation industry, offering a pathway to significantly reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. With growing regulatory support, increased corporate demand, and airlines’ commitments to achieve net-zero emissions, SAF is gaining attention. The market for SAF is expected to grow substantially in the coming years as it addresses the aviation industry’s critical need for sustainable, scalable alternatives to traditional jet fuel.

In an exclusive interview with our Editor Prakash Jha, Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, shed light on how his company is positioned to take advantage of this market boom. Dange discussed XCF Global’s unique role as a dedicated SAF producer, its operational advantages, and the strategic initiatives the company is undertaking to meet the growing demand. As XCF Global prepares for its upcoming NASDAQ debut, Dange highlighted the company’s commitment to sustainable growth and its vision for the future of aviation fuel.

Q. The market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to experience substantial growth. What makes this market so attractive to institutional investors, and how does XCF Global plan to capitalize on this growth?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents one of the most commercially viable low-carbon solutions for aviation in the global energy transition. Investors are increasingly seeking assets that combine strong fundamentals with measurable ESG impact. The SAF market does exactly that. It is backed by regulatory momentum, growing corporate demand, and decarbonization mandates from governments and airlines around the world.

At XCF Global, we offer early access to SAF as a dedicated, pure-play producer. Our New Rise Reno production facility is operational and has an expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF. We have a long-term agreement in place with Phillips 66 to provide non-food feedstock and offtake of renewable fuels, providing cash flow visibility and stability. XCF’s early-mover advantage and rapid scalability are compelling.

Q. What do you believe are the key factors driving the increasing demand for SAF, and how can investors ensure that they are getting the best return on their investments in this space?

Several converging forces are driving SAF demand: airline net-zero commitments, regional SAF blending mandates (especially in Europe), the rise of corporate ESG targets, and, most notably, the aviation industry’s lack of viable alternatives to liquid fuels. SAF is no longer an idea for decarbonizing the aviation industry – it’s the solution.

We believe stakeholders need to look at producers with real offtake agreements, proven production capacity, and scalable infrastructure. XCF is already delivering SAF. Our ability to monetize carbon credits, the opportunity to secure advantageous pricing in international markets, and deploy capital efficiently gives us a financial and operational edge in this space.

Q. XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut. How do you envision this public listing benefiting the company in both the short and long term?

Our NASDAQ listing is a milestone that positions us for scale, visibility, and access to growth capital. In the short term, it allows us to broaden our shareholder base, attract institutional coverage, and deepen investor engagement. It also enhances credibility with customers, regulators, and trade partners.

Long term, being a Nasdaq listed company provides us with a platform to expand our production footprint, explore new technologies, and solidify our position as a leading pure-play SAF company globally. We’re committed to delivering sustainable returns to shareholders – financially and environmentally.

Q. As the only public pure-play SAF producer in the U.S., what specific advantages does XCF Global have over competitors in this rapidly growing sector?

We are operational today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF output from our New Rise Reno production facility. That head start matters – especially in a market where demand vastly outpaces supply and bringing new facilities online is challenging.

We also benefit from:

•

Project pipeline: Our Reno, Nevada facility and an adjacent plot for SAF facility development is strategically located within proximity to SFO, LAX, and other west coast airports. This second facility in Reno is expected to come online in 2027. Additional plants in Florida and North Carolina are expected to service the Southeast and East Coast regions of the US and provide convenient access to deepwater ports that facilitate export. The Florida and North Carolina facilities are expected to come online in 2028 after which XCF expects to have the ability to produce 159 million gallons of annualized neat SAF production.

•

Feedstock flexibility: Our pre-treatment process allows for multiple non-food feedstock inputs, improving stability and reducing CI scores.

•

Fortune 50 partnerships: Partnership with Phillips 66 validates our model and provide supply chain stability.

•

Scalability: New Rise Reno has a pending utility patent related to the design, layout and configuration of its production facility. This site design requires less area to build a production facility and can be efficiently replicated as modular design allows for rapid expansion.

Q. Many clean energy companies have gone public in recent years. How does XCF Global’s strategy differ from other clean energy plays, and what sets you apart in the market?

Many clean energy IPOs have focused on long-term R&D or future-forward concepts. XCF is different—we’re built to deliver. We have an operating SAF facility, a long-term supply and off-take agreement with a Fortune 50 Company, and are generating revenue. Our unit economics work because we’ve designed our business around flexible feedstocks and offtake certainty.

Q. Airline net-zero commitments are driving the adoption of SAF. How quickly do you see the airline industry transitioning to SAF, and what role do you believe XCF Global will play in this transition?

Several major airlines around the world have committed to achieving 10% SAF usage by 2030. The transition is accelerating as carbon reduction becomes a competitive and regulatory imperative. However, the biggest bottleneck is supply—and that’s where XCF comes in.

We’re one of the few producers prepared to meet this demand. Our role is to bridge the supply gap, de-risk procurement for airlines, and provide low-CI SAF that helps them meet their sustainability goals. We’re not just a supplier—we’re a strategic partner in their net-zero journey.

Q. What challenges do airlines face in terms of SAF supply, and how is XCF Global positioned to help bridge that gap?

Airlines face three primary challenges: availability, cost, and carbon intensity. Many facilities won’t be online until the end of the decade, leaving a multi-year supply shortage. Pricing remains volatile, and not all SAF is created equal—many options still have high CI scores.

XCF addresses all three:

•

Availability: Our flagship facility, New Rise Reno, is online today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF

•

Cost: Our ability to diversify feedstock types allows us to effectively manage input costs.

•

Carbon impact: Our fuel helps customers earn value in carbon markets.

Q. Can you provide insights into the company’s strategic expansion plans in Nevada, Florida, and North Carolina? How do these regions align with the company’s broader vision for growth?

Our site strategy is designed for scale and resilience. Reno, Nevada is our first operational site, providing immediate production and proximity to West Coast aviation hubs.

XCF is developing an additional site, New Rise Reno 2, located directly adjacent to New Rise. This site will leverage existing infrastructure at New Rise, including pretreatment, electrical, water, and logistics, eliminating the need for a full ground-up build.

The site in Florida will expand our reach into Southeastern markets, while the site in North Carolina will serve as an East Coast conduit.

These locations facilitate logistics, permitting ease, feedstock availability, and access to major transportation corridors. Our patent-pending, 10-acre design allows us to replicate production quickly, enabling a modular path to bringing our projects to life.

Q. There is a significant gap between SAF supply and demand. What specific steps is XCF Global taking to ensure it can meet the surging demand for SAF over the next few years?

We’ve taken a proactive approach to close that gap:

1.

Near-term production: New Rise Reno is already operational. A second facility adjacent to New Rise is projected to come online in 2027 with the Florida and North Carolina facilities expected to commence operations in 2028.

2.

Replicable design: Our patent-pending facility design enables rapid deployment at future sites across the U.S. and globally.

3.

Strong partnerships: Our agreement with Phillips 66 ensures stable feedstock and off-take, enhancing predictability and stability for our trade partners.

Q. As one of the first movers in the SAF space, where do you see XCF Global in the next 5–10 years? How will you maintain your competitive edge as the industry evolves?

In 5–10 years, we expect XCF to be a global leader in SAF, recognized for delivering clean, reliable, low-carbon fuel solutions in aviation. We plan to be operating multiple facilities in the U.S. and beyond, supplying major airlines and energy companies, and leveraging our platform to drive decarbonization across aviation and beyond.

Ultimately, our success will be defined not just by gallons produced – but by our leadership in decarbonizing the air travel.

The following is an article following an interview with Simon Oxley as published on the www.SPGlobal.com https://www.spglobal.com/commodity-insights/en/news-research/latest-news/refined-products/040725-interview-small-us-saf-plants-well-positioned-for-investment-amid-turbulence-xcf-cfo/ on April 8, 2025:

INTERVIEW: Small US SAF plants well-positioned for investment amid turbulence, XCF CFO

By Thomas Washington and Jeff Mower

Modular approach offers cheaper finance alternatives

RINs market recovering after slump

US RD projects have faced bankruptcy, presenting SAF opportunities

Sustainable aviation fuel could see turbo-charged demand growth in the years to come, but with volatile prices and political headwinds in the US, investment in the near term will likely be limited, according to the chief financial officer of SAF producer XCF Global.

Larger facilities often require substantial upfront capital and are heavily reliant on long-term offtake agreements, which can be challenging to secure in the current market, XCF's Simon Oxley told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights, in an April 4 interview. The absence of established market norms and the lack of long-term contracts with airlines, which typically have weak balance sheets, create significant risk for investors, he added

By contrast, small modular projects are more attractive to financing because they require lower initial investments, can be developed incrementally and are more agile in response to market conditions, Oxley said.

""The airline industry is not slowing down, demand for planes is not slowing down,"" he said. ""So what we want to be able to do is sort of fill that gap and that gap does exist.""

XCF intends to be a leading producer of SAF in North America. It recently completed its acquisition of New Rise Renewables, which can produce 38 million gal/year of SAF, or just over 3,300 b/d of neat or unblended SAF, at its unit in Reno, Nevada. In the US, SAF is blended with petroleum-based jet fuel at a blending ratio of 10% to 50%. XCF is expected to become a publicly listed company on Nasdaq, it has said.

XCF plans to have neat SAF production capacity of more than 150 million gallons, or just over 13,000 b/d over the next five years, the company said in March 2024. To that end, XCF has acquired two locations -- one in Wilson, North Carolina, and Fort Myers, Florida. Total blended SAF production capacity could reach 1 billion gallons/year, the company said. XCF uses distilled corn oil, a waste product, as feedstock.

Volatile pricing environment

Part of US President Donald Trump's election platform was hostility to the climate-friendly policies of his predecessor Joe Biden.

This weighed heavily on renewable identification numbers. D4 RIN prices slumped from 91.25 cents/RIN Jan. 20, when Trump took office, to 74.5 cents/RIN March 13. However, they have since firmed; Platts assessed them at 104.25 cents/RIN April 4.

Much of the investment in facilities created by Biden's Inflation Reduction Act was in red states, such as Georgia and Texas, and members of Congress from those states have pushed back against plans to undermine biofuel plants in their constituencies. As such, ethanol earmarked for transport fuels looks safe for now, Oxley said.

""In order for them to change the tax rules, they need a change in law and they would need 100% Republican support in order to be able to push it through,"" he said.

SAF has strong growth prospects and has no substitution risk, unlike renewable diesel, which has seen a number of projects face bankruptcy, Oxley said.

Converting renewable diesel plants to SAF output, a similar product, in relatively short order, becomes ""quite an interesting way"" to participate in the SAF market, he said.

There are a lot of renewable diesel facilities that have gone through bankruptcy, been restructured and have a lot of counterparties who are holding equity but do not want to, Oxley said.

XCF's Reno facility was previously a renewable diesel facility.

The uncertainty that is being created by the Trump administration's decarbonization-averse policies, not least in relation to the large, IRA-related loans, means that the larger projects struggle to attract finance, Oxley said.

""They're too big; they're not in the sweet spot, whereas our approach is more modular,"" he said. The important difference is going to be XCF's ability to issue equity, bring new parties onboard, with new businesses onto the platform, and grow in an expedited basis that way, he added.

Some forecasts predict growth continued growth in renewable diesel. Renewable diesel demand in the US will rise to 39.277 million mt in 2050 from 11.785 million mt in 2025, according to data from analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights. US SAF demand will grow to 32.325 million mt in 2050 from 2.118 million mt in 2025, the analysts said.

And in this massive undertaking, no airplane maker is as invested as Airbus.

At the Airbus Summit, a symposium for journalists on 24 and 25 March, top executives sketched out a bold, tech-forward vision for the company’s next couple of generations of aircraft. The highlight, from a tech perspective, is a superconducting, fuel-cell powered airliner.

Airbus’s strategy is based on parallel development efforts. While undertaking the enormous R&D projects needed to create the large, fuel-cell aircraft, the company said it will also work aggressively on an airliner designed to wring the most possible efficiency out of combustion-based propulsion. For this plane, the company is targeting a 20-to-30 percent reduction in fuel consumption, according to Bruno Fichefeux, head of future programmes at Airbus. The plane would be a single-aisle airliner, designed to succeed Airbus’s A320 family of aircraft, the highest-selling passenger jet aircraft on the market, with nearly 12,000 delivered. The company expects the new plane to enter service some time in the latter half of the 2030s.

Airbus hopes to achieve such a large efficiency gain by exploiting emerging advances in jet engines, wings, lightweight, high-strength composite materials, and sustainable aviation fuel. For example, Airbus disclosed that it is now working on a pair of advanced jet engines, the more radical of which would have an open fan whose blades would spin without a surrounding nacelle. Airbus is evaluating such an engine in a project with partner CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines.

Without a nacelle to enclose them, an engine’s fan blades can be very large, permitting higher levels of “bypass air,” which is the air sucked in to the back of the engine—separate from the air used to combust fuel—and expelled to provide thrust. The ratio of bypass air to combustion air is an important measure of engine performance, with higher ratios indicating higher efficiencies, according to Mohamed Ali, chief technology and operating officer for GE Aerospace. Typical bypass ratios today are around 11 or 12, but the open-fan design could enable ratios as high as 60, according to Ali.

The partners have already tested open-fan engines in two different series of wind-tunnel tests in Europe, Ali added. “The results have been extremely encouraging, not only because they are really good in terms of performance and noise validation, but also [because] they’re validating the computational analysis that we have done,” Ali said at the Airbus event.

A scale model of an open-fan aircraft engine was tested last year in a wind tunnel in Modane, France. The tests were conducted by France’s national aerospace research agency and Safran Aircraft Engines, which is working on open-fan engines with GE Aerospace.Safran Aircraft Engines

Fuel-cell airliner is a cornerstone of zero-emission goals

In parallel with this advanced combustion-powered airliner, Airbus has been developing a fuel-cell aircraft for five years under a program called ZEROe. At the Summit, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury backed off of a goal to fly such a plane by 2035, citing the lack of a regulatory framework for certifying such an aircraft as well as the slow pace of the build-out of infrastructure needed to produce “green” hydrogen at commercial scale and at competitive prices. “We would have the risk of a sort of ‘Concord of hydrogen’ where we would have a solution, but that would not be a commercially viable solution at scale,” Faury explained.

That said, he took pains to reaffirm the company’s commitment to the project. “We continue to believe in hydrogen,” he declared. “We’re absolutely convinced that this is an energy for the future for aviation, but there’s just more work to be done. More work for Airbus, and more work for the others around us to bring that energy to something that is at scale, that is competitive, and that will lead to a success, making a significant contribution to decarbonization.” Many of the world’s major industries, including aviation, have pledged to achieve zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050, a fact that Faury and other Airbus officials repeatedly invoked as a key driver of the ZEROe project.

Later in the event, Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus’s vice president in charge of the ZEROe program, described the project in detail, indicating an effort of breathtaking technological ambition. The envisioned aircraft would seat at least 100 people and have a range of 1000 nautical miles (1850 kilometers). It would be powered by four fuel-cell “engines” (two on each wing), each with a power output of 2 megawatts.

According to Hauke Luedders, head of fuel cell propulsion systems development at Airbus, the company has already done extensive tests in Munich on a 1.2 MW system built with partners including Liebherr Group, ElringKlinger, Magna Steyr, and Diehl. Luedders said the company is focusing on low-temperature proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells, although it has not yet settled on the technology.

But the real stunner was Llewellyn’s description of a comprehensive program at Airbus to design and test a complete superconducting electrical powertrain for the fuel-cell aircraft. “As the hydrogen stored on the aircraft is stored at a very cold temperature, minus 253 degrees Celsius, we can use this temperature and the cryogenic technology to also efficiently cool down the electrics in the full system,” Llewellyn explained. “It significantly improves the energy efficiency and the performance. And even if this is an early technology, with the right efforts and the right partnerships, this could be a game changer for our fuel-cell aircraft, for our fully electric aircraft, enabling us to design larger, more powerful, and more efficient aircraft.”

In response to a question from IEEE Spectrum, Llewellyn elaborated that all of the major components of the electric propulsion system would be cryo-cooled: “electric distribution system, electronic controls, power converters, and the motors”—specifically, the coils in the motors. “We’re working with partners on every single component,” he added. The cryo-cooling system would chill a refrigerant that would circulate to keep the components cold, he explained.

A fuel cell aircraft “engine,” as envisioned by Airbus, would include a 2-megawatt electric motor and associated motor control unit (MCU), a fuel-cell system to power the motor, and associated systems for supplying air, hydrogen fuel, liquid refrigerant, and other necessities. The ram air system would capture cold air flowing over the aircraft for use in the cooling systems.Airbus SAS

Could aviation be the killer app for superconductors?

Llewellyn did not specify which superconductors and refrigerants the team was working with. But high temperature superconductors are a good bet, because of the drastically reduced requirements on the cooling system that would be needed to sustain superconductivity.

Copper-oxide based ceramic superconductors were invented at IBM in 1986, and various forms of them can superconduct at temperatures between –238 °C (35 K) and –140 °C (133 K) at ambient pressure. These temperatures are higher than traditional superconductors, which need temperatures below about 25 K. Nevertheless, commercial applications for the high-temperature superconductors have been elusive.

But a superconductivity expert, applied physicist Yu He at Yale University, was heartened by the news from Airbus. “My first reaction was, ‘really?’ And my second reaction was, wow, this whole line of research, or application, is indeed growing and I’m very delighted” about Airbus’s ambitious plans.

Copper-oxide superconductors have been used in a few applications, almost all of them experimental. These included wind-turbine generators, magnetic-levitation train demonstrations, short electrical transmission cables, magnetic-resonance imaging machines and, notably, in the electromagnet coils for experimental tokamak fusion reactors.

The tokamak application, at a fusion startup called Commonwealth Fusion Systems, is particularly relevant because to make coils, engineers had to invent a process for turning the normally brittle copper-oxide superconducting material into a tape that could be used to form donut-shaped coils capable of sustaining very high current flow and therefore very intense magnetic fields.

“Having a superconductor to provide such a large current is desirable because it doesn’t generate heat,” says He. “That means, first, you have much less energy lost directly from the coils themselves. And, second, you don’t require as much cooling power to remove the heat.”

Still, the technical hurdles are substantial. “One can argue that inside the motor, intense heat will still need to be removed due to aerodynamic friction,” He says. “Then it becomes, how do you manage the overall heat within the motor?”

An engineer at Air Liquide Advanced Technologies works on a test of a hydrogen storage and distribution system at the Liquid Hydrogen Breadboard in November, 2024. The “Breadboard” was established last year in Grenoble, France, by Air Liquide and Airbus.Céline Sadonnet/Master Films

For this challenge, engineers will at least have a favorable environment with cold, fast-flowing air. Engineers will be able to tap into the “massive air flow” over the motors and other components to assist the cooling, He suggests. Smart design could “take advantage of this kinetic energy of flowing air.”

To test the evolving fuel-cell propulsion system, Airbus has built a unique test center in Grenoble called the “Liquid Hydrogen Breadboard,” Llewellyn disclosed at the Summit. “We partnered with Air Liquide Advanced Technologies” to build the facility, he said. “This Breadboard is a versatile test platform designed to simulate key elements of future aircraft architecture: tanks, valves, pipes, and pumps, allowing us to validate different configurations at full scale. And this test facility is helping us gain critical insight into safety, hydrogen operations, tank design, refueling, venting, and gauging.”

“Throughout 2025, we’re going to continue testing the complete liquid-hydrogen and distribution system,” Llewellyn added. “And by 2027, our objective is to take an even further major step forward, testing the complete end-to-end system, including the fuel-cell engine and the liquid hydrogen storage and distribution system together, which will allow us to assess the full system in action.”

Conclusion Europe is moving along with its net-zero plans for 2050, including its targets for sustainable aviation fuel.
SAF is three to five times more expensive than jet fuel and could make flying so expensive that only a privileged few will be able to fly in the future unless technology and demand can produce SAF to be competitive with current aviation fuels.","The CEO of Qantas Airlines, Vanessa Hudson, said that flying may become so expensive that it would only be available for the privileged under a “net zero” policy requiring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF’s higher “clean fuel” costs threaten to put airfares out of reach of the masses. SAF costs three to five times as much as kerosene and is currently the only realistic path to achieving the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050. Fuel is the costliest input in air transportation operations. SAF is most commonly produced from cooking oil obtained in Asia.

Britain has issued a mandate for carriers to use at least 10% SAF by 2030 —one of the most stringent requirements in the world. The EU target is lower — 6% SAF by 2030. Airbus is planning to fly its future planes on SAF, adding an expensive “green premium” to air fares. Last year, SAF made up less than 1% of industry-wide fuel consumption due to its high price and low production. SAF is estimated to reduce life-cycle carbon dioxide emissions by around 80% compared with traditional jet fuel.

UK Requirement

The UK SAF mandate sets targets for aviation fuel suppliers to provide increasing amounts of SAF from 2025 to 2040. In 2025, 2% of the jet fuel supplied in the UK must be SAF, increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040. The UK government has a price guarantee mechanism to help increase SAF production and encourage the development of a large-scale refinery in the UK.

The mandate is being enforced by a tradable certificate plan for aviation fuel suppliers. Suppliers receive a certificate proportional to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduction they achieved in the previous year, which can be used to meet the mandate. Excess certificates can be sold to other suppliers who may need additional certificates. The mandate program also contains a buy-out mechanism that allows suppliers to discharge their obligations if they cannot secure a supply of SAF by imports or domestic production. The program also sets a maximum price for the certificates to prevent excessive costs from being passed on to consumers.

The UK currently has only one SAF production facility, owned by Phillips 66. It is located in Yorkshire and co-processes waste oils. The refinery is expected to produce approximately 50 million liters of SAF this year. Eight more SAF production facilities have been announced. However, experts have expressed doubts about whether production can be scaled up quickly enough to meet the UK’s aggressive schedule.

Airbus Plans

By the end of 2025, all Airbus customers can receive their aircraft with SAF anywhere, free of charge. In 2024, 75% of the 766 Airbus aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend. Recently, Airbus has been increasing the percentage of SAF used in its internal operations to 16%, including in business travel, delivery flights, and transportation of aircraft parts between different production sites. Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. TotalEnergies supplies more than half of the SAF that Airbus needs in Europe.

Airbus also recently unveiled a blueprint for a new generation of narrow-body planes capable of running off 100% SAF. Current plans for the aircraft, to be introduced after 2035, feature composite wings that are much longer and narrower than existing models. The supersized wings create more lift, reduce drag, and lower fuel burn. Their increased length means that the wings will need to fold in order to use existing airport gates. Airbus also confirmed that it had shelved studies for a jet engine-powered plane that would burn hydrogen instead of kerosene.

Conclusion

Europe is moving along with its net-zero plans for 2050, including its targets for sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is three to five times more expensive than jet fuel and could make flying so expensive that only a privileged few will be able to fly in the future unless technology and demand can produce SAF to be competitive with current aviation fuels. Airbus is changing the design of its planes to make them more aerodynamic and able to use 100% SAF more economically. The design will be introduced after 2035. Airbus currently uses 16% SAF for its internal operations and delivers Airbus planes with an SAF blend to 75% of its customers. The UK currently requires 2% SAF in its jet fuel and mandates 10% by 2030. The EU’s requirement by 2030 is less than 6%. Europe continues to layer costs upon its citizenry to comply with the UN’s Paris Accords, even when it means pricing much of its population out of the convenience of modern transportation.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bigstock-Empty-Airplane-Inside-With-Sma-359704195.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 11:56:28.059678

The report highlights several key initiatives, focusing on advancements in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a significant reduction in single-use plastics, and initiatives designed to foster community engagement in Hong Kong and beyond.

The airline’s Chief Executive Officer, Ronald Lam, explained that the airline has now laid a solid foundation for future development. After a challenging two years of recovery, Cathay Pacific is now focused on driving sustainable growth, with the aim of improving not only its operational efficiency but also its positive contribution to the global travel industry and communities it serves.

Advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Usage

One of the standout achievements highlighted in the report was Cathay Pacific’s increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which has been a key component of the airline’s sustainability strategy. As part of its commitment to reducing carbon emissions, Cathay Pacific has partnered with HSBC Hong Kong and EcoCeres to facilitate the introduction of SAF at Hong Kong International Airport. This collaboration also led to the formation of the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC). The coalition aims to drive the policy development needed to accelerate SAF adoption in the region.

According to the airline’s report, the Corporate SAF Programme has seen extraordinary growth, with Cathay Pacific increasing its SAF usage by an impressive 22 times compared to 2022. This marks a significant step forward in the airline’s broader strategy to reduce its carbon footprint, positioning Cathay Pacific as a global leader in adopting more sustainable aviation practices. By using SAF, which is made from renewable resources, the airline aims to lower the net carbon emissions of its flights, ultimately helping to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Promoting Circular Economy and Reducing Plastic Waste

In addition to its efforts in aviation fuel, Cathay Pacific has focused on improving its waste management practices. The airline has made significant progress in reducing single-use plastics (SUP), a major contributor to global pollution. In its 2024 report, Cathay Pacific revealed that the airline had reduced passenger-facing SUP items to an average of just 2.6 pieces per passenger. This achievement was a critical part of the airline’s sustainability goals and aligns with global efforts to combat plastic pollution.

Looking ahead, Cathay Pacific has set ambitious goals for 2025. These include increasing the recycling rate of inflight water bottles to 33% and ensuring that at least 50% of remaining SUP items are made from recycled plastics. Furthermore, Cathay Pacific introduced a recycling workflow at Hong Kong International Airport for plastic bottles and cans. This initiative is part of the airline’s broader strategy to embrace a circular economy, where resources are reused and recycled rather than discarded.

For the travel industry, this shift towards reducing plastic waste is likely to have a profound impact on how airports and airlines manage waste and sustainability. As travelers become more environmentally conscious, they may choose airlines and airports that prioritize eco-friendly practices, such as Cathay Pacific’s commitment to reducing plastic use and improving recycling programs.

Engaging with the Community: Cathay’s Commitment to Youth Development

Beyond its environmental initiatives, Cathay Pacific has demonstrated a strong commitment to community engagement, particularly through its flagship youth development programme, “I Can Fly”. In 2024, the programme celebrated its 20th anniversary, marking a significant milestone in its efforts to provide young people with the skills, knowledge, and experiences they need to succeed in the modern workforce. After a five-year hiatus, the programme returned and expanded its reach with an exchange tour that included visits to cities within the Greater Bay Area.

The “I Can Fly” programme has always been a way for Cathay Pacific to inspire young people in Hong Kong and beyond. It focuses on teaching leadership, teamwork, and career development, providing opportunities for participants to gain practical knowledge and insight into the aviation industry. As Cathay Pacific continues to nurture future talent, the programme plays an integral role in shaping the careers of young people who may one day enter the travel and aviation sectors, helping to diversify and strengthen the future workforce.

For the global travel industry, community engagement programmes like “I Can Fly” serve as a reminder of the importance of developing local talent and fostering youth involvement in aviation. The next generation of aviation professionals is crucial for the future of the industry, and Cathay Pacific’s efforts in this area could inspire other airlines to create similar initiatives that offer young people pathways into the aviation and travel sectors.

Setting Clear Sustainability Goals for the Future

Looking toward the future, Cathay Pacific has set clear, measurable sustainability goals for the next decade. The airline has committed to reducing cabin waste to just 0.63 kg per passenger by 2030, representing a 30% reduction from the 2019 baseline. This ambitious target is part of a broader commitment to achieve long-term sustainability, focusing on both reducing the environmental impact of air travel and enhancing passenger experience.

As part of this goal, Cathay Pacific is also focused on enhancing its inflight service offerings by reducing waste, improving energy efficiency, and implementing more sustainable operational practices. By integrating these initiatives into its day-to-day operations, Cathay Pacific aims to lead by example and inspire the rest of the aviation industry to adopt similar practices.

SAF or biojet is a renewable fuel approved for commercial airlines and can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel. However, SAF production presents unique operational challenges associated with feedstock variability and conversion processes.

In an article published in Hydrocarbon Processing magazine, Lara Petrishchev and Julie Valentine share measurement instrumentation strategies for navigating the complexities of biofuel production, especially within the hydrotreatment process unit of the refining process.

SAF Production Challenges

SAF is produced through lipid conversion processes, utilizing renewable feedstocks rich in oil, such as used cooking oil, oil-bearing plants like rapeseed and soybeans, and tallow. These feedstocks undergo pretreatment to eliminate contaminants that can harm reactor catalysts and to break them down into consistent intermediates that feed the hydrotreating and isomerization reactors.

Despite the pretreatment process of bio-based feedstocks, SAF feedstocks present unique challenges:

• They tend to be more corrosive, leading to operational issues.

• Their variability adds another layer of complexity.

In addition, the SAF refining process demands significantly more hydrogen (H2) and operates at elevated pressures and temperatures.

Improving Process Control

To optimize the operation of the hydrotreatment and isomerization unit, strategically deploying measurement sensors is critical to improving visibility into process conditions for better decision-making.

Controlling Highly Exothermic Reactions:

Temperature transmitters with advanced diagnostics and dual hot backup capabilities are vital for monitoring reactor temperatures and ensuring process safety.

Quad vortex flow meters provide redundant flow measurements for hydrogen treat gas, purge streams, and reactor recycle flow, preventing temperature excursions. With a two-out-of-three (2oo3) voting SIL-3 configuration, they enhance both safety and process control.

Differential pressure transmitters monitor pressure drop across reactor beds, indicating potential catalyst fouling.

Monitoring Yields and Catalyst Deactivation Rate:

Coriolis meters are crucial for the main feed, hydrogen, and product streams. Their ability to measure both mass flow and density enables accurate mass balance data for yield monitoring and catalyst evaluation.

Corrosion Monitoring:

Wireless ultrasonic corrosion sensors provide real-time indication of metal loss and monitoring of pipe wall thickness. This helps ensure equipment integrity given the variable and often more corrosive nature of renewable feedstocks. Check out this article for more insights on managing corrosion risk in biofuels processing.

Hydrogen Purity Monitoring

Continuous gas analyzers and gas chromatographs play a critical role in monitoring the purity of hydrogen streams for optimal conversion rates. They also track H2S in the recycle stream for better reaction control.

Energy Efficiency & Emissions

Continuous gas analyzers and Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) provide real-time data to quantify greenhouse gas emissions.

Real-time monitoring of flows, temperatures, and pressures of both process and transfer fluids in heat exchangers provides early detection of equipment fouling. The measurements optimize heat transfer and significantly reduce energy waste and emissions.

Simplifying Regulatory Reporting

Automated level and flow metering instrumentation with onboard diagnostics facilitates accurate fluid transfer measurements and reporting, ensuring compliance with regulations. This includes custody chain documentation, invoices, transportation, and audit trails critical to securing government subsidies.",https://www.emersonautomationexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 12:57:22.353540

“This is great news – not just for the hydrogen sector but for the UK’s ambition to become energy secure and a global leader in clean energy.” Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said: “We’re thrilled to see many Hydrogen UK members succeed in the second Hydrogen Allocation Round, marking a crucial step for scaling electrolytic hydrogen.
“This progress builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy – reinforcing the sector’s crucial role in economic growth and energy security.”","A new wave of hydrogen powered projects was shortlisted on Monday April 7, 2025, to help cut emissions and create thousands of jobs in the UK’s industrial heartlands – driving growth as part of the government’s Plan for Change.

Twenty-seven hydrogen projects have been selected for the next stage of the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2) – supporting low-carbon hydrogen production in the UK. The industry has the potential to attract over £1 billion of private sector investment into the UK by 2029, supporting the government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower.

Hydrogen will help deliver a new era of clean energy across the UK and decarbonise emission-intensive industries. It has already attracted £400 million of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire and is creating over 700 direct jobs in construction and operations.

Government support for hydrogen will help create thousands more jobs in the sector and reindustrialising the UK’s proud manufacturing regions. This includes roles for apprentices, graduates and technically trained professionals, such as engineers, welders, skilled construction workers, pipefitters and operations specialists.

Monday’s shortlist includes projects that could use hydrogen to help tackle the climate crisis by decarbonising their manufacturing and industrial practices, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick making, and sustainable aviation fuel production.

Industry Minister, Sarah Jones, said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

“From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.”

Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in a zero-carbon fuel that can be used for power generation, transport and industrial processes.

This builds on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round which saw 11 projects being allocated over £2 billion in government funding. One recipient, Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, will produce hydrogen for the Inchdairnie Whiskey distillery which intends to sustainably distil whisky by 2027.

Stretching across England, Scotland, and Wales, this latest wave of shortlisted HAR2 projects showcases the government’s commitment to create skilled jobs and establish clean energy hubs across Great Britain. The HAR2 shortlist could lead to projects that help support strong supply chains and the delivery of the clean energy superpower mission.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said: “This much-anticipated announcement brings vital clarity to the UK’s hydrogen sector, providing a crucial boost for projects that will drive forward the country’s low-carbon transition.

“The funding support offered through HAR2 gives our members and the wider industry the confidence to gear up for delivery, unlocking investment, creating jobs, and driving economic growth.

Future Energy Global is backed by Aviation Partners, the world leader in advanced winglet technology which has already saved more than 140 million tons of aviation CO2 emissions.","ENGLEWOOD, Colo., April 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) and Future Energy Global (FEG) are pleased to announce that they have signed a pioneering offtake agreement for carbon abatement attributes, to enable airlines and other companies to reduce their CO2 emissions through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Under the multi-year agreement, FEG will acquire from Gevo the Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions credits from 10 million gallons per year of fuel to be produced at Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) SAF production facility, Gevo ATJ-60, to meet demand from FEG customers, both airlines and corporates, seeking to decarbonize their operations. The agreement also includes an option for FEG to increase the off-take at a later date.

This agreement is expected to enable Gevo’s financing of the construction of its ATJ-60 facility. Gevo has secured a loan guarantee conditional commitment of $1.63 billion (including capitalized interest during construction) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) and is originating equity from project level capital providers. Under development in Lake Preston, South Dakota, ATJ-60 is designed to address the market need for cost-effective jet fuel while abating carbon and to respond to growing worldwide demand for SAF. Gevo's proprietary plant design is expected to be able to produce 60 million gallons of SAF per year at similar production costs to conventional jet fuel, but with far lower carbon emissions.

The aviation industry has targeted net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to contribute around two thirds of the necessary emissions reduction, but to achieve this, its production quantities need to scale more than 400-fold. SAF is not yet available at all major airports worldwide so FEG provides SAF-derived Scope 1 credits to airlines who wish to buy additional SAF but who cannot easily source the physical fuel at their own airports. Similarly, when companies purchase and retire SAF-derived Scope 3 credits to compensate for their business travel emissions, they mitigate the added cost of SAF to airlines and thus enable the faster scale-up of SAF production.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines different “scopes” of responsibility for emissions. The emissions from a flight fall under an airline’s direct responsibility (i.e., Scope 1), but a company with staff flying for business on that flight is responsible for its staff’s share of the flight’s emissions (i.e., Scope 3 or indirect emissions). Separating the Scope 1 and Scope 3 attributes from the physical fuel, an approach known as “Book and Claim,” reduces fuel transportation and storage costs and carbon emissions, and unlocks a global SAF market both for airlines and for indirect aviation fuel customers around the world who are seeking to mitigate their emissions.

“Gevo has always planned to leverage SAF market economics to scale our business, and a Book and Claim market that enables the trading of SAF environmental attributes can accelerate SAF production even faster,” says Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, CEO of Gevo. “Future Energy Global is building just such a market, spanning corporate customers, airlines, and aircraft lessors. Aircraft lessors own about half of all commercial aircraft worldwide, and Book and Claim is a critical enabler to allow them and their airline customers to adopt SAF faster.”

“FEG’s collaboration with Gevo strongly enhances the portfolio of Book and Claim solutions we can offer our airlines, our lessors and our corporate customers,” says Natasha Mann, CEO and Co-Founder of FEG. “It’s crucial to scale SAF production, and our business model lets us unlock the capital to do so. We’re impressed with Gevo’s pipeline, which combines technology ready for today’s market and additional technologies far along in development that could increase production efficiency and accelerate the trajectory of SAF scaling.”

FEG’s unique business model brings together investors, suppliers, and buyers to help accelerate and scale SAF production globally. FEG generates additional revenue streams by commercializing the carbon credits which SAF provides, enhancing the business case for faster production scale-up. FEG’s offtake agreement with Gevo is expected to fulfill a market need by giving buyers access to SAF credits at predictable prices, while providing financial commitments and revenue certainty that are expected to allow suppliers like Gevo to expand. FEG’s initial focus has been on aviation, though its sustainable-fuel credit solutions span the transport spectrum, including marine and land transport.

About Book and Claim

Book and Claim is a well-established structure for accounting for environmental attributes and has been in use for many years in markets such as renewable electricity generation, where individual electrons cannot be tracked through the grid. Book and Claim systems overcome this challenge by allowing renewable electricity providers to “book” the electricity they supply to the grid, while customers can “claim” the renewable electricity they have bought, whether or not they physically receive the renewable electrons. Book and Claim systems, whether in renewable electricity or in SAF, rely on robust tracking and accounting procedures to ensure that environmental credits are counted only once.

Whilst only a preliminary plan, the development will take place in 2-3 phases, with the first planned to be operational around 2034-2036.

Additionally, ABO will explore the possibility of producing methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) in Oulu – however, this will depend on the availability of biogenic carbon dioxide. The company would offer the waste heat generated for use as district heating in the region.

ABO Energy Suomi Oy, owned by ABO Energy KGaA, will implement the plant in the industrial area of Pyyryväinen.

As the land reservation is only a preliminary decision, a final investment decision (FID) will be made at a later date.

Finland was chosen due to its cheap electricity prices, ABO said in an online statement. Head of Development at ABO Energy Finland, Amanda Cardwell, explained, “Finland is an incredibly attractive destination for investment, thanks to our abundant, affordable green electricity and exceptional capacity to scale up production.”

Furthermore, the Oulu region is reportedly the largest producer of renewable electricity in Finland. “Our unique strength as a company lies in our ability to supply renewable energy to hydrogen projects directly through our wind energy portfolio,” Cardwell added.

ECO2FLY combines the sustainability of a business of great importance to the surrounding area, such as the cement industry, with the creation of a new industry for decarbonization, which will generate employment and wealth for the region, José Antonio Membiela said.

A leading position

The combination of technology and production capacity for the fuel of the future of aviation positions ECO2FLY as a leader in Europe for the decarbonization of key development sectors considered difficult to decarbonize.

In this context, over the first ten years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million tonnes of CO2.

At ECO2FLY, companies have come together from different sectors, all of them key for society like construction, energy, mobility, tourism and logistics.

In this regard, Ignacio Casajús, Global Strategy & Growth Lead at Exolum, highlighted how “Exolum is making a firm commitment to the development of partnerships that allow the development of sustainable fuels that, as of today, are presented as the only viable solution to reducing carbon emissions in the short term in sectors like aviation and shipping”.

An opportunity for Europe

This partnership is an example of how inter-sectoral collaboration allows Europe to tackle challenges it faces successfully.

This project will be submitted to the next call of the European Union Innovation Funds. Its roll-out will not only contribute to the energy transition and help achieve net zero emissions, but it will also drive the position of Spain and the European Union as a leader in industrial innovation and sustainability, strengthening our energy independence.

This project is an opportunity to be leaders in Europe in the production of eSAF, which represents an enormous strategic value for the Spanish economy. It will be the start of a new industry that will create employment and wealth, and a new energy paradigm for the country, with the opportunity to become exporters of renewable fuel on a large scale for the first time, ended Javier Esteban, Director of the Consortium and Partner of P2X Spain.",https://bioenergyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/schematiceco2fly.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 12:57:25.781390

Today, he considers them the best in the world when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel.
Back to Joachim Nordin at Skellefteå Kraft, who at this point cannot say for sure how Skellefteå Kraft will act in the future.","The planned aviation fuel factory at Näsudden in Skelleftehamn is a significant hydrogen project. The aim is to produce one hundred thousand tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually, known as eSAF, which is made from water, renewable electricity, and captured carbon dioxide.

This type of aviation fuel will become required for European airlines starting in 2030. Initially, it will need to make up 0.7 percent of total fuel use, increasing to at least 25 percent by 2050.

– This will create a large new market, Maarten van Dijk, CEO of the Dutch company SkyNRG, told Norran.

SkyNRG, pronounced Sky Energy, has been working with sustainable aviation fuel since 2009. Together with the company's co-founder, KLM Airlines, they were the first in the world to use this type of fuel on a commercial flight in 2011.

Since then, they have continued to gain market share in the industry.

– We've had both a short-term strategy where we simply bought and resold fuel, and a long-term strategy focused on building our own factories, says Maarten.

Maarten van Dijk, CEO of SkyNRG, being interviewed by Norran via video link. He co-founded SkyNRG in 2009 and has worked in various roles at the company since then.

Currently, they have one factory being built in the Netherlands and two more planned. One of them is in the USA – and the other is in Skellefteå.

– We looked at sites in Amsterdam, Germany, Canada, the Middle East, Australia, and Brazil – but ultimately, we decided that northern Sweden is the best place.

Why is that?

– There are mainly two important reasons. We need a completely green electricity network and available carbon dioxide from sources that aren't fossil fuels, like the forestry industry. This makes Skellefteå a very good location, says Maarten, who also mentions that other vital factors are the existing electricity and transportation infrastructure.

En tidig illustration av hur flygbränslefabriken på Näsudden kan komma att se ut. Kapaciteten som planeras, hundra tusen ton eSAF, beräknas täcka uppskattningsvis en sjättedel av det lagstadgade behovet i Europa 2030, baserat på de senaste flygbränsleprognoserna för EU, enligt SkyNRG.

To make this investment happen, SkyNRG teamed up with Skellefteå Kraft and created a joint company called SkyKraft AB.

However, when Joachim Nordin, CEO of the city-owned Skellefteå Kraft, first heard about SkyNRG, he didn’t know who they were.

– We had to do very careful checks. There were many other companies also talking to us, he told Norran.

Today, he considers them the best in the world when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel.

– We’ve visited their headquarters twice and met their board, management, suppliers, and owners. After the second visit, I felt completely sure – they are the best partner for this, says Joachim, who also points out that the Australian investment bank Macquarie Asset Management has invested 1.9 billion kronor in SkyNRG as proof that they are the right partner.

""Just because we’ve made money in the past doesn’t mean we can sit back and assume it will continue. The world around us and our conditions are changing – and so must we,"" says Joachim Nordin.

That Skellefteå Kraft should be involved in a project like this is, according to Joachim, completely obvious.

He believes that as an energy company, Skellefteå Kraft ""can't just keep doing things the way they've always been done"" without risking their profits.

– Just because we've made money in the past doesn't mean we can relax and expect it to continue. The world around us is changing – and so must we, says Joachim, pointing out that there's a large surplus of electricity in northern Sweden, which leads to lower earnings for energy companies.

Selling all the extra electricity to the south isn't possible because the power grid has limitations. According to him, Skellefteå Kraft instead needs to, for example through a sustainable aviation fuel plant, process its green energy locally, while also using the leftover heat to warm Skellefteå’s district heating system.

The latter is currently losing money.

– A project like this is the solution to our two biggest strategic problems, he says.

At Hedensbyn, a pilot plant for hydrogen production is being planned. Skellefteå Kraft is building it themselves, with help from, among others, EU funding. According to Joachim Nordin, the pilot plant is expected to be ready in 2026, provided all permits are granted. “The facility in Skelleftehamn is 100–150 times larger than this one, but it’s important for us to learn, for example, how to make use of waste heat,” says Joachim.

But who will pay for the construction of the factory, which is estimated to cost between 20 and 25 billion kronor? Norran asked this question to both Maarten and Joachim. Both answer that the largest part will be financed by banks and other external investors.

SkyNRG, which is backed by the giant investment bank Macquarie, also plans to invest significant capital in the operation itself.

– We are here to stay for the next 40 years, or more, and run the factory. We will not ask Skellefteå Kraft to run it. If they think it’s a good business opportunity to invest in, they can do so; if not, that’s also okay with us, says Maarten.

A potential decision on whether Skellefteå Kraft will invest larger sums will come later. So far, according to Joachim, besides working hours and some overhead costs, they have only invested 24,500 kronor, which is 49 percent of the share capital in SkyKraft AB.

How much Skellefteå Kraft is willing to invest in total, Joachim cannot say, but he admits that he has no problem investing one hundred million kronor, which is the same amount they invested in Northvolt, which recently went bankrupt.

– Even though I wasn't CEO when the decision to invest in Northvolt was made, I would argue that it was a very good decision by Skellefteå Kraft. We have received much more back than that over these years, both directly and indirectly. From a business perspective, we can easily invest 100 million kronor in a project like this, he says.

The number of employees at the factory is estimated to be around 50–100 people. “It’s not a Northvolt in terms of number of employees,” says Joachim Nordin.

If Skellefteå Kraft is to invest larger sums than that, a decision needs to be made by the politicians in the municipal council, Joachim emphasises.

Furthermore, investing larger amounts will only happen in the next phase when more details are available and agreements with future customers are to be signed.

Maarten describes the project in four different financial phases, where varying amounts of money need to be invested to move on to the next.

– In an early stage, perhaps 5 million kronor were needed, and in phase two, where we are now, around 20-30 million kronor are needed, he says.

– In the next phase after that, an estimated 500 million kronor will be needed, and then we will have a discussion with Skellefteå Kraft about whether they want to join that phase. After that will come the really large costs for building the factory.

Approximately 20 billion kronor, according to Maarten.

– Then I imagine that 70 percent will be financed with bank loans, and 30 percent will come from equity. Then the question is whether everything will be owned by SkyNRG, by SkyNRG and Skellefteå Kraft, or by SkyNRG and external investors who want to invest in this type of infrastructure, says Maarten.

""We are very aware of risks and extremely careful before making decisions, especially after all the media attention on Skellefteå Kraft as a part-owner of Northvolt. But at the same time, every business involves some kind of risk, and I wouldn’t be a good CEO if I avoided all risks.""

Back to Joachim Nordin at Skellefteå Kraft, who at this point cannot say for sure how Skellefteå Kraft will act in the future. However, he emphasizes that they will carefully consider the risks.

– We are very aware of risks and are extremely careful before making decisions, especially after all the media attention that has been on Skellefteå Kraft as a co-owner of Northvolt. But at the same time, all business involves some type of risk, and I wouldn't be a good CEO if I avoided all risks, says Joachim.

Does a municipally-owned company really need to be involved in a project like this? If it's such a good opportunity, wouldn't private businesses find it attractive?

– I don't think this would become a reality if Skellefteå Kraft wasn't involved as an important partner, and IF it were to happen anyway, it's not certain that the operation would be integrated with our heating network and that we would be the ones selling the electricity. We are doing this because it is best for Skellefteå Kraft and for the people of Skellefteå, says Joachim.",https://cdn.ntm.se/api/v1/images/jpmek2kj/smart/width/1200/height/630,N,,2025-04-09 09:56:44.988973

It offers 20 cents per gallon for nonaviation fuels and 35 cents for aviation fuels which cut emissions by 50% compared with petroleum. Michigan has six key clean-fuel and alternative-energy initiatives, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst for Tax Foundation, estimates that repealing the credit could net about $12.8 billion over a decade based on Treasury projections, although he questions the math.

""That was based on some estimates from Treasury. It doesn't make sense to take a revenue cost estimate from Treasury and assume it will one-for-one translate into revenue raised from reversing a policy,"" she said.

Critics call credit initiative costly, favoring big companies while possibly raising fuel prices and distorting the market. It started on January 1st and is slated to run through 2027 unless extended.

Congress is divided on the future of these tax credits. While some want to eliminate them altogether to offset tax cuts, others warn that doing so could harm energy investments and job growth.

Nan Swift, a resident fellow of the Governance Program at R Street Institute, believes that right now, Congress is likely far from debating the finer details, and the tax credit is just one of those specifics.

Touted for its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, SAF is poised to transform air travel into a greener industry. Yet, its trajectory hasn’t been smooth—especially in the U.S., where economic policy during the Trump administration reshaped the outlook of the SAF market in unforeseen ways.

During his presidency, Donald Trump’s hardline approach to trade led to a sweeping tariff regime targeting China, the European Union, and other key trading partners. The goal was to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and reduce trade imbalances, but the ripple effects across various industries—particularly renewable energy and sustainable fuels—were significant.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel market, still in its developmental stages, faced heightened uncertainty, higher input costs, and disrupted global partnerships. In this article, we explore the multifaceted impact of Trump-era tariffs on the SAF landscape and how the market is working to regain its momentum in a post-tariff economy.

Rewriting the Rules: How Trump Tariffs Restructured the SAF Ecosystem

SAF production relies on a complex web of global supply chains. Equipment, feedstocks, and conversion technologies often span continents. When tariffs on raw materials like aluminum, steel, and refining machinery were imposed, SAF infrastructure projects in the U.S. saw cost overruns that derailed timelines and reduced investor confidence.

At the same time, tariffs on agricultural products like soybeans and corn—critical feedstocks for many SAF technologies—added volatility to input pricing. These policies created a domino effect: fewer investments, reduced R&D budgets, and a reluctance from airlines to commit to large-scale SAF procurement amid fluctuating prices.

Trade Wars Leave Deep Scars on SAF Development

Although the trade war officially cooled off near the end of Trump’s term, its economic aftershocks continue to shape SAF development today. In the early years of SAF commercialization, stability was crucial—yet the trade war fostered an environment of unpredictability.

Joint ventures with foreign companies suffered. U.S.-based SAF firms that relied on European biofuel tech found themselves blocked by tariffs and supply delays. Airlines that had announced pilot SAF programs postponed their rollouts due to rising costs and regulatory confusion.

As a result, the U.S. fell behind global peers. Europe, despite also being targeted by tariffs, surged ahead with strong regulatory support and an aggressive SAF adoption roadmap. The U.S., by contrast, entered a holding pattern.

Post-Tariff Adaptation: A Smarter, Stronger SAF Market?

With the Biden administration rolling back some of the most disruptive trade policies, the SAF industry is slowly finding its footing. One major pivot has been toward domestic resilience.

Companies have begun seeking U.S.-based alternatives for SAF feedstocks and processing equipment. There’s now a strong emphasis on innovation within national borders. This has led to the acceleration of new technologies that rely on waste oils, municipal waste, and non-food biomass—inputs less dependent on international trade.

This period of recalibration has also encouraged vertical integration. SAF producers increasingly want to control every stage of the value chain, from sourcing raw material to refining to distribution. It’s not just about green fuel anymore—it’s about ensuring security of supply.

The New Energy Independence: Can America Sustain Itself?

Trump’s vision of American self-sufficiency inadvertently sparked a shift in thinking within the SAF sector. While energy independence was historically associated with oil, it’s now equally relevant to sustainable fuel.

The U.S. has the resources—vast farmlands, innovation hubs, and engineering prowess—to become a leader in SAF. Success depends on sustained government incentives, cross-sector collaboration, and a clear national SAF strategy.

Federal programs like the SAF Grand Challenge aim to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030. But achieving this goal without international cooperation—particularly on technology and certification frameworks—remains a formidable task. Going it alone might yield limited progress.

Agricultural Turbulence: How Tariffs on Crops Shook the SAF Supply Chain

The trade war’s impact on agriculture cannot be overstated. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans caused exports to plummet. This led to gluts in domestic markets, causing soybean prices to crash temporarily—appearing to benefit SAF producers using soy-based fuels.

The instability proved harmful in the long run. Farmers scaled back production or shifted to other crops, making feedstock sourcing less predictable. Contracts for long-term SAF supply, which depend on feedstock price certainty, became harder to negotiate.

Beyond soy, corn, canola, and even used cooking oil faced similar challenges. The result was a fractured feedstock landscape that disrupted many SAF pilot projects and commercial scale-ups.

Financial Fallout: What the Trade War Cost the SAF Industry

SAF has always carried a green premium—it costs more to produce than fossil-based jet fuel. But the Trump administration’s tariffs amplified that gap. Construction of SAF plants became significantly more expensive due to tariffs on steel and advanced machinery.

In turn, this increased the price of the final product, making it harder to secure long-term contracts with airlines. Airlines, pressured by shareholders and passengers to go green, found themselves unable to meet their SAF goals without incurring unsustainable costs.

The government did step in with grants and subsidies, but the inconsistency of support—coupled with market instability—slowed down investor enthusiasm. Many early-stage SAF ventures went dormant, and those that survived had to scale back their ambitions.

Green Goals vs. Trade Walls: A Conflict of Priorities

While the trade war was rooted in economic nationalism, climate change is a global problem. In that sense, the Trump-era policies worked against international collaboration—an essential ingredient for accelerating SAF adoption.

The result? U.S. participation in international SAF efforts was weakened. The European Union doubled down on its Green Deal and continued developing SAF capacity. Asia-Pacific nations, like Japan and Singapore, increased investments in SAF refining capabilities.

This shift allowed other regions to pull ahead in the race for SAF dominance. The U.S., once a front-runner in clean tech, became a cautionary tale of how protectionism can backfire on sustainability goals.

Rebuilding Confidence: Evolving SAF Investment and Policy Post-Tariffs

Since the Trump administration ended, U.S. policy has taken a more pragmatic turn. The Biden administration has restored diplomatic ties and promoted SAF through legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act, which offers tax incentives to biofuel producers.

Private capital is also returning. SAF companies are now securing funding rounds again, and new public-private partnerships are being announced. Airlines have renewed their commitments, some even investing directly into SAF startups to lock in future supply.

Investors are now smarter—many build geopolitical risk into their financial models and prioritize projects with strong domestic foundations. The goal is no longer just profitability, but resilience in a shifting global landscape.

A Global Shake-Up: Who Benefited and Who Lost?

The U.S. retreat created opportunities for other nations. The EU strengthened its position as a global SAF leader. Countries like Finland and the Netherlands rapidly built refining capacity and developed export pipelines.

U.S. SAF producers, particularly small and medium enterprises, bore the brunt of uncertainty. Some merged, others downsized, and many shut down. But the ones that endured—often those with unique feedstock access or patented conversion processes—are now stronger for it.

The playing field has changed. Global SAF markets are less centralized, with multiple power centers emerging. For the U.S., the opportunity to lead is still alive, but it requires bridging past mistakes with forward-thinking strategy.

Protectionism’s Double-Edged Sword: A Legacy for SAF

While the Trump tariffs imposed hardships on SAF development, they also sparked new conversations around economic resilience, domestic innovation, and the fragility of global interdependence. The industry’s response—a shift toward diversified supply chains, domestic investment, and innovation—may ultimately prove beneficial.

The future of SAF in America now hinges on building partnerships that balance national interest with global cooperation. That includes streamlining federal policy, supporting scalable SAF technologies, and participating in global certification standards.

If the U.S. can balance trade policy with climate ambition, it still has the chance to lead a more sustainable future in aviation. The Trump-era tariffs were a shock—but one that forced the industry to grow, innovate, and adapt.",,N,,2025-04-09 10:56:38.939324

In the preliminary plan, the new hydrogen plant would have an electrolyser with a maximum capacity of 600MW. Implementation would take place in 2-3 phases.

In addition to hydrogen production, the company is exploring the possibility of producing methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (E-SAF) in Oulu.

The feasibility of synthetic fuel production depends on the availability of biogenic carbon dioxide.

ABO Energy would offer the waste heat generated for use as district heating in the Oulu region.

The first phase is planned to be operational around 2034-2036. For the new green transition industrial area of Pyyryväinen, the plant would be implemented by ABO Energy Suomi Oy, whose parent company is ABO Energy KGaA of Germany.

Amanda Cardwell of ABO Energy Suomi Oy said: ""Finland is an incredibly attractive destination for investment, thanks to our abundant, affordable green electricity and exceptional capacity to scale up production.

""Our unique strength as a company lies in our ability to supply renewable energy to hydrogen projects directly through our wind energy portfolio.""

Electricity in Finland is among the cheapest in Europe. The Oulu region is the largest producer of renewable electricity in Finland.

Several other hydrogen production and H2 derivative projects have already been initiated in the Oulu region.

Gasgrid Finland plans to establish a hydrogen transport infrastructure to connect Oulu's hydrogen production with the rest of Finland and other European countries, including Germany.

Other hydrogen production companies have also decided to invest in Oulu, attracted by the international port of Oulu, biogenic carbon dioxide sources and the European TEN-T transport network.

The University of Oulu is also a centre of hydrogen research, providing the city with both high-quality hydrogen expertise and a large pool of hydrogen specialists to meet companies' workforce needs.

There is no doubting that Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) has gone from strength to strength over the last decade as its route network has grown, passenger numbers have soared and it has earned itself a reputation for being one of the most innovative gateways in the United States.

It is also one of the most self-contained and sustainably run airports in the nation based on the fact that it is the only airport in the US to have its own microgrid, which provides 100% of its energy needs.

Launched in 2021, the microgrid is powered by five natural gas-fired generators with natural gas drilled from underneath the airport site and nearly 10,000 solar panels.

And true to its pioneering ways which have led to the airport establishing its own on-site innovation lab (xBridge) for developing, trialling, testing and launching new technology, and Neighborhood 91 – a 195-acre hub for additive manufacturing with goods produced on site shipped around the world – PIT is now looking at producing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the airport campus.

Producing and exporting SAF on-site at PIT

What’s the thinking behind PIT potential leading the way on SAF blending and production?

Christina Cassotis, who celebrated her 10th anniversary as CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport in January 2025, says: “Why not? The world needs it, we want aviation to be more sustainable, and we have the perfect mix of assets and resources to make it happen.

“We sit on 3,500 hectares of land, a lot of which is still open for development. We have pipelines to and from the Ohio River where we get our Jet A fuel, so we could export to the North East, New York, Boston, Washington and mid-Atlantic.

“We are surrounded by millions of acres of corn production in Pennsylvania and Ohio, so we can support our farmers by turning the corn into ethanol which becomes the jet fuel. We build things in Pittsburgh, so we can do it.”

The on-site production of SAF would also generate extra revenue for PIT that will help secure its future and help transition the industry to further reduce CO2 emissions. PIT is, of course, not going to invest its own money on building and operating a SAF refinery, so the undertaking would be in partnership with a third party.

“We didn’t want to run a utility like our microgrid and we don’t want to run a SAF refinery. We want to enable it, be a strategic landlord and benefit from the fuel being produced here,” confirms Cassotis.

There are several collaboration pathways the airport could go down when it comes to SAF production.

CNX, for example, which currently extracts natural gas from the airport site, is working with KeyState Energy to develop a hydrogen hub on the airport that would allow for the production of SAF from hydrogen made from coal mine methane.

PIT is also exploring the option of working with a European company that already has ASTM Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) biofuel in production and in use by the US Air Force elsewhere on the airport site.

If things go well, it is possible that construction of a SAF refinery at PIT could start as early as the end of 2026.

PIT’s transformation over the last decade

The airport’s SAF ambitions are very real, and as PIT has proved with creating its own microgrid and countless other pioneering initiatives over the last decade, if its plans make good business sense, they almost invariably happen.

After all, PIT’s reinvention under Cassotis over the last 10 years really is nothing short of remarkable, particularly when you consider that back then she noted that the airport had to adopt a new business plan and focus on a future as an O&D gateway to finally get over the loss of its status as a US Airways hub.

Innovation, in all its forms, appears to have been the key driver of PIT’s new business plan to make it a better and more efficient airport, less dependent on aviation related revenue, and a key economic generator for the city and region.

While the decision to let go of the idea of PIT regaining its hub status and concentrate on developing its O&D services has proved a masterstroke, with the airport accommodating 9.95 million passengers last year, the most since 2006, on the back of a much expanded route network.

Putting that in some kind of perspective, when Cassotis started at PIT, the airport had service to 37 non-stop destinations across the US and Canada and handled around eight million passengers per annum. Today, the figure stands at 62 non-stop routes and includes international long-haul routes to London (British Airways) and Reykjavik (Icelandair) in Europe as PIT boasts seven more airlines that it had in 2015.

So, reflecting on her 10 years at PIT, is it possible for Cassotis to say what the highs and lows have been during this time?

“That’s a hard one to answer as there’s been lots of a highs and quite a few lows as we’ve faced many obstacles over the years, but I would say putting Pittsburgh back on the global stage from a aviation perspective would be the highlight, as that was always the intention,” enthuses Cassotis.

She notes that passenger traffic has increased by nearly 25% since her arrival and will exceed 10 million in 2025, which it would have done last year if it wasn’t for a global IT outage that downed airline computer systems for 24 hours during the peak summer months.

Cassotis cites the success of getting Pittsburgh to believe and buy into her plan to develop PIT as an O&D gateway as the major turning point for the airport and catalyst for its current growth trajectory.

“I would say that my role has always been sales/business development, which started internally with getting people to believe that there were other ways we could be successful other than as a hub, which was the mindset when I got here,” she explains.

“Back then the community’s understanding of success was tied to regaining our hub status with an airline. So, getting the airport team and then the community to understand that an origin and destination airport could still be a very successful business model for PIT was a really big accomplishment.”

As an aside, Cassotis adds that Pittsburghers have always been fiercely proud and supportive of their airport, so much so in fact that she reveals that this enthusiasm led her to take the job in the first place.

Other achievements Cassotis is proud of PIT achieving in the first decade under her watch include the creation the microgrid, the opening of a childcare centre for airport staff and the new terminal which opens for business later this year.

New terminal

“Built by Pittsburgh for Pittsburgh”, PIT’s new terminal will open later this year – most likely in Q4 – and is expected to take operational efficiency and customer convenience and satisfaction to new levels.

The ongoing $1.57 billion new terminal programme is designed to improve facilities and create a new consolidated terminal that modernises outdated former hub facilities and just make it easier for passengers and staff to use.

What that effectively means is that PIT will get a terminal designed for today’s O&D driven market and not the long gone connecting travellers that accounted for 80% of all passengers when US Airways was the hub carrier.

Indeed, the de-hubbing of PIT left it with plenty of facilities that it just didn’t need any more, including eight miles of baggage belts built for transfer passengers that previously caught connecting flights across the airport campus.

O&D passengers now make up 97% of PIT’s passengers, so the airport simply needs new facilities that will make journeys easier, more convenient and comfortable for passengers and the airlines. Its opening will complement improvements to PIT’s existing ‘airside’ facilities (and eliminate the half-a-mile gap between the terminals) which contain the airport’s X-shaped central core, which according to Cassotis will be gutted and completely redesigned.

“The concourses are getting massive upgrades, the holdrooms, the back of the house and all the systems we couldn’t do preventative maintenance on before are being addressed now, so it’s a lot of fun out there right now,” jokes Cassotis.

According to PIT, the main goals of the new terminal programme include reducing passenger wait and walk times, shortening baggage delivery times, improving the international arrivals process, reducing operations and maintenance costs, providing more public parking spaces and making the airport more efficient and sustainable overall.

Some examples of the improved airport experience the new terminal will bring for passengers include one central security checkpoint instead of the existing two in different buildings, and separate levels for Arrivals and Departures.

It is hoped that the terminal will also end the current confusion passengers face on exiting the airport due to ongoing development work and the confusing layout of existing facilities that sometimes means that arriving passengers have to travel between different levels just to get outside.

In March, it was announced that the construction of the new terminal was 85% complete, ensuring that the facility is on target to open as planned in the second half of 2025.

Guided by the core principles of nature, technology and community, the key design features of the new terminal include:

Four new outdoor terraces – two accessible before security and two beyond.

Structural supports made to look like tree columns and leaf designs in the flooring, paying tribute to Western Pennsylvania’s foliage.

A 4,000 constellation ceiling lights installation, creating a night sky effect.

A new 5,000-space parking structure and roadway system.

The new terminal will have three levels: a commercial kerb on the first floor, an arrivals level on the second floor and a departures level on the third floor.

Technology woven seamlessly into the design concept to improve operations at security and baggage claim.

Prioritising enhancing the passenger experience through a range of design features, the new terminal’s Universal Access features include raised crosswalks with improved lighting, accessible-height ticketing counters, digital wayfinding that offers both visual and audio cues, intuitive layouts to simplify navigation, and outdoor spaces with biophilic design elements.

These enhancements are said to build on Pittsburgh International Airport’s established commitment to inclusivity, best illustrated by Presley’s Place – one of the USA’s first comprehensive sensory rooms designed for travellers with autism and other sensory sensitivities.

The airport believes that facilities like Presley’s Place signal what the future of air travel could look like with regards to being more welcoming and supportive for all passengers.

Cassotis has no doubt that the new terminal will usher in a new era for PIT in terms of operational efficiency, customer service levels and even people’s perceptions of the airport.

“It will be transformative,” enthuses Cassotis. “Every single part of our business will change. The equipment it will utilise will allow us to operate more efficiently and give us data that we never had before to make decisions and do predictive maintenance.

“The new terminal will allow us to do a better job of taking care of staff and passengers. Passengers will enjoy shorter walk times and be guided on their journeys by more intuitive wayfinding. It will be a much more pleasant experience.”

It will also be one of only a handful of airport terminals in the US to have outdoor terraces airside, which like its landside counterparts, will be accessible to all passengers.

Worthy of note is the fact that 16,000 tons of locally fabricated steel have been used in the terminal’s construction.

Energy efficient

The terminal itself is designed around using less energy for heating and cooling through the orientation of the terminal, strategic building overhangs and materials used in construction.

Like the rest of the airport, it will be powered by PIT’s microgrid, which means that the airport is 100% self sufficient in terms of energy supply and able to continue operating if the local grid goes down for whatever reason. On the reverse side of the coin, it also has the capability to switch to the traditional power grid if it experiences issues with its own microgrid.

An added bonus of the microgrid is that it has reduced PIT’s carbon emissions by six million pounds a year, and saved the airport around $1.5 million annually in utility costs.

Passenger growth, routes and destinations

As mentioned earlier, Pittsburgh International Airport handled 9.95 million passengers in 2024 – 8.1% more than the previous year and 166,000 passengers more than in pre-pandemic 2019.

The airport attributes the upturn, and first time it has exceeded pre-COVID levels, to a record number of Pittsburghers travelling through PIT, with over 9.7 million travellers recorded to have started or ended their trips in Pittsburgh last year.

It’s the highest origin-and-destination (O&D) figure in the airport’s history. What’s more, PIT’s international traffic surpassed 195,000 international passengers in 2024, a 30% increase from 2023, boosted by Icelandair launching seasonal service to Reykjavik, Iceland, in May and British Airways’ continued growth on its year-round service to London Heathrow.

And international travel in Pittsburgh is expected to grow again in 2025 as British Airways will upgrade frequency to London Heathrow to a daily service starting March 30, and Icelandair will resume its seasonal Reykjavik service a month earlier in 2025, with flights returning on April 17.

“Pittsburgh is a market that responds to the air service that comes in and gives it the passenger numbers that it needs, so we are constantly adding destinations or increasing frequency or aircraft capacity on existing ones,” enthuses Cassotis.

“When I got here, I looked at the map of destinations served from Pittsburgh and thought, wow, the West Coast is missing! That’s no longer the case today.”

In terms of the overall traffic, PIT’s increasingly diverse mix of domestic routes shows that the top airlines at the airport in terms of market share are Southwest (26%) and American Airlines (24%) – the former accommodating the most passengers and the latter the most daily flights – followed by Delta (18%); United (14%); and Spirit (12%).

When we last spoke in early 2016, Cassotis mentioned that she hoped that in five to ten years PIT would see the return of international flights to Europe and the introduction of a Gulf carrier to serve the Gulf region and beyond.

BA and Icelandair have, of course, now ticked the Europe box, but Cassotis is not overly celebrating as she feels that there is scope for more services, mentioning Germany and Amsterdam in the Netherlands as potential new routes. She is, however, still looking for a Gulf carrier.

Cassotis says: “I have not given up on a Gulf carrier as we believe that we can support traffic to the region because of our Indian market and the cargo potential of the route. As you know, it often takes years for a new route to happen, and we are playing the long game.”

Innovation and new technology

When talking about innovation and ‘smart airports’, Cassotis is quick to point out that it is about more than just technology, encompassing everything from inspiring new retail/F&B offerings and route development to the opening of a childcare centre for airport staff.

“Innovation certainly isn’t always tied to technology,” she notes. “In my opinion, the definition of innovation means doing something better than before, that it makes sense, and everybody benefits from it.”

Having said that, new technology that will aid airport operations as well as passenger journeys is certainly high on the agenda for PIT, which is perhaps not surprising considering Pittsburgh’s status as a technology centre and the robot capital of the world.

Indeed, Google, Bosch, Meta, Uber (driverless car testing), Intel and Yahoo are among thousands of technology firms based in the area and the city is home to 68 colleges and universities that include R&D leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.

For its part, PIT has helped bring some 30 technologies to an advanced stage at its xBridge innovation centre, located in a 10,000 square foot facility at the end of Concourse B.

One of these technologies is BioFlyte, a bio-aerosol surveillance sensor that can quickly detect and identify airborne pathogens and subsequently bio-terrorism threats such as ricin, anthrax and fentanyl in the air in less than five minutes.

One of these technologies is BioFlyte, a bio-aerosol surveillance sensor that can quickly detect and identify airborne pathogens and subsequently bio-terrorism threats such as ricin, anthrax and fentanyl in the air in less than five minutes.

During its proof of concept at PIT, Bioflyte’s BioTOF z200 sensor was installed in an HVAC mechanical room where it collected data on return air from the terminal. Additionally, BioFlyte tested simulations of threats at PIT to prove that the sensor can detect them.

It is currently deployed with the US Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and a Fortune 100 investment banking firm.

Other innovations include tested at PIT via xBridge include smart recycling bins (CleanRobotics’ TrashBot), autonomous wheelchairs (Blueberry Technology Inc’s BBGo), the technology to convert regular vehicles into remote controlled cars (Mapless AI), and autonomous robots used to clean floor (Carnegie Robotics) or deliver food and beverages to passengers (Ottonomy’s Ottobot).

Through xBridge the airport has a partnership with British Airways’ parent company IAG to assist it in some of the work and testing it is doing in the field of robotics.

While one of the more unusual successes of xBridge has been AlgenAir’s aerium, which harnesses the natural power of algae to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and produce oxygen (O2), combating indoor air pollution. Its first commercial-sized aerium currently sits in the baggage hall at PIT and has proved a welcome distraction for passengers waiting for their luggage.

PIT notes that the broad airport ecosystem enables innovations across many industries such as parking, logistics, retail, food and beverage, customer experience, security, sustainability, building management and more.

Talking specifically about xBridge, Cassotis says that it is “designed to embed innovation inside the airport, among its staff, companies and industry partners while maintaining a sense of Pittsburgh”.

Explaining a little more, she comments: “xBridge is a physical centre for innovation to test two things – materials, such as the paint on columns and flooring, and technology.

“On the technology side, instead of going to the robotics, AI and automation community here in Pittsburgh to say can you fix this, we have folks from xBridge who go into the start-up or robotics communities and ask them whether they’ve ever thought about using their technology in an airport. We then invite them to come to PIT and see what it can do.”

Away from technology, Cassotis believes that PIT’s sensory room and more recent opening of childcare centre for the children of airport staff are two of the most high profile ways that the airport has shown innovation in other areas.

The 1,500ft and now much copied sensory room, Presley’s Place, recently enjoyed its fifth anniversary, with Cassotis noting that it was actually the idea of PIT employee, Jason Rudge, who has an autistic son (Presley).

While the late 2023 opening of PIT’s very own childcare centre has arguably helped PIT hold on to staff and attract others to work at the airport who otherwise wouldn’t have considered it due to child care concerns.

PIT believes that providing a childcare option on the same site as an employee’s workplace helps strengthen parents’ work-life balance and supports workforce development. The goal, it says, is to break down barriers preventing working parents from starting careers at the airport.

Speaking at the facility’s opening, Cassotis said: “Being a working parent and dealing with childcare issues is huge stress. This is our contribution to getting more and more working parents, more and more peace of mind, as they build careers and build families.”

Industry leaders gathered to discuss pioneering technologies, including Open Fan engine architecture, which could revolutionise fuel efficiency and emissions reductions.

During the Summit’s Pioneering Technology for Future Aircraft session, Mohamed Ali, senior vice president and chief technology and operations officer at GE Aerospace, joined Frank Haselbach, senior vice president of propulsion engineering at Airbus, to explore the potential impact of Open Fan technology.

Ali highlighted the aviation industry's steady progress in engine efficiency over the decades. “If you reflect on it, our current newest engine at CFM, the CFM LEAP, is 15% better in fuel burn than its iconic predecessor, the CFM56 engine. And then the CFM56 on its own has been 15% to 20% better than its predecessor,” he said.

Despite these gains, the fundamental shape of commercial jet engines has remained relatively unchanged. As Haselbach pointed out, the industry faces a pivotal choice – either continue refining high-bypass-ratio ducted engines or pursue a bolder, more revolutionary approach: Open Fan architecture.

Open Fan technology removes the traditional engine casing, boosting bypass ratios and significantly improving efficiency. CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines, is spearheading Open Fan development through its Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) programme, aiming for a 20% improvement in fuel burn compared to current commercial engines.

Beyond its efficiency gains, Open Fan is designed to operate with alternative fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hybrid electric systems, further supporting aviation's drive towards sustainability.

The RISE programme has completed over 250 critical field tests, including extensive wind tunnel evaluations. “These supercomputers’ capabilities are unprecedented in the ability to simulate the future,” Ali said, praising computational modelling used in collaboration with Boeing, NASA, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Further tests continue, ensuring durability, vibration resistance, and alternative fuel compatibility. Airbus and CFM plan a joint demonstration flight later this decade, marking a significant step towards Open Fan’s commercial viability.",https://www.aero-mag.com/image-assets/1016e2de4a45355509923810b450038d.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 05:56:25.933612

No longer limited to futuristic imaginations, it is actively changing society, and bringing with it great opportunities to better address tomorrow’s global challenges.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has brought fundamental changes to how data is processed and analysed. Its speed and efficiency means using it can bring improvements to every industry. At Airbus, AI is not a new phenomenon – it's already being used internally to improve production, manufacturing and operational processes. It is also used in the software of some of our products, improving operational performance and safety.

A key area where AI has played a huge role at Airbus is in Earth observation. Airbus provides a range of satellite imagery services that help customers respond more effectively to natural disasters, monitor environmental changes such as deforestation, and maximise farming yields and fertilisation. AI improves these services as it enables data to be processed at incredible speeds, while leveraging machine-learning to fill in gaps in information and predict results. This enables real-time monitoring that would be impossible to do manually. It also enhances precision, reducing the likelihood of error.

AI is able to automate things like pattern recognition and predictive analysis, allowing it to detect anomalies immediately and without human oversight. These anomalies can then immediately be flagged for customers, allowing them to respond swiftly to emergencies or irregular changes, improving their decision-making capabilities and resource allocation. The AI is also powerful enough to run many algorithms in tandem, permitting it to scan for any need to activate a range of different emergency protocols.This results in a faster, more focused response.

In practical terms, there are several primary ways that AI-powered services improve satellite imagery results for our customers. Take a look at just a few of the highlights below.

Enhancing satellite imagery for better wildfire management

Climate change has made some environments around the world warmer and drier, which has increased both the frequency and burn area of wildfires. When it comes to firefighting, the ability to quickly detect, assess and respond to wildfires in real time is paramount. Pléiades Neo, Airbus’ Earth observation satellite constellation, provides key support to those fighting fires on the ground. Its high-resolution imagery of wildfires greatly enhances situational awareness for firefighters, allowing them to track the evolution of fires, predict their spread and identify safe evacuation routes. Its data can also be combined with that of other satellites to have a larger view of a situation at lower resolution.

The Pléiades Neo imagery is provided in 30 centimetre resolution, meaning one pixel of an image represents a 30 x 30 centimetre square of the planet. The utility of this extremely high-resolution imagery is taken a step further by the AI-powered software that is able to identify tiny changes and flag them for review. This allows our customers to react to new threats as quickly as possible, without waiting for them to become large enough to be detected by the naked eye.

Tracking deforestation from space

Deforestation is a significant contributor to climate change, and the supply chains of certain commodities – including palm oil, coffee, cocoa, rubber, pulp and paper, timber and soy – are known to be at risk of supporting illegal deforestation. Starling is a software programme founded by Airbus and the Earthworm Foundation to help companies combat deforestation and meet their responsible sourcing requirements.

Starling analyses high-resolution imagery from ESA’s Sentinel-2, NASA’s Landsat and Airbus’ Pléiades Neo satellite systems, and uses AI-powered algorithms to detect suspicious changes in forest cover and identify illegal deforestation. This is especially important as some, though not all, deforestation takes place in very remote areas far from human sight. Being able to identify damage in real time helps local law enforcement enforce policies against illegal logging as quickly as possible, supporting biodiversity and responsible land use.

Increasing harvest quality and yields

Farmstar is another Airbus product that uses AI-powered algorithms to improve farming productivity and yields for wheat, barley and rapeseed crops. Vegetation reflects sunlight differently depending on its development, which can be discerned in satellite imagery. This information is then processed by algorithms and combined with meteorological data to provide advice about soil conditions, crop health and environmental factors. These recommendations can then be used to help optimise farming practices, leading to increased yields and crop quality.

Farmstar supports precision fertilisation by tracking nitrogen levels. Its algorithm can then recommend where to add more fertiliser and where to withhold it. This is called automatic variable rate application, and it saves money for the farmer and reduces the amount of fertiliser used, reducing its environmental impact.

Farmstar can also support the growth of sustainable aviation fuels. It can optimise the yield of the crops used for SAF production, and find the right balance between crops to feed populations, crops to produce SAF and intermediate crops to absorb carbon emissions.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102215/664640-y5ld0j4c65-preview.jpg,N,,2025-04-09 05:56:44.755206

“Most developed countries have made limited progress in producing SAF due to lack of market demand and most aircraft are still manufactured to run on fossil fuels. It would be very expensive to modify existing aircraft engines to be compatible with SAF.”

The aviation minister explained that the sector’s agencies were working assiduously on initiatives to mitigate the effect of climate change.

Keyamo said some of the initiatives included production of Seasonal Climate Prediction by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) and participation in Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).

As a result, the carbon footprint for Lagos airport was reduced by six per cent in 2021 due to improved energy management, earning the airport a Level 2 ACA accreditation (Reduction), he stated.

Keyamo added that the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) was actively addressing climate change through initiatives, like the “Fly2Green Nigeria” programme to promote Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and collaborate with the National Council on Climate Change (NCCC) to facilitate cleaner aviation energy.

Chairman, House Committee on Climate Change, Honourable Chris Nkwonta, emphasised the financial burden of transitioning to greener aviation.

Nkwonta said the committee had discussed that with the United Nations, stressing the need for international support to help developing nations meet climate change targets.

He also stressed the need for conscious steps to decarbonise the sector as much as possible through the innovative use of less emitting fuels and carbon trade-offs; green infrastructure at the airports; sustainable waste management practices, among others.

Nkwonta called on airlines to invest in buying carbon credits to offset their carbon footprints, saying the funds from there can then be used to invest in more sustainable energy sources for the country and even in climate-smart agricultural practices that can help address food security issues.

🔌 PluggedIn: How Symphonic Capital is setting up pre-seed founders for success (video)

Sydney Thomas was working for an early stage venture capital firm when she noticed that some of the firm’s portfolio companies from unconventional backgrounds would get “lost in the sauce” when they went to raise follow-on rounds from investors. That led her to launch Symphonic Capital with former entrepreneur and Y Combinator alum Shruti Shah. The pre-seed venture firm invests in founders building solutions for underserved communities. “The thesis was, how are we investing in companies that are closing access gaps around health and wealth for overlooked communities?” Thomas told Sherrell Dorsey on this week’s PluggedIn. “A consistent theme that we saw was that climate intersects with both of these.”

Digital supply chain solutions can transform compliance challenges into a strategic advantage, helping brands build trust, enhance operational efficiency, and drive long-term profitability.","From global icons to mid-size businesses, today’s fashion and apparel brands are facing pressure to meet increasingly stringent environmental, social, and governance (ESG) requirements. Between the growing scrutiny from consumers to the watchful eyes of investors and regulators, the stakes have never been higher for companies to ensure ethical sourcing, environmental responsibility, and supply chain transparency.

With these challenges, however, comes opportunity: digital supply chain solutions are emerging as critical tools for mitigating ESG risks, maintaining compliance, and turning sustainability obstacles into competitive advantage.

Rising pressures: The ESG imperative in fashion supply chains

Under growing scrutiny from regulators and stakeholders, fashion brands face intensifying pressure to transform their operations and ensure full transparency in their supply chains.

Violations in environmental standards or an infringement of worker rights can quickly escalate into a reputational crisis, particularly when issues arise deep within supply chains. That said, gaining visibility into these areas continues to be a formidable challenge due to the fragmented nature of global supply chains and disconnected data systems.

For example, brands often struggle to track materials and processes across multiple geographies and supply chain layers. Without reliable insights, companies may be susceptible to serious losses due to supply chain disruptions. They also risk non-compliance with ESG mandates, financial penalties, and diminished consumer trust.

Challenges in capturing accurate ESG data

The challenges of ESG compliance often stem from fragmented systems and data silos, creating significant obstacles for companies striving to achieve transparency and accountability.

Fragmentation occurs when different systems are used to track disparate data points, such as materials, processes, facilities, and their social or environmental impacts. This disjointed approach makes it difficult to consolidate information into a unified framework.

Compounding this issue, data silos frequently arise when product-specific data is isolated from facility-level sustainability metrics. This isolation hampers the ability to generate comprehensive and accurate reports.

Regulatory uncertainty adds yet another layer of complexity. The rapidly evolving landscape demands that companies comply across all tiers of their supply chains, yet many lack the necessary tools to effectively capture and organize the required data.

This lack of centralized data and reporting practices only exacerbates these challenges, leaving brands unprepared to meet both current and future mandates.

Digital innovation for tackling ESG hurdles

An important first step is to adopt a digital supply chain platform and framework to ensure you can collect, interpret, and report on the data required. Digital supply chain solutions for fashion and apparel brands offer game-changing potential for addressing the above challenges head-on, providing the necessary tools to build transparent, compliant, and sustainable supply chains.

For example, real-time supply chain tracking that utilizes IoT sensors and AI-driven analytics can enhance visibility into every layer of the supply chain. These tools allow brands to closely monitor material origins, labor practices, and environmental impacts, ensuring a deeper understanding of supply chain dynamics.

Additionally, automated compliance management can play a crucial role in streamlining processes. With digital audit trails, supplier self-assessments, and AI-based risk assessments, brands can minimize human error and ensure adherence to regulatory requirements.

Data unification and interoperability can further address ESG challenges by enabling the consolidation of data from multiple sources into flexible, cloud-based systems. This capability allows for dynamic reporting and analysis, making it easier for brands to respond to evolving regulations.

Finally, AI-powered tools can also add an important layer of value by predicting potential ESG supply chain risks (financial or otherwise) and providing actionable insights to address issues before they escalate into full-blown reputational crises.

Future-proofing ESG: Flexible solutions for success

As regulations evolve, brands must adapt to meet both immediate and long-term ESG requirements. A dual approach can help.

In the short-term, it’s important to align with existing voluntary frameworks to help ensure compliance. These include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which provides standards for sustainability reporting, and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), which focuses on financially material ESG disclosures.

Longer term, brands should consider implementing modular, adaptable systems that can evolve alongside future regulatory changes and market demands.

Collaboration across the supply chain is equally important. Brands need to engage suppliers at all tiers, leveraging digital tools to simplify data collection and ensure accurate, consistent reporting. This not only strengthens compliance but also fosters stronger partnerships and operational efficiencies.

The path forward: Turning ESG challenges into strategic wins

Rather than looking at ESG compliance as a burden, brands should lean into it as an opportunity to differentiate themselves in a crowded market. Digital supply chain solutions can transform compliance challenges into a strategic advantage, helping brands build trust, enhance operational efficiency, and drive long-term profitability.

The future of fashion and apparel supply chains lies in digitization, transparency, and sustainability. By taking these steps today, companies can seamlessly navigate the challenges of ESG compliance and lead the way toward a more ethical and sustainable future.",https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/scn/image/2025/03/Generative_ART_AdobeStock_618444171.67c36055d827d.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-04-09 01:56:20.960019

Though aviation doesn’t account for a large portion of emissions, the increase in use of aviation globally has created a demand for sustainable aviation.
Aviation companies tend to mix bio fuels, hydrogen, and batteries, which are only viable for short flights.
Accountability has also created a barrier for the use of Sustainable Aviation, as there are no yet verdicts on large suits against Aviation Companies for unsustainable practices.
Without clear mandates or widespread market incentives, aviation companies have little reason to adopt these cleaner alternatives.","EcoAero had the opportunity to meet with Ethan Elkind, the director of the Climate Program at UC Berkeley Law School center for Law, Energy and the Environment. Mr. Elkind has recently started his research on law and energy use specifically in the aviation industry, as seen in his “Clean Take Off” Publication. He has started answering the questions of what legal tools does California use to require the use of sustainable aviation fuel and the incentives being put to use. The question of E-fuels, the combination of zero emission hydrogen with carbon capture, in aviation was a large part of Mr. Elkind’s Research as it looks to be a promising way to create a carbon neutral synthetic fossil fuel.

The Carbon Footprint of aviation is relatively small, about 2% globally and state wide. Though aviation doesn’t account for a large portion of emissions, the increase in use of aviation globally has created a demand for sustainable aviation. Contrails, the result of aviation, can magnify the effects of Greenhouse gasses. There is no ready, universal solution to limit the use of fossil fuels in aviation. Aviation companies tend to mix bio fuels, hydrogen, and batteries, which are only viable for short flights. The laws and policies on sustainable aviation are limited at this point and current solutions are just not enough so companies are looking towards solutions such as e-fuels.

It is not yet clear as to the economic value of e-fuels. E-fuel is essentially a synthetic petroleum molecule, carbon neutral with very limited emissions. In order for e-fuels to have a chance of success in the current market it would have to be cost competitive with other fuel sources such as jet fuel. The hydrogen and carbon capture required is extremely expensive and if there is excess wind or solar power, it would be more economical to store it for other uses. There is also no demand in the market right now thus companies have no incentive to spend four times the amount of money on sustainable fuel when it is not yet required by any law.

As for the legalities, there are no clear cut mandates for aviation companies to change the sustainability of their fuel and incentives are the only thing pushing the use of sustainable Aviation. The Federal Government has already stepped in the field and passed a series of laws, mostly in the 1970s, such as the Airline Deregulation Act which created a national market for Aviation in which states have no control over. The question remains, if California continues to challenge the use of sustainably in Aviation, will it be challenged and invalidated by Federal law?

Accountability has also created a barrier for the use of Sustainable Aviation, as there are no yet verdicts on large suits against Aviation Companies for unsustainable practices. Companies need to be held accountable in order for progress to be made in the field and it might take multiple decades for these suites to come to a final judgement. It is not clear yet where the money from the suits would be distributed if the cases were to render a guilty verdict.

The best way to fight the cost issue, Mr. Elkind states, is to get as much deployment as possible to bring the cost down over time. Reducing the cost of electrolyzers plays a huge part in this strategy.

In speaking with Ethan Elkind, we gained insight into the critical but complex intersection of aviation, sustainability, and legal policy. While the aviation sector currently contributes a relatively small portion of global emissions, its rapid growth and the amplified climate impact of byproducts like contrails make the need for sustainable alternatives increasingly urgent. Mr. Elkind’s research shines a light on promising technologies such as e-fuels — synthetic, carbon-neutral alternatives that may eventually offer viable replacements for conventional jet fuel. Yet as he made clear, significant legal, economic, and infrastructural challenges remain. Without clear mandates or widespread market incentives, aviation companies have little reason to adopt these cleaner alternatives. At EcoAero, we recognize that bridging this policy and innovation gap is essential. We will continue advocating for stronger legal frameworks and greater accountability while spotlighting emerging solutions like those Mr. Elkind studies — ensuring the path to cleaner aviation is not just imagined but actively pursued.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1030/1*kFtTEF7LjElWeqvKVvTFgg.jpeg,N,,2025-04-09 05:56:57.740436

A final investment decision on the company’s proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project is expected by year end.

Tidewater began commercial operations at its renewable diesel and renewable hydrogen (HDRD) complex during the final quarter of 2023. The HDRD complex achieved a daily throughput of 2,677 barrels per day during the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a utilization rate of 89%, up from 1,700 barrels per day, or 57%, during the same period of 2023.

For the full year 2024, Tidewater reported that significant improvements in throughput and reliability at the HDRD complex allowed the facility to achieve an average daily throughput of 2,643 barrels per day, equating to a utilization rate of 88%. The biorefinery has produced and sold more than 170 million liters (44.91 million gallons) of renewable diesel into the local British Columbia market since the facility began operations in November 2023.

Tidewater has proposed to develop 6,500 barrels per day of SAF capacity at the Prince George biorefinery. The company said it has continued to make meaningful progress on the front-end engineering design work for the proposed SAF project and expects to make a final investment decision during the second half of 2025.

Tidewater reported a fourth quarter net loss of $3.4 million, compared to a net loss of $12.7 million during the same period of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $6 million, down 44% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.

For the full year 2024, Tidewater reported a net loss of $357.8 million, compared to a net loss of $41 million for 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $74.5 million, up 62% when compared to the previous year.

During a fourth quarter earnings call, company officials discussed policy changes and company actions that aim to improve the Canadian market for renewable diesel. Tidewater, in late 2024 filed a countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping duty complaint with the Canada Boarder Services Agency. The complaint alleged that unfairly traded imports of renewable diesel from the U.S. were significantly undermining the Canadian industry. In response to that complaint, CBSA on March 6 announced it is initiating investigations into alleged dumping and subsidizing of renewable diesel from the U.S.

Tidewater has also spoken out in support of action taken by the government of British Columbia earlier this year to update the law governing its Low Carbon Fuels Standard. The updates will require eligible renewable fuels to be produced in Canada and boost the renewable content requirements for diesel.

“Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favour of renewable energy production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardised and transparent way.

The system allows the environmental benefits of SAF to be recorded as the fuel moves through the value chain, supporting airlines and corporate customers in claiming these benefits under regulatory frameworks and voluntary initiatives.

Now operated by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO), the Registry aims to create a standardised, transparent marketplace for SAF – helping airlines and corporate customers prove their environmental claims and meet climate-related goals.

By supporting accurate tracking of SAF transactions worldwide, the platform aims to accelerate the sector’s transition to net-zero emissions by 2050.

The Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply – which is acutely scarce and available in a few locations globally – by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. It gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalises on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.

The SAF Registry is designed to be technology- and feedstock-neutral, allowing for a range of SAF production methods. It can align with specific regulatory requirements while supporting efforts toward global harmonisation. The system is intended to be interoperable with other registries to promote competition and open markets.

The Registry was developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and suppliers, and corporate travel management companies. With over 30 early users already in the process of onboarding and ready to use the system, the Registry is underpinned by the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology which provides a consistent approach to accounting for the environmental benefits of SAF purchases, regardless of location.

“Aviation’s decarbonisation is a team effort,” says Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s chief economist and SVP of sustainability. “In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.

“It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain. The Registry will record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases in an immutable way, safeguarding against double counting.

“Airlines, their corporate customers, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and all related organisations will be able to record and account for their SAF transactions in a global market for SAF.

“While this is of fundamental importance and a historically momentous advance, it is but one step along the way to a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. The Registry cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production,” says Thomsen. “Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favour of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay.”

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost recovery basis.",https://i0.wp.com/gadget.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Gemini_Generated_Image_xtxqg6xtxqg6xtxq.jpg?resize=1000%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-08 22:56:54.110607

The deal had two parts. First in his capacity of an adviser to the U.K. government, Carney has helped push for a new British regulation to use 10 per cent biofuel in jet planes. Second, Carney’s company Brookfield made a $1-billion investment in a biofuel company.

“Mr. Carney is not a businessman,” Poilievre said in Edmonton on Tuesday. “He is a political grifter who has used his political influence to turn decisions that profit his company at the expense of workers and seniors — and that is exactly how he would govern the country.”

Article content

Carney brought up the jet fuel deal at the Prime Quadrant conference — billed as a place to reach 400 “ultra high net worth investors” — in December 2024. At the time, Carney was both an official economic adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and also chairman and head of impact investing for Brookfield.

Carney used the jet fuel deal as an example of how government policy can drive investment into net-zero businesses.

He told his interviewer that he gave free advice to politicians. “I do spend some time advising on what, you know, again, pro bono, but advising on the types of policies that are going to have maximum impacts for investors.”

He then pointed to air travel causing two per cent of global carbon emissions. “So the question is, ‘Are we going to have green, sustainable aviation fuel?’ What’s happened in the U.K., the EU, is they’ve said to major airlines, ‘Look, if you’re flying in and out of Heathrow or wherever, you have to have 10 per cent of your load, it has to be sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.'”

As a consequence of this policy, Carney said the biofuel produced by a Texas company suddenly became economic. Airline companies like American Airlines and British Airways had to purchase this more expensive fuel. “They’ll pay a green premium,” Carney said. “In that case, we put, Brookfield, put a billion dollars to work there (investing in the biofuel company). And, you know, it’s a fantastic opportunity. The point being, the policy has to drive it and drive things down.”

I asked Poilievre about this jet fuel deal. He was in Edmonton for a political rally, then took questions from the media at a Tire Town outlet, standing before a group of shop workers.

“It’s crony capitalism,” Poilievre said, “It works against these people behind me.”

He gestured at Tire Town workers, then unpacked what Carney had said and done. “In this particular case he used his political power to convince the British government to require more expensive jet fuel for air travel, and then he invested, his company invested, a billion dollars in the company that was selling that jet fuel. So, if God forbid, a family like the people behind me here want to take their kids on a vacation somewhere, they have to pay higher airplane ticket prices to fund this more expensive jet fuel so that Mark Carney’s billion-dollar investment can pay off.”

Poilievre concluded his critique. “Mark Carney has been getting rich by making the working class poor.”

Of course business leaders often lobby government leaders. But Carney’s relationship was more than lobbying, it was working closely with government on policy, sometimes as a formal adviser.

Of course Carney will say the carbon policies he pushed and/or is now still pushing — from consumer carbon taxes to biofuel mandates, from carbon emissions caps on the oil and gas industry to carbon tariffs on imported products — are hugely beneficial when it comes to dealing with global warming.

That may or may not be true. I have major doubts given how hesitant progressive left elites have been to embrace the best way to lower emissions, namely building out nuclear power and replacing coal burning with lower emissions LNG exports.

It’s also fair to ask at a time when the world’s economic tigers, from the U.S. to China to India, are producing and securing as much fossil fuel energy as they can, and when numerous top Western financial institutions are backing away from Carney’s net-zero regulatory scheme, if it’s wise for Canada to now go all-in on iffy policies that have done well for Carney and Brookfield but have driven up costs for struggling Canadian families.

CTP’s unique approach involves working closely with corporate partners to identify and support technology solutions tailored to aviation needs.

Qantas and Airbus’ collaboration with CTP will help stimulate technological advancements in SAF, particularly in Australia, through a dedicated investment vehicle. It will focus on technologies for SAF production, feedstock development and other value-chain innovations and will sit alongside Climate Tech Partner’s main fund. CTP will leverage the diverse skills and knowledge base of its group of 12 partners – made up of leaders in industries ranging from energy generation to infrastructure – to provide mentorship and strategic guidance to enable further collaboration.

This initiative will help bridge the gap that Qantas and Airbus have identified between early-stage climate technologies and at-scale commercial production in Australia. Through this partnership, CTP will invest on behalf of Qantas and Airbus into leading local and global start-ups focused on SAF and other innovative technologies. As these solutions mature, Qantas and Airbus have the option to explore further follow-on and direct investments enabling deployment of the start-up’s technologies in real-world Australian projects. The investment will be made from Qantas and Airbus’ US$200 million partnership which was established in 2022 to help accelerate SAF production.

Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher said: “Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors – from airlines, manufacturers and airports to regulators, governments and investors. This partnership with CTP and Qantas highlights that the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs innovative solutions for a nascent technology that will drive innovation, attract investment and create new jobs in Australia, which I believe is well positioned to be a leader in low carbon fuels. At Airbus, we are honoured to be partnering with Qantas and now CTP to transform aviation for the long term.”

Qantas Group Chief Sustainability Officer Fiona Messent said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool we have to decarbonise aviation and, with Airbus, we’re investing significantly in ways to make it more available and accessible. As well as funding, this partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated in the SAF supply chain, while also providing companies with access to Qantas and Airbus as they develop and test their solutions. For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit, so it’s fantastic to be collaborating across industries to help accelerate local production.”

Patrick Sieb, Co-Founder, CTP said: “Working with global leading aviation and aerospace companies allows us to not only make more deeply informed investment decisions in this complex area but attract and support the best companies by helping them accelerate through industry engagement.”

Climate Tech Partners specialises in investing in globally scalable technology solutions, primarily at the Series A stage, across the Energy & Power, Transport & Logistics, and Industrials & Resources sectors.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel market is now ready for takeoff—wiser, tougher, and more determined than ever.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely recognized as a cornerstone in reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. With global carbon neutrality goals intensifying, SAF has drawn increasing support from regulators, airlines, and investors. The path to scaling SAF has faced major roadblocks, none more significant than the economic ripple effects of the Trump-era trade war.

The trade conflict, characterized by aggressive tariff regimes aimed at key international partners such as China and the EU, affected nearly every major industry, and SAF was no exception. From feedstock pricing volatility to industrial equipment shortages, the impact on SAF development was substantial. This article explores how the Trump administration’s trade war shaped the SAF market, caused policy shifts, altered global competitiveness, and spurred new innovations amid the chaos.

How Trump’s Tariffs Altered the SAF Supply Chain

Sustainable Aviation Fuel relies on a complex international supply chain involving feedstocks like soybean oil, used cooking oil, animal fats, and agricultural waste. Many of these are processed using imported equipment and technologies, particularly from Europe and Asia. The tariffs imposed on aluminum, steel, and high-tech machinery led to higher costs for infrastructure development. Simultaneously, tariffs on agricultural imports and exports destabilized feedstock sourcing.

The result was that SAF producers faced higher capital costs, unpredictable feedstock pricing, and regulatory uncertainty. Infrastructure build-outs slowed, research investments contracted, and airlines hesitated to commit to SAF procurement due to unstable supply and inflated prices.

SAF Cost Volatility and Investment Withdrawal

The early-stage nature of SAF commercialization meant the industry was particularly vulnerable to price shocks. With production already more expensive than conventional jet fuel, additional costs from tariffs made SAF an even tougher sell. Airlines that had pledged to reduce their carbon emissions by integrating SAF into their fuel mix were forced to delay or renegotiate contracts.

Venture capital and private equity investments in biofuel startups also saw a decline during the peak years of the trade war. The uncertainty over equipment tariffs and export restrictions created risk factors that discouraged funding. As a result, many SAF projects either scaled back or stalled entirely.

Agricultural Sector Instability and Feedstock Scarcity

A major, often overlooked aspect of the trade war was its impact on U.S. agriculture. China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans, corn, and other crops disrupted export flows, leading to domestic surpluses and price crashes. While this initially appeared beneficial for SAF producers relying on these feedstocks, the long-term result was lower crop yields, a shift in farmer priorities, and reduced agricultural resilience.

This feedstock uncertainty undermined planning for long-term SAF contracts, complicating the economic modeling needed for large-scale facility investments. Tariffs on imported feedstocks from countries like Argentina and Brazil further limited options for producers.

Policy Paralysis and Regulatory Delay

The Trump administration focused heavily on deregulation and promoting fossil fuels, often at the expense of renewable energy programs. SAF, still an emerging technology at the time, received limited direct support. Without robust federal incentives or a clear regulatory framework, SAF producers were left navigating a high-cost environment without a clear pathway to scale.

This policy vacuum delayed progress on SAF mandates, blending requirements, and infrastructure funding. By contrast, the European Union advanced its SAF roadmap through mandates like ReFuelEU, widening the transatlantic gap in sustainable aviation readiness.

International Competition and Global Market Shifts

While U.S. companies struggled under the weight of protectionist trade policies, international competitors accelerated SAF production. Finland, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the UK leveraged government support and favorable trade policies to attract investment and build SAF refining capacity.

As a result, Europe and Asia-Pacific began exporting SAF to global carriers, securing long-term contracts with international airlines. U.S.-based producers, constrained by tariffs and lacking scale, missed out on these early opportunities. This shift not only reduced U.S. market share but also signaled a broader decline in American leadership in green aviation technology.

The Turnaround: Post-Tariff Recovery and Strategic Resilience

Since the end of Trump’s presidency, the Biden administration has sought to reverse many of the economic barriers faced by the SAF industry. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 included significant tax credits and incentives for low-carbon fuel production. These measures helped rejuvenate investor interest and sparked new SAF initiatives across the U.S.

In response to past supply chain disruptions, SAF companies are now prioritizing domestic resilience. Many have started to localize supply chains, develop non-agricultural feedstock alternatives like municipal solid waste and algae, and integrate vertically to minimize reliance on foreign equipment.

Lessons Learned: Balancing Trade, Security, and Climate

The Trump-era trade policies served as a wake-up call for the SAF sector. While the intention was to boost domestic industries, the ripple effects proved that trade isolation can hinder innovation, disrupt green goals, and weaken global competitiveness.

Policymakers today must strike a balance between protecting national interests and fostering international collaboration. SAF, by its nature, is a globally interconnected industry. Harmonizing regulatory standards, facilitating cross-border tech transfer, and maintaining open supply chains will be essential for its success.

A Stronger, Smarter SAF Industry Ahead

Despite the setbacks of the Trump-era tariffs, the SAF market has demonstrated remarkable resilience. What once seemed like insurmountable challenges have sparked innovation, localization, and strategic partnerships. The U.S. may have lost ground temporarily, but the lessons learned have laid the foundation for a more self-sufficient, stable, and forward-thinking SAF industry.

With continued policy support, investment, and international alignment, SAF will remain a critical pillar of sustainable aviation. The turbulence of the trade war has passed, but its legacy will inform the next generation of clean fuel strategies and supply chain design.

Nigeria’s Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Mr Festus Keyamo, said on Tuesday that the federal government is investing in sustainable aviation infrastructure. He spoke during a visit from the House Committee on Aviation at his Abuja office.

Keyamo stressed the need to cut the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. He noted Nigeria’s alignment with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) “Leave No Country Behind” project, ensuring the country keeps pace with developed nations in this shift.

Though Nigeria contributed just 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions in 2015, Keyamo highlighted challenges. “As a third-world country, we face major limitations in investing in infrastructure and research for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), even though it is part of our mandate,” he said.

He added that developed countries also struggle with SAF production due to low demand, and most aircraft still rely on fossil fuels. “It would be very expensive to modify existing aircraft engines to be compatible with SAF,” he explained.

He praised ongoing efforts. “All the aviation agencies are working assiduously on initiatives to mitigate the impact of climate change,” Keyamo said. These include the Nigerian Meteorological Agency’s (NiMet) Seasonal Climate Predictions and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria’s (FAAN) Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme.

“As a result of this, the carbon footprint for Lagos airport was reduced by 6% in 2021 due to improved energy management, earning the airport a Level 2 ACA accreditation (Reduction),” he added.

Hon Chris Nkwonta, Chairman of the House Committee on Climate Change, raised funding concerns. He said talks with the United Nations underscored the need for global support to help developing nations meet climate goals.

As business aviation operators strive for greater sustainability while maintaining operational efficiency, the complexity of evolving regulations presents both challenges and opportunities. To navigate this rapidly changing landscape, digitalization is emerging as a crucial tool for ensuring compliance and boosting operational efficiency.

New Sustainability Regulations for 2025

Several significant regulatory changes have come into effect in 2025, shaping the future of sustainability in business aviation. In the UK, the government implemented its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate on January 1, requiring all jet fuel supplied in the country to contain at least 2% SAF. While this marks a significant step in reducing fossil fuel emissions, it also creates financial challenges for operators. Aircraft owners and charter companies will need to invest in SAF at a higher cost while waiting for production scales to increase, creating an opportunity for technology to alleviate these financial pressures.

In Europe, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has introduced mandates for emissions tracking and transparency. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), effective from January 1, 2025, requires reporting on non-CO₂ emissions. Additionally, the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will be mandatory starting in 2026. These measures call for business aviation operators to invest in emissions tracking systems and enhance their reporting capabilities to meet these new environmental standards.

In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted new regulations for companies to disclose their environmental footprint, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Corporate flight departments and aircraft managers will need to implement systems that track emissions accurately. These disclosures will start in 2026, covering Fiscal Year 2025. Additionally, the U.S. has introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC), incentivizing SAF production based on emission reductions, which could make SAF more cost-effective and widely available for business aviation operators over time.

The Need for Digital Solutions in Business Aviation

As regulatory requirements continue to evolve, business aviation companies must stay agile. Digitalization is playing a pivotal role in managing these complexities, especially with the increasing need for emissions tracking and environmental reporting.

Introducing digital document management systems can streamline compliance with evolving regulations. Traditional paper-based systems can overwhelm operators with hundreds of pages of data, making it difficult to stay up to date. A digital solution consolidates all information into one accessible platform, automatically updating regulatory changes and flagging necessary actions for operators.

The use of large language models (LLM) in aviation documentation further enhances efficiency. With AI, users can easily query and receive detailed explanations about new regulations, saving valuable time spent searching for relevant information and improving compliance.

We examine the economic ripple effects, challenges faced by stakeholders, evolving policy landscapes, and what the future holds for SAF in a post-tariff world. By analyzing multiple angles—feedstock supply chains, global competition, investment climates, and policy shifts—we provide a holistic view of the intersection between trade policy and sustainable innovation.

How Trump-Era Tariffs Are Reshaping the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market

The Trump administration’s aggressive tariff strategy—aimed at rebalancing trade deficits and protecting domestic industries—had unintended consequences for the renewable energy sector. Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which depends on a complex network of global supply chains, was particularly vulnerable.

Tariffs on aluminum, steel, and industrial machinery increased the cost of building and operating SAF production facilities. Even more critically, tariffs on agricultural products disrupted feedstock supply chains. Corn, soybeans, and used cooking oil—common SAF feedstocks—saw pricing volatility that discouraged producers from scaling operations. Import restrictions also made it harder for U.S. companies to access advanced refining equipment and bioconversion technologies developed in Europe and Asia.

The uncertainty surrounding ongoing trade negotiations made investors hesitant. Many feared that new policies could make foreign partnerships less viable or affect raw material availability, leading to project delays or cancellations.

The Trump Trade War and Its Lasting Impact on Sustainable Aviation Fuel Development

The impact of the Trump-era trade war has extended well beyond the immediate economic shockwaves. While some sectors have since recovered, the SAF market continues to feel the long-term effects of disrupted growth.

Many SAF producers were in nascent stages of development during the tariff period. The sudden increase in capital expenditure due to tariffs and counter-tariffs on machinery, chemical catalysts, and feedstock materials deterred early adopters. Several joint ventures between U.S. firms and European partners were either paused or restructured, reflecting a new level of geopolitical risk factored into sustainability strategies.

These delays pushed back SAF certification efforts, slowed down commercialization timelines, and reduced the confidence of airline operators who were eager to secure green fuel contracts. As a result, the U.S. lagged behind Europe in SAF readiness, even as global mandates like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) loomed on the horizon.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel in a Post-Tariff World: Lessons from the Trump Trade War

As the dust begins to settle from the trade war, stakeholders across the SAF value chain are applying hard-earned lessons. Chief among them is the importance of diversification—not only of feedstock types but also of supply sources and geopolitical risk exposure.

Many producers have begun sourcing feedstocks domestically to avoid future tariff exposure, which in turn is reviving interest in U.S. agriculture-based fuel solutions. There is also a renewed emphasis on vertical integration, where companies aim to control both feedstock supply and fuel refining processes to buffer against international disruptions.

Innovation in SAF technology has accelerated in part due to this shift. Emerging feedstocks such as municipal solid waste, algae, and forest residues are gaining traction, as they offer less exposure to trade volatility and fewer conflicts with food supply chains. Furthermore, domestic collaborations are being prioritized over international joint ventures, reflecting a cautious shift in partnership strategy.

Can the U.S. Achieve Energy Independence in SAF Amid Trade Barriers?

One of the unexpected outcomes of the Trump administration’s protectionist policies was a renewed call for energy independence—not just in fossil fuels, but also in renewable alternatives. For the SAF sector, this raises an intriguing question: Can the U.S. truly produce enough sustainable aviation fuel domestically to meet future demand?

The short answer is: not yet, but it’s within reach. The U.S. has vast agricultural resources that can be leveraged for SAF production. Scaling production will require investment in biorefineries, government subsidies, and a coordinated policy framework. Programs like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Department of Energy’s SAF Grand Challenge have stepped in to bridge this gap.

Still, challenges remain. Building a fully domestic SAF ecosystem requires overcoming logistical hurdles, technological scaling, and regulatory compliance. Without international collaboration—particularly in technology exchange and best practices—the U.S. risks siloing its SAF development, which may limit innovation and delay decarbonization goals.

From Soybeans to SAF: How Tariffs on Agricultural Products Disrupted Biofuel Supply Chains

The Trump tariffs notably targeted agricultural exports and imports, particularly from China. Soybeans, one of the most important feedstocks for biofuel, were caught in the crossfire. As China retaliated with its own tariffs, American soybean farmers faced surplus inventories and falling prices.

While this initially seemed beneficial for domestic SAF producers—lower prices meant cheaper feedstock—the longer-term impact was more damaging. Farmers shifted away from soybean cultivation, disrupting future supply reliability. The uncertainty discouraged long-term contracts, a crucial element for SAF production planning.

Other feedstocks like corn stover and used cooking oil also faced price fluctuations due to altered trade dynamics. This volatility made it difficult for SAF producers to establish stable supply chains, impacting both pricing models and production timelines.

The Cost of Going Green: Economic Burden of Trump Tariffs on the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Sector

Producing SAF is already more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Adding trade tariffs on essential components like feedstocks, refining technology, and infrastructure only widened the cost gap. Trump-era tariffs on steel and machinery, for instance, raised capital expenditure costs for SAF plant construction by an estimated 10–20%.

These cost increases trickled down the value chain, leading to higher per-gallon SAF prices. Airlines, already operating on razor-thin margins, were hesitant to commit to long-term SAF contracts at premium prices. This created a vicious cycle where producers couldn’t scale without demand, and demand wouldn’t materialize without price parity.

Even as government subsidies helped buffer some of the financial strain, the policy uncertainty introduced by trade wars made long-term financial planning a challenge. Investors, too, pulled back from large-scale SAF projects, instead favoring lower-risk renewable energy ventures.

Global Trade Wars vs. Green Aviation Goals: Who Wins?

The core conflict here lies between protectionist economic policies and global environmental mandates. Trade wars by nature disrupt international cooperation, while climate change is a global issue requiring cross-border collaboration. When Trump-era tariffs disrupted the flow of sustainable technologies, feedstocks, and capital, it posed a serious setback for climate-aligned aviation goals.

International SAF initiatives, such as those driven by ICAO and the EU, had to adapt without U.S. leadership. Countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands accelerated their own SAF production plans, capturing market share and technical leadership in the process. Meanwhile, the U.S. temporarily lost its competitive edge.

In the long run, the trade war served as a cautionary tale: nationalistic policies may serve domestic industries in the short term, but they can undermine global progress in sustainability. To meet 2030 and 2050 climate targets, the SAF market needs more collaboration, not less.

Tariff Aftershocks: How SAF Policy and Investment Strategies Are Evolving in the U.S.

In the aftermath of the trade war, U.S. policy toward SAF has undergone a significant shift. The Biden administration has moved away from unilateral tariffs and instead promoted multilateral climate cooperation. The Inflation Reduction Act provides SAF-specific tax credits, while the Federal Aviation Administration is actively funding SAF R&D.

Investment is also bouncing back. Venture capital and institutional investors are increasingly interested in SAF startups, especially those focusing on novel feedstocks and modular refining units. Many investment strategies now include clauses that protect against geopolitical risks, and some funds have even created SAF-specific portfolios.

Airlines are becoming more proactive. United, Delta, and American Airlines have all signed SAF purchase agreements and invested in domestic SAF startups. These moves signal a growing confidence that the market has stabilized and that the U.S. is serious about achieving long-term SAF scalability.

Trump Tariffs and the Global SAF Market: Winners, Losers, and the Road Ahead

During the height of the trade war, several international players stepped in to fill the void left by the U.S. retreat. European nations continued to lead in SAF policy innovation, while Asian countries like Japan and Singapore made strategic investments in bio-refineries.

Many smaller SAF firms in the U.S. struggled to survive the uncertainty. The lack of clear policy direction combined with increased costs made it difficult to secure funding. This period also led to a shakeout, where only the most resilient and innovative firms survived.

As tariffs gradually ease and new trade agreements are negotiated, the global SAF market is realigning. There's renewed interest in transatlantic collaboration, and SAF hubs are emerging in California, Texas, and the Midwest. The road ahead will require balancing national interests with international cooperation to ensure that the aviation sector can truly decarbonize.

How Protectionism Shaped the Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in America

Ultimately, the Trump trade war served as a stress test for the SAF industry. While the short-term effects were damaging—higher costs, reduced investment, and policy fragmentation—the long-term impact has been more nuanced. The industry has emerged more resilient, more domestically focused, and more aware of the geopolitical factors that can influence its growth.

Protectionism inadvertently sparked a conversation about the importance of domestic supply chains, technological independence, and energy sovereignty. These conversations are now driving policy and investment decisions that could shape the future of green aviation in America for decades to come.

If the U.S. can learn from past mistakes and adopt a balanced approach to trade and sustainability, it still has a chance to lead the global SAF revolution.

With €2.3 million ($2.5 million) in pre-seed funding and grants of around €300,000 ($324,000), Spark e-Fuels may soon bring sustainable air travel closer.

As Climate Insider reported, the Berlin-based company has developed proprietary e-fuel technology that optimizes how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is produced.

According to the United States Department of Energy, SAF is a synthetic fuel created from ""non-petroleum feedstocks."" While SAF still produces planet-warming pollution when burned, the DoE noted that compared to conventional jet fuel, it can reduce emissions by 94%.

However, it still requires a lot of energy to create, which is why more efficient processes that don't rely on dirty fuels are needed.

While renewable energy sources like wind and solar are cheaper and more accessible than ever, their intermittent availability makes it tough to produce SAF at scale — something Spark's system is designed to overcome. The company plans to test the tech in its first e-fuel pilot plant soon.

""For sustainable aviation fuel to become the industry standard, production must be both scalable and cost-competitive,"" Mathias Bösl, CEO and co-founder of Spark e-Fuels, told Climate Insider. ""Our technology unlocks this potential by integrating renewable energy in a demand-responsive way.""

This could be a huge win for both travelers and the planet. If SAF can be produced at scale reliably and affordably, it would help airlines to cut pollution, lower transportation costs, and improve air quality for surrounding communities.

""We were drawn to Spark's ability to integrate renewable energy into chemical production in a demand-responsive way,"" said Isabella Fandrych, General Partner at Nucleus Capital, one of the investors. ""This approach is not only essential for SAF but has wider applications across the chemical industry, which must decarbonize rapidly.""

There's growing momentum behind clean fuels as aviation works to reduce its climate footprint — it's a $50 billion market. SAF is expected to make up less than 0.7% of total jet fuel production in 2025, but companies like Spark could help ramp that up. Plus, Spark's technology will also aid the green energy transition in the overall chemical industry.

More and more companies are moving toward innovative clean energy solutions, such as Walmart putting EV charging stations at hundreds of stores and European energy companies working to reduce carbon pollution.

The initiative aims to create a standardized global market for SAF, facilitating transparent transactions and promoting adoption. The platform is now live, with over 30 early users onboard, including airlines, fuel producers, government entities, and corporate travel management companies.

Fuel remains the largest source of emissions in the aviation sector. SAF, derived from sources such as waste oils and agricultural residues, has the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85% compared to conventional jet fuel. However, widespread adoption is constrained by limited supply and high costs. IATA estimates SAF production reached 1 million tonnes in 2024—equivalent to 1.3 billion liters—doubling 2023 volumes but still accounting for just 0.3% of global jet fuel output.

The SAF Registry seeks to address supply challenges by enabling stakeholders to transparently track SAF transactions and their environmental attributes across the value chain. It allows airlines and corporate customers to claim environmental benefits under regulatory frameworks and voluntary sustainability programs, preventing double counting of emissions reductions.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort. With the launch of the SAF Registry, we have provided a critical platform that ensures all airlines can access SAF and claim their purchases against climate-related obligations,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The Registry operates as a global system for standardized SAF transaction recording. It is technology- and feedstock-neutral, encouraging diverse SAF production pathways worldwide. By decoupling SAF attributes from physical location, the platform allows airlines to access fuel benefits regardless of where the SAF is physically uplifted, improving accessibility and usability.

“While this is a significant and historic advance, it is just one step toward a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. The Registry alone cannot create miracles, but without it, no miracles are possible,” Thomsen added.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free of charge until April 2027, after which it will transition to a cost-recovery operational model. The platform is designed for interoperability with other registries, fostering competition and integration across markets.

“The Registry addresses the critical challenge of limited SAF supply — scarce and geographically concentrated — by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers globally. It also enables corporate customers to access in-sector emissions reductions, leveraging their ability to co-finance decarbonization costs,” IATA stated.

IATA stressed the need for strong policy intervention to advance SAF adoption further. “Progress requires active policy support to scale up renewable energy production, including SAF. Governments must redirect subsidies from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The successes of the wind and solar energy markets provide a blueprint, and we must act without delay,” Thomsen concluded.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-04/IATA%20Launches%20SAF%20Registry%20for%20Global%20Fuel%20Transparency.jpg?h=9e53bbac&itok=2RcmGA22,N,,2025-04-08 15:56:34.654330

This annual event is the preeminent conference for sharing best practices about airport planning, terminal technologies, and improving passenger experience. It’s a window into the technologies and trends that will shape the airport of the future. It’s also an opportunity to learn about the challenges and pressures facing airport executives as they work to build a more seamless and streamlined airport experience for the world’s ever-increasing population of air travelers.

This year’s event comes at an incredibly important time in the commercial aviation industry – when rising passenger numbers, labor shortages, and new technologies are coming together to drive massive innovation in today’s modern airports.

We were recently joined by Anthony James, editor of PT World, the official publication of PTE 2025, to learn more about the trends and technologies that will be on display at this year’s event.

Connected Aviation Today (CAT): With PTE 2025 on the horizon, what would you say are the largest challenges facing modern airports?

Anthony James: I recently sat down with experts at airports and aviation authorities responsible for airport master planning, and they suggested that it’s no longer enough for airports to only consider how best to expand their capacity to meet future passenger growth.

Today, airports need to give careful consideration and planning towards sustainability, climate resilience, and fuel and energy infrastructure while also increasing digitalization and minimizing exposure to cyberattacks. They need to think about all these critical challenges while also dealing with an ever-increasing number of passengers.

CAT: What are the technologies that airports are embracing to help overcome these challenges? How far along are global airports in the adoption of these technologies?

Anthony James: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one area that all airports are currently exploring to help them become more efficient and improve their operations. In so doing, they will also improve the passenger experience.

“There is a strong vision and desire across airports and the larger commercial aviation industry for a fully automated, contactless, seamless passenger journey.” – Anthony James

There are numerous recent examples of airports embracing AI. Airports are exploring AI tools and solutions to minimize aircraft turnaround and detect foreign object debris on the runway. They’re also using AI chatbots to improve customer service. AI can also help speed security screening, while biometrics will help to speed border clearance.

CAT: There are numerous sessions and panel discussions planned for PTE 2025 around the “Future Airport.” What does the airport of the future look like? How is it different from what we have today?

Anthony James: There is a strong vision and desire across airports and the larger commercial aviation industry for a fully automated, contactless, seamless passenger journey.

There is also a consensus that the sector will likely see the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel and perhaps even hydrogen or electric aircraft.

“Today, airports need to give careful consideration and planning towards sustainability, climate resilience, and fuel and energy infrastructure while also increasing digitalization and minimizing exposure to cyberattacks.” – Anthony James

CAT: It’s clear that Urban Air Mobility (UAM) – and the associated increase in drone and eVTOL aircraft traffic – is part of that future. What challenges does this create for airports? How are they adapting?

Anthony James: There are still clearly some air traffic integration issues, and UAM will require the creation of robust communication protocols between eVTOLs and ANSPs.

However, rather than a challenge, this is also a huge opportunity to boost airport connectivity and slash onward travel times for passengers.

“AI is one area that all airports are currently exploring to help them become more efficient and improve their operations.” – Anthony James

CAT: This year’s PTE is happening at a time of incredible change and advancement among commercial airlines and airports. Who should attend PTE, and what can they expect to learn at this year’s conference?

Anthony James: Everyone should attend! Not just airports – airlines, architects, urban planners, governments and aviation authorities, too. It’s the industry’s most important event.

PTE 2025 will be where everyone gets together to catch up with each other, share ideas, discuss their current projects, and source and discover new solutions and technologies – there is no greater opportunity to fast-track your understanding of this rapidly evolving sector!",https://connectedaviationtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2467550689.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:56:29.369149

These sustainable fuels can directly replace conventional kerosene made from fossil fuel with no need for adaptations in aircraft or supply infrastructure, facilitating the immediate decarbonization of air transportation.

The new facility, located at the Holcim factory in Villaluenga de la Sagra (Toledo), is designed to capture over 700,000 tpy of CO2 during cement production. Part of this CO2 will be combined with green H2 produced from renewable energy to be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF), reaching an estimated production of 100,000 tpy. The remaining CO2 will be stored permanently in geological repositories.

The combination of technology and production capacity for the fuel of the future of aviation positions ECO2FLY as a leader in Europe for the decarbonization of key development sectors considered difficult to decarbonize. In this context, Over the first 10 years of operation, ECO2FLY will avoid emissions of over 6.5 million tons of CO2.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonization of the industry. Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction.”

In this regard, Ignacio Casajús, Global Strategy & Growth Lead at Exolum, highlighted how “Exolum is making a firm commitment to the development of partnerships that allow the development of sustainable fuels that, as of today, are presented as the only viable solution to reducing carbon emissions in the short term in sectors like aviation and shipping.”

José Antonio Membiela, CEO of IGNIS P2X, considers this project “the most important in the production of synthetic aviation fuel currently produced in Spain, both in terms of size and strategic location and the circularity it offers partners (energy, CO2 capture, methanol production and consumption in aviation). ECO2FLY combines the sustainability of a business of great important to the surrounding area, such as the cement industry, with the creation of new industry for decarbonization, which will generate employment and wealth for the region.

For his part, Javier Esteban, Director of the Consortium and Partner of P2X Spain, states that “this project is an opportunity to be leaders in Europe in the production of eSAF, which represents an enormous strategic value for the Spanish economy. It will be the start of a new industry that will create employment and wealth, and a new energy paradigm for the country, with the opportunity to become exporters of renewable fuel on a large scale for the first time.”

We are just now starting to see the spillover effects of corporations rolling back DEI programs – customer boycotts, employee lawsuits and other scrutiny.
Make sure that key stakeholders like employees or employee groups are fully considered before changing your course of action.
Companies will be even more focused on connecting the dots between DEI 2.0 (inclusion and belonging) and financial value.
Whether announced publicly through a press release or scrubbed in the cover of night, companies will make shifts around how they discuss DEI programs moving forward.","By: Chad Spitler, Founder and CEO, Third Economy

Risk mitigation is top of mind for U.S. corporate issuers in 2025, as the current federal administration attacks diversity, equity and inclusion, or “DEI”.

Just pick up a newspaper or scroll through LinkedIn and you’ll see hundreds of responses to corporate DEI commitments (or retractions) in reaction to recent legal challenges and political rhetoric.

DEI as a practice has come under fire. Critics contend that programs intended to assist people from historically disadvantaged groups do more to divide than to foster genuine inclusion, undermining fairness and hiring for merit or capability. Proponents believe that DEI leads to better financial results by creating cultures where different perspectives mitigate risk and drive innovation, and that helping uplift people is the right thing to do.

Companies are facing a dilemma – reframe or remove DEI initiatives to avoid attack (but risk disenfranchising stakeholders that support DEI) or stand strong with their beliefs (and risk potential attacks from the administration or other important stakeholders).

As with all corporate strategy, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all roadmap or playbook on how to manage this dynamic. Company decisions will be more nuanced, to make commitments that are best for their unique stakeholders and ultimately, their business. While the media may be quick to jump on any company update as a “retreat” from the tenets of DEI, many businesses are reframing their commitment to DEI as simply “inclusion” or “belonging”, to create workplace cultures that welcome everyone and to generate financial success.

In today’s highly divided world, can companies create cultures where both sides are valued, and their respective positions are heard?

Welcome to DEI 2.0, focused on inclusion and belonging for financial results, versus social impact.

Here’s what we can expect from companies in the era of DEI 2.0.

Companies will reflect on their values and how DEI aligns with their moral and ethical foundation.

The moral and ethical foundation of DEI is fairness, based on the belief that every individual possesses inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their identity or background. This foundation is not likely to significantly change for most companies.

However, companies will tailor (and potentially change) the strategies and communications around their values to fit their customers and key stakeholders, ensuring that these efforts reflect the priorities of the communities they serve.

What does this mean in practice? A bell curve of responses from companies across the board:

Some companies will keep their existing programs and language in place. For select organizations, this means a continuity of trust with core customer and employee groups and a DEI strategy that remains unchanged, part of which involves lifting people up from historically disadvantaged demographics. This will be even more important for mission-driven organizations.

Most will reposition their programs and their language. This represents businesses that would like to maintain trust with existing customer and employee groups that support DEI – but need to adjust their framing and approach in response to feedback from opposing groups. This is the most common outcome that we are seeing today: a move toward inclusion and belonging for all (tied to financial success) and away from the social impact objective.

Some will roll-back programs entirely. For some organizations, particularly those who may have never bought in on the value of DEI, this represents retracting commitments entirely. This applies to companies answering to activist stakeholders in select geographic areas and/or those who cannot make the case for the business value of DEI in today’s environment.

Our advice:

Draw upon your code of ethics for guidance. These documents were developed by your predecessors and peers to ensure corporate integrity, and foster accountability to build trust and credibility with your stakeholders.

Don’t react to one stakeholder group while alienating another. Be inclusive to all. We are just now starting to see the spillover effects of corporations rolling back DEI programs – customer boycotts, employee lawsuits and other scrutiny. The backlash can often be just as intense as opposition to the initiatives themselves (Don’t believe me? Just ask Target these days!). Make sure that key stakeholders like employees or employee groups are fully considered before changing your course of action.

Even if diversity is “out”, inclusion is always “in”. While DEI is increasingly becoming weaponized, its core tenets are not. Inclusive environments lead to higher levels of innovation, creativity, and collaboration and diverse teams perform better when inclusion ensures that all voices are heard and valued. Figure out ways to include all your employees and create paths for growth for everyone.

Companies will be even more focused on connecting the dots between DEI 2.0 (inclusion and belonging) and financial value.

It will be more important than ever to make the link between a company’s approach to inclusion and belonging and long-term value creation.

Companies will need to evaluate initiatives, procedures, and programs to ensure they meet the objective of driving long-term financial resilience and performance. This will include linking initiatives to financial outcomes and revising communications (including policies, financial communications, job postings and reports) where needed, to better focus this point.

Integrating DEI 2.0 into core business strategies will allow for the full financial benefits of sustainability – which is always about helping companies to achieve competitive advantages, to capitalize on market trends, and to promote innovation.

The result? An organization that is more collaborative, better engaged, ready to meet challenges, and foster innovation.

Our advice:

Evaluate initiatives to ensure they meet the objective of financial value creation. Carry this through all your internal and external communication channels.

Tools like materiality assessments are helpful to reinforce that your sustainability priorities are aligned with key stakeholder views.

Consider the long-term impact. Administrations change every 4-8 years and reacting to today’s political challenges may be detrimental to your long-term strategy and goals. Identify a lane and stay consistent.

Companies will make language changes to avoid legal scrutiny and overall politicization.

Whether announced publicly through a press release or scrubbed in the cover of night, companies will make shifts around how they discuss DEI programs moving forward. For some, this may simply be a rebrand of efforts or for others, a name change to reflect the complete overhaul of a program. In general, many companies are moving away from the language of social impact objectives, quotas, and goals.

Our advice:

Consider some of these shifts that we are seeing to promote a broader sense of inclusion:

Programmatic names are changing from “DEI” or “DEIB” to “Belonging” or “Inclusion”

Employee resource groups or “ERGs” are being expanded to “Affinity” groups, affirming any employee can participate

“Diversity” is being broadened to cut across racial and gender lines (i.e. “first-generation college graduates” or “disadvantaged backgrounds”)

“Pay equity” is being repositioned as a tool for employee retention

Keep all disclosures and communications around sustainability and DEI precise and clarify any nuance to ensure that all efforts can be tied to your overall business strategies.

Companies will continue to prioritize profit.

Like it or not, the DEI conversation has solidified that corporations’ biggest priority in the U.S. is driving profit – and that includes managing today’s political highwire.

While the past decade has seen some momentous shifts in our working culture (including the radical transformation of remote work), today’s DEI debates make clear that companies must balance multiple stakeholder groups in their pursuit of financial value.

Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily ¬– our view is that this creates a more transparent environment in which all key stakeholders have a better sense of the values and the ideals of the company.

2025 has proven to be a major inflection point for U.S. companies of all size. But instead of looking at this moment as an abandonment of sustainability principles, we could view this shift as an opportunity to advance DEI to be ever more inclusive, and to better tie inclusion to long-term financial performance and innovation.

DEI as a construct lives on in many of the reframed programs and initiatives in 2025. The language may be different, but the foundational values remain the same for the companies doing it right – fairness and creating cultures where people feel comfortable, celebrated and able to do meaningful work that enables financial success for all.

If our programs unintentionally divide people on either side, then we need to be open to constructive feedback and continuous improvement until everyone feels included.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Third-Economy-Spitler2.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 12:57:00.273117

Without policy, sustainability efforts risk being unstructured and fragmented, leaving companies unaligned in their initiatives.

As business aviation organizations seek to operate more sustainably while maintaining operational efficiency, evolving regulations introduce new challenges and opportunities. Operators must find ways to navigate these complexities and stay abreast of what’s happening in the sector.

Digitalization will be crucial to ensuring they can stay compliant in this competitive and more sustainable landscape.

Sustainability: What’s New In 2025

2025 marks a significant year for the industry’s drive to a more sustainable future as several new regulations come into effect.

In the UK, the government administered its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate on Jan. 1st which requires all jet fuel supplied to the country to contain at least 2% SAF.

While the legislation marks a significant step forward in the industry’s drive to reduce harmful fossil fuel emissions, it requires operators to overcome new financial hurdles. Jet owners, aircraft management, and charter companies that operate in the UK will need to invest more in the short term as SAF production continues to scale. We’ll likely see business aviation organizations turn to technology to alleviate new pressures, thanks to the long-term cost and time saving benefits it offers.

In Europe, we’ll continue to see regulations emphasize emissions tracking and transparency. EASA has already outlined its mandate to standardize environmental impact information, allowing passengers to compare the environmental impact of their flights more easily. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) also introduced new reporting requirements for non-CO₂ emissions from Jan.1, 2025, and the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is set to become mandatory from the start of next year.

These measures reinforce Europe’s move toward more rigorous environmental disclosure and lifecycle emissions analysis, which will require operators to introduce accurate tracking systems and reporting methods.

Proactive engagement and investment in technology will be essential for operators to successfully navigate these evolving regulations, as well as boost emission transparency between stakeholders.

In the US, similar reporting mandates have been implemented. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a rule requiring public companies, including non-U.S. firms with shares traded in the U.S., to report elements of their environmental footprint, including Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Corporate flight departments and managed aircraft used by large public companies will need to invest in technologies that ensure accurate and efficient emissions tracking, with first disclosures being scheduled for 2026 to cover Fiscal Year 2025 reporting.

Sustainability initiatives in the U.S. are also developing through incentive programs. The Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC) rewards SAF producers based on emission reductions.

For business jet operators, this means that while there is no direct obligation to incorporate SAF into their fuel mix, the increasing availability and potential cost reductions of SAF in the future – driven by these incentives – could make adoption easier and more appealing over time.

Navigating Changes With Digitalization

Complying to a range of new regulations, which differ from region to region, introduces complexities for business aviation organizations. Businesses will need to remain agile as mandates continue to evolve and reshape the industry’s future.

Technology is becoming increasingly critical. Among large scale projects, introducing digital systems at an administrative level can be the key to a more flexible approach. For example, digital document management solutions can significantly streamline regulatory adherence. Traditional, paper-based systems often exceed hundreds of pages of information, making it difficult to adapt when changes to an existing regulation are issued or new framework introduced.

Digitalization can condense all information into one accessible platform, while automatically updating and flagging regulatory changes. This is an extremely beneficial practice for business aviation operators looking to save time, drive operational efficiency, and remain compliant.

The introduction of large language models (LLM) in aviation documentation further enhances these opportunities. Navigating regulatory information can be time-consuming. With AI, users can ask questions about a new regulation and receive descriptive answers, not only saving time spent sourcing relevant information but further improving compliance.

Is The Future Digital?

As environmental regulations become more complex and diverse, forward-looking business aviation operators must prioritize digitalization to remain competitive. Digital tools are integral to the operational efficiency that modern businesses require in an evolving regulatory environment. Digital documentation platforms are one example, working to significantly reduce the burden of managing multiple frameworks. In a shifting industry, those who adapt early to digital solutions will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly regulated future.

Q. XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rapidly emerging as one of the most viable low-carbon solutions for the aviation industry, offering a pathway to significantly reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. With growing regulatory support, increased corporate demand, and airlines’ commitments to achieve net-zero emissions, SAF is gaining attention. The market for SAF is expected to grow substantially in the coming years as it addresses the aviation industry’s critical need for sustainable, scalable alternatives to traditional jet fuel.

In an exclusive interview with our Editor Prakash Jha, Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, shed light on how his company is positioned to take advantage of this market boom. Dange discussed XCF Global’s unique role as a dedicated SAF producer, its operational advantages, and the strategic initiatives the company is undertaking to meet the growing demand. As XCF Global prepares for its upcoming NASDAQ debut, Dange highlighted the company’s commitment to sustainable growth and its vision for the future of aviation fuel.

Q. The market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to experience substantial growth. What makes this market so attractive to institutional investors, and how does XCF Global plan to capitalize on this growth?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents one of the most commercially viable low-carbon solutions for aviation in the global energy transition. Investors are increasingly seeking assets that combine strong fundamentals with measurable ESG impact. The SAF market does exactly that. It is backed by regulatory momentum, growing corporate demand, and decarbonization mandates from governments and airlines around the world.

At XCF Global, we offer early access to SAF as a dedicated, pure-play producer. Our New Rise Reno production facility is operational and has an expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF. We have a long-term agreement in place with Phillips 66 to provide non-food feedstock and offtake of renewable fuels, providing cash flow visibility and stability. XCF’s early-mover advantage and rapid scalability are compelling.

Q. What do you believe are the key factors driving the increasing demand for SAF, and how can investors ensure that they are getting the best return on their investments in this space?

Several converging forces are driving SAF demand: airline net-zero commitments, regional SAF blending mandates (especially in Europe), the rise of corporate ESG targets, and, most notably, the aviation industry’s lack of viable alternatives to liquid fuels. SAF is no longer an idea for decarbonizing the aviation industry – it’s the solution.

We believe stakeholders need to look at producers with real offtake agreements, proven production capacity, and scalable infrastructure. XCF is already delivering SAF. Our ability to monetize carbon credits, the opportunity to secure advantageous pricing in international markets, and deploy capital efficiently gives us a financial and operational edge in this space.

Q. XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut. How do you envision this public listing benefiting the company in both the short and long term?

Our NASDAQ listing is a milestone that positions us for scale, visibility, and access to growth capital. In the short term, it allows us to broaden our shareholder base, attract institutional coverage, and deepen investor engagement. It also enhances credibility with customers, regulators, and trade partners.

Long term, being a Nasdaq listed company provides us with a platform to expand our production footprint, explore new technologies, and solidify our position as a leading pure-play SAF company globally. We’re committed to delivering sustainable returns to shareholders – financially and environmentally.

Q. As the only public pure-play SAF producer in the U.S., what specific advantages does XCF Global have over competitors in this rapidly growing sector?

We are operational today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF output from our New Rise Reno production facility. That head start matters – especially in a market where demand vastly outpaces supply and bringing new facilities online is challenging.

We also benefit from:

Project pipeline: Our Reno, Nevada facility and an adjacent plot for SAF facility development is strategically located within proximity to SFO, LAX, and other west coast airports. This second facility in Reno is expected to come online in 2027. Additional plants in Florida and North Carolina are expected to service the Southeast and East Coast regions of the US and provide convenient access to deepwater ports that facilitate export. The Florida and North Carolina facilities are expected to come online in 2028 after which XCF expects to have the ability to produce 159 million gallons of annualized neat SAF production.

Feedstock flexibility: Our pre-treatment process allows for multiple non-food feedstock inputs, improving stability and reducing CI scores.

Fortune 50 partnerships: Partnership with Phillips 66 validates our model and provide supply chain stability.

Scalability: New Rise Reno has a pending utility patent related to the design, layout and configuration of its production facility. This site design requires less area to build a production facility and can be efficiently replicated as modular design allows for rapid expansion.

Q. Many clean energy companies have gone public in recent years. How does XCF Global’s strategy differ from other clean energy plays, and what sets you apart in the market?

Many clean energy IPOs have focused on long-term R&D or future-forward concepts. XCF is different—we’re built to deliver. We have an operating SAF facility, a long-term supply and off-take agreement with a Fortune 50 Company , and are generating revenue. Our unit economics work because we’ve designed our business around flexible feedstocks and offtake certainty.

Q. Airline net-zero commitments are driving the adoption of SAF. How quickly do you see the airline industry transitioning to SAF, and what role do you believe XCF Global will play in this transition?

Several major airlines around the world have committed to achieving 10% SAF usage by 2030. The transition is accelerating as carbon reduction becomes a competitive and regulatory imperative. However, the biggest bottleneck is supply—and that’s where XCF comes in.

We’re one of the few producers prepared to meet this demand. Our role is to bridge the supply gap, de-risk procurement for airlines, and provide low-CI SAF that helps them meet their sustainability goals. We’re not just a supplier—we’re a strategic partner in their net-zero journey.

Q. What challenges do airlines face in terms of SAF supply, and how is XCF Global positioned to help bridge that gap?

Airlines face three primary challenges: availability, cost, and carbon intensity. Many facilities won’t be online until the end of the decade, leaving a multi-year supply shortage. Pricing remains volatile, and not all SAF is created equal—many options still have high CI scores.

XCF addresses all three:

Availability: Our flagship facility, New Rise Reno, is online today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF

Cost: Our ability to diversify feedstock types allows us to effectively manage input costs.

Carbon impact: Our fuel helps customers earn value in carbon markets.

Q. Can you provide insights into the company’s strategic expansion plans in Nevada, Florida, and North Carolina? How do these regions align with the company’s broader vision for growth?

Our site strategy is designed for scale and resilience. Reno, Nevada is our first operational site, providing immediate production and proximity to West Coast aviation hubs.

XCF is developing an additional site, New Rise Reno 2, located directly adjacent to New Rise. This site will leverage existing infrastructure at New Rise, including pretreatment, electrical, water, and logistics, eliminating the need for a full ground-up build.

The site in Florida will expand our reach into Southeastern markets, while the site in North Carolina will serve as an East Coast conduit.

These locations facilitate logistics, permitting ease, feedstock availability, and access to major transportation corridors. Our patent-pending, 10-acre design allows us to replicate production quickly, enabling a modular path to bringing our projects to life.

Q. There is a significant gap between SAF supply and demand. What specific steps is XCF Global taking to ensure it can meet the surging demand for SAF over the next few years?

We’ve taken a proactive approach to close that gap:

Near-term production: New Rise Reno is already operational. A second facility adjacent to New Rise is projected to come online in 2027 with the Florida and North Carolina facilities expected to commence operations in 2028.

Replicable design: Our patent-pending facility design enables rapid deployment at future sites across the U.S. and globally.

Strong partnerships: Our agreement with Phillips 66 ensures stable feedstock and off-take, enhancing predictability and stability for our trade partners.

Q. As one of the first movers in the SAF space, where do you see XCF Global in the next 5–10 years? How will you maintain your competitive edge as the industry evolves?

In 5–10 years, we expect XCF to be a global leader in SAF, recognized for delivering clean, reliable, low-carbon fuel solutions in aviation. We plan to be operating multiple facilities in the U.S. and beyond, supplying major airlines and energy companies, and leveraging our platform to drive decarbonization across aviation and beyond.

Ultimately, our success will be defined not just by gallons produced – but by our leadership in decarbonizing the air travel.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mihir-Dange-CEO-XCF-Global.jpeg,N,,2025-04-08 10:56:10.277423

This estimate is based on Thailand adopting a 5% SAF blend, referencing 2019’s daily jet fuel consumption of 20 million litres.
With SAF demand expected to rise significantly after 2030, Bangchak is positioning itself ahead of the curve.
The company anticipates that the aviation industry will not have viable alternatives such as electric planes for large-scale commercial use by then.
“If the aviation industry does nothing to achieve carbon neutrality, it will be branded as a very dirty industry,” said Mr. Chaiwat.","Energy conglomerate Bangchak Corporation Plc expects it will take 5 to 7 years to recover its investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as some countries have postponed plans to mandate SAF use by airlines, reports Bangkok Post.

Despite the extended timeline, Bangchak President Chaiwat Kovavisarach expressed confidence in the long-term profitability of the project. “We are confident we have an opportunity to make a profit,” he said.

The revised payback estimate, up from an earlier 3–5 years, comes in response to changes in global SAF policies, particularly in East Asia where enforcement of SAF blending rules has been delayed.

The aviation sector is turning to SAF as a cleaner alternative to jet fuel, with studies suggesting it can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%. To help drive this transition, Bangchak is building a 10-billion-baht SAF factory that will use used cooking oil as a feedstock. The facility is set for a test run on April 25, with commercial production planned by mid-2025.

Initially, the factory will operate at half its full daily capacity of 1 million litres. This estimate is based on Thailand adopting a 5% SAF blend, referencing 2019’s daily jet fuel consumption of 20 million litres.

With SAF demand expected to rise significantly after 2030, Bangchak is positioning itself ahead of the curve. The company anticipates that the aviation industry will not have viable alternatives such as electric planes for large-scale commercial use by then. The number of global air travelers is projected to double from 6 billion in 2024 to 12 billion in 2030.

“If the aviation industry does nothing to achieve carbon neutrality, it will be branded as a very dirty industry,” said Mr. Chaiwat.

Currently, the ex-refinery price of SAF stands at 48 baht per litre—more than double the 21–22 baht for conventional jet fuel. Mr. Chaiwat suggested government subsidies may be necessary to bridge this price gap.

Bangchak has already secured contracts to sell SAF and is sourcing used cooking oil from food and beverage operators to support production.

According to international aviation bodies, SAF mandates are set to rise: the European Union will require a 2% blend by 2030, while the UK and US are aiming for 10%.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAF-sustainable-aviation-fuel-2.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 10:56:17.979505

XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rapidly emerging as one of the most viable low-carbon solutions for the aviation industry, offering a pathway to significantly reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. With growing regulatory support, increased corporate demand, and airlines’ commitments to achieve net-zero emissions, SAF is gaining attention. The market for SAF is expected to grow substantially in the coming years as it addresses the aviation industry’s critical need for sustainable, scalable alternatives to traditional jet fuel.

In an exclusive interview with our Editor Prakash Jha, Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, shed light on how his company is positioned to take advantage of this market boom. Dange discussed XCF Global’s unique role as a dedicated SAF producer, its operational advantages, and the strategic initiatives the company is undertaking to meet the growing demand. As XCF Global prepares for its upcoming NASDAQ debut, Dange highlighted the company’s commitment to sustainable growth and its vision for the future of aviation fuel.

Q. The market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to experience substantial growth. What makes this market so attractive to institutional investors, and how does XCF Global plan to capitalize on this growth?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents one of the most commercially viable low-carbon solutions for aviation in the global energy transition. Investors are increasingly seeking assets that combine strong fundamentals with measurable ESG impact. The SAF market does exactly that. It is backed by regulatory momentum, growing corporate demand, and decarbonization mandates from governments and airlines around the world.

At XCF Global, we offer early access to SAF as a dedicated, pure-play producer. Our New Rise Reno production facility is operational and has an expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF. We have a long-term agreement in place with Phillips 66 to provide non-food feedstock and offtake of renewable fuels, providing cash flow visibility and stability. XCF’s early-mover advantage and rapid scalability are compelling.

Q. What do you believe are the key factors driving the increasing demand for SAF, and how can investors ensure that they are getting the best return on their investments in this space?

Several converging forces are driving SAF demand: airline net-zero commitments, regional SAF blending mandates (especially in Europe), the rise of corporate ESG targets, and, most notably, the aviation industry’s lack of viable alternatives to liquid fuels. SAF is no longer an idea for decarbonizing the aviation industry – it’s the solution.

We believe stakeholders need to look at producers with real offtake agreements, proven production capacity, and scalable infrastructure. XCF is already delivering SAF. Our ability to monetize carbon credits, the opportunity to secure advantageous pricing in international markets, and deploy capital efficiently gives us a financial and operational edge in this space.

Q. XCF Global is set for its NASDAQ debut. How do you envision this public listing benefiting the company in both the short and long term?

Our NASDAQ listing is a milestone that positions us for scale, visibility, and access to growth capital. In the short term, it allows us to broaden our shareholder base, attract institutional coverage, and deepen investor engagement. It also enhances credibility with customers, regulators, and trade partners.

Long term, being a Nasdaq listed company provides us with a platform to expand our production footprint, explore new technologies, and solidify our position as a leading pure-play SAF company globally. We’re committed to delivering sustainable returns to shareholders – financially and environmentally.

Q. As the only public pure-play SAF producer in the U.S., what specific advantages does XCF Global have over competitors in this rapidly growing sector?

We are operational today with expected annual production capacity of 38 million gallons of neat SAF output from our New Rise Reno production facility. That head start matters – especially in a market where demand vastly outpaces supply and bringing new facilities online is challenging.

We also benefit from:

Project pipeline: Our Reno, Nevada facility and an adjacent plot for SAF facility development is strategically located within proximity to SFO, LAX, and other west coast airports. This second facility in Reno is expected to come online in 2027. Additional plants in Florida and North Carolina are expected to service the Southeast and East Coast regions of the US and provide convenient access to deepwater ports that facilitate export. The Florida and North Carolina facilities are expected to come online in 2028 after which XCF expects to have the ability to produce 159 million gallons of annualized neat SAF production.

Feedstock flexibility: Our pre-treatment process allows for multiple non-food feedstock inputs, improving stability and reducing CI scores.

Fortune 50 partnerships: Partnership with Phillips 66 validates our model and provide supply chain stability.

Scalability: New Rise Reno has a pending utility patent related to the design, layout and configuration of its production facility. This site design requires less area to build a production facility and can be efficiently replicated as modular design allows for rapid expansion.

The AvfuelZero portal empowers them to do just that, right at their fingertips. By launching this portal, we’re further streamlining the journey to net zero and simplifying sustainability for all who are ready to make that commitment, said C.R. Sincock II, EVP at Avfuel.

The system effectively organizes a specific user’s SAF documentation and other transaction information, including, but not limited to, volume, feedstock, manufacturing, and certification information.

Proof of sustainability, certificates of analysis, bills of lading, and all other supporting documents are held within the system to streamline manufacturing verification, and certification for ASTM D-7566 and ASTM D-1655 specifications.

Along with this product documentation, users also have direct access to carbon emissions reporting with detailed, transparent insights that help users meet their sustainability goals.

Increasing SAF access

The portal’s launch comes as Avfuel significantly increases access to SAF across North America and beyond.

Most recently, Avfuel added a supply terminal location in Dallas, Texas (TX), joining others brought online in the last three months, including Port Everglades, Florida (FL); Linden, New Jersey (NJ); and Pasadena, Texas (TX).

This supply chain network also includes Avfuel’s longstanding supply terminals in both Northern and Southern California.

As supply points expand, so does fixed base operator (FBO) availability. To date, Avfuel provides operators with access to SAF at 57 airports, including 24 in the United States and 33 spread across the EU and the UK, more than any other fuel supplier.

While Avfuel provides leadership in the business aviation industry for the direct supply of physical SAF molecules, it also manages its own transparent book and claim program in-house so operators can purchase SAF attributes no matter where they fly.

This multi-modal approach to selling SAF has vastly enhanced the fuel’s accessibility, while the AvfuelZero portal simplifies how to track and report these emissions reductions, no matter the transaction type.",https://bioenergyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/avfuelzero.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 11:57:46.220148

From the initial golden age of travel to current budget airlines

and the restrictions of the pandemic, air travel has transformed over the past decade. Significant advancements in aviation have occurred over the years as engines and aircraft have become lighter, quieter, and more efficient. Emerging technologies reshaped with robotics, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, unmanned aircraft systems and the push for hybrid and electricm airplanes sounded the death knell for jumbo jets across the world. Asia Pacific became the world’s biggest aviation market, whilst airlines squeezed more seats into their aircraft. Passengers benefited as fares remained at surprisingly affordable lows, business class seats hit new levels of comfort, wifi became airborne and inflight entertainment offered a plethora of options. Offsetting this was the rise of annoying ancillary fees for previously included items, the decline of economy-class catering and the reduction of legroom to knee-crunching levels. Allegiances became extra fluid as airlines moved beyond major global alliances to make strategic deals, whilst some names faded away.

Operating more than 150 aircraft and flying to over 170 destinations worldwide, Cathay Pacific has 200 more aircraft and a three-runway system at Hong Kong International Airport in the pipeline to enhance their operations. Over the past decade the Aria suite that they introduced, and their brainchild ‘Gallery in the Skies’ escalated customer service to an all-new high. Their culinary program balances tradition with innovation; a taste of Hong Kong through classical favourite dishes, and partnerships with Michelin-starred establishments such as Louise and Dudell’s, whilst also focusing on a range of wellness and sustainability-focused food and experiences. The Corporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel Programme (SAF) combined with the ‘Fly Greener’ offset program and ‘Greener Together’ rewards program, positions Cathay Pacific at the forefront of aviation’s sustainable future.

VIRGIN ATLANTIC

From creating the concept of the Premium cabin to the introduction of onboard bars, pioneering the world’s flight seatback TVs, and even setting up charity donations with loose foreign currency, Virgin Atlantic has been innovating for customers since its inception. More recently, Virgin Atlantic has underpinned its belief that ‘everyone can take on the world’ with industry-leading changes for its team, who, along with its customers, are encouraged to live by the ‘Be Yourself’ mantra. In hindsight, it was the first airline to scrap make-up requirements for its cabin crew, allow visible tattoos and let its people decide which version of the iconic Vivienne Westwood uniform best represents them. The airline has taken a leadership position in decarbonising aviation for more than a decade, taking early action to optimise the efficiency of its fleet and is committed to achieving net zero by 2050. It operated the historic Flight100, the first transatlantic flight on 100 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel last November 2024.

Rep. David Steffen, R-Howard, as well as Sens. Romaine Quinn of Birchwood and Patrick Testin of Stevens Point, recently sent a co-sponsorship memo to other lawmakers on the legislation.

“Wisconsin can lead the way in championing the production of this sustainable fuel, providing our farmers and timber producers with a long-term, reliable path in our everchanging global economy,” they wrote.

Under the bill, the state would create an income and franchise tax credit of $1.50 per gallon of “sustainable aviation fuel” or SAF produced in Wisconsin, starting in 2028. It’s defined in the bill as aviation fuel that’s at least 90% derived from synthetic, renewable and nonpetroleum sources.

SAF has similar properties to standard jet fuel, but has a smaller carbon footprint, according to an overview from the U.S. Department of Energy. Depending on how it’s made, the fuel can produce “dramatically” lower emissions, and the agency says some emerging pathways for production have a net-negative emissions footprint.

Bill authors note it’s made from renewable agricultural resources including “low value” energy crops. Potential feedstocks can include corn grain, oil seeds, forestry residues, wet wastes such as manure and even algae. DOE says using wet wastes has the added benefit of reducing pollution on watersheds while also reducing greenhouse gases.

SAF could provide a boost to Wisconsin’s growing $4.2 billion biofuels industry, which employs more than 19,000 people, the lawmakers wrote in the memo.

“While there is currently no production of SAF occurring in Wisconsin, our state is in a prime position to become a hub for SAF production, both geographically, and because of our strong agricultural outputs,” they wrote.

The partnership will see Microsoft co-fund 39,000 tonnes of SAF, translating to a projected reduction of 113,000 tonnes of lifecycle carbon emissions. The goal? To tackle Scope 3 emissions—the often-overlooked category that includes everything from business travel to freight shipping, and one of the hardest to address in corporate climate strategies.

The deal isn’t just about emissions—it’s about market-making. SAF remains expensive and underproduced. By signing long-term contracts, Microsoft and IAG are helping stabilize demand and give fuel producers confidence to scale up supply.

The SAF will be produced by:

Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery (UK), using used cooking oil and food waste

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels plant (USA), the first commercial-scale alcohol-to-jet fuel facility

Both sources are certified by the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), ensuring credible climate benefits.

“This long-term deal brings us closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030,” said Julia Fidler, Microsoft’s Lead for Fuel and Materials Decarbonization. “And it helps accelerate SAF production globally.”

Microsoft has positioned itself as one of the few tech companies making direct bets on clean fuels. Its $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund has already invested in SAF innovators like LanzaJet. The new agreement with IAG extends that commitment to business air travel and global logistics tied to its data centers.

For IAG, it’s a reinforcement of strategy. The airline group has now invested more than $3.5 billion in SAF, and in 2024, sustainable fuel made up 1.9% of its total fuel usage—a figure that remains small, but industry-leading.

“Long-term agreements like this give the confidence needed to scale SAF production,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer.

The aviation industry accounts for roughly 2-3% of global emissions, but it remains one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize. That’s why Microsoft and IAG’s move is being closely watched.

This partnership highlights how corporations and airlines can collaborate to accelerate clean fuel markets while hitting their own climate targets. It’s also a glimpse into how voluntary corporate climate leadership might be the key to unlocking progress where regulation alone has struggled.",https://esgbroadcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-61.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:56:34.449689

The year 2025 marks a pivotal moment for aviation in the United Kingdom. With the introduction of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate, the country signals a clear commitment to decarbonising air travel. This development arrives alongside government support for expanding runways at major airports, aligning growth with sustainability imperatives. While many see this as a regulatory necessity, there is a deeper narrative at play. The mandate presents an extraordinary opportunity to reimagine the future of aviation through innovation, collaboration, and visionary thinking.

The Urgency of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Aviation faces one of the most complex decarbonisation challenges of any sector. Improvements in airframe design, engine efficiency, and smarter flight operations will certainly help. Yet, the fuel that powers aircraft remains largely unchanged. Conventional kerosene is deeply entrenched, and while electric and hydrogen aircraft are on the horizon, their widespread adoption remains distant and primarily suited to shorter routes.

In contrast, Sustainable Aviation Fuel stands out as a practical solution. Compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure, SAF provides a meaningful path forward. It allows airlines to reduce emissions without waiting for entirely new technologies. However, realising its potential depends on overcoming several substantial hurdles.

Overcoming Barriers to SAF Adoption

Scaling SAF production is not without its challenges. Feedstock availability is limited, and current production technologies are expensive. Traditional SAF pathways such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids are already costly, and innovative methods like alcohol-to-jet and Power-to-Liquid are even more so.

Projections indicate that reaching the ambitious 2050 targets could require investments between three and five trillion dollars beyond a scenario without SAF. Unlike solar and wind energy, where economies of scale have sharply reduced costs, SAF may not follow the same trajectory due to feedstock constraints. As demand rises, reliance on higher-cost production pathways could keep prices elevated.

Yet, this complex landscape creates fertile ground for creative solutions and novel collaborations.

Unlocking Innovation Across the Ecosystem

Rather than viewing these challenges as insurmountable, the aviation sector is embracing them as catalysts for innovation. The SAF mandate acts as a lever to unlock new possibilities across the value chain.

Collaboration Becomes a Cornerstone

Airlines, fuel producers, investors, governments, and even passengers are increasingly aligned in their efforts. Cross-sector partnerships are emerging, fostering shared commitments to decarbonisation goals. These collaborations accelerate progress, create shared value, and build resilience in an evolving market.

Advancing Book and Claim Systems

One of the most promising advancements lies in the evolution of book and claim systems. These mechanisms allow the environmental benefits of SAF to be traded separately from the physical fuel itself. By decoupling these components, airlines and fuel producers can optimise logistics and distribution, reducing costs and expanding market reach. Book and claim is a quiet revolution within the SAF market, enhancing its accessibility and attractiveness.

Airports as Future Energy Hubs

Airports are evolving beyond their traditional role. They are poised to become dynamic energy hubs, integrating SAF production, storage, and distribution into their operations. This transformation requires rethinking logistics, optimising production locations, and reconfiguring infrastructure to accommodate sustainable fuels. Airports embracing this role will not only support decarbonisation but also create new revenue streams and community value.

Building Market Confidence Through Policy Support

The UK mandate is designed not just to increase SAF usage but also to build confidence among investors. By setting clear targets and limits, particularly favouring novel and high-cost pathways such as Power-to-Liquid, the policy aims to stimulate market activity and attract essential funding. Regulatory certainty reassures stakeholders that their investments will be supported, encouraging long-term commitments to sustainable fuel development.

This supportive framework ensures that the SAF mandate does more than mandate compliance. It creates a nurturing environment for experimentation, entrepreneurship, and enterprise.

Embracing the Opportunity for Growth

What may have begun as a policy requirement is fast becoming a beacon of opportunity. The journey towards sustainable aviation is not linear, nor is it without obstacles. Yet, the SAF mandate fosters a mindset shift. It encourages the industry to see beyond immediate challenges and focus instead on the transformative possibilities that sustainable fuel offers.

Market Leadership for the United Kingdom

By embracing SAF, the United Kingdom positions itself as a global leader in sustainable aviation. The country is shaping not just its domestic aviation market but also influencing global standards and best practices. This leadership opens the door to export opportunities, knowledge sharing, and new diplomatic and economic partnerships.

Inspiring Innovation Beyond Aviation

The ripple effects extend far beyond airports and airlines. Advancements in SAF production technologies can benefit other hard-to-abate sectors. Lessons learned in feedstock management, carbon accounting, and supply chain optimisation have the potential to inspire broader industrial transformation.

Conclusion: Charting the Course for a Cleaner Sky

The United Kingdom’s SAF mandate marks the dawn of a new era for aviation. Rather than viewing it purely as a regulatory hurdle, the industry is recognising it as a springboard for innovation, collaboration, and sustainable growth. Through collective effort, pioneering technology, and forward-looking policies, the skies of tomorrow can be cleaner and more sustainable.

The mandate provides a unique opportunity to turn ambition into action. As the industry continues to push boundaries, the future of aviation will not only be fuelled by sustainable resources but also by the shared commitment to creating a better world for generations to come.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:56:49.922164

Qantas is using the Airbus A350-1000 for its “Project Sunrise”, with plans to launch non-stop flights to London and New York from Sydney in mid-2026, amid a fleet upgrade that include the Airbus A321XLR arriving within months.

The duo set up a US$200 million partnership in 2022 to help accelerate SAF production and will invest from that fund.

Airbus Chief Sustainability Office Julie Kitcher and Qantas Chief Sustainability Officer Fiona Messent said they chose CTP because it works closely with corporate partners to identify and support technology solutions for aviation.

They hope the initiative will help bridge a gap the aviation giants identified between early-stage climate technologies and at-scale commercial production in Australia.

“Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors – from airlines, manufacturers and airports to regulators, governments and investors,” Kitcher said.

“This partnership with CTP and Qantas highlights that the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs innovative solutions for a nascent technology that will drive innovation, attract investment and create new jobs in Australia, which I believe is well positioned to be a leader in low carbon fuels.”

The investment focus will be on technologies for SAF production, feedstock development and other value-chain innovations and will sit alongside Climate Tech Partner’s main fund.

CTP has 12 partners – leaders in sectors ranging from energy generation to infrastructure – to provide mentorship and strategic guidance to enable further collaboration.

CTP will invest on behalf of Qantas and Airbus into leading local and global startups focused on SAF and other innovative technologies. The airline and plane builder will also have the option to explore further follow-on and direct investments to support the deployment of those startup solutions in real-world Australian projects.

Fiona Messent from Qantas said sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool they have to decarbonise aviation.

“This partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated in the SAF supply chain, while also providing companies with access to Qantas and Airbus as they develop and test their solutions,” she said.

“For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit, so it’s fantastic to be collaborating across industries to help accelerate local production.”

CTP invests globally, primarily at the Series A stage, across the energy & power, transport & logistics, and industrials & resources.The BESEN Family Office is an investor in both Climate Tech Partners and CTP main fund.

While airlines are taking interest, adoption has been slow for sustainable aviation fuel, which can be made from feedstocks such as agricultural waste and cooking oils.

This is in part due to the increased cost compared to conventional fuels, though Kitcher says economies of scale can help mitigate the “green premium”.

“We need to pull on the demand side, and we need to give fuel suppliers that visibility of the demand and uptake agreements to give security for the investments to be able to scale,” she said.

“We also need production incentives so that the fuel producers have the opportunity to invest in their facilities and be able to ramp up the production. So, it’s really on both sides that we need to work.”

Kitcher’s comments came as Airbus and Qantas jointly invested $15 million into a climate-focused venture capital fund.

SAF is a safe, nearly identical replacement for conventional jet fuel and could cut aviation fuel emissions by up to 80%, with the potential for a 100% reduction in the future. This makes SAF a crucial step toward achieving the aviation sector’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

Since the first biofuel test flight on a commercial plane in 2008, the industry and its partners have made significant progress. SAF has been certified by ASTM International, the global fuel standards body. Since 2011, over 750,000 flights have used blends of SAF and traditional fuel.

On October 7, 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) set a long-term aspirational goal (LTAG) of achieving net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. ICAO is a specialised agency of the United Nations that leads the international alignment of technical standards and strategies, facilitating the safe, secure, and sustainable development of its 193 member states’ aviation sectors and air services.

During the 41st ICAO Assembly held in September and October 2022, the member states adopted the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) long-term aspirations to formalise an international agreement to reduce aviation-related carbon emissions.

This agreement is structured similarly to the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2018 Initial Greenhouse Gas Strategy but establishes a more ambitious long-term reduction target. Just as the IMO’s agreement has prompted new policies and investments in low- and zero-emission ships, the ICAO policy can potentially be a significant catalyst for change in the aviation sector.

The new flagship report produced by Airports of Tomorrow, an initiative of the World Economic Forum, is titled “Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook 2025.” This report brings together leaders from across the aviation industry. It is based on interviews with top executives from the World Economic Forum’s aviation community and discussions held in 2024. Its purpose is to provide an overview of the significant risks and opportunities affecting the progress of aviation decarbonisation in 2025.

The main concerns identified focus on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) availability and cost, geopolitical tensions, and the tariffs associated with growing protectionism. The overarching goal is to accelerate the aviation industry’s efforts regarding SAF, battery-electric, and hydrogen aviation technologies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

In late 2024 and early 2025, Chief Executive Officers from the World Economic Forum’s aviation community were asked: How can the aviation industry achieve the ambitious goal of net-zero emissions while expanding? What actions and priorities need to be taken? What risks should public-private collaboration focus on this year to accelerate progress toward decarbonisation?

These discussions aim to capture the evolution of aviation executives’ perspectives over time and highlight ongoing opportunities for public-private collaboration. Their responses have informed this report, which seeks to set the agenda for discussions in the year ahead.

The views of aviation executives interviewed for this report reveal several challenges impacting climate action. Some risks are specific to the aviation sector, while others arise from broader economic and geopolitical constraints.

Below are the top ten risks affecting the aviation decarbonisation progress outlined in the WEF report:

Despite challenges in 2024, including the SAF plant closures, scrapped projects, and delays in policy guidance and incentives, the 30 C-suite executives interviewed for this report remained cautiously optimistic regarding the decarbonisation goals of the aviation industry. More than two-thirds were confident that the momentum for aviation decarbonisation will continue in 2025, with a minority voicing neutral or negative expectations for the year ahead.

To align with the priorities outlined in the report, the World Economic Forum’s sustainable aviation initiatives for 2025 will focus on the following:

1. Continuing discussions on SAF policy and geopolitics to identify regional synergies and promote increased investment in SAF production while boosting demand, particularly in emerging markets.

2. Maintaining emphasis on zero-emissions propulsion and infrastructure, with an upcoming report on how airports can serve as energy hubs. This report will include a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of multi-fuel applications at airports.

3. Exploring how innovation can support aviation climate adaptation and mitigation by sharing best practices and solutions that airports and airlines implement to disseminate key findings and lessons learned.",https://climateadaptationplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/climate-adaptation-Key-Risks-and-Opportunities.jpg,N,,2025-04-08 02:56:09.822057

The expansion of SAF feedstock supply is expected to stem from enhanced farming practices and large-scale biomass utilisation rather than land expansion.
This research highlights Southeast Asia’s rich SAF feedstock potential, positioning the region as a key player in meeting global SAF demand.
Southeast Asia has a unique opportunity to lead sustainable aviation while driving economic growth and environmental stewardship.” Sachin Narang, GHD’s Executive Advisor – Energy and Infrastructure, said, “The successful completion of this project represents a major milestone in ASEAN’s journey toward sustainable aviation.
Together, ASEAN governments, businesses and communities can help shape a sustainable aviation future that contributes meaningfully to regional and global sustainability goals.","JAKARTA, 8 April 2025 — Southeast Asia’s abundant agricultural feedstocks offer potential for the region to become a global hub for SAF, according to a joint Canadian-ASEAN research project.

The “Promoting the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) from Agricultural Waste in the ASEAN Region” project marks a significant step towards a more sustainable aviation future in Southeast Asia. It was carried out by the ASEAN Secretariat, GHD, Boeing, Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development (CTIF), funded by Global Affairs Canada (GAC), and implemented by Cowater International, the Institute of Public Administrators of Canada (IPAC).

SAF is a renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure, as a “drop-in” fuel. Aviation engines can currently run on a mix of 50% SAF and 50% conventional aviation fuel, but the industry is working towards a 100% SAF mix. SAF lowers carbon emissions over the fuel’s life cycle by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock, with the potential to reduce even more in the future. SAF can be made from a wide variety of sources: cover crops and other nonedible plants, agricultural and forestry waste, non-recyclable municipal waste, industrial plant off-gassing and other feedstocks.

As part of the project, a techno-economic assessment was conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, focusing on feedstock availability, technology pathways, carbon intensity, logistics, environmental and social aspects, institutional frameworks, and financial assessment.

With improvements in economic feasibility, SAF production in ASEAN could surpass regional demand, enabling exports both within and beyond ASEAN.

The expansion of SAF feedstock supply is expected to stem from enhanced farming practices and large-scale biomass utilisation rather than land expansion. The report emphasised that mechanisation, improved irrigation, and R&D in crop optimisation could boost feedstock availability without increasing deforestation or land conversion.

Beyond environmental benefits, the project highlighted SAF’s role in fostering gender equality and economic development. The SAF sector offers opportunities for job creation, upskilling, and workforce diversification, with a strong emphasis on inclusive participation of women and marginalised communities.

Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, Satvinder Singh, commended the initiative, stating: “This initiative marks a significant step in advancing ASEAN’s commitment to sustainable aviation. By leveraging regional resources and innovation, we are not only addressing environmental challenges but also driving economic growth and enhancing energy security. The successful completion of this project underscores ASEAN’s capacity for effective collaboration in tackling climate challenges while creating new opportunities for our communities.”

CTIF Project Manager Hendry Predy also commented on the initiative stating “CTIF technical assistance supported Southeast Asia countries with a project to improve the ability of the energy sector to assess the reliability of the upstream feedstock supply and the potential for sustained use and production within the region. The recommendations from the proposed project informed on the future development and operation of the pilot areas in selected member countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam) to convert agricultural waste and residues to SAF. The project and recommendations supported the ASEAN Secretariat in ascertaining the reliability of feedstock supply for renewable fuels.”

Sharmine Tan, Boeing’s regional sustainability lead for Southeast Asia said “SAF is the biggest opportunity to cut aviation emissions over the next 30 years. This research highlights Southeast Asia’s rich SAF feedstock potential, positioning the region as a key player in meeting global SAF demand. To unlock this potential, governments and industry must act decisively, harmonise sustainability policies, invest in infrastructure, and scale local production to build a robust regional SAF ecosystem. Southeast Asia has a unique opportunity to lead sustainable aviation while driving economic growth and environmental stewardship.”

Sachin Narang, GHD’s Executive Advisor – Energy and Infrastructure, said, “The successful completion of this project represents a major milestone in ASEAN’s journey toward sustainable aviation. The insights gained will serve as a foundation for future SAF initiatives, investments, and policy development across the region.”

The ASEAN Secretariat, together with its partners, invites continued collaboration with governments, industry leaders, research institutions, and investors to support the regional transition to SAF. Building on the findings of this project, the next phase will focus on areas such as enabling policy development, strengthening technical capacity, and mobilising investment to support SAF deployment, among other collaborative efforts. Together, ASEAN governments, businesses and communities can help shape a sustainable aviation future that contributes meaningfully to regional and global sustainability goals.

In a notable advancement for aviation sustainability, two global leaders are deepening their alliance. International Airlines Group and a renowned technology corporation have taken a significant step forward by extending their joint commitment to sustainable aviation fuel. This is not just another corporate announcement. It represents a shift in how businesses view their responsibility within the wider carbon ecosystem.

Their extended agreement focuses on an additional commitment to sustainable aviation fuel, aiming to cut life cycle emissions by an impressive amount. It is currently considered the largest and longest agreement of its kind according to public data. This move is a signal that the future of corporate responsibility lies in collaborative action rather than isolated efforts.

Understanding the Impact of Scope Three Emissions

To appreciate the importance of this agreement, one must first understand the concept of scope three emissions. Unlike direct emissions, scope three emissions come from activities not directly owned or controlled by a company. This includes everything from the sourcing of raw materials to the impact of business travel.

For industries that rely heavily on global supply chains and transportation, like aviation and technology, these emissions form a significant part of their overall carbon footprint. Addressing them is essential for any meaningful progress towards decarbonisation.

Through this agreement, the technology company is making tangible progress on its scope three emissions. In doing so, they are demonstrating that responsibility extends beyond operational boundaries and into the wider value chain.

A Strategy Beyond Carbon Reduction

What makes this partnership truly distinctive is its layered approach. The agreement does not just focus on fuel purchases. It also extends to supporting logistics operations by using sustainable aviation fuel for transporting data centre components globally.

By integrating sustainability into its freight operations, the technology corporation is advancing its goal of becoming carbon-negative by the end of the decade. At the same time, the airline group benefits from increased demand for sustainable aviation fuel, encouraging further production and industry growth.

This kind of integrated thinking shows a maturity in climate strategy. It moves beyond simple offsetting into embedded, systemic change.

The Critical Role of Long-Term Agreements

One of the most powerful aspects of this collaboration lies in its long-term vision. Short-term purchases of sustainable aviation fuel provide immediate benefits, but long-term commitments have a much deeper impact.

When businesses commit to multi-year agreements, they provide the certainty that fuel producers need to invest confidently in scaling up production. In this case, the agreement supports facilities in both the United Kingdom and the United States, using waste-based feedstocks like cooking oil and food waste.

Such sustained demand signals encourage investment in next-generation fuel technologies. This is exactly what is required to shift the entire aviation sector away from fossil dependence.

Certified Sustainability at the Core

The fuels produced under this agreement are certified by recognised bodies ensuring they meet stringent sustainability criteria. This level of certification gives assurance that the reductions in life cycle emissions are genuine and verifiable.

Moreover, the fuel suppliers themselves represent innovation. For example, the United States facility involved is the first commercial-scale alcohol to jet production site in the world. These pioneering developments are what will enable aviation to meet its ambitious climate targets.

Shared Responsibility Leads to Shared Progress

Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of this partnership is its demonstration of shared responsibility. By co-funding sustainable aviation fuel purchases, the technology corporation and the airline group are showing that climate solutions are most powerful when designed collaboratively.

Neither organisation could achieve this impact alone. Together, they amplify their influence, demonstrating that collective action is not just desirable, but essential for meaningful progress.

This partnership also serves as a signal to other industries. It shows that even sectors with hard-to-abate emissions can make significant progress through creative, collaborative strategies.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for the Future of Aviation Sustainability

This partnership between an aviation leader and a technology giant offers more than just positive headlines. It provides a blueprint for future collaborations across industries seeking to address complex carbon challenges.

By understanding their mutual impact, committing to long-term agreements, and supporting the scale-up of sustainable fuel production, they are actively reshaping the future of aviation.

This is a future where sustainability is not an afterthought but embedded in every decision. It is a future where supply chains, fuel suppliers, and customers are united by a common goal.

Most importantly, it is a future where the collective power of responsible businesses can move an entire industry towards genuine decarbonisation.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-04-08 08:57:26.198324

The aviation industry is promoting mixing SAF with jet fuel because SAF produces up to 80% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fuel, according to media reports citing various forecasts.

Bangchak adjusted its estimated payback period to 5-7 years, extended from 3-5 years in a previous feasibility study, in response to changes in the SAF market.

""We are confident we have an opportunity to make a profit,"" said Mr Chaiwat.

The company's 10-billion-baht SAF factory is scheduled to open on April 25 for a test run, with used cooking oil as a raw material.

Demand for SAF is projected to soar after 2030 because the aviation industry will not find other clean fuels by that time, or be able to shift to battery-powered aircraft on a commercial scale, according to Bangchak. In 2030, the number of air travellers is expected to tally 12 billion, up from 6 billion in 2024.

""If the aviation industry does nothing to achieve carbon neutrality, it will be branded as a very dirty industry,"" he said.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Air Transport Association, the EU requires airlines to mix 2% SAF with jet fuel by 2030. SAF proportions of 10% apply in the UK and the US in 2030.

Bangchak plans to start commercial production of SAF in the middle of this year, amounting to half of its full capacity of 1 million litres a day. The capacity of 1 million litres is calculated from an estimate that Thailand will use 5% SAF mixed with conventional oil, based on actual jet fuel supply of 20 million litres a day in 2019.

Bangchak partners with food and beverage operators to buy used cooking oil, and it already signed contracts to sell SAF to its customers.

The motive is less straightforward to climate activist Meisel, whose non-profit Clean Creatives convinced more than 1,300 ad firms to cut ties with fossil fuel companies.
One of those fossil fuel companies is Energy Transfer, a Texas-based pipeline company that doesn't sell products to consumers, but still advertises locally.
""I think it gets to the heart of a lot of fossil fuel advertising, which is essentially lobbying in public,"" said Meisel.
It's a message fossil fuel companies hope will resonate with college sports fans.","Americans love college sports, and so do oil and gas companies.

About 96% of more than 2,000 fossil fuel ads aired during live national games between 2022 and 2024 were during college football and basketball, compared to about 4% for professional sports, according to a CBS News data analysis of data from television ad tracking firm, iSpot.tv.

Duncan Meisel, a climate activist and a leading voice against advertising by fossil fuel companies, said many of these ads during televised games talk about supporting communities and the environment without ever acknowledging the industry's role in climate change.

""The problem is they're selling a product that they know harms people, that they know harms the planet,"" Meisel said.

About one in ten of the more than 2,000 ads carried a pro-climate message, like recycling cooking oil for renewable diesel, ""sustainable"" aviation fuel, lower carbon emissions or fuel made from corn.

While Meisel didn't dispute the accuracy of these claims, he emphasized that they're not these companies' main goal, and likely a very small percentage of what they produce.

CBS News reached out to Valero for comment on its ads highlighting renewable diesel and aviation fuel, but the company has not responded in time for this story's publication.

It's an effective business strategy to advertise during college sports, according to Peter Carton, who directs the Sports Management program at Southern Methodist University.

Carton said the college sports demographic tends to be middle-to-upper income. The return on investment for these companies is higher than for pro sports, because it's cheaper to advertise.

""When they look at where do they want to put their advertising dollars and marketing dollars to reach certain demographics, college is much more efficient,"" Carton said.

""You're very familiar, I'm sure we all are, with the cost of advertising on the Super Bowl. That's outside of the reach of many, many companies. But to be able to get a very passionate, dedicated consumer base, that's the college market,"" he said.

How Much More Can Air India Expand In The US?

Air India already flies to five destinations in the United States - Newark, Washington Dulles, New York JFK, Chicago O'Hare, and San Francisco. Some of these routes are served by multiple Indian airports. Still, during a chat with Simple Flying last month, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson shared that his airline is keen to expand within the US once it receives more widebodies. There have been reports about adding Dallas and Los Angeles to the works. Still, how much could the airline expand across the US? Could we see some additional routes along both coasts?

Which Airline Has Disappointed You The Most?

It is hard to be disappointed with low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers, at least when things run as they should. After all, they have a bare-bones approach, meaning expectations are usually low. It’s then easy to meet or even exceed them. The same cannot be said for the spectrum of ‘full’-service carriers, which often overpromise and underdeliver. It is hard to pinpoint one airline that has disappointed me the most because some aspects of the experience could be good, while others may not. One flight might be less than desirable, while the next – if there is a next time – might be noticeably, or at least acceptably, better. Such inconsistencies only add to the trouble. Which carrier has disappointed you the most and why? For me, it is Ethiopian Airlines. I have flown it four times, which is not really enough to have a fair impression. Still, the food was unusually poor, even by airline standards, and the cabins, even on nearly ne

World Atlantic Airlines Has 3 Aircraft Seized In Miami: Is This The End Of The Line?

This is user-generated content. The views and opinions expressed here are not necessarily those of Simple Flying. Recently, a Florida court ordered the seizure of three McDonnell Douglas MD-83 aircraft belonging to World Atlantic Airlines until the airline pays up $1.8 million to Blue Diamond General Investments. The three aircraft seized were N801WA, N802WA, and N804WA. Recently, the airline has mostly been operating 'charters' to Cuba. At the time of writing, 801 seems to be flying, 802 is sitting on the ground in Cuba with engine failure, and 804 is nearly 40 years old and hasn't flown in a while. As such, right now, World Atlantic Airlines is only operating 801 and 805. Is the end of the line for World Atlantic Airlines? Share your thoughts in the comments!

Delta Air Lines Plans 36% More Domestic US Widebody Flights This Summer: Will You Be Flying On Any Of These Routes?

Delta is significantly increasing its use of widebody aircraft on domestic routes this summer, with a 36% jump in scheduled flights compared to last year. This means more chances to fly on aircraft like the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767 on routes typically served by narrowbodies. Key routes benefiting from this expansion include: New York JFK to Los Angeles New York JFK to San Francisco Los Angeles to Honolulu Atlanta to Los Angeles Honolulu to Salt Lake City Atlanta to Honolulu Atlanta to New York JFK Atlanta to San Francisco Detroit to Honolulu Detroit to Minneapolis Los Angeles to Kahului Minneapolis to Honolulu New York JFK to Honolulu Delta’s move could enhance connectivity while giving travelers a taste of international-level comfort on shorter flights.

When Will Aeroflot Return to the United States?

Russian-carrier Aeroflot used to serve over 50 destinations before the Russia-Ukraine War but mostly all have been terminated in Europe and North America since the beginning of the war. In the United States, Aeroflot served direct flights from Moscow (SVO) to: New York (JFK), Miami (MIA), Los Angeles (LAX), San Francisco (SFO), Chicago (ORD), Seattle (SEA), and Washington (IAD). In Europe, Aeroflot served Moscow (SVO) to: Madrid (MAD), London (LHR), Frankfurt (FRA), Munich (MUC), Rome (FCO), Warsaw (WAW), and so many more. However, all have been terminated since the EU banned Aeroflot from flying to Europe. The airline currently serves flights to Dubai (DXB), Istanbul (IST), Bangkok (BKK), Tehran (TEH), Almaty (ALA), and other destinations. This also includes flights around Russia including St. Petersburg (LED), or places like Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (PKC). These are mainly reasons why Aeroflot makes money still.

Fiji Airways (which is set to adopt the American Airlines AAdvantage loyalty program) and Oman Air (the second Gulf carrier to join oneworld following Qatar Airways) will officially join the group.

Which Airline Needs To Update Its Livery?

Simple Flying's reporting on Delta Air Line's new ""100 Years"" livery got me thinking: The standard Delta livery has been around for quite a while now. Since 2007, in fact, so the better part of two decades. Which is interesting, because the airline seemed to change it quite frequently prior to that. But the liveries of other airlines have been around even longer. British Airways' ""Chatham Dockyard"" livery dates back to 1997, and Singapore Airlines and Korean Airlines have been largely unchanged (bar some minor tweaks to the titles) since the late 1980s. I believe that Philippine Airlines holds the record for the oldest livery, unchanged since it was introduced 40 years ago. You can argue that it's good to stick with a solid brand that everyone recognizes. But sometimes even the most well-recognized brands need a refresh. So with that in mind... Which airline needs to update its livery?

I began my commercial flying career at 18 while still in high school. I was fortunate to spend the next 50+ years doing what has been described as ""The Best Job in the World,"" that of a professional pilot. At age 23, I received an FAA flight check for Airline Transport Pilot and was designated as Captain for an airline. Since then, I have served airlines from the smallest start-up to some of the largest carriers in the world. Ask me anything! Edit: Thank you all for asking me questions. The AMA has concluded now.

Where Would You Like United Airlines To Fly The Airbus A321XLR?

United plans to have 50 Airbus A321XLRs, with the first aircraft due to enter service in 2025. Naturally, the carrier said they’ll partly replace the Boeing 757-200ER, including to Europe. Unlike the A321LR, a variant United does not have and has not ordered, the XLR is a true 757 replacement – just with a longer range and much better fuel burn. The XLR may also help United to make some seasonal routes year-round while right-sizing capacity with demand on others, freeing up other equipment to be used elsewhere. It may also enable higher frequencies. More interesting are new route possibilities. While necessarily vague, United said, “The XLR can fly much further [than the 757] and will open new stations that either don't have service from an airline today [from the US], or they don't have United service.” Where would you like the carrier to fly the type?

From Lab to Talent Pipeline: Dr. Atim Enyenihi Shares Insights on Building Pathways, Breaking Barriers, and Talent Development

""The real problem is retention,"" says Dr. Atim Enyenihi, Technology and Innovation Strategic Industry Advisor at the Salt Lake City Department of Economic Development, a position she was appointed in March 2024. It's a point she drives home frequently in her work. While much of the national STEM conversation centers on recruitment, Dr. Enyenihi is focused on what happens after people enter the field: how to keep them there, growing, connected, and fulfilled.

As the Tech Accelerator Awardee for the 2024 Women Tech Awards, Dr. Enyenihi is helping reshape Salt Lake City's tech ecosystem—from workforce development to biotech innovation to early talent cultivation.

A Public Sector Strategist with a Startup Mentality

At the Salt Lake City Department of Economic Development, Dr. Enyenihi leads initiatives designed to close skill gaps in critical sectors including software, biotech, and fintech. That includes launching internship pipelines, workforce-aligned courses, and industry partnerships. One example: a new software course taught by Agile Manifesto co-author Alistair Cockburn, aimed at giving students hands-on skills grounded in industry best practices.

""We’re building from the ground up and looking for what’s missing—not just plugging holes but rethinking the whole structure,"" she said.

Retention Over Recruitment

Dr. Enyenihi’s focus on retention comes from experience. She points to a lack of mentorship, limited mobility, and a lack of diversity as the primary reasons women and underrepresented groups leave STEM fields.

""You can get people in the door, but if they don’t see anyone like them in leadership or don’t have anyone to guide them, they’ll eventually walk away,"" she explains. Her strategy: build inclusive environments where different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives aren’t just welcomed—they’re critical.

From Middle School to Industry

Looking downstream, she’s also thinking about the next generation. Dr. Enyenihi helps lead Human Innovation Day: Exploring Career Paths to Biotechnology, an annual March event supported by the Salt Lake Education Foundation and Mayor Erin Mendenhall's Tech Lake City initiative. The 2025 event will expose middle schoolers to real-world applications of biotech—from sustainable aviation fuel to bioreactors.

""We talk about biotech in three dimensions: to heal the world, feed the world, and fuel the world,"" she says. The goal is early exposure. “If you don’t show students the landscape, how can they navigate it?”

Biotech with Urgency

Before shifting to workforce development, Dr. Enyenihi was in the lab. Her graduate work at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill focused on drug therapies for acute myeloid leukemia, using analytical chemistry to identify anti-cancer targets now being developed into CAR T-cell therapies.

She also helped develop a newborn diagnostic screening for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a genetic disorder often caught too late. “It’s powerful to detect a disease early and change the outcome. But eventually, I wanted to be closer to the people those outcomes affect.”

A Global Journey, A Local Impact

Born in Nigeria and raised in Dominica before immigrating to the U.S. in high school, Dr. Enyenihi is familiar with navigating unfamiliar systems. She taught herself the U.S. education system, learned English, and later studied chemistry at the University of Missouri. She was awarded a McNair Scholars scholarship and pursued research in analytical chemistry, studying abroad in Mexico and Spain to further her Spanish fluency—a skill she still uses in regulatory biotech work.

Her background informs her approach: “You have to know your why,” she says. ""Success for me would mean success for my entire family. That kept me going.""

STEM as a Launchpad

When asked what advice she’d give students entering STEM fields, she doesn’t hesitate: “STEM is your platform. It’s a launch pad. You don’t have to follow someone else’s track—you can make your own.”

Her talks at events like the Intermountain Biological Engineering Conference at Utah State University (November 2024) and Women4STEM at Weber State University (March 2025) don’t shy away from the challenges. “I’m a big proponent of being real. Students deserve the truth so they can make decisions they’ll thrive in.""

Sometimes that truth lands hard: “At one talk, people had tears in their eyes. It wasn’t about success stories—it was about their stories, reflected back at them.”

Whether she’s developing future therapies or future technologists, Dr. Enyenihi is focused on the long game: building systems where people can grow—and stay.

Microsoft to co-fund 39,000 tonnes of SAF, cutting 113,000 tonnes of lifecycle emissions — the largest and longest Scope 3 SAF agreement between an airline and corporate customer.

SAF to be sourced from UK’s Phillips 66 and US-based LanzaJet, both using sustainable feedstocks and certified by ISCC.

IAG’s total SAF-related investment surpasses $3.5B, supporting long-term decarbonization of air travel and logistics.

IAG and Microsoft have expanded their 2023 agreement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), extending it by five years in what is now the most extensive Scope 3 SAF commitment on record between a corporate and an airline.

Under the new terms, Microsoft will co-fund 39,000 additional tonnes of SAF — reducing lifecycle emissions by approximately 113,000 tonnes. Scope 3 includes emissions from activities outside a company’s direct control, such as business travel and freight.

“We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production,” said Julia Fidler, Environmental Sustainability Fuel and Materials Decarbonization Lead at Microsoft.

“We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement.”

This strategic partnership enables Microsoft to decarbonize business travel and global freight while allowing IAG to scale SAF use and reduce its direct (Scope 1) emissions.

The SAF will be produced from:

Used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery (UK), and

Sustainably sourced bioethanol at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility (USA), the world’s first commercial-scale alcohol-to-jet fuel plant.

Both production pathways are certified under the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC).

“We’re pleased to work with like-minded organisations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions,” said Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s Group Sustainability Officer.

“Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”

The big picture:

Microsoft is also co-funding SAF for air freight used in shipping its global data center components.

IAG’s 2024 SAF usage reached 1.9% of its total fuel, and its total SAF investment (including future commitments) has topped $3.5 billion.

Microsoft’s $1B Climate Innovation Fund has previously invested in LanzaJet, bolstering SAF infrastructure.

This reflects the decarbonisation challenges faced by the sector in comparison to others. At the same time, the aviation industry only looks set to grow with expansions at Heathrow and Gatwick airports expected to be an important part of the UK government’s efforts to stimulate economic growth.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has a critical role to play in enabling the expansion of UK aviation without compromising on environmental protection.

And its importance is recognised by the country’s first-ever SAF mandate coming into law earlier this year. This starts by requiring 2% of the UK’s total jet fuel demand to be SAF this year, with this to then increase linearly to 10% in 2030, and then 22% by 2040. In total, it aims to deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

So, the production of SAF will need to scale to deliver against demand. But there are challenges to overcome first. There are already a number of SAF projects underway in the UK, yet complexities in the sector have stifled progress.

The SAF mandate, however, provides fresh impetus for the industry to navigate the challenges holding back the scaling of SAF production, with collaboration at the heart of the solution.

Overcoming barriers

There are several barriers that have stalled the progress of SAF projects in the UK. Chiefly, a lack of certainty around what actually counts as SAF in the UK has held back investment, although the recent mandate serves to rectify this.

One of the key obstacles currently is a concern about the high costs involved with these projects. The advanced technologies and feedstock required for SAF makes it more expensive than traditional jet fuel. This leads to SAF being less competitive, causing airports and airlines to be reluctant to adopt it without incentives.

And when it comes to the feedstock for these projects, those who look to use waste oils, agricultural residues, or dedicated energy crops, are having to grapple with concerns around availability of supply, with the sector being in competition with other sustainable industries like biofuel production.

This means that despite the need for financial resources to scale up production and unlock the significant potential of the industry, investors are cautious.

Helping projects to take off

Despite these barriers, we are seeing ways for businesses to overcome them. Especially amongst smaller schemes, we are seeing innovative technologies emerging to help get the projects we need off the ground.

For instance, flexibly sourcing hydrogen from biomethane or through production by electrolysis is one method that we are seeing to provide an alternative to waste oils, helping to address issues with feedstock availability. Alongside this, there are also process innovations that are now being leveraged to maximise SAF yields, reducing waste and lowering the carbon intensity of the production process.

At Bilfinger UK, we are also involved in various SAF projects as construction partners, helping to reduce risk and drive cost optimisations.

The key to being successful in this has been engaging with stakeholders and subcontractors early, to provide time for detailed discussions and allow for accurate cost estimates. This, alongside building an honest, transparent relationship with clients to foster collaboration, was essential in helping to overcome the uncertainties that we have seen when it comes to SAF.

And we are also seeing efforts from the government to help alleviate investment concerns, with the Advanced Fuels Fund being extended to £63m. There is now a clear push amongst both the public and private sectors to ramp up domestic SAF development.

Scaling SAF

The SAF mandate has fired the starting gun for the sector, but there are still actions that need to be taken to help the sector make the progress it needs and realise its full potential in driving our transition to a greener economy.

In the main, a revenue certainty mechanism still needs to be finalised by the UK government to provide more certainty on the funding and future earnings of projects and prevent developers from being left in limbo.

But once this is implemented, it will then be up to organisations across all levels of the supply chain to engage in the collaboration needed to help our SAF projects take off.",https://www.airport-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/04/shutterstock_789771859.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 12:56:55.426288

Geoff Cooper, RFA president, says the initial guidance on 45Z was important for several reasons.
Some members of Congress have already introduced legislation to extend the tax credits another 10 years, while others have called for the repeal of the 45Z tax credit altogether.","The critical pieces of the 45Z tax credit puzzle have been on display for interpretation by the greater biofuels industry and the current administration since early January. At the start of the year, 45Z—designed to award the production of low-emission transportation fuels—was assigned a monetary value by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

The U.S. Department of Energy, for its part, released its GREET model to more accurately calculate carbon intensity (CI) scores of renewable fuels. The USDA released an interim rule on technical guidelines for quantifying, reporting and verifying the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated with the production of corn, sorghum and other biofuel feedstocks, as well as a Feedstock Carbon Intensity Calculator (FD-CIC) to help producers better quantify the true CI values of their efforts.

All these 45Z-related puzzle pieces remain separate components of an incomplete whole, waiting on ongoing comment periods, stalled by government-linked timeline hurdles or the policymaking preferences of the Trump administration. But, as several industry voices have noted, having the pieces on the table now could finally give producers access to proper rewards for their clean fuels, should everything align.

Important Details

Following the release of the 45Z guidance notice and the subsequent updates by the DOE and the USDA on the GREET modeling and USDA FD-CIC, numerous energy accounting, tax and law entities provided their own assessments of the components, primarily basic outlines of the variables that matter to understanding 45Z at the time of the guidance release. Most also note that the guidance is not yet finalized. At press time, there was still no clear timeline as to when the credit framework might be finalized or implemented.

Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, Baker Botts, Latham & Watkins and others all outline several of the same key terms in the guidance.

The term “facility,” is important as it refers to a single production line that is used to produce transportation fuel. The facility can also include carbon capture equipment and components located in a different building or geographic area, provided they function interdependently.

A “producer,” is the person/entity who engages in the production of the transportation fuel and does not need to own the facility. Activities that do not result in chemical transformation wouldn’t qualify as “production.”

“Production,” the tax and law firms point out, begins with the processing of primary feedstocks and ends with ready-to-sell fuel.

A “qualifying sale” involves the sale of a “transportation fuel” for use in the production of a fuel mixture, in trade or business, or sold in retail. “Transportation fuel” is notable because it is defined as “suitable for use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft.” But actual use as a fuel in a highway vehicle or aircraft would not be required.

A producer would meet the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) requirement if it sells a synthetic blending component that is then blended into an ASTM spec mixture.

Don Lonczak, a tax partner who focuses on energy at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, says the most essential aspect of the guidance is the initial emissions rate table because it sets forth categories of transportation fuels, pathways and feedstocks. Lonczak’s team regularly helps clients with tax credits, including those like the 45Z, to qualify, finance projects or transfer credits.

Key Points

The 45ZCF-GREET model used to create the emissions table that Lonczak cites has long been preferred by the biofuel industry because it uses the most accurate and up-to-date production technology data and does not overstate indirect land-use change in its calculations of CI scores.

In a hearing with the House Committee on Ways and Means in December 2024, roughly one month before the release of the 45Z guidance and subsequent USDA and DOE announcements, members of Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association called for the GREET model to be used in the guidance.

Growth Energy’s CEO, Emily Skor, said the GREET model should specifically be used for emissions calculations because of its treatment of indirect land-use change.

For Jenny Speck, partner at Vinson & Elkins tax practice, the most important piece of the 45Z guidance is multi-pronged. “It provided taxpayers with clarity on eligibility for the credit, the definition of a 45Z facility, and importantly, the potential eligibility of various feedstocks and fuels.”

Vinson & Elkins is already helping clients understand the impact of the 45Z rules on their businesses, Speck says, notably the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, registering to be a clean fuel producer, modifying offtake agreements, selling the 45Z tax credits or strategizing future business plans. And, if 45Z isn’t an option under the current guidance for a producer, Vinson & Elkins can help clients identify other opportunities.

Geoff Cooper, RFA president, says the initial guidance on 45Z was important for several reasons. “We desperately needed to see some structure to the rules surrounding the credits, as well as the 45ZCF-GREET model and the USDA’s FD-CIC feedstock calculator.” The 45ZCF-GREET model release is particularly important, he adds, because the model reflects a big step forward in understanding the emissions benefits of ethanol.

“Emissions from feedstock production contribute to more than half of ethanol’s carbon footprint,” Cooper says.

The model’s release also represents a useful framework for continuing to understand the advancing science and properly valuing the innovation taking place in the industry.

The American Coalition for Ethanol welcomed the USDA’s release of the guidelines and the FD-CIC. ACE has been working for months with government and industry to create a better understanding and system for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices through programs designed to streamline the process.

Skor notes the importance of the guidance as it relates to investment. She wants the 45Z credit to be extended to 10 years and the Ways and Means Committee to consider putting the SAF credit on par with a previous tax credit known as 40B—roughly $1.25 per gallon as opposed to the 35 cents per gallon credit available to SAF in the Treasury’s 45Z guidance.

Surprises In 45Z

While the guidance from the Treasury, USDA guidelines and DOE release represented a tremendous amount of progress, according to Cooper, many important areas were excluded completely or left undetermined.

Cooper says the Treasury failed to address some feedstocks, including corn kernel fiber, that he and other leaders from industry trade groups called for in the initial January guidance release. The assumption is it will be added later.

In late February, the DOE’s Alternative Fuels Data Center’s numbers showed that the tax credit amount for non-aviation fuel was 20 cents per gallon and 35 cents per gallon for SAF. For facilities that satisfy the wage and apprenticeship requirements, the credit amount would be $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuel and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The wage and apprenticeship requirements were created in the Biden Administration and call for wage minimums during the construction, alteration or repair of facilities. For the apprenticeship requirements, 15% or more of the labor force working on the construction, alteration or repair of facilities must be from a registered apprenticeship program.

Cooper is already calling for significant revision to the wage and apprenticeship requirements.

“They just aren’t practical for much of the industry,” he says.

Skor is also calling for a re-evaluation of the prevailing wage and apprenticeship components, citing the rural location of most biorefineries and the lack of access to labor in the type and numbers needed to fulfill the requirements.

The January version of the Treasury notice also doesn’t include on-farm practices in CI calculations, Cooper notes.

Speck also points to a lack of guidance on how producers may request provisional emissions rates (PER). She says the issue is especially important because of the limited feedstocks and production pathways in the 45ZCF-GREET model that may leave some in limbo until subsequent guidance on the PER request procedure is published.

Finishing the Puzzle

The comment period on the Treasury’s guidance ended in April. Some members of Congress have already introduced legislation to extend the tax credits another 10 years, while others have called for the repeal of the 45Z tax credit altogether. But leading industry voices have continued to tout the importance of the framework as an economic driver for rural and farm economies, along with the evolution of the SAF industry, regardless of administration.

Cooper says his team will continue to push policymakers to finalize the moving parts, including the Treasury rules, the USDA feedstock rules, the feedstock calculator and the DOE’s 45ZCF-GREET model.

“Getting the emissions pathway rules right will be a big deal,” he says. “This includes making sure technologies are fairly considered and producers are able to get credit for their unique technologies and attributes.”

The RFA also wants to see on-farm practices integrated into emissions calculations. Overall, the industry needs procedures, reporting and compliance requirements that are streamlined and manageable, RFA says.

Growth Energy, ACE, RFA, the Clean Fuels Alliance, the Advanced Biofuels Association and others say more work needs to be done on the final framework of 45Z, but the work is worth doing.

“For the first time ever, you have major federal agencies and a major regulatory framework confirming that indirect land-use change is close to zero and that typical corn ethanol has a carbon intensity below 50 grams per megajoule and cuts GHG emissions by half compared to gasoline,” Cooper says.

Integrating on-farm practices with current ethanol production technology into a CI score has also never been done before.

“We have told our story, and our points are getting through,” Cooper adds. “But I wouldn’t call anything a ‘win’ until we see final guidance that harmonizes the components of the 45Z.”

This new wave of hydrogen-powered projects hopes to decarbonise some of the UK’s most energy-intensive industries and promote economic growth, particularly in manufacturing communities.

These projects promise to cut emissions and create thousands of new jobs, strengthening the government’s ambitions to establish the UK as a global clean energy leader.

27 hydrogen projects selected to drive industrial decarbonisation

The 27 shortlisted projects represent a wide range of industries, from clean power generation to glass manufacturing, brick making, and the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

These initiatives will use low-carbon hydrogen to drive innovation in industries that traditionally contribute to high carbon emissions, positioning hydrogen as a key player in the UK’s transition to net zero. With an estimated £1 billion in private sector investment expected by 2029, this initiative signals a major commitment to climate action and industrial revitalisation.

Hydrogen, produced through a process known as electrolysis, where renewable energy splits water into hydrogen and oxygen, offers a zero-carbon fuel that can power everything from transport and public services to industrial operations.

This method provides a cleaner alternative to traditional energy sources and helps decarbonise industries like ammonia production and power generation, where emissions have been challenging to reduce.

Creating jobs and economic growth

The government’s backing for these projects represents an important moment in the UK’s energy transition, helping establish clean energy hubs across England, Scotland, and Wales.

The projects are expected to boost local economies, particularly in areas that have long been dependent on manufacturing.

New roles will emerge in fields ranging from construction and operations to highly skilled technical jobs, including engineers, welders, and pipefitters. Apprenticeships and graduate positions will also be available, providing a pathway for the next generation to contribute to the UK’s clean energy future.

The UK’s plan towards energy security and local economic resilience

The HAR2 initiative builds on the success of the first Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1), which saw £2 billion allocated to 11 projects across the UK, bringing green hydrogen into the mainstream. One project, the Whitelee Green Hydrogen facility in Scotland, will produce hydrogen to fuel the Inchdairnie Whiskey distillery, which plans to use clean energy to sustainably distil whisky by 2027.

The funding from HAR1 has already begun to make a lasting impact, with several projects in the early stages of construction and operations.

As part of the Plan for Change, these new hydrogen projects work with the UK government’s goal of achieving energy security and strengthening local economies. In addition to creating jobs, the hydrogen sector offers the potential to build strong supply chains, particularly in regions with a history of industrial activity.

With hydrogen playing an increasing role in the UK’s energy mix, this initiative is set to unlock many economic opportunities and ensure the country’s leadership in clean energy innovation.

With HAR2’s shortlist now public, the country’s industrial future may well depend on which of these 27 projects makes the final cut.","In a significant step forward for the UK’s low-carbon transition, the government has unveiled a shortlist of 27 green hydrogen projects that could soon receive vital grant funding and revenue support. These projects are aimed squarely at powering the next generation of clean manufacturing across the nation's industrial strongholds.

The Department for Energy Security and Net-Zero (DESNZ) announced today (7 April) that the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2) has launched. This competitive program is designed to identify and support hydrogen production facilities that meet the government's strict low-carbon criteria. These shortlisted projects now enter a critical phase where funding is within reach but not guaranteed.

Once a fringe player in clean energy discussions, Hydrogen is gaining momentum. Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen produces zero emissions at the point of use, making it a strong contender for decarbonising sectors that have historically been hard to electrify — like heavy industry, shipping, and high-heat manufacturing. But there’s a catch: not all hydrogen is created equal.

Globally, a staggering 92% of hydrogen is still “grey”—produced from fossil fuels via steam methane reforming, with significant carbon emissions baked into the process. The UK, however, is drawing a firm line. Only projects producing green hydrogen—generated via electrolysis powered by renewable electricity—are eligible under HAR2. And that’s exactly what all 27 shortlisted projects are offering.

If greenlit, the projects could power a wide range of industries: glassmakers, brick manufacturers, ammonia producers, and even those working on sustainable aviation fuels. The broader aim? To inject low-carbon hydrogen directly into industrial operations, slashing emissions where they matter most—at the source.

Among the industries expected to benefit are those with high-temperature processes that are notoriously difficult to decarbonise through electrification alone. In this context, hydrogen becomes a clean energy solution and a strategic enabler for the UK's climate and economic goals.

This isn’t the first time the UK has rolled the dice on hydrogen. Under HAR1, launched by then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, 11 projects were awarded £90 million in capital grants and over £2 billion in revenue support, unlocking a combined 124 megawatts (MW) of hydrogen production capacity. So far, five of those have inked their final contracts, including flagship efforts like the Bradford Low Carbon Project in Yorkshire and the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in Scotland.

But history also offers a cautionary tale. Being shortlisted does not guarantee funding. As with HAR1, many current HAR2 hopefuls will likely fall short. Developers must now provide updated technical and financial information and continue to refine their proposals if they hope to secure a slice of the funding pie.

The UK’s target of 10GW of low-carbon hydrogen production by 2030 remains a central plank of the national climate strategy. Although initially set under Conservative leadership, the Labour-led government has embraced the mission with its own twist, claiming the hydrogen sector could unlock over £1 billion in private investment by 2029.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

“From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy

generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.”

What’s clear is this: the race to scale green hydrogen is officially on. With HAR2’s shortlist now public, the country’s industrial future may well depend on which of these 27 projects makes the final cut.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_4814b5e52b5344398f6eda7304eef038~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_960,h_640,al_c,q_85/becc64_4814b5e52b5344398f6eda7304eef038~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-04-07 12:57:14.484914

Live now, the Registry is meant to facilitate the development of an international SAF market, which is expected to accelerate aviation's path to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Ensuring Transparency and Preventing Double Counting

The new SAF Registry will serve as a secure, transparent platform to document the environmental credentials of SAF transactions. By providing an immutable record of SAF purchases, the Registry will prevent double counting and ensure that airlines worldwide can verify their SAF use for climate compliance.

In addition to airlines, corporate clients, fuel manufacturers, regulators, and related entities will be able to log and monitor SAF transactions within this global system.

Marie Owens Thomsen, the Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist at IATA, stated that aviation's decarbonization is a collaborative effort. She explained that the release of the SAF Registry to CADO for launch is a crucial platform that benefits all stakeholders. It ensures that airlines worldwide have access to SAF, and their SAF purchases can be claimed against climate-related obligations.

The Registry will securely record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases, preventing double counting. She emphasized that airlines, corporate customers, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and related organizations will be able to record and account for SAF transactions in a global market.

While acknowledging the significance of this advancement, Thomsen noted that the Registry is just one step toward establishing a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. She further pointed out that the Registry alone cannot produce miracles, but without it, no progress can be made.

As such, the Airbus A321ceo looks set to serve Delta Air Lines for the foreseeable future.
Operational snapshot According to current fleet data made available by aeroLOPA, Delta Air Lines configures its Airbus A321ceo aircraft in a 191-seat layout that features two classes of travel.
Looking at present scheduling data from Cirium, we can see that Delta Air Lines favors domestic operations when it comes to its first-generation Airbus A321-200 jets from the A320ceo family.
Domestically speaking, Delta Air Lines has scheduled a whopping 13,613 flights within the United States of America with its Airbus A321 jets this month.","When it comes to the pollution emitted by modern aviation operations, a heavy emphasis is placed on carbon emissions, with airlines around the world looking to get these down to a net-zero level by 2050. However, this isn't the only kind of pollution that operators of commercial aircraft have to take into consideration. Indeed, noise pollution also plays a key role in dictating decision-making processes.

Of course, this is far from a new issue. Indeed, Concorde faced considerable opposition in the US in its early years on account of the noise emitted by its sonic booms, and airports like London Heathrow (LHR) have been using runway alteration schemes for a long time in order to minimize the impact on local residents. This is also something that Delta Air Lines has been able to work on in recent years, thanks to a small but effective addition to the engines on its Airbus A321ceo twinjets.

Older engines

In recent years, airlines around the world have modernized their portfolios of Airbus narrowbodies by adding planes from the A320neo family. Powered by CFM International LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1100G turbofan engines, these modern single-aisle twinjets are known for being quieter than their predecessors, both in terms of noise inside the cabin and how loud they are to onlookers outside the jet.

Want answers to more key questions in aviation? Check out the rest of our guides here!

However, this isn't a feature of older twinjets from the A320ceo series, as these are fitted with previous-generation engines. These include the likes of the CFM International CFM56-5B (all models), the Pratt & Whitney PW6000A (A318 only), and the International Aero Engines IAE V2500 (everything but the A318). As such, long-term operators of such jets are faced with considerably higher noise emissions.

Delta Air Lines is one such carrier, as its Airbus A321-200s from the A320ceo series, in particular, are still on the relatively young side. Indeed, present fleet data made available by ch-aviation shows that these aircraft have an average age of just 6.3 years old, compared to 23.2 years for its A319-100s and 29 years for its A320-200s. In fact, Delta made history by receiving the last ever A321ceo in 2021.

As such, the Airbus A321ceo looks set to serve Delta Air Lines for the foreseeable future. However, it will do so alongside an increasingly large fleet of next-generation A321neo aircraft, with the carrier set to operate more than 150 once all orders are delivered. With this in mind, Delta (alongside certain other A321 operators) has a trick up its sleeve to bridge the gap in terms of noise pollution on its A321 jets.

Special chevrons

For eagle-eyed viewers, the small but effective alteration that makes Delta Air Lines' Airbus A321s quieter than most can briefly be seen in the video embedded below, which shows the carrier's first A321 taking off and landing at Hamburg Finkenwerder Airport (XFW) in Germany. Specifically, the exhaust nozzles at the rear end of its jet engines are fitted with tooth-like chevron structures to reduce their noise.

This modification is only available on aircraft powered by CFM International CFM56 engines, with the company announcing that it was working on such technology as early as February 2002. Indeed, a statement published on the General Electric Aerospace website at the time explained that ""the new technology includes (...) a core chevron nozzle. (...) Flight tests on the Airbus A321 are scheduled for later this year, followed by certification and entry into service in early 2003.""

The chevrons represented part of a wider acoustic package that aimed to ""reduce the cumulative noise signature at least 10 EPNdB (effective perceived noise in decibels) below Stage III levels."" As it happened, a later statement made by CFM International itself confirmed that flight testing of the upgrade package on Airbus planes would actually be able to begin slightly earlier, namely in November of 2002.

As pictured in the photo embedded above, Delta is not the only carrier to have reaped the rewards of this technology. Indeed, Aeroflot was among the other airlines whose CFM56-powered A321ceos were also fitted with noise-reducing chevrons on the exhaust nozzles of their engines. According to Aerospace Research Central, studies found that the chevrons alone reduced perceived noise levels by 1.3 decibels during takeoff, a flight stage when engines are typically at their loudest.

Meeting regulations

While any kind of progress in terms of pollution reduction in modern commercial aviation represents a positive step forward, there was a good reason for the addition of chevrons to the exhaust nozzles of the CFM International CFM56 engines used on the Airbus A321. Indeed, as the company explained in 2002, the ""CFM56-5B engine for the higher-gross-weight A321"" was soon set to face regulatory issues.

CFM International explained that ""noise and emissions have become key factors in aircraft fleet planning and operations, [and] all CFM-powered A320 family aircraft meet current FAR Stage III noise requirements with a significant margin."" However, a few years down the line, a new set of aviation regulations concerning noise pollution emitted by commercial aircraft, known as CAEP 5, was set to come into force. The A321's incompatibility with these prompted the modifications, as CFM notes:

""These [CFM International CFM56] engines also meet the CAEP 5 recommendations, which take effect on January 1st, 2006, with the exception of the CFM56-5B engine for the higher-gross-weight A321. CFM and Airbus have defined an acoustic package to ensure this aircraft/engine combination will operate well within the proposed limits.""

Over the years, there have been slight concerns in certain corners that the addition of chevrons to turbofans, as also seen on the engine covers of certain next-generation Boeing aircraft, may hinder the performance of these planes due to vortex-induced drag. However, according to the Aviation Stack Exchange, research into this subject in 2000 by NASA found that the thrust reduction was minimal.

Delta's A321 fleet in a nutshell

As mentioned earlier, Delta Air Lines' current sub-fleet of Airbus A321 twinjets is relatively young, with an average age of just 6.3 years old at the time of writing (compared to a fleet-wide mean figure of 16 years). According to ch-aviation, all of these aircraft are fitted with CFM International engines, with the aforementioned chevrons on the exhaust nozzles playing a key role in noise reduction.

All in all, Delta currently has 127 examples of the Airbus A321-200 at its disposal, of which 123 are presently listed as being active, with the remaining four undergoing maintenance procedures at the time of writing. This sub-fleet of 127 aircraft makes the A321ceo Delta Air Lines' second most numerous aircraft type and its most popular Airbus jet, with its total only exceeded by the Boeing 737-900ER (163 units).

While the Airbus A321 first flew in March of 1993, and entered service the following January with German flag carrier and Star Alliance founding member Lufthansa , it wasn't until more than two decades later that Delta Air Lines received its first example of the type. Indeed, March 2016 saw N301DV join the SkyTeam founding member on a brand-new basis, with deliveries of the carrier's 127 Airbus A321 aircraft continuing until N129DN came onboard in December of 2021.

Delta has also used the A321 for various special milestones, such as a flight from Minneapolis St Paul International Airport (MSP) to New York LaGuardia (LGA) in September of 2024 that was powered by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Needless to say, despite Delta having already received 71 next-generation Airbus A321neos and with orders for another 84, the older A321ceo isn't going anywhere just yet.

Operational snapshot

According to current fleet data made available by aeroLOPA, Delta Air Lines configures its Airbus A321ceo aircraft in a 191-seat layout that features two classes of travel. The best seats in the house are the 20 domestic first class recliners, which are laid out in five four-abreast (2-2) rows and offer 37 inches of pitch. Meanwhile, of the 171 economy seats, 29 are listed as Delta Comfort+ with an increased pitch of 34 inches, compared to the 31 inches that are offered in standard economy seats.

Looking at present scheduling data from Cirium, we can see that Delta Air Lines favors domestic operations when it comes to its first-generation Airbus A321-200 jets from the A320ceo family. Indeed, this April, the Atlanta-based carrier has scheduled just 619 flights to and from foreign destinations with the stretched-fuselage narrowbody twinjet. The top route on this front connects its Atlanta (ATL) hub with Cancun (CUN) in Mexico, offering 78 monthly rotations. Others include:

Detroit (DTW) - Cancun, 64 round trips.

Atlanta - Montego Bay (MBJ), 36 round trips.

Minneapolis - Cancun, 33 round trips.

Domestically speaking, Delta Air Lines has scheduled a whopping 13,613 flights within the United States of America with its Airbus A321 jets this month. These services will offer collective grand totals of 2,600,083 seats and 2,838,176,533 available seat miles (ASMs). The type's busiest internal route at Delta this month is from Atlanta to New York LaGuardia, with 402 outbound and 403 inbound flights scheduled. Meanwhile, Atlanta to West Palm Beach (PBI) has 338 round trips.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/here-s-why-delta-air-lines-airbus-a321s-are-quieter-than-others-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 11:57:21.370230

The 27 shortlisted projects reportedly represent 765MW of production capacity, although 23% of the selected initiatives have yet to disclose their planned electrolyser sizes.
Nevertheless, it is expected to provide revenue support through the Hydrogen Production Business Model (HPBM) over 15-year contracts, similar to HAR1.
Additionally, the projects selected under HAR1 ultimately secured less funding than the total available allocation.
At the Hydrogen UK Annual Conference in Birmingham last week (April 2), Industry Minister Sarah Jones confirmed that the remaining eight HAR1 contracts will be finalised by May.","The UK Government has shortlisted 27 successful projects under its Hydrogen Allocation Round 2 (HAR2), expected to deliver a combined 765MW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity for deployment between 2026 and 2029.

The projects, which include initiatives from RWE, Uniper and Centrica, among others, are expected to supply hydrogen for the power, glass manufacturing, brick-making and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sectors.

The 27 shortlisted projects reportedly represent 765MW of production capacity, although 23% of the selected initiatives have yet to disclose their planned electrolyser sizes. HAR2 was originally planned to support 875MW.

Geographically, the shortlist spans the UK, with Scotland standing out – home to eight of the 27 projects. Among those with published capacity data, Scottish projects account for 35% of the total 765MW.

However, in an online statement, the government stressed that it’s “unlikely that all projects will be successful.” It added, “As such being on the shortlist does not imply availability of funding for any of the shortlisted projects.”

In terms of developers, RWE leads the pack, responsible for 41% of the disclosed capacity, driven primarily by its 200MW Grangemouth Green Hydrogen project and 100MW Pembroke Green Hydrogen initiative. Uniper and Green Cat Hydrogen follow, contributing 14% and 9% of the total, respectively.

French hydrogen producer Lhyfe will deliver 100MW of combined capacity via its North Tyneside and Kent projects. Boris Davis, Head of Business Development UK at Lhyfe, said he will work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) to “progress at pace to the next stage and ultimately get the production sites up and running.”

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, claimed HAR2 “builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy.”

The exact total funding amount for HAR2 has not been specified. Nevertheless, it is expected to provide revenue support through the Hydrogen Production Business Model (HPBM) over 15-year contracts, similar to HAR1.

The eventual winners will receive public financial support in the form of a Contract for Difference (CfD), a mechanism guaranteeing them in the long-term a fixed price for the hydrogen produced.

In December 2023, the government announced £2bn ($2.6bn) in funding for 11 hydrogen projects for HAR1, offering a combined capacity of 125MW – although delays in critical agreements left them in limbo for a year.

By December 2024, three projects totalling 31.8MW of capacity officially signed agreements for government revenue support.

Additionally, the projects selected under HAR1 ultimately secured less funding than the total available allocation.

The International Monetary Fund came out with a statement this, in which its chief, Kristalina Georgieva, said the tariffs were a threat to global economic growth. “We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,” she said, adding, “We appeal to the United States and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty.”

It is this argument of damage to economic growth that most analysts are pointing to when predicting dark times ahead for oil prices. As Gabelli Funds analyst Simon Wong puts it, while direct tariffs on crude are not “very meaningful”, “The bigger impact on the oil market is the uncertainty in global demand related to President Trump’s tariffs as global expansion drives crude demand growth.”

Indeed, Bloomberg’s Julian Lee wrote in a column Thursday that even though oil itself was mostly spared from tariff pressure, demand for it was bound to be hurt because the biggest driver of demand was Asia, and Trump slapped Asian countries with some of the highest additional tariffs. Lee sees an economic slowdown in Asia resulting from the tariffs that would inevitably lead to lower oil demand that may last a while.

However, there is a counterargument to be made. The tariffs have tanked oil prices. This means oil is now more affordable for Asian importers. It is an interesting question whether they would miss out on a chance to replenish their stocks of crude—especially in anticipation of an inevitable economic slowdown—or grab it and buy more oil on the cheap.

There is also the question of how long these tariffs will remain in effect. Per Trump’s Vice President, J.D. Vance, the point of these is to bring back manufacturing home. “That's fundamentally what this is about, the national security of manufacturing and making the things that we need, from steel to pharmaceuticals,” Vance told media, as quoted by Reuters.

Not everyone sees it that way, to put it mildly. According to Henry Hoffman, PM of the Catalyst Energy Infrastructure Fund, “The Trump administration's decision to base them on a net-imports-to-imports ratio seems less about reciprocity or fairness and more about wielding a blunt instrument to force negotiating leverage. In doing so, the White House is giving up the moral high ground it often claims in trade talks, opting instead for a high-risk, high-reward gambit.”

This is why the tariffs are unlikely to become a permanent fixture of global trade, hurting growth prospects and sinking oil prices lower. “It’s hard to imagine these tariffs sticking for the long term. They seem engineered more as a provocation—a splashy opening move in a game of tit-for-tat brinksmanship aimed at fast-tracking trade concessions,” Hoffman says, cautioning, however, that they may yet backfire. If that happens, it would hurt emerging, smaller economies the most.

Bad as this is, it means that the biggest oil consumers will remain relatively unscathed. China, which is always the focus of analyst attention when it comes to oil, is already preparing its response to the tariffs—and it’s going to be about stimulus and export market diversification. CNBC cited several analysts from China as expecting a focus on local economic strengthening action instead of retaliatory tariffs, which somewhat ironically suggests the “blunt instrument” may end up benefiting its target. It’s worth noting—as analysts have done—that China has a growth target to reach, and for that, it needs energy, in other words, oil and gas.

China is unlikely to be the only one diversifying export markets and forging or strengthening trade relationships with countries other than the United States—if the tariffs stay. If commentators see them as a blunt instrument for trade negotiations, like Catalyst Energy Infrastructure Fund’s Hoffman, they will be removed soon enough as long as the target countries commit to “fixing” their surpluses with the United States. It might yet turn out to be a molehill instead of a mountain.

Of course, there is always the possibility that the tariffs will remain in place for more than a couple of weeks, which will really set in motion those processes of diversification and trade relationship building. Like the sanctions on Russia, however, tariffs will, in all likelihood, change patterns in the global oil market but not really kill oil demand, regardless of the short-term effect of the tariffs on economic growth prospects.

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

LEE ZELDIN’S AMBITIOUS EVOLUTION — POLITICO’s Hannah Northey, Emily Ngo, Josh Siegel and Miranda Wilson: President Donald Trump’s wild-card pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency has emerged as one of the most devoted public champions for his efforts to demolish the Biden agenda — and MAGA world is taking notice.

Lee Zeldin’s crusade to revoke more than $20 billion in already-doled-out climate grants has taken the EPA into uncharted legal territory, provoked a spat inside the Justice Department and left some environmental nonprofits fearing possible bankruptcy. He’s made dozens of appearances on conservative television outlets such as Fox News, Fox Business and Newsmax — proclaiming the “death of the green new scam” on Laura Ingraham’s primetime show — while using his own videos on X and EPA’s YouTube channel to call for rolling back “suffocating” regulations and defanging the “climate change religion.”

Zeldin has also praised Elon Musk and embraced Trump’s call for slashing 65 percent from his own agency’s budget, a target that he insists will cut waste, bring back auto jobs and boost U.S. energy dominance. The Sierra Club has denounced the proposed cuts as “sabotage.”

The Army reservist and former House member’s performance as Trump’s environmental enforcer is winning cheers from the president’s supporters, according to interviews with a dozen of Zeldin’s former colleagues, political opponents and local officials in and around his home community of Long Island. This comes a little more than two years after Zeldin’s aggressive, crime-focused campaign for governor in deep-blue New York came surprisingly close to unseating Democrat Kathy Hochul — an outcome that caused fellow Republicans to predict a bright future for him in GOP politics, possibly as national or state party chair.

Now the question is what doors a role in Trump’s Cabinet might be opening — or closing — for Zeldin.

“If he can do a good job and continue on the path that he’s on, then there’ll be all kinds of different potential options open to him,” said Andrew Giuliani, who ran against Zeldin in the 2022 GOP primary for governor and is son of the former New York City mayor-turned-Trump-attorney.

LIHEAP WORRIES — New Jersey officials are worried about layoffs at the federal program that helps low-income people keep their lights on and heat and cool their homes.

So far, Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration has been unable to get much information about how the layoffs at the federal health department’s Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program will affect the 240,000 or so households that receive several hundreds of dollars a year to help pay their gas and electric bills. Hundreds of thousands more homes are likely eligible but don’t participate.

“They have fired all the employees who actually implement the program,” said state ratepayer watchdog Brian Lipman. “I haven’t seen anything about cutting the program, but I’m not sure how you have a program if you don’t have anyone who can actually run the program.”

The worry is especially acute because energy bills in New Jersey continue to rise. Power bills are expected to go up by $25 a month starting in June.

Concern about LIHEAP has been widespread among Democrats since the cuts were first reported last week. — Ry Rivard

What you may have missed

NO OXYGEN FOR HEAT EMBERS: Gov. Kathy Hochul dashed some cold water on hopes that the NY HEAT Act, which would reshape gas utility rules, will be part of the state budget. During an unrelated press conference dominated by questions — mostly unanswered — about progress on issues like discovery rules and a mask ban, Hochul said in response to a question that NY HEAT hadn’t come up in negotiations. “That’s down the list,” said Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie about the measure. “We haven’t gotten to it.” — Marie J. French

TRUMP ADMIN FLOATS LONG ISLAND GAS PLANT FOR AI: The U.S. Department of Energy wants input on a proposal to power a data center at the Brookhaven National Laboratory with a new Long Island gas plant. The DOE floated a 90-acre data center site at Brookhaven in a request for information released Thursday. The department wants to leverage its land to support American leadership in artificial intelligence, according to the RFI. A new data center at the Brookhaven National Laboratory Discovery Park could be powered by a new 750 megawatt gas plant on the property of the existing 350 megawatt Caithness plant, the document suggests.

The DOE is targeting projects that could begin construction this year and be operational by 2027. That’s an ambitious timeline to build a new gas plant in New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected new permits for gas plants in 2021 due to the state’s climate law. Caithness proposed an expansion more than a decade ago but ultimately didn’t move forward after the Long Island Power Authority later found it wasn’t needed. The power plant company did not respond to a request for comment. The company is also considering battery storage for the site, Newsday reported last month.

The proposal to build a second, larger gas plant comes as environmental groups are challenging DEC’s approval of an air permit for the existing Caithness gas plant. Earthjustice is representing progressive groups opposed to the pollution from the power plant, which is contracted with the Long Island Power Authority until 2029. They argue that DEC should have applied stricter scrutiny to the renewed permit to comply with the state’s 2019 climate law. — Marie J. French

LAWMAKERS DEFEND CLEAN TRUCK RULES: Supporters of a mandate to sell increasing amounts of electric trucks banded together to oppose a bill to delay the rules. “When it comes to environmental protections, the storyline is always the same — polluters drag their feet and say they can’t possibly meet the standards, they need a couple more years,” said Democratic Sen. Liz Krueger, chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “Then in a couple years, they act surprised when the deadline is approaching, and say they need a few more.” Sens. Julia Salazar, Nathalia Fernandez and Brad Hoylman-Sigal also expressed opposition to any delay. Assemblymembers Karines Reyes, Jo Anne Simon, Marcela Mitaynes, Khaleel Anderson, Emily Gallagher, Al Stirpe and Amanda Septimo also joined in. The delay of the advanced clean trucks rule is sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeremy Cooney and Assemblymember Donna Lupardo. — Marie J. French

TO THE CAPITOL — Infrastructure tweaks could dramatically cut commute times between New York City and Albany, according to a new study by longtime transit reporter Nolan Hicks.

Hicks explored basic changes to trains and stations that could trim trip times in his work for NYU’s Marron Institute of Urban Management.

First, make sure the platforms are level with trains. That cuts the time a train must wait at a station because people with luggage and strollers can walk on and off the train without climbing steps.

Second, switch from diesel to electric train engines for better acceleration and speed.

The bottom line: It would cost about $3.5 billion to slash a trip from the city to the capital by more than half an hour. “Trains could sprint between New York City and Albany,” Hicks writes, “depending on the level of investment.”

Right now the trip can take 2 hours and 41 minutes; Hicks said these improvements could reduce that to about 2 hours.

Similar changes could reduce a trip between the city and Buffalo by nearly three hours, the report said. — Ry Rivard

CAMDEN FIRE — POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: A recycling company whose Camden facility had a massive fire in February that scared and temporarily displaced residents has inspired legislation that would require companies to give back their tax incentives if found to have violated New Jersey environmental laws. New Jersey awarded EMR $253 million in tax incentives in 2015 to build the facility in New Jersey’s most impoverished city with the aim of creating jobs, though it was reduced by nearly half, to $132 million, in 2022.

The proposal, NJ A5534 (24R), by Assemblymember Bill Moen, a Democrat who represents Camden, would require any business that receives a state economic development subsidy and is found to have violated state environmental laws to forfeit at least 20 percent of its incentives, and more if that’s not enough to cover the cost of the incident. The bill, though inspired by EMR’s fire, would likely not apply to it, as it would only apply to incentive agreements between companies and the state that were struck after its effective date.

NYSERDA EYES ALTERNATIVE FUELS: Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration is seeking industry and stakeholder input as it develops a funding program for in-state fuel production from waste like cow manure, landfills, paper plants, wastewater treatment plants and other sources. NYSERDA released a “request for information” to shape a planned competitive program for pilot projects, research and development, and supply chain development for alternative fuels from waste feed stocks including renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, sustainable aviation fuel and clean hydrogen. Responses are sought by May 30.

It’s the latest sign of interest from Hochul’s energy policy experts in an “all-of-the-above” approach to reducing emissions and achieving the state’s climate goals. NYSERDA’s focus in the request is on using clean fuels in the transportation sector, which aligns with elements of the state’s climate scoping plan. The plan called for the state to “evaluate and consider adopting” a low-carbon fuel standard for the transportation sector, which would promote biofuels and electrification by raising the cost for fossil fuels. Hochul in her 2024 State of the State directed state agencies to launch that study. No results have been released, but NYSERDA and DEC are working with ICF on it, a spokesperson told POLITICO in January 2025.

Dairy farms and landfills in New York are already producing pipeline-grade renewable natural gas, but the environmental benefits are largely being sold in California and elsewhere since there’s little market for the fuel in New York. “New York dairy farms implement science-based management practices daily to protect our natural resources, and it’s encouraging to see NYSERDA and lawmakers considering ways our farms can continue to recycle materials, reduce emissions, and contribute to the state’s climate goals,” said Allyson Jones-Brimmer, vice president of regulatory and legislative affairs with the Northeast Dairy Producers Association.

Environmental justice groups have opposed widespread adoption and promotion of biofuels, as they’d still emit health-harming co-pollutants. They prefer a strict focus on electrification efforts to eliminate those pollutants in their communities. “NYSERDA should invest in giving New Yorkers access to clean, energy-efficient technologies that we know work well, like heat pumps and electric vehicles, rather than chasing dirty false solutions that will continue to pollute New York communities,” said Hillary Aidun, senior associate attorney with Earthjustice.

The New York League of Conservation Voters and other supporters of the clean fuel standard concept argue diesel trucks will remain on the road for years to come and fuel switching will reduce emissions in the near term. Fuel suppliers who have advocated for biofuels to be included in the state’s emissions reduction efforts praised NYSERDA’s request for information as a positive sign. “Biofuels, including renewable diesel, should be a critical component of an all-of-the-above approach to meeting New York’s energy and emissions goals,” said New York State Energy Coalition CEO Rocco J. Lacertosa and Empire State Energy Association Executive Director Kris DeLair in a joint statement. “The state is taking important steps to make an impact today and lead innovation that drives progress in the years ahead.” — Marie J. French

MIND THE FUNDING GAP: One of the asks from environmental groups and lawmakers as budget negotiations officially enter overtime is for a program to address issues preventing low- and moderate-income households from accessing energy efficiency and other decarbonization programs. Dubbed the “Green Affordable Pre-Electrification,” or GAP Fund, lawmakers and environmental advocates called for $200 million for the program to remediate at least 10,000 homes annually. A report funded by WE ACT 4 Change last month estimated that between 550,000 and 1 million low- and moderate-income households need structural improvements or other upgrades before being able to access weatherization or electrification programs. The Fiscal Policy Institute placed the total need for funding at $11 billion.

The Assembly included money for this concept in its one-house budget with specifics for the $1 billion proposed by Hochul. The Senate included the legislation (S3315/A2101) in its one-house budget. It’s just one of many specific programs environmental groups are pushing to get funded that may end up getting a boost from Hochul’s $1 billion “Sustainable Future Fund.” Other asks have included funding for electric school buses as concerns about a mandate for new purchases rise and thermal energy network projects for college campuses.

“It’s time to fill this gap,” said Assemblymember Didi Barrett, chair of the Energy Committee. “We do have some great programs in New York but in order to make them accessible for low- and moderate-income families we have to make sure they can do the things they need to do to access these sustainability programs.” Barrett called on Hochul to support the proposal. — Marie J. French

RELIABILITY IN FOCUS: The New York Post zeroed in on reliability issues highlighted in a recent analysis that backers intended to underscore their opposition to letting utilities build new renewables. “A bombshell report from a clean energy group admitted that shifting to solar and wind may mean chaos for New York’s power grid as the state’s green energy law creates hurdles for cost and reliability,” the Post’s Carl Campanile wrote about the FTI Consulting report on utility-owned generation.

The FTI report includes a disclaimer that it does not necessarily represent the views of backers including the Alliance for Clean Energy, Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc., solar trade groups and others. The report cites the state’s independent grid operator and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which sets reliability standards, raising concerns about the slow progress of renewables and retirement of fossil fuel plants as demand for power expands. “New York faces hurdles in maintaining reliability due to ambitious renewables targets, the projected retirement of much of its flexible fossil generation fleet, growing load, and extreme weather,” the report states.

“The point of the Report and its findings were to demonstrate the increased costs associated with utility projects versus [independent power generators], amongst other issues,” said Gavin Donohue, the head of IPPNY. The findings were presented at IPPNY’s conference in Albany last week. They mainly focused on the cost declines for electricity supply in New York since utilities were largely barred from owning generation assets. The report concluded that utilities would face all the same issues slowing renewable development in New York that private developers have. The industry was concerned because utility ownership was floated in the state’s draft report on progress toward the 70 percent renewable by 2030 target, which New York will not meet. That report includes several actions to continue investing in new renewables and speed up progress despite the delay — a final version is expected this month.

The New York Post “mischaracterized” the report, said Marguerite Wells, head of ACE New York. “To completely change how our grid works and all the generation on it brings a lot of challenges,” she said. “What we were really calling out was that utility ownership of renewables would make it more expensive for ratepayers. The challenges, which we’ve acknowledged, are not new news.. and we’re working on solutions.”

The report also highlights delays by the state’s Public Service Commission in defining “zero emission” resources that would support the achieving of the 2040 zero emissions electric grid target in the climate law. The state’s own analysis, independent researchers and the New York Independent System Operator has concluded there will need to be thousands of megawatts of new, dispatchable, zero-emissions resources to meet that target and maintain reliability. Wind, existing nuclear and hydropower, solar and current battery technology won’t be sufficient, according to those reports. But it’s not clear what that technology will be or how the state will promote development.

Gov. Kathy Hochul has in the past year focused on the potential of new nuclear to support a decarbonized grid. She rejected a proposal to build new gas plants in New York City in 2021 that developers argued would support grid reliability and reduce overall emissions. The state issued regulations to retire some of the oldest, most polluting fossil fuel power plants, in 2019. But those rules included provisions to keep the plants available if needed — and some are staying online after the NYISO identified problems meeting peak summer demand this year if they retire.

There are off-ramps elsewhere. The climate law allows the PSC to modify the state’s electricity targets if they threaten reliability or are linked to more unpaid utility bills. The New York Power Authority is required to retire its small downstate fossil fuel power plants by 2030, but can delay if retirements risk reliability or would raise emissions from other power plants near vulnerable communities.

“The governor has led by example in New York’s ongoing transition to a clean energy economy: we have one of the cleanest grids in the nation — with 50% zero-emission electricity — and are a gold standard in reliability,” Hochul spokesperson Paul DeMichele told the New York Post. “The governor recognizes that we can only continue to serve as that good example if the lights stay on and costs are low — and she will use every tool at her disposal to ensure that happens.” — Marie J. French

CLIMATE LAWSUIT FILED — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Green groups are suing in state court to force Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration to implement New York’s landmark climate law. Four environmental groups filed a lawsuit Monday that claims the Department of Environmental Conservation is violating the climate law by failing to adopt regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The lawsuit alleges the DEC is also running afoul of the state constitutional right to clean air and a healthy environment.

“DEC’s failure to comply with its mandatory duty to regulate threatens New York’s climate targets as well as New Yorkers’ health and wellbeing,” the lawsuit states.

Hochul has delayed the rollout of the cap-and-trade style program she first embraced during her State of the State speech in 2023. The governor has since been more focused on the potential cost concerns and economic impacts of her signature program to abide by the state’s climate law.",https://static.politico.com/3d/ee/f4d549cf4e548af6712990ce5b9e/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 10:56:08.810179

The partnership includes the long-term lease of eight Airbus A320neo aircraft, designed to support the airline’s continued expansion and sustainability goals.

As part of the agreement, two of the aircraft have already been delivered, while the remaining six are scheduled for delivery throughout 2025. The deal strengthens the relationship between AviLease and Turkish Airlines, one of the world’s fastest-growing carriers, as it enhances its narrow-body operations with next-generation, fuel-efficient aircraft.

The Airbus A320neo is known for its reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions, making it a key component in Turkish Airlines’ broader fleet modernization strategy. The airline has made sustainability a core focus of its operations, and adding these aircraft contributes directly to that mission while also boosting its ability to serve short- and medium-haul routes more efficiently.

Edward O’Byrne, Chief Executive Officer of AviLease, stated, “We thank the Turkish Airlines team for their partnership, and we are delighted to further strengthen our relationship. These aircraft will support Turkish Airlines’ growth plans while contributing to their fleet modernisation strategy and sustainability goals.”

AviLease’s Growing Presence in Global Aviation

With this agreement, AviLease continues its rapid ascent as a major player in global aircraft leasing. Backed by the long-term capital of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), AviLease has positioned itself as a strategic asset under the kingdom’s Vision 2030 initiative. The lessor currently owns and manages a portfolio of 200 aircraft—primarily new-technology, fuel-efficient models—leased to 48 airlines around the world.

Founded to align with Saudi Arabia’s National Aviation Strategy, AviLease operates globally with a team of 85 aviation professionals across five offices. Its aim is not only to be a top-10 global aircraft lessor but also to drive innovation and sustainability within the aviation finance sector. The Turkish Airlines partnership demonstrates how AviLease is leveraging its capital and expertise to form long-term relationships with leading global carriers.

The A320neo aircraft included in the agreement are particularly well-suited for Turkish Airlines’ needs. Offering lower operational costs and increased range compared to earlier models, these jets help airlines reduce their environmental footprint while maintaining strong performance on busy regional routes.

This move comes at a time when global airlines are increasingly focused on fleet renewal to meet tightening environmental regulations and rising fuel costs. Turkish Airlines’ decision to lease from AviLease rather than purchase the aircraft outright reflects a broader trend toward financial flexibility and capital efficiency in airline operations.

For AviLease, deals like this one with Turkish Airlines mark important milestones in building a globally diversified client base. The lessor’s expanding portfolio and growing list of partner airlines signal its role as a key enabler of aviation growth, especially for airlines seeking modern fleets to support ambitious expansion strategies.

As both companies continue to pursue growth and innovation, this agreement reflects a shared vision for the future of air travel—one that is sustainable, efficient, and globally connected.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/avilease-turkish-airlines-a320neo-lease-agreement-group-photo.webp,N,,2025-04-07 10:56:12.638259

Among them is Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, which will supply clean hydrogen to the Inchdairnie Whisky distillery—set to become a sustainable distilling operation by 2027.
Projects in this round include plans to use hydrogen in ammonia production, brick and glass manufacturing, clean power generation, and sustainable aviation fuel.
Spanning England, Scotland, and Wales, the HAR2 shortlist signals the UK’s growing ambitions to become a clean energy superpower.","A new wave of hydrogen-powered projects has been unveiled today as part of the government’s efforts to cut emissions, revive industrial heartlands and drive economic growth.

In total 27 projects have been shortlisted for the next stage of the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2), a scheme aimed at supporting low-carbon hydrogen production nationwide.

The hydrogen industry has already drawn in £400 million of private investment in areas such as Milford Haven and High Marnham, creating 700 direct construction and operations jobs.

With this latest shortlist, the government hopes to unlock more than £1 billion in private sector investment by 2029.

Labour says the push on hydrogen is about reindustrialising the nation, pointing to the wide range of jobs the sector could support—from apprenticeships and graduate roles to technically skilled positions like engineers, welders and pipefitters.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones, said:

We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.

Among them is Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, which will supply clean hydrogen to the Inchdairnie Whisky distillery—set to become a sustainable distilling operation by 2027.

Hydrogen is seen as a key tool in helping heavy-emitting industries decarbonise.

Projects in this round include plans to use hydrogen in ammonia production, brick and glass manufacturing, clean power generation, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Green hydrogen, which is produced by splitting water using renewable electricity, offers a zero-carbon alternative for powering key parts of the economy, from transport to industry.

These initiatives are expected to support progress toward 2050’s zero carbon emissions goal and increasing production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), while ensuring technological advancement and policy support those efforts.

SAF is a critical solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint, but its limited availability and high costs pose challenges for the industry, as it operates on thin profit margins.

ZEERO’s biofuels provide more affordable alternatives to fossil fuel, allowing sustainability goals to be met in a cost-effective manner. In addition, its co-ownership and climate contributing funding model enables sector-wide collaboration, promoting clean-energy investment in SAF and aiding decarbonisation efforts.

Nico Nicholas, chief executive and co-founder of ZEERO said: “We are thrilled to join IATA’s Strategic Partnerships Program and contribute to the aviation industry’s sustainability mission. This collaboration represents a major step forward for ZEERO as we continue to pioneer scalable, high-impact solutions that integrate cutting-edge renewable energy technologies. By working alongside IATA and its members, we aim to accelerate the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient aviation ecosystem.”

Dr. Preeti Jain, head of net zero research and programs at the IATA sustainability and economics division, added: “We are pleased to welcome ZEERO to the IATA Strategic Partnerships Program.

The partnership marks the latest step in Qantas and Airbus’ wider US$200 million joint initiative launched in 2022, aimed at fast-tracking SAF production.

The companies said their support for early-stage innovation is intended to address the current gap between promising climate technologies and large-scale commercial rollout in Australia.

Fiona Messent, the Qantas Group’s chief sustainability officer, said SAF remains the airline’s most viable near-term decarbonisation option.

“As well as funding, this partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated in the SAF supply chain,” she said.

“For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit.”

CTP, which specialises in scaling climate-related technologies in sectors like energy and logistics, will invest in both local and international start-ups on behalf of Qantas and Airbus. The companies may later pursue additional investments in ventures that show promise for application in Australia.

Julie Kitcher, Airbus Chief Sustainability Officer, added that decarbonising aviation demands cooperation from across the aviation and energy landscape.

“This partnership with CTP and Qantas highlights that the scaling of Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs innovative solutions for a nascent technology that will drive innovation, attract investment and create new jobs in Australia.”

The move is one of a number of major initiatives by local aviation firms to embrace SAFs, which have the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

Last month, for example, Australian Aviation reported how Virgin has partnered with Viva Energy to trial SAF in departing flights from Whitsunday Coast Airport.

The agreement, to last from March to July 2025, will see Virgin use a blend of A1 jet fuel and 30–40 per cent synthetic SAF made from waste and residue feedstocks, which the airline says is fully compatible with existing aircraft, fuelling infrastructure and regulatory and safety requirements.

Air New Zealand, meanwhile, last year signed a deal for 9 million litres of SAF that will be blended with conventional jet fuel.

In 2022, former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce argued Australia should be beating other nations to produce large quantities of SAF.

“Australians are the most competitive people I’ve ever come across,” Joyce said. “We should be making it into a World Cup. I think we’d win if that were the case.”

Joyce was a long-term advocate of encouraging more production of SAFs in Australia, branding it a “huge opportunity” that would create “a huge amount of jobs”.

“It’s a shame if Qantas meets its 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel target in 2030 by just buying it offshore. That would be terrible outrage in my mind, and it’s a terrible dropping of the ball in Australia.”","https://res.cloudinary.com/momentum-media-group-pty-ltd/images/c_fill,w_1200/f_auto/v1724895113/Australian%20Aviation/videoframe_215269_o0gjkc/videoframe_215269_o0gjkc.png?_i=AA",N,,2025-04-07 12:57:42.480401

The UK Government is hoping for the nation to host 10GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 – a target set by the Conservatives.
The 27 shortlisted projects are a mix of green hydrogen projects, whereby hydrogen is produced via electrolysis processes with water that are powered by renewable electricity, and projects where fossil fuels are used and man-made carbon capture technologies are deployed.
The Hydrogen Energy Association’s CEO Dr Emma Guthrie said the shortlist is a “much-anticipated announcement” which “brings vital clarity” to the sector.
The developers of the shortlisted projects are required to further develop their projects and provide updated information to DESNZ.","The Department for Energy Security and Net-Zero (DESNZ) has announced today (7 April) a shortlist of 27 projects under the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2).

HAR2 enables the developers of hydrogen production projects to compete for capital grant support and revenue support, the latter under the Hydrogen Production Business Model.

Through the previous round, HAR1, held by Rishi Sunak’s administration, DESNZ confirmed £90m in capital grant support and more than £2bn of revenue support to 11 projects totalling 124MW of production capacity.

Five of these projects have signed their contracts, including the Bradford Low Carbon project in Yorkshire and the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in northeast Scotland.

The UK Government is hoping for the nation to host 10GW of low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 – a target set by the Conservatives. The Labour-led Government has subsequently claimed that the hydrogen industry has the potential to attract more than £1bn of private sector investment into the UK by 2029.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones said: “We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

“From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy

generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.”

Low-carbon hydrogen standard

Only projects which meet the UK Government’s low-carbon hydrogen standard are eligible to apply for HAR1 and HAR2 funding.

Hydrogen is fast becoming a popular option for decarbonising heating processes and transport fuels, as it produces no greenhouse gas emissions at the point of combustion. However, hydrogen needs to be manufactured, and this process can be high-carbon. Around 92% of global hydrogen production is ‘grey’, i.e. produced by steam methane reforming from fossil fuels.

The 27 shortlisted projects are a mix of green hydrogen projects, whereby hydrogen is produced via electrolysis processes with water that are powered by renewable electricity, and projects where fossil fuels are used and man-made carbon capture technologies are deployed.

Hydrogen produced from the shortlisted projects would serve a range of industries including glass manufacturing, brick making, ammonia production and the production of alternative aviation fuels.

A full list of the shortlisted projects can be found here.

The Hydrogen Energy Association’s CEO Dr Emma Guthrie said the shortlist is a “much-anticipated announcement” which “brings vital clarity” to the sector.

Dr Guthrie added: “The funding support offered through HAR2 gives our members and the wider industry the confidence to gear up for delivery, unlocking investment, creating jobs, and driving economic growth.”

A project’s inclusion on the shortlist does not guarantee Government support and, as was the case with HAR1, it is unlikely that all projects shortlisted under HAR2 will secure Government funding. The developers of the shortlisted projects are required to further develop their projects and provide updated information to DESNZ.

This is a big move as the airline navigates through its steps of strategic development, reconsolidating its status as one of China’s top airlines.

Boeing 787-8 Phasing out from Fleet

China Southern Airlines’ fleet restructuring started back in 2022. Three of China’s top airlines have been at their fifth year of loss following a recent release of financial results for 2024. Restructuring the fleet has helped China Southern Airlines boost operational cost-effectiveness.

As the first Chinese airline to operate with Boeing 787-8 aircraft, the airline is now phasing the model out. They own a total of 28 Boeing 787 aircraft, and after selling 10 787-8 aircraft, the fleet will operate with only 787-9 aircraft. The model has a higher passenger capacity and longer flight distance. With this restructuring step, the airline expects higher operational efficiency, which would lessen its loss and potentially bring in more revenue as the market evolves.

The deal’s starting total price is at RMB 3.964 B.

Fleet Restructuring and Strategic Development

This is not the first step China Southern Airlines has taken to recover from its loss. Starting from 2022, the airline has sold multiple A380 aircraft, amounting to RMB 14.7 B, and these steps have seen significant improvement in the airline’s performance.

With increasing competition both domestically and internationally, China’s top airlines have taken different steps to up their game in the aviation industry. Besides expanding flight routes to different regions, fleet updating and restructuring is undoubtedly also key to polishing the airline’s operations.

This step in strategic development shows again the airline’s ambition to consolidate its influence as China’s leading airline.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Boeing_787-8_China_Southern_Airlines_16182136580.jpg?fit=1280%2C815&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-07 07:56:09.636042

This agreement aims to combine the expertise of both companies: Ecopetrol in fuel production and LATAM in airline operations and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) testing.

First Flights with Low-Emission Fuel

As part of this collaboration, LATAM Airlines Colombia will operate more than 700 flights using Jet A1 co-processed with 1% renewable raw materials, produced at Ecopetrol’s Cartagena refinery.

This fuel will be distributed at the airports of Barranquilla, Medellín, and San Andrés, marking a milestone in the adoption of SAF in the country.

For Ricardo Roa Barragán, president of Ecopetrol, this initiative represents a key step toward developing more sustainable fuels:

“This is the beginning of a transformation that will enable the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels in Colombia and Latin America. At Ecopetrol, we remain committed to innovations that bring us closer to fuels with up to 50% renewable components.”

Meanwhile, Erika Zarante, CEO of LATAM Airlines Colombia, emphasized the importance of this agreement in the airline’s environmental strategy:

“LATAM was the first airline to operate flights with biofuels in Colombia. This alliance is another step forward in our commitment to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and strengthen local infrastructure for SAF development.”

Emission Offsets and Supply Chain

In line with its sustainability goals, LATAM will offset the emissions generated by transporting this fuel through the Co2Bio project, which protects over 270,000 hectares of forests and wetlands in Colombia’s Orinoquía region.

Additionally, the distribution and storage of the co-processed fuel will be managed by World Fuel Services and Chevron.

Andrés Roque, Vice President of Supply for Latin America at World Fuel Services, highlighted the importance of this regional effort:

“We have supplied more than 170 million liters of SAF worldwide. Being part of this initiative in Latin America demonstrates our commitment and that of our strategic partners.”

Research and Development of SAF in Colombia

The fuel used in this alliance is the result of more than 15 years of research by the Colombian Institute of Petroleum and Energy for the Transition (ICPET), which has developed methods to incorporate renewable raw materials into refining.

The co-processed Jet A1 fuel was produced in October 2024 at the Cartagena Refinery and meets international ASTM D1655-24b standards, ensuring its compatibility with commercial aircraft without technical modifications.

Looking ahead, Ecopetrol plans to establish sustained SAF production at the Cartagena refinery and develop a dedicated plant in Barrancabermeja.

Depending on the technologies applied, this fuel could reduce CO₂ emissions by 50% to 80% compared to conventional Jet A1.

LATAM’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation in Colombia

LATAM Airlines has been working for over a decade to promote sustainable fuels in Latin America. In 2013, it operated the first flight with biofuel in Colombia, and since then, has formed alliances to strengthen the regional industry.

As well as reducing Microsoft’s emissions from business travel, the funding for alternative aviation fuel will also cut CO2 from the company’s freight carried by IAG’s airlines.
IAG has set the target of using at least 10 per cent alternative fuel for its flights by 2030 – these fuels made up 1.9 per cent of the group’s total fuel mix during 2024.","European airline giant IAG and tech firm Microsoft have agreed a new extended deal to co-fund the purchase of alternative aviation fuels until the end of the decade.

IAG, which owns British Airways, Iberia and Aer Lingus, originally struck a co-funding deal with Microsoft for what the aviation industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in 2023.

In a statement, the two companies said the new five-year deal was the “largest and longest” agreement between an airline operator and a corporate client to reduce Scope 3 emissions from the company’s business travel.

The new deal will see Microsoft co-fund an additional 39,000 tonnes of SAF, which would reduce “lifecycle” carbon emissions by approximately 113,000 tonnes. The fuel will be manufactured in the UK by Phillips 66 and at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels production facility in the US.

Alternative aviation fuels can be produced from a variety of feedstocks and can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional kerosene-based fuels. Phillips 66 converts used cooking oil and food waste into jet fuel, while Lanzajet creates bioethanol from alcohol.

As well as reducing Microsoft’s emissions from business travel, the funding for alternative aviation fuel will also cut CO2 from the company’s freight carried by IAG’s airlines.

Julia Fidler, Microsoft’s environmental sustainability fuel and materials decarbonisation lead, said the extended deal with IAG would bring the company “closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030”, as well as helping to increase production of alternative fuels.

""We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement,” she added.

IAG has set the target of using at least 10 per cent alternative fuel for its flights by 2030 – these fuels made up 1.9 per cent of the group’s total fuel mix during 2024.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group sustainability officer, added: “We’re pleased to work with like-minded organisations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions.

“Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/1_News/Air_Travel/LanzaJet%20Freedom%20Pines%20Fuels%20%20web.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-04-07 07:56:28.819962

These ZEV Mandate updates aim to provide greater flexibility for automakers while keeping the country on track to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.

The revised ZEV Mandate, unveiled as part of a broader strategy to reinforce industrial growth amidst global economic uncertainty, will make it easier for manufacturers to adapt production lines and meet evolving consumer demands.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasised that British brands such as Rolls-Royce, Vauxhall, and Land Rover will benefit from enhanced stability and long-term support as they transition to electric vehicle (EV) production.

Starmer added: “I am determined to back British brilliance. Now more than ever, UK businesses and working people need a government that steps up, not stands aside.

“That means action, not words. So today, I am announcing bold changes to the way we support our car industry.

“This will help ensure home-grown firms can export British cars built by British workers around the world, and the industry can look forward with confidence, as well as back with pride.”

Flexibility and realism for a smoother transition

Recognising the complexity of transitioning to EV manufacturing, the UK Government has adjusted the ZEV Mandate to give carmakers more leeway.

While the core 2030 target remains – phasing out the sale of new petrol and diesel cars – manufacturers will now have increased flexibility on how and when they meet emissions targets leading up to the deadline.

Among the key revisions are the extended allowances for hybrid vehicle sales, with models like the Toyota Prius and Nissan e-Power permitted until 2035.

Additionally, rules allowing manufacturers to borrow ZEV credits will continue through to 2030, helping them manage production and innovation timelines more effectively.

This flexibility includes the ability to transfer credits between vans and cars, with defined ratios to preserve credibility in carbon reduction.

EV demand surges as government doubles down on infrastructure

The UK’s commitment to electrification is underscored by rising EV sales, which jumped over 40% in March compared to last year.

With over 382,000 electric vehicles sold in the UK in 2024, the nation now leads the European market and ranks third globally.

To support this growth, more than 75,000 public EV chargepoints are already in operation, with new ones being installed every 29 minutes.

A further £2.3bn in public funding is boosting British EV manufacturing and expanding the country’s charging network. This is complemented by generous tax incentives aimed at making EV ownership more accessible.

With operational savings of around £1,100 annually for EV drivers charging at home overnight and a growing selection of affordable models – including nearly 30 new electric cars under £30,000 – the shift to electric is becoming increasingly attractive to UK motorists.

Safeguarding British icons while embracing change

In a nod to the UK’s rich automotive heritage, small and micro-volume manufacturers – including luxury marques like McLaren and Aston Martin – will be exempt from ZEV Mandate targets.

This approach allows Britain’s high-performance vehicle segment to continue thriving without compromising the broader push for electrification.

The updated mandate also grants van manufacturers additional time, with internal combustion engine (ICE) vans permitted until 2035.

This phased transition will provide essential breathing space for both large-scale producers and supply chains to scale up zero-emission options.

A modern industrial strategy to power the future

Scheduled for full release this spring, a new Industrial Strategy will provide the roadmap for capitalising on emerging sectors like EVs.

The strategy is expected to focus on securing investment, supporting innovation, and driving sustainable economic growth across the UK.

In tandem with these plans, the government is working closely with the automotive sector to adapt to changing global trade dynamics.

As new international tariffs come into play, particularly from the United States, UK ministers have pledged to keep industry support under review and ensure competitiveness is protected.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander added: “We will always back British business. In the face of global economic challenges and stifled by a lack of certainty and direction for too long, our automotive industry deserves clarity, ambition and leadership. That is exactly what we are delivering today.

“Our ambitious package of strengthening reforms will protect and create jobs – making the UK a global automotive leader in the switch to EVs – all the while meeting our core manifesto commitment to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.”

ZEV mandate marks a turning point for the UK automotive industry

With the ZEV Mandate updates, the UK Government is balancing ambition with practicality – ensuring that its climate targets remain intact while providing crucial breathing room for automakers.

As the country accelerates towards a zero-emission future, the combination of policy flexibility, infrastructure investment, and market incentives is positioning the UK as a global leader in electric mobility.

The changes announced today highlight a unified effort to future-proof the British car industry, spark innovation, and deliver sustainable growth for future generations.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2374438937.jpg,N,,2025-04-07 07:56:34.782494

Our projects will support industrial decarbonisation and the government’s mission to build a low-carbon hydrogen economy by 2030.”","The UK government has shortlisted 27 low-carbon hydrogen projects under the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2) issued today.

With pressure rising to accelerate decarbonisation and spur more investment into the hydrogen sector, the shortlist of projects covers manufacturing and industrial practices, ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick making, and sustainable aviation fuel production.

The industry has the potential to attract over £1bn of private sector investment into the UK by 2029, providing companies can be convinced the country has a consistent and supportive policy environment which will facilitate growth and offtake agreements.

Total funding for HAR2 was not released but it is expected to provide revenue support through the country’s Hydrogen Production Business Model over 15-year contracts, similar to HAR1, according to gasworld’s sister title, H2 View.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones, said the country would be “deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology.”

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said the much-anticipated announcement has delivered vital clarity to the UK’s hydrogen sector, providing a crucial boost for projects that will drive forward the country’s low-carbon transition.

“The funding support offered through HAR2 gives our members and the wider industry the confidence to gear up for delivery, unlocking investment, creating jobs, and driving economic growth,” she said.

“This is great news – not just for the hydrogen sector but for the UK’s ambition to become energy secure and a global leader in clean energy.”

The First Hydrogen Allocation Round saw 11 projects being allocated over £2bn in government funding. One recipient, Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, will produce hydrogen for the Inchdairnie Whiskey distillery which intends to sustainably distil whisky by 2027.

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said the higher number of its members making the second round marked a crucial step for scaling electrolytic hydrogen.

“This progress builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy – reinforcing the sector’s crucial role in economic growth and energy security,” she said.

Tim Stedman, CEO, Storegga, the CO2 capture and storage solutions company, said, “We welcome the next stage of the HAR2 process. Our projects will support industrial decarbonisation and the government’s mission to build a low-carbon hydrogen economy by 2030.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/10/shutterstock_2196899169-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-04-07 07:57:06.111632

“We’ve launched the design of a small engine demonstrator, which is around the kind of thrust level you’d need for a narrow body application,” says Alan Newby, Rolls-Royce’s director of aerospace technology and future programs.
The broader strategy also includes renewed investment in tests of the larger UltraFan, which will continue to be developed in parallel.
“I don’t know whether it’s going to be a widebody first, a narrowbody first, Boeing first or Airbus first.
“We are rebuilding engine one [the first UltraFan demonstrator] now, and our plan is to get that ready to test by the end of this year.","Rolls-Royce aims by mid-year to freeze the design of a smaller demonstrator version of the UltraFan geared turbofan as part of plans signaling its serious intent to target the single-aisle market in the 2030s.

The demonstrator is scheduled to undergo ground tests in 2028 and will pave the way for a more than 30,000-lb.-thrust class engine designed to power successors to the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737. The initiative fulfills a strategic goal unveiled by CEO Tufan Erginbilgic in late 2023 and marks a key step in Rolls-Royce’s renewed ambition to reenter the narrowbody sector, which it effectively abandoned with the 2012 sale to Pratt & Whitney of its shares in the International Aero Engines collaborative venture.

The new geared engine demonstrator will leverage technology developed for the much larger 80,000-lb.-thrust UltraFan, which ran in 2023 and is positioned to compete in the lower thrust bracket with the Open Fan in development by CFM joint venture partners GE Aerospace and Safran, as well as a next-generation variant of Pratt & Whitney’s PW1100G geared turbofan.

“We’ve launched the design of a small engine demonstrator, which is around the kind of thrust level you’d need for a narrow body application,” says Alan Newby, Rolls-Royce’s director of aerospace technology and future programs. “The reason for doing that is manifold. One is to show to our customers that we’re serious about it, show to our suppliers that we’re serious about it and also show to our potential partners that we’re serious about it,” he adds.

“Whatever happens regarding airframe strategies, and any partner strategies that can happen, we want to make sure that we’ve got the technology ready and proven at that scale, so that we’re ready to adapt,” Newby says. The broader strategy also includes renewed investment in tests of the larger UltraFan, which will continue to be developed in parallel.

The plan covers all potential new aircraft developments, Newby says. “I don’t know whether it’s going to be a widebody first, a narrowbody first, Boeing first or Airbus first. So we’ve got to make sure that we are ready for any eventuality from the market perspective, and we’ve got the technology proven at both scales,” he adds.

“That’s effectively what I’m trying to do at the moment, is make sure we’ve got the data on both large and small engines, so we’re ready to go when the market decides which way it’s going to jump,” Newby says. “We are rebuilding engine one [the first UltraFan demonstrator] now, and our plan is to get that ready to test by the end of this year. In parallel, we’ve got another engine that we’re rebuilding. And that one that will go on to do further testing, and possibly other assets on top of that one.”

The small UltraFan initiative leverages design elements developed for Rolls-Royce’s Pearl 10X—a business jet engine based on the company’s Advance2 core project. It also leans on technologies from Heaven—for Hydrogen Engine Architecture Virtually Engineered Novelly—an ongoing project under Europe’s Clean Aviation research initiative aimed specifically at scaling the UltraFan architecture to suit short-medium range applications.

Targeting a 20% integrated fuel burn reduction, as well as enabled for sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen, the Heaven project has included tests of an advanced power gearbox, improved combustor designs and the design of a new intermediate pressure turbine.

Further tests planned for the second half of Heaven include completion of the preliminary design of an SMR engine and validation of elements to a technology readiness level of five. “Clean Aviation Phase Two is about taking those to demonstration, so clearly that’s an opportunity to put something like this into that program,” Newby says.

“We also continue to work closely with the ATI [the UK Aerospace Technology Institute] and in Germany as well. So there’s a range of funding sources we can use on that one, but it fits well with the calls in Europe at the moment,” he adds.

Rolls-Royce, meanwhile, declines to comment on reports in the Financial Times that it is in talks with the UK government to help fund part of the estimated $3.9 billion (£3 billion) development cost for the smaller UltraFan. However, a spokesperson for the engine-maker says, “we believe narrowbody represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver a step-change in growth for the UK economy.”

The engine-maker believes the narrowbody market is potentially worth more than £100 billion to the UK in terms of the gross value added it would create for the economy through taxable jobs, exports and economic activity in the supply chain. Rolls, which currently employs 21,000 people in the UK and invests around £800 million a year in R&D, also believes that entry into the narrowbody engine field could create 40,000 new skilled jobs across the company and the supply chain.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-07 07:57:11.518693

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Twenty-seven hydrogen projects have been selected for the next stage of the Second Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR2) – supporting low-carbon hydrogen production in the UK. The industry has the potential to attract over £1 billion of private sector investment into the UK by 2029, supporting the government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower.

Hydrogen will help deliver a new era of clean energy across the UK and decarbonise emission-intensive industries. It has already attracted £400 million of private sector investment in towns and cities such as Milford Haven in Wales and High Marnham in Nottinghamshire, and is creating over 700 direct jobs in construction and operations.

Government support for hydrogen will help create thousands more jobs in the sector and reindustrialising the UK’s proud manufacturing regions. This includes roles for apprentices, graduates and technically trained professionals, such as engineers, welders, skilled construction workers, pipefitters and operations specialists.

Today’s shortlist includes projects that could use hydrogen to help tackle the climate crisis by decarbonising their manufacturing and industrial practices, including ammonia production, new clean power generation, glass manufacturing, brick making, and sustainable aviation fuel production.

Industry Minister Sarah Jones, said:

We are deploying hydrogen at a commercial scale for the first time – not just investing in a technology – but investing in British jobs, our proud manufacturing communities and our energy security.

From distilleries and sustainable aviation fuel to public transport and clean energy generation, hydrogen can power our everyday life and unlock clean energy growth across the country as part of our Plan for Change.

Green hydrogen is produced by using renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, resulting in a zero-carbon fuel that can be used for power generation, transport and industrial processes.

This builds on the success of the First Hydrogen Allocation Round which saw 11 projects being allocated over £2 billion in government funding. One recipient, Whitelee Green Hydrogen in Scotland, will produce hydrogen for the Inchdairnie Whiskey distillery which intends to sustainably distil whisky by 2027.

Stretching across England, Scotland, and Wales, this latest wave of shortlisted HAR2 projects showcases the government’s commitment to create skilled jobs and establish clean energy hubs across Great Britain. The HAR2 shortlist could lead to projects that help support strong supply chains and the delivery of the clean energy superpower mission.

Dr Emma Guthrie, CEO of the Hydrogen Energy Association, said:

This much-anticipated announcement brings vital clarity to the UK’s hydrogen sector, providing a crucial boost for projects that will drive forward the country’s low-carbon transition.

The funding support offered through HAR2 gives our members and the wider industry the confidence to gear up for delivery, unlocking investment, creating jobs, and driving economic growth.

This is great news - not just for the hydrogen sector but for the UK’s ambition to become energy secure and a global leader in clean energy.

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said:

We’re thrilled to see many Hydrogen UK members succeed in the second Hydrogen Allocation Round, marking a crucial step for scaling electrolytic hydrogen.

This progress builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy - reinforcing the sector’s crucial role in economic growth and energy security.

Case studies

In December 2023, the government announced an initial 11 projects from the First Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1), totalling 124 MW of production capacity.

Five of these projects have signed their contracts, including the Bradford Low Carbon project in Yorkshire and the Cromarty Hydrogen Project in northeast Scotland.

The Bradford Low Carbon project, in the heart of the city centre, will use renewable electricity to power a 10.6 MW alkaline electrolyser. Being developed by Hygen and Ryze, it will supply the mobility sector, including JCB diggers and Wrightbus - which developed the world’s first hydrogen powered bus.

The Cromarty Hydrogen Project is being developed by Scottish Power and Storegga. It will use electricity from nearby wind farms to power an 11 MW electrolyser, supplying hydrogen to local industries, including distilleries.

The projects, which include initiatives from RWE, Uniper and Centrica, among others, are expected to supply hydrogen for the power, glass manufacturing, brick-making and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sectors.

Clare Jackson, CEO of Hydrogen UK, said HAR2 “builds on valuable lessons from past rounds and strengthens UK leadership in clean energy.”

The exact total funding amount for HAR2 has not been specified. Nevertheless, it is expected to provide revenue support through the Hydrogen Production Business Model (HPBM) over 15-year contracts, similar to HAR1.

However, in an online statement, the government stressed that it’s “unlikely that all projects will be successful.” It added, “As such being on the shortlist does not imply availability of funding for any of the shortlisted projects.”

In December 2023, the government announced £2bn ($2.6bn) in funding for 11 hydrogen projects for HAR1, offering a combined capacity of 125MW – although delays in critical agreements left them in limbo for a year.

By December 2024, three projects totalling 31.8MW of capacity officially signed agreements for government revenue support.

Additionally, the projects selected under HAR1 ultimately secured less funding than the total available allocation.

The Minnesota Senate Taxes Committee approved legislation in early March 2025 to expand an existing tax credit to encourage the increased production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The current law, which applied a $1.50-per-gallon tax incentive to biomass-derived SAF that achieved at least a 50% reduction in life-cycle greenhouse gas pollution, was originally set to expire on June 30, 2030.

Now, it has been extended to July 1, 2035, and includes an additional provision allowing qualified taxpayers to claim an additional 2 cents per gallon for each percentage point above the base 50% threshold, capping at 50 cents per gallon.

""Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to rapidly decarbonize the aviation industry, provide additional revenue streams for a wide array of farmers, communities, and industries, and create good-paying jobs throughout Minnesota,"" Sen. Robert Kupec (D-MN), one of the co-sponsors of the bill, said in an official statement.

Sen. John Jasinski, another co-sponsor, also emphasized the bill's potential to bolster job creation and expand opportunities for farmers across the state to support crop production and eliminate waste, calling it an ""economic jet engine for the state of Minnesota.""

Durch gezielte Fuel Efficiency-Maßnahmen konnte Lufthansa Cargo im Jahr 2024 rund 5.700 Tonnen Kerosin einsparen, was einer CO2-Reduktion von rund 18.000 Tonnen entspricht.
Gleichzeitig wurde die Ladeinfrastruktur im Lufthansa Cargo Center (LCC) mit insgesamt sechs Ladepunkten an zwei Gebäuden umgesetzt.
Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem branchenführenden SFC-Netzwerk unterstützt die Strategie von Lufthansa Cargo für eine nachhaltigere Zukunft.","Verantwortungsvolles Handeln ist die Grundlage der unternehmerischen Tätigkeit von Lufthansa Cargo. Die Frachtfluglinie setzt auf Qualität, Sicherheit und Zuverlässigkeit beim Luftfrachttransport und ermöglicht globalen Handel so nachhaltig wie möglich. „Unser Anspruch ist es, Verantwortung zu übernehmen und unsere ehrgeizigen Klimaziele weiter voranzutreiben“, sagt Nicole Mies, Head of Communications & Corporate Social Responsibility bei Lufthansa Cargo. „Im Jahr 2024 haben wir gemeinsam mit unseren Kunden, Partnern und der Wissenschaft neue Möglichkeiten ausgelotet, viele Schritte unternommen und wertvolle Fortschritte erzielt. Nicht überall stehen wir schon da, wo wir hinwollen – aber wir arbeiten konsequent weiter daran, eine Luftfracht zu gestalten, die effizient, innovativ und zukunftsorientiert ist.“

Das weltweite Umweltmanagementsystem von Lufthansa Cargo ist erneut nach dem internationalen Umweltstandard ISO 14001 zertifiziert. Es stellt die kontinuierliche und transparente Steuerung, Überwachung und Verbesserung der Umweltbilanz sicher – und das nicht nur in der Luft, sondern auch am Boden. Zur Aufrechterhaltung der Zertifizierung weist das Unternehmen jährlich externen Gutachtern nach, dass die Anforderungen der Norm eingehalten werden und das System auf allen Ebenen funktioniert und gelebt wird.

Moderne Flotte

Als Airline entsteht der gesamte CO2-Fußabdruck von Lufthansa Cargo zu fast 99 Prozent durch den Flugbetrieb. Der derzeit größte Hebel zur Reduktion von CO2 in der Luftfahrt ist der Einsatz neuer, treibstoffeffizienterer Flugzeuge. Flugzeuge der neuesten Generation verbrauchen im Vergleich zu ihren jeweiligen Vorgängermodellen bis zu 30 Prozent weniger Treibstoff und emittieren entsprechend weniger CO2. Lufthansa Cargo setzt in ihrer eigenen Langstreckenflotte mit einem Durchschnittsalter von 7,6 Jahren ausschließlich auf die Boeing 777F – das derzeit modernste und effizienteste Frachtflugzeug seiner Klasse. Im Sommer 2024 begrüßte das Unternehmen seinen 18. Langstreckenfrachter am Flughafen Frankfurt. Weitere sieben Boeing 777-8-Frachter mit der kommenden Technologie sind bestellt und werden bis 2030 erwartet.

SAF-Kooperationen

Der Einsatz von Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ist für nachhaltigeres Fliegen ein entscheidender technologischer Schlüssel und essenziell für die Energiewende in der Luftfahrt. Auf Basis von biogenen Reststoffen hat es über den gesamten Lebenszyklus einen rund 80 Prozent geringeren CO2-Fußabdruck als herkömmliches Kerosin. Mit ihrem Add-on Service „Sustainable Choice“ lädt Lufthansa Cargo alle Kunden dazu ein, einen Beitrag zur Dekarbonisierung der Luftfracht zu leisten. Der optionale Service kann einfach über die Lufthansa Cargo-Homepage hinzugebucht werden und kombiniert die CO2-Reduktion durch SAF-Einsatz mit der Kompensation durch den Beitrag zu hochwertigen Klimaschutzprojekten. Gleichzeitig können große, individuelle Vereinbarungen, sogenannte Bulk Deals, auf interessierte Partner von Lufthansa Cargo zugeschnitten werden. Im Jahr 2024 konnte Lufthansa Cargo auf diese Weise rund 8.500 Tonnen CO2einsparen.

Fuel Efficiency Maßnahmen

Lufthansa Cargo strebt eine maximale Reduktion der CO2-Emissionen im Flugbetrieb an und setzt dabei auf effektive Maßnahmen. Neben einer modernen Flotte und dem Einsatz von nachhaltigem Flugkraftstoff (SAF) liegt der Fokus auf der kontinuierlichen Optimierung des Flugbetriebs. Durch gezielte Fuel Efficiency-Maßnahmen konnte Lufthansa Cargo im Jahr 2024 rund 5.700 Tonnen Kerosin einsparen, was einer CO2-Reduktion von rund 18.000 Tonnen entspricht. Den größten Einzelbeitrag leistet dabei die Statistical Contingency Fuel-Methode (SCF). Diese statistische Analyse ermöglicht, einen Teil der benötigten Reservekraftstoffmenge für jeden Flug präziser zu kalkulieren. Dabei werden historische Flugverbräuche analysiert und aktuelle Faktoren – beispielsweise Wetterbedingungen am Zielflughafen – bei der Treibstoffplanung berücksichtigt. So lassen sich unnötige Kraftstoffreserven vermeiden, ohne die Flugsicherheit zu beeinträchtigen. Darüber hinaus wurde SCF Ende des Jahres 2024 durch eine weitere automatisierte Datenintegration ergänzt, um die Kraftstoffplanung für das Rollen am Boden vor dem Start noch präziser zu kalkulieren. Diese optimierte Taxi Fuel-Berechnung erhöht somit zusätzlich die Effizienz der Treibstoffplanung für den gesamten Flugprozess.

Eine weitere wichtige Maßnahme ist ""RETI"" (Reduced Engine during Taxi In): Dabei wird beim Rollen zur Parkposition – wenn möglich – ein Triebwerk abgeschaltet, wodurch jährlich rund 400 Tonnen Kerosin und 1200 Tonnen CO2 eingespart werden.

Maßnahmen am Boden

Am Boden arbeitet die Frachtfluglinie mit Hochdruck an dem Ziel der CO2-Neutralität bis 2030. Zusätzlich sucht die Organisation im Teamwork immer neue Wege, um Energie, Treibstoffe, Ressourcen und Abfälle zu vermeiden. Ein Beispiel der zahlreichen Maßnahmen aus dem Jahr 2024 ist der Umstellungsstart der Operations-Dienstwagenflotte auf E-Fahrzeuge. Die insgesamt 30 Fahrzeuge, die für Dienstfahrten am Hub Frankfurt eingesetzt werden, sollen schrittweise gegen neue E-Fahrzeuge ausgetauscht werden. Die ersten Neuwagen sind bereits eingetroffen und im Einsatz. Gleichzeitig wurde die Ladeinfrastruktur im Lufthansa Cargo Center (LCC) mit insgesamt sechs Ladepunkten an zwei Gebäuden umgesetzt.

Darüber hinaus werden seit Sommer 2024 defekte und abgelaufene Frachtgurte in Zusammenarbeit mit der WfB Rhein-Main e.V. recycelt. Das wiederverwendbare Material wird für Baustellenabsicherungen oder Dämmplatten genutzt, das Aluminium der Spannschlösser wiederverwertet. So spart Lufthansa Cargo in Frankfurt jährlich mehrere Tonnen Abfall.

100-Flüge-Programm

Zudem unterstützt Lufthansa Cargo aktiv die Erforschung der so genannten Nicht-CO2-Klimaeffekte des Luftverkehrs. Um deren Auswirkungen besser zu verstehen und Maßnahmen zur Verringerung der Gesamtklimawirkung abzuleiten, beteiligt sich die Lufthansa Group an Forschungsprojekten. Lufthansa Cargo hat im Jahr 2024 gemeinsam mit Lufthansa Airlines und anderen deutschen Fluggesellschaften am „100-Flüge-Programm“ teilgenommen, das vom Arbeitskreis klimaneutrale Luftfahrt des Bundeswirtsschafts- und Bundesverkehrsministeriums initiiert wurde. Lufthansa Cargo hat hierfür 23 Flüge ausgewählt, von denen 13 in der Routenplanung in der Flughöhe angepasst wurden, um Kondensstreifen zu vermeiden, und weitere zehn Referenzflüge zum Vergleich. Ziel ist es, Daten zur Vorhersage von Kondensstreifen-Gebieten in der Flugplanung zu nutzen und ihre Qualität und Verlässlichkeit zu testen. Zum Nachweis, ob auf umgeleiteten Flügen tatsächlich Kondensstreifen vermieden werden konnten, werden Satellitenbeobachtungen herangezogen und ausgewertet. Die Auswertung der Flüge erfolgt im Rahmen des Forschungsprojekts „D-KULT“ auf Basis der dort entwickelten Daten und Prototypen von Computerprogrammen, zusammen mit den Projektpartnern Deutscher Wetterdienst, Deutsche Flugsicherung (DFS), Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) und Lufthansa Systems.

Klimaschutz ist Teamwork

Der notwendige Wandel kann nur gemeinsam mit starken Partnern erreicht werden. Lufthansa Cargo ist eng vernetzt und im aktiven Austausch mit ihren Kunden und Innovationstreibern aus Forschung, Wirtschaft und Politik. Im Jahr 2024 konnte das Unternehmen beispielsweise den Beitritt zur Smart Freight Centre Community bekanntgeben. Das Smart Freight Centre (SFC) ist eine internationale Non-Profit-Organisation, die sich auf die Reduzierung von Treibhausgasemissionen im Güterverkehr konzentriert. Ihr Ziel ist es, Mitglieder und Partner bei der Reduzierung ihrer Treibhausgasemissionen zu unterstützen, um bis zum Jahr 2050 oder früher einen emissionsfreien globalen Logistiksektor zu erreichen, der mit dem Pariser Klimaschutzabkommen vereinbar ist. Die Zusammenarbeit mit dem branchenführenden SFC-Netzwerk unterstützt die Strategie von Lufthansa Cargo für eine nachhaltigere Zukunft.
