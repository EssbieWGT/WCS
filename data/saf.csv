The Australian government is investing $10.4 million in two initiatives to develop low carbon liquid fuels and biofuel production capabilities. These projects mark a significant step towards aviation industry decarbonization and achieving net zero targets. The studies will explore the feasibility of establishing a biorefinery facility using innovative biomass to biofuel technology and creating sustainable fuel infrastructure at a major airport. This investment aligns with Australia's commitment to developing domestic SAF production and supporting the transition to cleaner air travel. The projects will not only contribute to greenhouse gas reduction but also boost the country's renewable fuel alternatives sector. Readers will gain insights into cutting-edge hydrothermal liquefaction technology, the potential of sugar mill residues for SAF production, and the future of sustainable aviation in Australia.",https://farmonaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Australias-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Revolution-Pioneering-Renewable-Energy-Projects-for-a-Net-Zero-Future_1.jpg,https://farmonaut.com/australia/australias-sustainable-aviation-fuel-revolution-pioneering-renewable-energy-projects-for-a-net-zero-future/,2025-02-28 00:00:04.701809

The current situation in the production of sustainable aviation fuels is presented along with challenges related to its use. Lignocellulosic biomass is considered a promising feedstock for the production of aviation fuels; its composition, as well as possible conversion routes, are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the levulinic acid as a component received as a result of biomass processing. It is proposed to convert levulinic acid into alkyl levulinates using different simple alcohols to use them as components of sustainable aviation fuels. The method of alkyl levulinates synthesis is described. The basic physical-chemical properties of received products are determined and analyzed. Alkyl levulinates’ properties are compared to conventional jet fuel’s properties. Based on the experimental data, the possibilities of f using lignocellulosic biomass use for sustainable aviation fuel production are substantiated.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/assets/img/ieee_logo_smedia_200X200.png,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10380174/,2025-02-25 00:00:02.446187
