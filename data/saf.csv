The company, known for providing pipe services in the O&G sector, currently focuses on engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning (EPCC) for renewable energy projects. Now, it is considering becoming an asset owner in the biomass space, reports The Edge Malaysia.

Speaking after the company’s 25th annual general meeting, managing director and group CEO Giancarlo Maccagno said that the goal is to move past just building plants for clients. He explained that by securing long-term feedstock supply and energy offtake agreements — such as selling power to utility giant Tenaga Nasional — the company could build a more stable and recurring revenue stream.

Maccagno described the move as a natural progression for Wasco, and one that fits well with its current renewable energy operations. At present, the company is involved in full EPCC projects for biomass facilities, including steam turbine supply, mainly serving the palm oil industry. In both Malaysia and Indonesia, empty fruit bunches (EFB) from palm oil mills present a largely untapped source of biomass energy.

Despite the opportunity, Maccagno stressed that Wasco will only commit to projects once it has secured both supply and demand. “The risk is if either the feedstock provider pulls out or the energy buyer fails to follow through. We won’t proceed unless all key aspects are in place,” he said. He added that each plant could cost between RM30 million and RM40 million.

Wasco is not setting a deadline for its first biomass investment, preferring to wait for the right conditions. “There’s no urgency. Our existing business is performing well. But this strategy offers a promising future, as it can reduce the ups and downs of project-based income,” Maccagno noted.

This move aligns with Malaysia’s broader energy policy, which is increasingly supporting renewable sources like biomass and small hydro, in addition to solar power.

As of the end of financial year 2024, Wasco reported a group order book of RM2.5 billion, with 85% coming from the O&G sector and the remaining 15% from renewable energy. Its tender book currently stands at RM13 billion.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biomass-3.jpeg,N,,2025-05-30 06:56:38.070459

That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies.","General Index (GX) and ATOBA Energy are excited to announce their strategic partnership, bringing a brand-new vision of how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) benchmarks are built. SAF indexes need to be tailored to the unique cost profiles of diverse production technologies, delivering the right information required to scale the SAF industry for aviation goal of net zero by 2050.

For more than half a century, the aviation industry has relied on traditional price reporting services to manage exposure to price risks in the fossil jet fuel market. But the SAF revolution demands a new approach. Unlike traditional fuels, SAF can be produced from a wide variety of certified technologies, each with distinct feedstocks, costs, CO2 reduction capabilities and production scalability – and, at the end, producing similar drop-in aviation fuels. A one-size-fits-all SAF index isn’t fungible in this complex emerging market.

ATOBA recognizes that the immediate hurdle to overcome is unlocking investment and building confidence in bankable long-term offtake agreements for new production facilities. A key enabler to overcoming this challenge is bringing transparency and a level playing field to the industry through the creation of new SAF price indexes, developed by General Index. Each index will be designed to reflect the unique cost profile of the diverse SAF technologies and aggregated to create a benchmark that aligns with regulatory frameworks, regional nuances and market needs.

Neil Bradford, CEO and founder, General Index, said, “Creating transparent and technology-specific SAF price benchmarks is critical to scaling sustainable aviation fuel markets. We’re already a benchmark partner to the European Commission for the official 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Now, by partnering with ATOBA Energy, we’re helping to build the foundational infrastructure needed to attract investment, support offtake agreements, and accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to net zero.”

Arnaud Namer, CEO & co-founder ATOBA Energy, said, “Unlocking investment in sustainable aviation fuel starts with transparency, market confidence, and trusted pricing tools. That’s why we’re proud to partner with General Index to introduce a new generation of SAF price benchmarks tailored to the real cost structures of emerging SAF technologies. These benchmarks are critical to ensuring SAF is competitively priced for airlines—an advantage we deliver thanks to our diversified portfolio of best-in-class SAF producers and long-term offtake aggregation strategy.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Atoba_General_Index_945fca3b32.jpg,N,,2025-05-30 02:57:20.838606

Author: Anna Simet Director of Content & Senior Editor Biodiesel Magazine","It seems that every day this magazine is in production, something changes policywise. Just this week, we’ve seen lots of movement with the release of President Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful bill” and its potential 45Z implications, as well as the U.S. EPA’s delivery of two Renewable Fuel Standard rulemakings to the White House Office of Management and Budget. One of those rulings for the 2026 renewable volume obligations and purportedly “also contains several regulatory changes to the RFS program intended to improve the program’s implementation.”

I haven’t yet come across any speculation as to what these changes are, but rumors allege that the renewable volume obligation proposal for biomass-based diesel will not be set at the industry’s ask of 5.25 billion gallons, but short of that. It’s expected we’ll know in late May or early June, so the waiting game continues.

In any case, I’ve had to make some updates to feature article “Ready to Bounce Back” on page 14, and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if by the time this magazine hits desks, even more has changed. The policy pieces that the industry has been waiting for are long overdue, so these movements are very welcome. My main interview for this article was with Grant Kimberley of the Iowa Biodiesel Board and Iowa Soybean Association. Iowa has the most biodiesel plants of all the states at 10, with a collective production capacity at 416 MMgy. In the article, he discusses the impact that policy inaction has had on Iowa’s biodiesel industry, and what is needed overall to get back to a healthy state. In particular, he emphasizes the critical impact of strong RVOs. “All indications from experts and marketplace are that a strong RVO would reset the RFS in a very positive way, strengthen RIN prices and be a huge boom to the marketplace,” Kimberley says.

Changing gears a bit, our page-21 feature shifts the focus to Canada. In “Fueling Canadian Decarbonization,” associate editor Katie Schroeder takes a deep dive into the Canadian biofuel sector—what it looks like and where it’s headed, the policy and incentives available (and needed) to help with the buildout, and how the United States’ biofuel policy has impacted development there.

Finally, we’re about three weeks out from the International Fuel Ethanol Workshop being held in Omaha, Nebraska, June 10-12. Being held in conjunction with that is the Sustainable Fuels Summit, which is focused solely on biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. It’s great timing to connect with stakeholders and learn about the impacts impending policy could or will have on the industry, among many other things.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers a solution to the industry's 2-3% share of global carbon emissions. Boeing's President for India and South Asia, Salil Gupte, highlighted at the CII Annual Business Summit 2025 in New Delhi that India anticipates 2,500 civil aircraft arrivals in the next two decades. With India's rapid civil aviation growth, local airlines have already ordered over 1,000 planes recently. Gupte emphasized the upcoming fleet renewal in India, foreseeing a younger aircraft fleet that aligns with decarbonization goals. He also underscored India's potential to drive biofuel industrialization for aviation, identifying supply chain efficiency and cost-effectiveness as crucial factors.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) – An unpredictable trade war and daunting environmental targets are on the agenda for global airline bosses at an annual summit in India, as the industry’s outlook is clouded by concerns that geopolitical uncertainty will dampen travel demand and raise costs.

More people are flying than ever before after a full post-pandemic passenger market recovery, but airlines globally are facing rising cost pressures, extended plane delivery delays, lingering supply chain bottlenecks and falling airfares.

On top of this, President Donald Trump’s evolving trade war has upended the global aerospace industry’s decades-old tariff-free status and added a new layer of volatility and risk.

While carriers in Europe and Asia report strong demand for flying, the U.S. airline sector has been hit by a recent slump in travel demand, with carriers struggling to forecast passenger behaviour and operational costs.

The influential International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents more than 300 airlines and over 80% of global air traffic, will hold its annual three-day meeting from Sunday in New Delhi.

The summit, hosted by India’s largest carrier IndiGo, comes as the world’s third-largest air passenger market rapidly expands its aviation industry, and as air travel growth in Asia is expected to outstrip Europe and North America for the next few decades.

India’s recent hostilities with neighbour Pakistan, which is causing Indian airlines to take large, expensive detours around Pakistani airspace, highlights how conflict zones are an increasing burden on airline operations and profitability.

IATA said in February that accidents and incidents related to conflict zones are a top concern for aviation safety requiring urgent global coordination.

Aviation safety will also be in focus after a spate of air accidents in Kazakhstan, South Korea and North America over the past six months, and rising concerns about air traffic control systems in the United States.

NET-ZERO DOUBTS

IATA has increasingly been warning that airlines will not meet their sustainability goals, and that it is not clear how the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and new technologies will be financed.

Airlines agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF, which is made from waste oil and biomass and costs more than conventional jet fuel.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh has in recent weeks said the industry will need to re-evaluate the commitment.

Airlines are being expected to bear the cost of the more expensive fuel and are not getting the support they need from SAF manufacturers, Walsh has said. Delays by Airbus and Boeing in delivering new, more fuel-efficient aircraft are also causing headaches for airlines.

IATA said 1 million metric tons of SAF was produced globally in 2024, below forecasts of 1.5 million tons, and described production as disappointingly slow.

“Demand for SAF continues to outstrip supply, and costs remain prohibitively high. Regulatory frameworks to encourage SAF production are still underdeveloped, inconsistent, or insufficient,” said Subhas Menon, the director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.

Commercial aviation has taken a new big step after the Toulouse Aviation Summit, held under the auspices of the French Presidency of the European Union, the event concluded with a new Declaration calling on all countries to take action to achieve a decarbonized aviation sector by 2050.

The Declaration was signed by 42 States, including the 27 member countries of the European Union, as well as Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Morocco and Georgia. It was also adopted by 146 industry stakeholder groups that participated in the event, including the top five European aviation associations represented through Destination 2050.

Reaching the GHG emission reduction targets proposed by the aviation industry and by organizations such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will require a significant increase in the production and consumption of biofuels, thus boosting the market. In addition, the ability to incorporate unchanged aircraft infrastructure drives demand for biofuels.

Based on biofuel manufacturing technology, the Hydroprocessed Fatty Acid Esters and Fatty Acids – Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) segment is projected to lead the sustainable aviation fuel market during the forecast period.

There have been several initiatives taken by airlines to test and implement blended fueling in their aircraft fleet. For example, in June 2019, United Airlines took a flight from Chicago O'Hare to Los Angeles, powered by a 30% blend of sustainable aviation fuel produced by World Energy. The blended fuel met the same fuel specifications as Jet A with added environmental benefits.

Reporting from San Francisco

US green fuel company HIF Global has a big vision for Texas's Matagorda County: a $7bn (£5.2bn) commercial scale e-methanol factory to supply the world market.

The plant, which it claims would be the largest to date anywhere, would make e-methanol from captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced on site using renewable energy.

Its construction would create thousands of jobs and the product would power ships and planes in a far cleaner way.

But the company has yet to make its final investment decision. It is waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production.

The fate of the subsidies is part of a sweeping budget bill currently under consideration by the Senate.

A version of the legislation passed by the lower house cuts the hydrogen tax credit, amongst others, and scales back more.

The clean hydrogen tax credit would help reduce the cost of the American technology going into the facility, and aide in competing with Chinese e-methanol producers, says Lee Beck, HIF Global's senior vice president for global policy and commercial strategy.

""The goal is not to be dependent on tax credits over the long run, but to get the project started.""

Ms Beck can't say yet what the outcome for the Matagorda facility will be if the tax credit is ultimately killed, except that it will make things hard – and the US isn't the only location the company operates in.

The Trump administration has been particularly hostile to green energy.

Amongst the President's actions since taking office in January include initiating the US's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and temporarily suspending renewable energy projects on federal lands (he has a particular disdain for wind power).

Trump has also directed agencies to pause Green New Deal funds, which he regularly calls ""Green New Scam"" funds: grants and loans being made under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden's presidency in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

Those grants and loans, together with the clean energy tax credits that are also part of the IRA, have been funnelling billions of new federal and private dollars into developing clean energy.

""It is tumultuous time,"" says Adie Tomer, of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. ""We are doing the exact opposite of our developed world peers.""

Court battles are ongoing over the President's order to pause green funding, which might ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, agencies are conducting their own reviews and making their own decisions.

Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which represents companies involved in carbon capture and storage, laments the lack of clarity from the administration.

Members, she explains, have won project funding under the IIJA – including, for example, to build direct air capture facilities. But while projects generally have been able to access funds already awarded to earlier phases, it is unclear if they will be able to progress to additional phases where additional funds are supposed to be made available.

""It is causing uncertainty, which is really bad for project deployment,"" says Ms Stolark. ""If you endanger the success of these first-of-a-kind projects it just takes the wind out of the sails of the whole [carbon management] industry long term.""

Meanwhile, the fate of the IRA, which the Congress has the power to amend or repeal along with the IIJA, is being decided, in part, by the budget bill, which aims to permanently extend President Trump's first term tax cuts by making savings elsewhere.

What exactly will remain of the Federal green energy agenda when both the House and Senate agree a compromise version remains to be seen.

It seems likely the IRA's tax credits, which are generally scheduled to expire at the end of 2032, though some extend beyond that date, will take a heavy hit, even if the IRA dodges the bullet of outright repeal.

Also marked for termination include the tax credits for consumers buying EVs and making their homes more efficient.

Many others, such as those for producing clean electricity and manufacturing clean energy components like wind turbine parts, solar panels and batteries, would be phased out earlier or made harder and less worthwhile to secure.

That many of the projects set to benefit from the tax credits are in Republican areas seems to have had little sway in the House, notes Ashur Nissan of policy advice firm Kaya Partners.

But critics say that the Biden green energy initiatives are too expensive.

The IRA's energy tax credits are ""multiple times"" larger than initial estimates, and expose American taxpayers to ""potentially unlimited liability"" noted a recent report from the libertarian Cato Institute advocating their full repeal.

Meanwhile, actual clean energy investment in the US including from both government and private sources (the far larger share) dropped 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $67.3bn, a second quarterly decline, according to new figures released by the Clean Investment Monitor.

""Momentum is sagging a bit which is a little concerning,"" says Hannah Hess of the Rhodium Group research firm, which partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce it. She attributes the trend to a mix of high inflation, high interest rates, global supply chain issues and uncertainty in the policy environment created by the new administration.

There was also, she observes, a record number of clean energy manufacturing projects cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 – six projects mostly in batteries and representing $6.9bn in investment– though it is difficult to say to what extent the new administration was a driver.

More worrying to Ms Hess is the decline since the last quarter in announcements for some types of new projects, which she believes can be ""more strongly"" attributed to the policy situation, with companies lacking confidence there will be demand for the clean products their projects would produce.

Tariffs, which will increase factory construction costs if components need to be imported, are an extra factor that may negatively influence project decisions going forward, notes Anthony DeOrsey of the Cleantech Group research and consulting firm.

Investment aside, companies are also making shifts in how they market their products.

The homepage of LanzaJet – which produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol – used to emphasise how scaling SAF could ""meet the urgent moment of climate change"". It now focusses on its potential to ""harness the energy of locally produced feedstocks"".

SAF has never been about just one thing, notes CEO Jimmy Samartzis. Tailoring messaging to be ""relevant to the stakeholders we are engaging with"" makes sense.

The company is current waiting on a $3m grant it was awarded by the Federal Aviation Authority last August as part of a nearly $300m program designed to help aviation transition to SAF and which was funded under the IRA.

""It is approved funding, but it is stuck at this point,"" says Mr Samartzis.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2b61/live/52a048b0-3bb9-11f0-a20d-1b53273f2a3b.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 19:56:47.190036

The pump in Urbandale is now the second station in the country with the high blend of biodiesel fuel, but the first station with an above-ground pump.
Karl Thomas with Optimus Technologies, the company that helped to outfit the PepsiCo trucks to use the fuel, said decarbonizing the industry requires collaboration.
Biodiesel supports the soybean industry Biodiesel in Iowa is made primarily from soybean oil, which means biodiesel demand is directly linked with soybean demand.
According to 2024 figures from the Iowa Biodiesel Board, the industry added $2.2 billion in total sales and $123 million in labor income to the state’s economy.","URBANDALE— The Des Moines region is now home to the first above-ground B99 fueling pump, an action that was celebrated Thursday morning by leaders in the biofuels, trucking and soybean industries.

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the new pump, which allows certain semi trucks to fill up with a 99% biodiesel blended fuel, shows a completion of the ag supply chain, from the field to the biofuel refineries and now into a truck.

“Every time I see this, or think of an infrastructure investment, I just know that that’s more demand pulling through, and what that ultimately means is more demand for the things that we grow,” Naig said. “It adds value every single step throughout the chain.”

The pump is located at a Pilot fuel station in Urbandale, near the intersection of Douglas Avenue and Interstate 35, and for now will be used primarily by PepsiCo trucks which are equipped to utilize the fuel.

Eric Fobes, head of renewables for Pilot, said the new biodiesel pump is an adherence to the company’s commitment to “shaping the future of energy.”

“To me and our customers, it’s important that we are offering decarbonized solutions,” Fobes said. “This is one of those offers.”

The trucking company launched the first B99 pump at a travel center in Decatur, Illinois in March. The pump in Urbandale is now the second station in the country with the high blend of biodiesel fuel, but the first station with an above-ground pump. The company has plans to open another pump in Texas this summer.

PepsiCo has committed local trucks to using the biodiesel from the station, which is several minutes away from the beverage and snack company’s Urbandale plant.

Sarah Towles, senior director of government affairs for PepsiCo, said the partnership with Pilot represents “real scalable solutions” for long haul transportation. Towles said PepsiCo has about 20 trucks prepared to use the station currently, but plans to equip other trucks in the future.

Karl Thomas with Optimus Technologies, the company that helped to outfit the PepsiCo trucks to use the fuel, said decarbonizing the industry requires collaboration.

“Together, we’re building an ecosystem for sustainable trucking by introducing a new fuel to the commercial trucking market in the U.S.” Thomsas said.

Thomas said Optimus developed a vector system in the trucks which keeps the biodiesel from gelling during colder months. Thomas said this technology, and equipping long haul trucks to run on higher blends of biodiesel is “one of the lowest cost technologies to decarbonize heavy duty trucking.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates 23% of transportation related carbon dioxide emissions came from medium and heavy-duty trucking. The agency encourages the industry to transition to lower emission fuels, like biofuels, hydrogen or compressed natural gas to lower emissions.

Biodiesel supports the soybean industry

Biodiesel in Iowa is made primarily from soybean oil, which means biodiesel demand is directly linked with soybean demand.

Dave Walton, a director for both Iowa Soybean Association and Iowa Biodiesel Board, said the pump represents, “real on the ground, progress in Americans’ transition to cleaner fuels.”

“By fueling their Des Moines based fleet at this B99 pump, PepsiCo is showing that high blends of biodiesel aren’t just a future concept, they’re here and now, and working,” Walton said.

Walton said biodiesel is critical to the farm economy and that the industry adds a 13% value to each bushel of soybeans produced by Iowa farmers.

According to 2024 figures from the Iowa Biodiesel Board, the industry added $2.2 billion in total sales and $123 million in labor income to the state’s economy.

“Projects like today’s expands consumer access to affordable domestic homegrown fuels that increase good paying jobs for our hardworking Americans,” Walton said.

Walton also commended Iowa lawmakers, specifically Sen. Annette Sweeney, R-Iowa Falls, Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale and Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale who were in attendance, for supporting state incentives on biodiesel blends.

Calls for federal support

While the industry a high performing year, with a total of 350 million gallons of biodiesel produced in 2024, Walton said several plants in the state are idle due to the uncertainty of federal tax credits.

Walton said he also hopes EPA will approve 5.25 billion gallons of biodiesel for the upcoming Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS. This standard sets the minimum amount of renewable fuels required to be blended, annually, into diesel and gasoline. According to EPA, the 2025 requirement for biodiesel was 3.35 billion gallons.

Naig echoed the call for “strong” Renewable Volume Obligations under RFS and said producers also need clear guidance on tax policy.

Renewable fuel producers in Iowa have been advocating for, and waiting on, definitive guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury on the 45z tax credit, which would incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel and other plant-based fuels.

A bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines, could also impact the biofuels industry’s ability to use these credits, which is a major reason why the industry has opposed the legislation, which is currently sitting on Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk.

Naig said he has heard from folks on both sides of the issue, but the decision on the bill rests with Reynolds and her council.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8869-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 18:56:34.116026

The May 21 flight and landing at Edwards AFB, Calif., came about five months later than the Atlanta-based company had hoped. The main goal of the company’s test campaign is to validate high-speed takeoff and landing.

The company said the successful test campaign and flight of the Mk 1 “validated design and performance models, including aerodynamics, stability and control. Testing also validated performance of vehicle subsystems including propulsion, fuel systems, hydraulics, power, thermal management, avionics, flight software, telemetry, flight termination, and command and control.”

The Mk 1 is powered by the GE Aerospace J85 engine. The Mk 2 will be powered by the RTX Pratt & Whitney F100-229 turbofan engines used on the Air Force’s F-15 and F-16 fighters. The F100 will feature a precooler to give the engine more speed, a feature of the startup’s future Chimera engine this is a hybrid of a turbojet for takeoff to get an aircraft to supersonic speeds, and a ramjet that will allow an aircraft to reach hypersonic speeds.

A successful flight is also seen as important to demonstrate the business perspective for investors and customers.

Design of the Mk 1 began in the fourth quarter of 2023.

But the potential could be “very significant"" if stepped-up to commercial levels, said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger, speaking to Canada’s National Observer.
These sustainable aviation fuel projects are clearly addressing a need articulated by government and industry,"" said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger.
SAFs can produce 80 per cent lower emissions than conventional jet kerosene.
This could reduce emissions by 15-20 per cent for aircraft departures from Canada.","Aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing has invested almost $17.5 million with a trio of Canadian sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pioneers aiming to accelerate development of technologies that could help convert the country’s lumber waste and CO2 emissions into low-carbon jet fuels.

Boeing will invest $10 million in a joint venture between Quebec companies Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables to advance a project that will turn sawmill by-products into biocrude for SAF, and $7.5 million in a pilot plant being built in BC by Dimensional Energy that can capture CO2 directly from industrial facility emissions and transforms it into green synthetic fuel.

The volumes of SAF produced by the pilot projects will be relatively small: a total of 50 million gallons a year compared to the almost 100,000 million gallons currently burned annually by passenger airlines, according to Statista, a data portal. But the potential could be “very significant"" if stepped-up to commercial levels, said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger, speaking to Canada’s National Observer.

Chris Lohman, Boeing Canada’s head of sustainability, added: “These two projects were selected because of the enormous latent energy sources in Canada that they have the potential to unlock: sawmill waste residue that in years gone by went into the pulp and paper industry but is now looking for new uses and end-products, and CO2 that comes from heavy-emitting industry.”

“We are a global company and committed to supporting Canada’s objective of being net-zero by 2050. These sustainable aviation fuel projects are clearly addressing a need articulated by government and industry,"" said Boeing Canada CEO Al Meinzinger.

Canada Transport’s climate action plan targets 10 per cent of aviation fuel being replaced by SAF by 2030 to decarbonize a sector that globally accounts for over two per cent of all CO2 emissions, according to the Air Transport Action Group, a lobbyist. SAFs can produce 80 per cent lower emissions than conventional jet kerosene.

“SAF is a very complicated nut to crack and each concept has its own unique challenges so it is important Boeing support companies to move these technologies down the field,” said Lohman.

SAFs — which can be generated from a range of industrial and commercial feedstocks as well as captured carbon — have the potential to make up 65 per cent of the emissions reduction needed by the aviation sector to reach net-zero in 2050, according to figures from the International Air Transport Association, an industry trade body.

Technology ‘valley of death’

The SAF generated by the two projects backed by Boeing will first be trialled in 16 P-8A Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance military aircraft ordered from Boeing by the Canadian government in November 2023, but Meinzinger said it was targeting future use in commercial airliners.

“These projects are aimed at the broadest possible market. We want to help these technologies traverse the ‘valley of death’ [between innovative concepts to commercial production] and get over the key engineering challenges so that they can get to economic scale,” he said.

Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables’ project, called Projet Avance, points to Canada’s “unique opportunity” with SAF, said Lohman, given the “vast, ready-made biomass resource” that can be found in the forested regions across the country “not just to create a useful low-carbon fuel for use in Canada but also one that is exportable.”

The Dimension Energy project, which will capture CO2 straight off a flue stack at a Lafarge cement facility in Richmond, BC, he added, is “highly replicable anywhere you have greenhouse gases being generated by heavy industry.”

The Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels — made up of 60 airlines operating in the country — laid out a roadmap in 2023 aiming to have 265 million gallons of SAF being produced domestically by 2030 and by 2035 enough to meet 25 per cent of total demand. This could reduce emissions by 15-20 per cent for aircraft departures from Canada.

Meinzinger believes Canada is “not going to get anywhere” in its energy transition without moving away from its historical focus on energy-intensive fossil fuel-based products and services: “The world is energy-hungry but, in the long term, also sustainability-hungry.”

Lohman added that Canada “needs to make more of what we need here with what we’ve got,” adding that SAF is “at the intersection of this reality.”

SAF technologies, he said, can “disentangle” Canada from its dependence on petroleum for jet fuel by using biomass and CO2 to build more sustainable industries.

“This investment in new industries will bring enormous rewards if it bridges the gap between innovative technology and commercial products – jobs, economic development, expanded export markets,” he said.",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2025/05/29/dimension_energy_saf_2.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 17:56:50.646335

“The development of Infinium’s Project Roadrunner is a great example of the importance of the county, city, and PEDC working together to support economic growth for Reeves County,” added Reeves County Judge Leo Hung. “This plant is going to create sustainable, high-paying jobs, increase the severance tax, and encourage other job creators to look at Reeves County and the City of Pecos for business development.”

Reeves County, the Town of Pecos City, and the Pecos Economic Development Corporation collaborate to attract investment and position Pecos as the leading energy corridor of west Texas, ideally suited for the development and expansion of energy-related industries.

Reeves County is the top-producing natural gas county in the state of Texas. It is also among the top six oil-producing counties in Texas.",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pecos-Economic-Development-Corporation-logo.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 16:56:27.852296

“The way we make cars, the way we make TVs, the way we make semiconductor chips should be the same way we make chemicals plants,” Brix said.
Much of the world’s supply of the chemicals is from factories that are part of China’s expanding coal-fed chemicals industry.
But OCOchem doesn’t need a ​“green premium” for its low-carbon bona fides, Brix said.
That causes cost problems and safety problems,” Xu said, especially for chemicals being transported by truck or train.","The global chemicals industry is big, and it’s dirty. Chemical plants consume lots of fossil fuels, both to power the high-temperature, high-pressure processes involved and often as a feedstock for the chemicals produced. And to maximize production, those plants are typically built to be as large as possible.

Todd Brix, CEO of startup OCOchem, has a different vision for how to build a modern chemicals industry: Manufacture lots of small machines that are powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels to do the work.

“The way we make cars, the way we make TVs, the way we make semiconductor chips should be the same way we make chemicals plants,” Brix said.

Last week, the company’s pilot plant in Richland, Washington, started producing a class of chemicals known as formates, used in everything from deicing airplanes to preserving animal feed. But instead of the conventional hot, dirty method of combining methanol with carbon monoxide derived from fossil fuels, OCOchem makes formate with just water and carbon dioxide inside four 1.5-meter electrolytic modules.

OCOchem fills those modules with water and carbon dioxide and then zaps the solution with electricity, causing an electrochemical reaction that yields formic acid, a combination of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. Chemically speaking, it’s ​“one of the simplest molecules you can imagine,” Brix said — basically, ​“CO2 with two hydrogen atoms attached to it.”

The $5 million project can make up to 60 tons of formic acid per year. That’s not a lot, compared with the roughly 1 million tons per year of formates produced globally. But being able to deliver an industrial chemical cost-effectively in such small amounts is one of the selling points, Brix explained.

“Once you want to scale out and make more formate, you just make more modules. That’s the power of economies of scale of mass production,” he said. ​“We can rapidly scale that technology out, and make a lot of little chemical plants, and stack them together.”

Factory-built modular devices are being tried out across various industries, from fertilizer to steel — and they are even being considered for nuclear power. It’s already a winning pathway in the renewable energy sector, where mass-produced solar panels and lithium-ion battery cells have seen costs drop steeply as production volumes increase and manufacturers consistently improve each new generation of products.

“What the solar industry does is mass-produce solar panels — and what we are trying to do is mass-produce chemical plants,” Brix said. ​“That allows you to dramatically lower the costs over time.”

Tiny chemicals-production cells are a bit more complicated than solar panels, of course. But OCOchem’s electrolytic cells aren’t taking on anything as dangerous as nuclear fission. Brix described the process as akin to ​“artificial photosynthesis.” Plants use water, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the energy from sunlight. OCOchem cells, which operate at ambient temperatures and pressures, electrify water and carbon dioxide and emit only formic acid, which is corrosive but not flammable or explosive.

Using electrolysis to produce formate is far from a unique idea, said Brix, who worked at Chevron, Intel, and Microsoft before founding OCOchem in 2020. In fact, researchers have been trying to do it for decades. But the efforts he’s aware of have struggled to expand cells to a size that can support commercially viable volumes.

“We started with a reactor that was 10 square centimeters in size,” Brix said. ​“We’ve scaled that up by a factor of 1,500.” OCOchem has developed patented technologies that can handle the required current density, or electrical throughput, to achieve this increased size and manufactures these key components itself. It then works with a contract manufacturer to assemble them into cells, which otherwise use off-the-shelf equipment from other electrolysis-based industries.

OCOchem raised $5 million in 2023 and has secured federal and state grants for its early technology development, as well as an undisclosed amount of early-stage support from Halliburton Labs, the tech accelerator of oil services company Halliburton. The four cells in the pilot facility are the first it’s produced via this assembly-line process, Brix said, but the company is preparing to scale up its manufacturing to meet orders for more than $300 million in prepurchase contracts.

Those contracts are for the formate it will make, not for the equipment itself, he noted. ​“Our goal is to be the developer of the technology and operator of the plant and share ownership of the plant with various partners.”

A cleaner — and cheaper — path to bigger chemicals markets?

OCOchem’s process emits no carbon dioxide, unlike the fossil-fuel-based processes used to make formates today, Brix said. Much of the world’s supply of the chemicals is from factories that are part of China’s expanding coal-fed chemicals industry. Whether OCOchem’s formate is considered low-, zero-, or negative-carbon depends on two key factors: the carbon footprint of the electricity used to make it and the carbon dioxide going into its cells.

Right now, OCOchem plans to get its CO2 ​“from the highest purity and cheapest sources we can find,” Brix said. ​“That turns out to be biogenic CO2,” or gas captured from ethanol plants, breweries, wastewater-treatment facilities, and similar sources. Some of that CO2 is used today as coolant in refrigeration and for carbonating beverages. CO2 that can’t find industrial purchasers is either captured at the expense of its emitter or, far more often, vented into the atmosphere, which contributes to climate change.

Plenty of industries, ranging from sustainable aviation fuel to lower-carbon cement, are planning to rely on captured CO2 to decarbonize. Consulting firm EcoEngineers studied OCOchem’s process and found that every ton the company produces could avoid a combined 7.2 tons of CO2 emissions, compared with fossil-fuel-fed formate production, both by displacing fossil fuels and fixing captured CO2 in the formic acid it makes.

But OCOchem doesn’t need a ​“green premium” for its low-carbon bona fides, Brix said. Instead, it’s relying on offering customers a cost-competitive alternative to formate shipped from overseas. That’s not possible with its pilot-scale facility today, he stressed. But ​“even at 10,000 tons per year, which is a small chemical plant, we’ll have lower cost of production” than typical fossil-fuel-fed plants. ​“We can say, ​‘Whatever your market price is, we’ll meet it.’”

More chemical markets beckon. Formic acid can be processed into a number of organic compounds, including many now made from fossil fuels, he said — ​“not because they’re higher performance, or cleaner, or cheaper, but because they do the job good enough.”

Formates and formic acid could also serve as ​“hydrogen carriers,” Brix said. Hydrogen, when it’s produced in ways that don’t cause greenhouse gas emissions, can be used to cut the carbon impact of industries from steelmaking to shipping. It’s unlikely that OCOchem’s formates would be a cost-effective source of hydrogen at large volumes, but they could serve as a convenient medium for transporting hydrogen in trucks, he said.

The trick is to find cost-effective ways to separate the hydrogen molecules from the formates once they reach their destination, said Ye Xu, associate professor of chemical engineering at Louisiana State University. Xu specializes in research in ​“surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis” — the fundamental study of the interaction of solid catalysts with molecules. He’s been working on a project to crack hydrogen from formates in a way that’s economically viable—one of many being funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“If you need to transport huge quantities of hydrogen atoms, you have to compress hydrogen gas under extremely high pressure. That causes cost problems and safety problems,” Xu said, especially for chemicals being transported by truck or train. Hydrogen-bearing formates, by contrast, are ​“not flammable. They don’t explode. They are not toxic. These are some very attractive characteristics.”

When it comes to separating the hydrogen atoms from formate molecules at the end of the journey, so far ​“the stumbling block is the speed of the reaction,” he said. ​“Formates are stable substances and slowly decompose on their own.” Speeding up the process requires a catalyst, and ​“according to the scientific literature, the only catalyst that works is palladium” — a costly metal, which, like the chemically similar platinum, is already in high demand for electronics, automotive, and many other industrial uses.

Xu’s search for substitute catalysts to make formate a viable hydrogen carrier involves massive computational research as well as collaboration with scientists doing real-world research. In a way, Brix noted, it’s a similar process to the years of research that have gone into OCOchem’s core technologies, such as the gas-diffusion electrodes that allow it to electrolyze water and CO2 at commercial-scale volumes.

Taking such experiments from laboratory to pilot project to commercial production may be labor-intensive and costly. But building, testing, and redesigning the next generation of technologies is a lot easier and faster on an assembly line than as part of a complicated, yearslong engineering, procurement, and construction project to build large-scale facilities, Brix said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/OCOchem-cell-assembly-indoor-framing.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=18f1b215d9eb4728fdc775a7965fa035,N,,2025-05-30 00:56:21.750256

White House seeks to suspend tariffs ruling: Update

White House seeks to suspend tariffs ruling: Update

Adds White House reaction, additional court action Washington, 29 May (Argus) — President Donald Trump's administration is asking a federal court to suspend a ruling issued late Wednesday that blocked emergency tariffs on nearly all imports, warning that failure to do so will be a foreign policy ""disaster"" and ""shatter"" trade negotiations with dozens of countries. The administration is asking the US Court of International Trade to stay its ruling — which would permanently enjoin tariffs now set at 10pc for much of the world, but which are set to revert to higher rates in July absent intervention by Trump — until it has time to pursue an appeal. The harm to foreign affairs from leaving the court ruling intact during an appeal ""could not be greater"", the administration said, whereas putting the decision on hold will preserve the status quo during an appeal. ""It is critical, for the country's national security and the president's conduct of ongoing, delicate diplomatic efforts, that the court stay its judgment,"" the administration wrote in a legal filing after the court issued its sweeping ruling. The White House said the three judges on the trade court panel behind the ruling, two of whom are Republican appointees, ""brazenly abused their judicial power to usurp"" Trump's authority. The administration expects appealing the unfavorable ruling ""all the way to the Supreme Court"" but believes other countries will continue to negotiate on trade agreements with the US as a way to prevent tariffs. In a further setback for the administration, the US District Court for the District of Columbia today ruled in a separate lawsuit that Trump did not have authority to impose the tariffs, which were issued under a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The effect of that ruling is far more limited and would only freeze tariffs on two small toy companies behind the lawsuit, in the event the broader ruling on Wednesday is put on hold. Trump began imposing the emergency tariffs at issue in the case just weeks into his second term, starting with a 25pc tariff from Canada and Mexico and a 10pc incremental tariff on China, claiming they were in response to the threat of drug trafficking. Trump vastly expanded his use of tariffs on ""Liberation Day"" on 2 April on nearly every country based on an alleged ""emergency"" of trade imbalances, raising tariffs to as high as 145pc on China before lowering them to 30pc. The Court of International Trade, in its ruling on Wednesday, found all of those tariffs were unlawful and gave the administration 10 days to implement its ruling. IEEPA did not offer Trump ""unbounded"" authority to put unlimited tariffs on nearly all goods imported in the US, the court said, but instead set limits on tariff authority that the administration did not follow. If that ruling is upheld on appeal, the US will be required to offer refunds of emergency tariffs that have already been paid. The ruling does not affect separate ""section 232"" tariffs that Trump has imposed on steel, aluminum and automobiles, and that are being planned for pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and critical minerals. Trump could also pursue non-emergency ""section 122"" tariffs that would allow tariffs of up to 15pc, but those could only be used for 150 days. The Trump administration, in its request for a stay, said the court's invalidation of emergency tariffs under IEEPA poses an immediate and ""grave"" harm to the US because those alternative tariff authorities do not allow the president to take ""swift and flexible"" actions that are needed to address national emergencies. At a minimum, the administration said the tariff suspension should only apply to the handful of manufacturers and states that filed the lawsuit. To support its stay request, the administration included a declaration by US secretary of state Marco Rubio saying the injunction would cause ""irreparable harm"" to foreign policy and national security, while US trade representative Jamieson Greer said it will be a ""foreign policy disaster scenario"". US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick wrote it would ""would destroy"" a carefully negotiated agreement with China. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent warned the ruling ""will threaten to shatter our negotiations with dozens of countries"" and create a risk that trading partners ""feel a renewed boldness to take advantage of"" a new ability to retaliate against the US. The White House did immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of the collection of the emergency tariffs. The Trump administration, in its legal filing, said a stay of the ruling would not harm those who brought the tariff lawsuit because the US ""will issue refunds"" along with any interest that accrues during the appeal.

Both companies are reinforcing their longstanding commitment to the Canary Islands, where they have been present for nearly a century, by leading the decarbonization of the maritime sector in the region

Moeve has reached a strategic agreement with Grupo Armas Trasmediterránea to supply 2G marine biofuels in the Canary Islands, with approximately 40,000 tons to be delivered through December 2025 under a long-term contract, with the potential for extension into 2026.

This deal marks Moeve’s largest biofuel supply to date, and its first in the Canary Islands, reinforcing the company’s leadership in the production and sale of sustainable solutions for maritime transport. This agreement also marks a major step in advancing decarbonization in the Canary Islands, a region where Moeve has maintained a nearly century-long presence and remains committed to driving the maritime sector’s energy transition.

Sergio Vélez, CEO of Armas Trasmediterránea, said that the signing of this agreement marks a new milestone in the company’s roadmap toward more sustainable shipping. “We’re not starting from scratch, we’ve been implementing measures to reduce our environmental footprint for years, from route optimization to becoming pioneers in the use of biofuels,” he emphasized. This step forward in biofuel adoption reinforces Armas Trasmediterránea’s commitment to decarbonizing the maritime transport sector and, in particular, protecting the marine environment. “It’s not only our natural working environment, it’s also a heritage we have the responsibility to preserve,” Vélez added.

As part of this pioneering agreement in the Canary Islands, both companies have visited Autoridades Porturias to reaffirm the value of the agreement in advancing the decarbonization of the sector. Beatriz Calzada, President of Autoridad Portuaria of Las Palmas, stated that the agreement “aligns perfectly with our strategy to transition toward green fuels. Our goal is to deliver operational excellence and offer a diverse range of services to our clients.” Meanwhile, Pedro Suárez, President of Autoridad Portuaria of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, emphasized, “We’ve spent years proactively positioning ourselves in the energy transition, with a strong commitment to sustainability. This first fuel supply marks a key milestone toward enabling more sustainable port calls and a more competitive port overall.”

Moeve produces these biofuels at its San Roque Energy Park (Cádiz) and La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva, and already supplies Spain’s main ports, including Algeciras, Barcelona, Ceuta, and Huelva. Second-generation (2G) renewable biofuels can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 90% throughout their life cycle compared to traditional fuels, accelerating the energy transition and enabling sustainable mobility in hard-to-electrify sectors such as maritime transport. Additionally, they can be used immediately with existing infrastructure and engines, without the need for modifications or major investments, facilitating the sector’s rapid decarbonization.

Moeve has 90 years of experience in supplying maritime transport, with operations in over 60 Spanish ports, enabling full presence across the value chain, optimizing processes, and offering the most competitive products possible.

This progress is part of Moeve's 2030 Positive Motion strategy, through which the company seeks to lead sustainable mobility and promote the decarbonization of heavy transport (air, sea, and land) via the production of green molecules.

We're part of the E2E program. It stands for English to Engineering. That program is composed of five smaller undergraduate research teams, and we all share the common goal of furthering sustainable propulsion in the aerospace industry. So this is the SAF team. SAF stands for sustainable aerospace fuels. What we're looking at is how do the SAFs on the market, particularly HEFA-SPK, which is our most popular SAF right now. How do they work in traditional jet infrastructure and can they be drop in? Drop in means that a fuel can be basically dumped into an engine and they don't have to change any of the mechanisms. The main goal of this year specifically is to look at the interaction between the sustainable aviation fuel and the O rings and how that might be different than regular jet fuel. Basically to see, can we use normal HEFA-SPK, which is the sustainable aviation fuel, on current engines without the O rings breaking down or losing their performance. Two years ago, we found that the specific O rings we tested, which were Buna-N O rings, were quite reactive to the fuel. We're finding this year that that's not quite the case. With these Viton O rings, which are different compound. The sustainable aviation fuel O rings react a lot more similarly to the Jet A O rings than we thought. We like to call this program something that is vertically integrated, which means that we build off of each semester, and we develop our students to stay with the program throughout their undergrad years. I think it's cool that undergrads get the opportunity to lead a team, choose what they want to do, and publish a paper. To be involved in a sustainable aviation research group has really been eye opening and made me realize that is really what I want to do, and it's been very fun to be a part of this group in the past three years.

I have often questioned the professionalism and necessity of SLPD’s “funny” social media posts when they intentionally punch down. When our unofficial tagline is “Be a Better Human,” it is crucial to consider whether those in positions of power are truly upholding that message.

Sabrina Martinez, Storm Lake

Veto this bill. Let’s get it right next year.

Iowa’s ethanol industry stands at a crossroads. For decades, we’ve fueled America’s cars with homegrown energy. But as electric vehicle sales rise — 1.3 million in 2024 alone, now nearly 10% of new cars — we must evolve to stay competitive.

Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel — the biggest opportunity Iowa agriculture has seen in decades. Planes won’t run on batteries anytime soon, and SAF needs low-carbon, liquid fuel. That’s a lane Iowa ethanol can dominate, but only if we have the infrastructure to compete.

Carbon capture unlocks that path. By storing CO2 emissions from ethanol plants, we lower the carbon intensity of ethanol and qualify for the booming SAF market — a market projected to demand billions of gallons annually. That means stronger corn demand, more stability for farmers, and long-term investment in Iowa’s future.

This isn’t theoretical. More than 1,320 Iowans have voluntarily signed easements with Summit Carbon Solutions to make this future real. In some counties, voluntary participation is 70%, 80%, even 90%. These are farmers and landowners — people who understand exactly what’s at stake and are choosing to lead.

That’s what makes the legislation passed by the Iowa House and Senate so disappointing. It doesn’t get the job done. It doesn’t solve the problem. And it sets back the very industry it claims to support.

Today I am asking Gov. Reynolds to veto this bill.

Not because she supports any one company, but because she supports Iowa’s largest industry — agriculture — and one of its most important products — ethanol. She knows what’s at stake for our state, and for the 42 ethanol plants already producing 4.6 billion gallons annually. Without access to SAF markets, we’re cutting off their future.

This bill is a step backward. It adds confusion, weakens our competitive edge, and threatens the kind of private investment Iowa needs to grow. And the unintended consequences are real. This bill doesn’t just apply to carbon pipelines—it affects all hazardous liquid infrastructure. If we start blocking one type of project, what’s next? Today it’s ethanol infrastructure — tomorrow it could be broadband, transmission lines, or even rural water systems. That’s a slippery slope Iowa can’t afford.

Let’s come back next year and do it the right way. Let’s bring agriculture, ethanol producers, landowners, and lawmakers to the table and find a real solution that balances property rights with progress. That protects our rural communities while paving the way for market access and long-term growth.

The sky’s the limit for Iowa — but only if we clear the runway. Gov. Reynolds, veto this bill.

Make learning great again

President Trump says foreign students at Harvard are occupying spots rightfully belonging to Americans. Therefore, a recent Executive Order bans Harvard from accepting international students.

Trump’s inability to see beyond his latest DEI revenge tour has blinded him to the myriad ways in which the world has benefitted from the contributions of Americans who made the arduous journey to Paris from 1830-1900, seeking experiences unavailable to them then in the U.S. Historian David McCullough’s 2011 book, “The Greater Journey” could enlighten him about this.

What if Samuel Morse had not braved the ocean journey, homesickness, harsh Paris winters, and the language barrier in pursuit of improving his art to then return home with his idea for the telegraph?

What if Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. had not formed his infection theories in France and put them into practice here, henceforth saving women from childbed fever? What if Holmes had not learned enough there to return here to teach evidence-based medical practices at Harvard?

What if James Fenimore Cooper had not lived in France and then returned home to write uniquely American fiction like “The Last of the Mohicans?”

What if Napoleon III had refused entrance to Morse, Holmes, Cooper, and other Americans whose knowledge gained in France has enhanced lives world-wide?

It seems to me that the greater journey for Americans living now is to make learning great again, to instill those values in our children, and to resist the short-sighted revenge of Trump and his loyalists.

Trump’s failed promises

On Inauguration Day, Trump said, “Our power will stop all wars.” He promised to end the Ukraine war in 24 hours. World peace turns out to require a bit more than Mr. Trump has to offer, apparently.

He also said, “We will make Martin Luther King’s dream come true.” I wonder if MLK ever contemplated inviting white refugees from South Africa to America to save them from “genocide” at the hands of blacks there. Likely not, since 10,000 or so blacks get murdered here each year as opposed to about 30-50 white farmers per year in South Africa.

Trump announced, “I will bring back free speech to America.” He forgot to mention that free speech will not be extended to international students, mayors like Newark’s, media companies he is suing, etc.

He also prophesied, “There will be no crime.” That has been problematic, as blue-collar crime, white collar crime and Presidential “high crimes and misdemeanors” have continued unabated.

Finally, the most messianic promise of all: “I will fix every single crisis affecting our country.” Unfortunately, the crisis that most everybody agrees is the worst of all is the one Trump himself is creating — the constitutional crisis.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/storm/original/20240625-113453-bbe-letters-to-the-editor.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 15:57:10.087745

Those investments have helped cut Microsoft’s footprint from purchased energy and its own operations by 30 percent since 2020.
Signs of progress Microsoft actually reported a modest 1.8 percent year-over-year decrease in its carbon footprint for its 2024 fiscal year, which ended June 30.
This cuts the embodied carbon footprint of new facilities by 65 percent compared with traditional processes.
Microsoft’s new code of conduct includes a requirement for its biggest supply chain partners to transition to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2030.","Microsoft remains “pragmatically optimistic” that it will meet its commitment from five years ago to become carbon negative by 2030, despite reporting a 23.4 percent cumulative increase in its total greenhouse gas emissions since that time.

That’s according to the company’s May 29 2025 environmental sustainability report, in which two of the tech giant’s senior executives describe that increase as “modest” compared with its 168 percent increase in energy use and 71 percent growth in revenue over the same time period.

“Microsoft remains steadfast in our dedication to achieving the company’s 2030 environmental sustainability commitments,” said President Brad Smith and Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa, in a joint foreword.

Microsoft has promised to cut its emissions in half by 2030, compared with 2020, and to remove more carbon dioxide than it emits during that time frame. It has also promised to be water positive, achieve zero waste and protect ecosystems.

The company doesn’t have a corporate net-zero commitment, as defined by the Science Based Targets initiative, the de facto standards setter. It was one of nearly 250 well-known companies to have its “target removed” in spring 2024, after failing to submit a plan that would meet SBTi’s standard. “We remain engaged with SBTi and hope this entity involves practitioner feedback more comprehensively going forward while maintaining a robust governance process and remaining in close coordination with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol updates,” the company said in a statement responding to questions from Trellis.

Pragmatic optimism explained

Microsoft does have near-term SBTi goals: to cut the emissions intensity for its Scope 3 footprint from things like productions and use of its products by 30 percent as a percentage of revenue compared with a 2017 baseline year; to avoid an absolute growth in Scope 3, which accounted for 97.3 percent of its footprint in FY2024; and to source 100 percent renewable electricity.

So far, it has met just the last one, by procuring more than 34 gigawatts in carbon-free energy since 2020 — 19 in 2024 alone.

The company’s confidence comes from its long experience in creating entirely new markets, Nakagawa said during an interview. Microsoft, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, is spending billions to make sustainability a core value. Among other things, it’s buying low-carbon steel, concrete and construction materials. It has allocated more than $793 million for new climate technologies and is now the largest single buyer of carbon removal credits, worth more than 30 million metric tons.

Those investments have helped cut Microsoft’s footprint from purchased energy and its own operations by 30 percent since 2020.

“We remain pragmatically optimistic, and over the next few years, we want to continue to scale these markets, not only to reach our goals and for our benefit, but frankly, for the world,” she said.

Signs of progress

Microsoft actually reported a modest 1.8 percent year-over-year decrease in its carbon footprint for its 2024 fiscal year, which ended June 30. The company disclosed total emissions of 14,857,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent compared with 15,130,000 for FY2023.

That achievement is barely discussed as part of the report narrative, and that’s intentional. As more countries and regions adopt policies for mandatory corporate disclosure, Nakagawa explained, corporations will be required to report more thoroughly on progress since their baseline year. Companies must show that they are making the sorts of investments that steer emissions reductions in the right direction, she said.

There are also bright spots in Microsoft’s Scope 3 data, i.e., cumulative decreases in emissions related to these categories:

Waste generated in operations

Business travel

Employee computing

Downstream transportation and distribution

Use of sold products

End of life treatment of sold products

Downstream leased assets

Most of these categories account for less than 2 percent of Microsoft’s Scope 3 breakdown, except for use of sold products, which adds up to almost 12 percent of the total.

Microsoft’s two biggest Scope 3 categories are purchased goods and services (about 34 percent of the 2024 total) and capital goods (almost 41 percent).

What’s in store

To chip away at its two biggest Scope 3 categories, Microsoft is turning to its suppliers.

For example, the company is adopting a hybrid approach to data center construction that substitutes mass timber materials for concrete. This cuts the embodied carbon footprint of new facilities by 65 percent compared with traditional processes. Microsoft is also adopting chip-level cooling technologies. That one design change will help the company slow down the pace of new construction (because less space is needed for cooling equipment); decrease the amount of energy required for operations; and avoid significant evaporation of freshwater.

Microsoft’s expectations of suppliers are being built into contracts. One of its power purchase agreements with renewables developer Engie, for example, requires that solar panels be reused or recycled.

Microsoft’s new code of conduct includes a requirement for its biggest supply chain partners to transition to 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2030. So far, 89 facilities that manufacture Microsoft’s hardware — such as tablet computers, gaming consoles or accessories — have bought into renewables. That helped cut 232,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Next up: a program, coming in July, that will help Microsoft suppliers procure certificates that give them credit by supporting sustainable aviation fuel.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Cross-laminated-timber-being-used-in-two-new-Microsoft-datacenters-.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 12:56:47.138363

This report covers our fiscal year 2024, and measures progress against our 2020 baseline. You can read the foreword below and explore the report in its entirety here.

As Microsoft continues to grow and innovate, our commitment to environmental sustainability remains a core value. This year, we reflect on our progress towards our ambitious 2030 goals: to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste, while protecting ecosystems. As we enter the second half of the decade, Microsoft remains steadfast in our dedication to achieving the company’s 2030 environmental sustainability commitments.

Since we announced our goals in 2020, we have made meaningful progress while seeing major changes in both the technology sector and in our understanding of what it will take to meet our goals. We are learning as we go, and we are proactively working to address sustainability challenges and accelerate solutions. We remain resolute in our commitment not only to meeting our climate goals but also to empowering others with the technology they need to build a more sustainable future.

At the heart of our approach is an understanding that sustainability is not simply a set of isolated initiatives, but a fundamental principle that must be integrated into every aspect of our business. Our cross-company Climate Council brings together leaders from across Microsoft to drive innovation, accelerate progress, and identify ways to build sustainability into our operations, products, and partnerships.

We remain pragmatically optimistic because of the promise of new sustainability technologies, innovations in AI, and market solutions that are emerging which can accelerate progress across challenging sectors like steel, concrete, and energy transitions. This annual report is our opportunity to share our learnings to help accelerate these markets, be transparent about our progress, and explore how we can ultimately scale solutions across our value chain.

We are sharing details about the progress made in each of our core commitment areas: carbon negative, water positive, zero waste, and protecting ecosystems. Our report also highlights a number of our breakthrough innovations, drawing insights from the leading edge of climate innovation.

Our progress

In 2020, Microsoft made bold sustainability commitments. At this halfway point to our 2030 goals, we are reaching key milestones and making progress that includes:

Ecosystems. In 2022, we met our target of protecting more land than we use by 2025, a target we’ve since exceeded by more than 30%. AI innovation is now driving biodiversity conservation through research efforts led by the AI for Good Lab and tools like the Microsoft Planetary Computer.

Zero waste. We exceeded our annual target to divert 75% of construction and demolition waste six years early by diverting 85% of this waste in FY24. We have also surpassed our target for our reuse and recycling rate for servers and components, reaching 90.9%. The Surface Copilot+ PCs now feature our most sustainable packaging design yet. Packaging from over 30,000 server racks was processed through recycling programs in FY24—diverting over 2,500 metric tons of waste from landfills.

Water positive. We met our target to provide more than 1.5 million people with clean water and sanitation solutions. We are also on track to replenish more water than we consume across global operations and improve datacenter water use efficiency, including through a new innovative datacenter design that optimizes AI workloads and consumes zero water for cooling to avoid the use of an estimated 125,000 cubic meters annually per facility.

Carbon negative. To date, we have contracted 34 gigawatts (GW) of carbon-free electricity (CFE) across 24 countries, about an eighteenfold increase since 2020. We have also entered long-term agreements to procure nearly 30 million metric tons of carbon removal since the start of this program.

Carbon negative: a marathon, not a sprint

As we remain focused on sustained progress towards our 2030 goals, it has become clear that our journey towards being carbon negative is a marathon, not a sprint. While our total emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) have increased by 23.4% compared to our 2020 baseline due to growth-related factors such as AI and cloud expansion, we are encouraged by the fact that this increase has been modest compared to the 168% increase in energy use and 71% revenue growth that has taken place over the same period.

For Microsoft to be carbon negative by 2030, we will need to reduce our value chain emissions. Starting with our direct operational emissions, as we shared earlier this year, since 2012 our carbon strategy has included a combination of procuring environmental attributes leveraging our corporate carbon fee and overall carbon emissions reduction efforts. This enabled us to decrease our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 29.9% from our 2020 baseline in FY24. At the same time, as we shift away from procuring non-additional environmental attribute certificates, we recognize that we must also bring more carbon-free electricity onto the grids where we operate.

We are also implementing strategies to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 2030, which increased in FY24 by 26% from our 2020 baseline. We are prioritizing addressing these emissions through supplier engagement programs including establishing standards via our Supplier Code of Conduct. Through the latter, select large-scale Microsoft suppliers are required to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity for their delivered goods and services as well as forthcoming guidance, launching in July, to target usage of sustainable aviation fuel, where possible, for Microsoft business-related air travel by 2030. We also remain committed to developing and supporting innovative solutions to reduce emissions from key datacenter and operational inputs including building materials, chips, and fuels, focusing on long-term solutions over short-term stopgaps. To do this, we have been adapting our strategies to use new sustainability technologies and address the challenges of expanding energy demand.

We see significant progress in several key areas, demonstrating potential for global impact:

Powering operations with carbon-free electricity (CFE):

In 2024, Microsoft contracted 19 GW of new renewable energy across 16 countries through power purchase agreements (PPAs), which are central to our carbon reduction strategy, driving down our Scope 2 emissions. Microsoft has taken a first-mover approach to making long-term investments to bring more CFE online.

We continue to advocate for expanding clean energy solutions globally to support not only our power needs but also those of our supply chain. We are addressing challenges with permitting, interconnection delays, and fluctuating interest rates by innovating through circularity and contracting. For example, we signed groundbreaking PPAs with Engie requiring that 100% of photovoltaic modules will be reused or recycled.

Transforming datacenters and campuses:

In FY24, we launched our first datacenters constructed with mass timber, a strong, ultra-lightweight wood in a hybrid construction model. This approach is projected to reduce the embodied carbon footprint of these new datacenters by up to 65% compared to typical precast concrete. We also doubled our rate of power savings and are transitioning from traditional air-cooled datacenters to chip-level liquid cooling designs at all owned datacenters. As the World Economic Forum highlighted in Innovation and Adaptation in the Climate Crisis, “Data-driven and digital technologies are uniquely suited to build adaptive capacity.”

We believe technology can be a powerful tool to address some of society’s toughest challenges, including environmental sustainability. As demand for AI and cloud services grows, we are advancing how we design, build, and operate our datacenters and campuses. Decarbonizing the built environment is a crucial element in this process.

Accelerating carbon removal initiatives:

In FY24, Microsoft signed long-term agreements to procure more carbon removal than all previous years combined, achieving nearly 22 million metric tons in contracts for carbon removal. We are committed to helping build the markets we buy from, translating leading science into commercial innovation and regularly updating our Criteria for High-Quality Carbon Dioxide Removal. We also know we cannot accelerate this market alone, which is why we co-founded the Symbiosis Coalition with industry partners. The Symbiosis Coalition is targeting up to 20 million metric tons of high-quality, nature-based carbon removal credits by 2030.

Improving operational efficiency and logistics:

In FY24, among facilities that manufacture devices for Microsoft, we saw a tenfold increase over the previous year in transitions to 100% CFE. This was accomplished, in part, by partnering with 3Degrees to launch the Supplier REach portal to support suppliers making their CFE transition. Our drive to reduce datacenter emissions extends to transforming the logistics operations of these facilities.

Through strategic partnerships and targeted initiatives, Microsoft continues to reduce emissions across transportation, warehousing, and the broader logistics supply chain, setting new benchmarks for operational efficiency and environmental impact. We adopted alternative fuels and electric vehicles to reduce emissions, collaborating with several leading logistics service providers (LSPs).

Renewable diesel is now in use in our road freight operations in Europe and California, cutting emissions by 50% for these shipments while keeping existing equipment in use. We also have partnered with airlines and shipping lines to expand the use of sustainable aviation and marine fuels. These efforts have reduced emissions by over 17,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions, comparable to avoiding the combustion of nearly 40,000 barrels of oil.[1]

Accelerating global solutions

At Microsoft, we understand that driving meaningful sustainability progress goes beyond our own practices and requires global collaboration, investment, and innovation. Across our operations, we are working to empower customers, build impactful partnerships, and invest in breakthrough solutions that drive progress worldwide.

Investing in innovation: A hallmark of this effort has been our Climate Innovation Fund (CIF)—our $1 billion commitment set in 2020 to advance innovation beyond Microsoft’s four walls. To date, CIF has made significant investments in innovative climate technologies including commercial direct air capture technologies, sustainable aviation fuel, industrial decarbonization, and more. CIF has invested over $793 million in capital in new climate technologies, expanding to 63 investments across CFE, sustainable fuels, carbon removal, and advanced building materials.

Empowering customers: We help customers and organizations centralize, analyze, and act on their data with AI-powered platforms for advanced analytics and reporting insights. For example, the Howden Resilience Laboratory supported by Microsoft and our Planetary Computer uses technology and data platforms to help investors understand climate risks to critical infrastructure, improve resilience, and contribute to better-informed investment decisions.

Partnering for impact: Partnering to scale our impact is a critical component of our sustainability efforts. Today GitHub fosters a thriving community that is home to over 150 million developers and 60,000 climate-focused open-source projects, advancing climate technology, greener software, and device sustainability. Xbox has made significant investments not only to reduce the environmental footprint associated with the production of our devices, accessories, and console packaging, but also to reduce the energy usage of the console itself. For example, Xbox became the first console to release a dedicated energy consumption and carbon emissions measurement tool designed for game creators.

Accelerating AI for sustainability: Our AI for Good Lab, sustainability science, and research teams collaborate globally to accelerate solutions and develop climate resilience with AI. For example, we have partnered with the United Nations to apply AI to climate challenges through programs like the Early Warnings for All initiative, which seeks to better understand which populations may be at risk of extreme weather events and other threats. By sharing our progress, tools, and learnings with the world, we aim to accelerate the pace of innovation, improve overall operational efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and find new solutions with long-term results.

Sustained momentum and future impact

There is no issue today that connects everyone on the planet more than climate change. As we strive to build a more sustainable future, we remain inspired by the dedication of our employees and partners and committed to transparency, accountability, and collaboration.

While the road to a sustainable future is challenging and not linear, we are encouraged by the progress we have made in FY24. By strategically focusing on CFE, carbon removal, water stewardship, waste reduction, and ecosystem protection, we are building an efficient, sustainable engine that drives us closer to our commitments.

We encourage you to read further to learn more about our progress and learnings across all of these areas, and we look forward to engaging in continued dialogue as we learn and develop new ways to help us meet our goals. We will continue to adapt our strategies, utilize emerging sustainability markets, and scale innovative technologies for even greater impact.

We recognize that achieving our ambitious goals requires sustained momentum, and we are dedicated to driving that momentum forward.

SMM statistics show that the US accounts for nearly 40% of global SAF capacity under construction or planning.","The pressure on the aviation industry to decarbonize continues to escalate, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) emerging as a core solution. This article analyzes the current state of the SAF market, its core challenges, and key growth points based on data from the SMM industry database and global authoritative institutions.

I. Rigid Demand: Policy Drivers and Airline Commitments Form the Foundation of the Market

EU ReFuelEU Regulation: Clear roadmap for mandatory blending: 2% by 2025, 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050 (based on the 2020 aviation fuel consumption baseline). This alone will result in EU SAF demand exceeding 6 million mt/year by 2030 (IEA data).

US IRA Policy Leverage: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provides strong tax credits for SAF (up to $1.25-1.75/gallon) and sets a production target of 3 billion gallons (approximately 9 million mt) by 2030 (US Department of Energy).

Major Airlines' Bets: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) target: SAF usage to reach 7-8% of total aviation fuel by 2025 (approximately 7 million mt) and 10% by 2030 (approximately 23 million mt). Leading airlines such as Delta, United Airlines, and Lufthansa have already signed multi-decade long-term offtake agreements to secure future supply.

II. Supply Bottlenecks: Capacity Ramp-Up Lags Far Behind the Demand Curve

Current Capacity Severely Insufficient: Global SAF production was only approximately 600,000-650,000 mt in 2023 (IEA), accounting for less than 0.2% of global aviation fuel demand (~300 million mt).

Limited Short-Term Increments: SMM's tracking of global projects under construction/planned indicates that global SAF capacity is expected to reach 3-4 million mt/year by 2025, still falling significantly short of policy targets (such as EU demand by 2030).

Prominent Raw Material Constraints:

Mainstream HEFA Route (accounting for over 85%): Highly dependent on used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats. The global annual collectable amount of UCO is approximately 8 million mt (Argus Media), facing issues such as an imperfect catering recycling system and competition in the gray market for waste cooking oil. High prices: The average price of UCO in Europe was approximately $1,200/mt in 2023, significantly driving up SAF costs.

Advanced Routes (PtL/eFuels): Dependent on green hydrogen (produced via water electrolysis using renewable energy) and carbon sources (direct air capture (DAC) or point-source CO₂). The current global green hydrogen capacity is insufficient, with electrolyzer costs (~$700-1,200/kW CAPEX, BNEF) and extremely high energy consumption (~50 MWh/mt SAF) constraining large-scale deployment.

III. Cost Gap: Economic Viability Remains the Biggest Challenge

Significant Price Disparity: The current price of traditional aviation kerosene (Jet A1) is approximately $800-1,000/mt (2023 average, Platts). The price of commercial SAF is 3-5 times higher:

HEFA-SAF: $2,500-3,500/mt (including raw materials, processing, and certification)

PtL-SAF: $4,000-8,000+/mt (dominated by the costs of green electricity, electrolyzers, and DAC)

High reliance on policy subsidies: The US IRA tax credit can cover up to ~$600/mt of costs; the EU ETS price (~€80-90/mt CO₂) and mandatory blending obligations provide support, but this is still not enough to fully bridge the price spread.

Disproportionately high proportion of raw material costs: In the HEFA pathway, the cost of waste oil and fat raw materials can account for 70-80% of the total SAF production cost, indicating significant supply chain vulnerability.

IV. Competition among technological pathways: Diversifying to seek breakthroughs

HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids):

Current status: The only pathway to achieve large-scale commercialization (led by Neste and World Energy), with high technological maturity and capable of 100% blending (ASTM D7566 Annex 2).

Limitations: Obvious ceilings in raw material sustainability and scalability. Unable to independently support the industry's decarbonization goals in the long run.

FT-SPK (Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene):

Representatives: Velocys, Fulcrum BioEnergy. Utilizes gasification synthesis of biomass/municipal solid waste.

Progress: Multiple demonstration projects are in operation (e.g., the Fulcrum Sierra project in the US), but high CAPEX (>$1 billion per million-ton scale) and technological complexity restrict rapid replication.

ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet):

Raw materials: Cellulosic ethanol or waste ethanol.

Current status: LanzaJet (US) will commission its first commercial plant (in Georgia) in 2024, with a capacity of 10 million gallons/year (~30,000 mt). The technology is feasible, with raw material supply and cost being the key factors.

PtL / eSAF (Power-to-Liquids / e-SAF):

Core: Green hydrogen + CO₂ (from DAC or industrial capture) → converted into aviation fuel via the Fischer-Tropsch or methanol synthesis pathway.

Strategic significance: Theoretical capacity has no raw material constraints, and the product can 100% replace traditional aviation fuel, making it the ultimate technological option for the aviation industry to achieve net-zero emissions.

Challenges: Current costs are extremely high, heavily dependent on green electricity prices (competitive only at <$20/MWh, according to IEA) and a sharp drop in electrolyzer/DAC costs. Demonstration projects are emerging (e.g., Norsk e-Fuel in Norway, the Lufthansa-Siemens joint project in Germany), but large-scale commercialization is expected after 2030.

V. Project Dynamics and Regional Landscape

North America Leads: Benefiting from the strong IRA policy, the US has become a hotspot for project investment. Companies like World Energy, Gevo, and LanzaJet are accelerating capacity expansion. SMM statistics show that the US accounts for nearly 40% of global SAF capacity under construction or planning.

Europe Follows: Major players such as Neste (expanding its Rotterdam facility to 1.2 million mt/year), TotalEnergies, and Shell are making moves. Nordic countries focus on PtL (e.g., Sweden, Norway) leveraging abundant green electricity resources.

Asia-Pacific Starts: China is pushing policies (the CAAC's 14th Five-Year Green Development Plan outlines SAF pathways), with Sinopec, PetroChina, and Air China conducting pilot production and applications (e.g., Zhenhai Refining's bio-jet fuel project). Japan (Eneos, ANA) and Singapore (Neste's facility) are also advancing. Raw material (especially UCO) procurement capability is a key variable for Asia-Pacific players.

VI. Key to Breakthrough: Overcoming Cost and Scale Barriers

Continued Policy Reinforcement and Optimization: Beyond mandatory blending and fiscal support, efforts should focus on:

Green Premium Sharing Mechanism: Explore ""certificate separation"" (e.g., the EU’s Draft SAF Certificate system) to involve non-airline entities in cost-sharing.

Dedicated Raw Material Support: Establish sustainable waste oil collection and certification systems, combat adulteration, and ensure supply.

Disruptive Cost-Reduction Technology Breakthroughs:

Electrolyzers: Improve efficiency (>80%), lifespan (>80,000 hours), and reduce CAPEX (target <$250/kW, US DOE Hydrogen Shot).

DAC: Break energy consumption barriers (currently ~1,500 kWh/mt CO₂), targeting <500 kWh/mt CO₂.

Biotechnology: Mature next-generation biomass technologies like efficient cellulosic ethanol and algal lipids.

Building Resilient Supply Chains:

Diversified Raw Material Pool: Accelerate pathways for agricultural/forestry waste, energy crops, and municipal solid waste conversion.

Regionalized Production: Locate PtL projects near cheap green electricity (wind and solar power bases) or carbon sources (industrial zones).

Infrastructure Adaptation: Synchronize compatibility upgrades for airport storage and transportation facilities.

Deep Industry Capital Involvement: Energy giants (BP, Shell, Total), chemical firms (BASF, Johnson Matthey), airlines, and aircraft manufacturers (Airbus, Boeing) must form investment alliances to share high-risk, long-cycle projects.

Conclusion: A promising market with rapid growth is unstoppable.

The SAF market has moved beyond the conceptual stage and entered a period of growth driven by mandatory policies and capacity competition. In the short term (2025-2030), the HEFA route will remain the most-traded contract for supply, but the constraints of raw material supply are difficult to resolve. In the medium and long term (post-2030), PtL/eSAF will be the key to unlocking unlimited capacity and achieving deep decarbonization. Its commercialization process will depend on the speed of cost reduction in green hydrogen and carbon capture technologies, as well as the availability of green electricity resources.",https://static.metal.com/common.metal.com/images/header-en/smm-logo.png,N,,2025-05-29 11:56:10.062290

Shell has ceased the production of jet fuel from crude oil at its Wesseling, Germany facility, a move in its broader ambition to become a net zero emissions energy business by 2050.

By 2030, the company aims to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions under its operational control on a net basis compared with 2016.

It also aims to reduce the net carbon intensity of the product it sells by 15-20% by 2030.

Ending crude based jet fuel

Conventional jet fuels derived from crude oil are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in aviation.

Combustion of these fuels release CO₂ alongside pollutants including particulates and aromatic compounds.

In early 2024, Shell made a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker at its Wesseling site into a production unit for Group III base oils.

Instead, this production unit will be used to make lubricants such as engine and transmission oils.

On the announcement of the final investment decision, Huibert Vigeveno, Shell’s Downstream and Renewables Director, said: “The repurposing of this European refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils.

“This investment is part of Shell’s drive to create more value with less emissions.”

Crude oil processing as a whole will end at this site in 2025, Shell said.

At the time of the final investment decision, Shell said that the high degree of electrification of the base oil plant, alongside the ceasing of crude oil processing into fuels at the Wesseling site, is expected to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by around 620,000 tonnes each year.

Shell’s emissions targets

Shell’s roadmap to net zero includes a set of targets across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

This includes halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions under its operational control on a net basis compared with 2016.

By the end of 2024, the company said it had achieved a 30% reduction, meeting 60% of that target.

Shell reduced its Net Carbon Intensity by 9% from 2016 levels by the end of 2024, hitting its short-term milestone ahead of schedule.

Scope 3 emissions from the use of Shell’s oil products were down 14% compared to 2021, showing traction in curbing end-use emissions.

Decarbonising products

Shell says it is focusing on diversifying its energy offering to include more sustainable options.

Its initiatives to decarbonise its energy mix include:

A defining feature of the Paris Air Show is the unveiling of major aircraft orders. With global passenger traffic now exceeding pre-pandemic levels and continuing to rise, Airbus and Boeing are expected to compete actively for new commitments from airlines across various regions.

Despite a more cautious market outlook shaped by geopolitical uncertainty, tariff risks, and signs of softening demand from airlines, there is still a strong appetite for fleet modernization and new technology aircraft. However, low-cost carriers are no longer pursuing capacity-driven growth due to a slowdown in travel bookings, making it likely that order volume from this segment will be softer than in previous years. In contrast, full-service network carriers are increasingly focused on replacing aging aircraft, many of which are affected by ongoing shortages of spare parts and serviceable engines. As a result, a portion of new orders is expected to come from these legacy operators.

Forecast International anticipates a healthy level of order announcements, although not at the record-setting volumes seen during the surge of 2022 and 2023. So far this year, Boeing has recorded only 249 gross orders, and Airbus has secured only 291. For context, 2024 closed with 569 orders for Boeing and 878 for Airbus. A more moderate order environment is expected at this year’s show, though we still do expect significant announcements from airlines across the globe. The narrowbody segment, led by the A320neo family and 737 MAX variants, will likely see the most activity. However, developments in the widebody market will also be closely monitored, particularly as long-haul travel strengthens its recovery and airlines look to grow their international networks.

Supply Chain Disruptions and Production Ramp-Ups

While aircraft orders generate headlines, the deeper industry conversation centers on delivery schedules and manufacturing constraints. While demand remains strong and order books are full, OEMs have not been meeting that demand, and the spotlight is shifting from backlog size to delivery performance. The post-pandemic delivery environment has exposed structural weaknesses in the commercial aerospace system. From 2015 to 2018, global aircraft deliveries steadily climbed from 1,692 to 1,842 units. Since then, delivery levels have not recovered. After collapsing to just 844 units in 2020, the recovery plateaued at 1,386 in 2023 and slid further to 1,264 in 2024. These are not blips in performance but rather reflect deeper issues tied to supply chain fragility and production bottlenecks across the sector.

The delivery shortfalls at major OEMs illustrate the magnitude of the problem. Airbus, though regaining volume to 767 deliveries in 2024, continues to miss targets for ramping up production. Boeing remains under pressure from regulatory scrutiny and persistent quality control issues, with 2024 output totaling only 350 units, less than half of its 2018 high. Embraer and COMAC are rebuilding steadily, but most other manufacturers remain well below their historical production levels. Forecast International’s outlook reflects this constrained reality. Civil aircraft production is forecast to rise from 1.65K units in 2025 to 2.42K by 2029, a more tempered trajectory than earlier projections. These figures suggest that although OEMs intend to rapidly ramp up production rates, the timeline in which this occurs remains limited by systemic challenges. In Paris, we expect stakeholders to look for clearer answers on realistic delivery rates, supplier resilience, and how OEMs intend to restore industrial capacity. The discussion has shifted from sales to execution, and the credibility of OEMs now hinges not on who takes the most orders, but on who can actually deliver.

Trade Policy De-escalation

Although recent developments suggest a de-escalation in aircraft-related tariffs, the issue remains fluid. The global trade environment is still adjusting to a volatile geopolitical backdrop and changing policy stances from key economies.

While tariff headlines may take a back seat during the 2025 show, trade frictions continue to pose latent risk. Any future shifts, particularly from newly elected administrations or evolving international alliances, could reignite tensions and impact cross-border commercial aerospace activity. Trade policy will remain an important undercurrent, even if it does not dominate the formal agenda.

eVTOLs and Urban Air Mobility: Advancing Toward Operational Maturity

The eVTOL sector arrives at Paris 2025 with a sense of momentum. Key players including Joby Aviation, Archer, and Vertical Aerospace have advanced their flight-testing programs and are targeting certification windows within the next 24 months.

The conversation is transitioning from technical feasibility to operational integration. Updates at the show are expected to focus on certification timelines, infrastructure development, and airspace management strategies. Regulatory harmonization, public acceptance, and urban planning constraints are emerging as critical factors in determining the pace of deployment. The challenges are no longer solely technical; they are now systemic.

Next-Generation Narrowbodies

Discussion around clean sheet narrowbody aircraft is gaining traction as the industry begins to look beyond the current A320neo and 737 MAX platforms, which are expected to remain in production into the 2030s.

At this year’s show, attention may turn to propulsion concepts such as open-fan architectures, hybrid-electric systems, and sustainable composite materials. While no major program announcements are expected, engine manufacturers and systems suppliers may provide early indications of the capabilities and efficiency targets that will define the next generation of narrowbody platforms.

Sustainability: No Longer the Front Page, But Still in the Story

While sustainability continues to be a long-term strategic priority, it may not command center stage in 2025. The industry’s current focus is shifting toward operational stability, including resolving production bottlenecks and restoring supply chain robustness.

This evolving emphasis is evidenced by Airbus’s recent extension of its ZEROe hydrogen aircraft development timeline beyond 2035. Furthermore, announcements regarding sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen propulsion, and electric aircraft have become more measured.

That said, sustainability will not disappear from the conversation. Progress reports on SAF partnerships, hydrogen infrastructure, and emissions targets are still expected. However, these updates are likely to play a supporting role rather than leading the narrative.

Aviation accounts for around 2-3% of the global carbon emissions, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help in reducing these emissions.

At the industry body, CII’s Annual Business Summit 2025 in the national capital, Boeing India and South Asia President Salil Gupte also said that 2,500 civil aircraft will be coming into India over the next 20 years.

India is one of the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets and Indian airlines have placed orders for more than 1,000 aeroplanes over the past few years.

While mentioning that the country will have a newer and younger aircraft fleet in the coming years that will also help in decarbonisation, Gupte also said it can be looked at how India can play a role in industrialisation of biofuels for aviation.

The barrier for SAF is not going to be aeroplane technology or engineering technology but the supply factor and how the fuel can be made more economical, he noted.

Currently, SAF costs 2.5 to 3.5 times more than Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).

If the world is to reach the net zero goal for aviation by 2050, it needs to have 185 million tonnes of SAF per year. India’s feedstock, whether it is used cooking oil, agricultural waste or the like, will be able to make 8-10 million tonnes of SAF per year.

”This means that India can actually provide over 5% of the world’s SAF requirements… India can be an exporter of SAF. This creates an opportunity. This means India can help decarbonise the civil aviation industry,” Gupte said and added that turning agricultural waste into SAF will be a tremendous opportunity.

This report focuses on examining the prospects for renewable fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which are types of biofuels manufactured from inedible biomass sources.

Government policies and international regulations are driving biofuel adoption across multiple sectors, but policy support remains uneven globally. Many countries have implemented mandates for blending biofuels with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to curb emissions. Even in shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is promoting biofuel use, while aviation sector is also gaining regulatory momentum. However, policy approaches vary widely around the world.

The oil and gas industry's energy transition must incorporate transition fuels and low-carbon energy sources within their portfolios to reduce their carbon footprint. This includes the use of biofuels, either directly or through blending with petroleum fuels to help decarbonize the transportation sector. Although biofuels are predominantly used in transportation, they also have other applications, including heating and aviation. Unlike conventional fuels, biofuels are produced mostly from plants and animal sources, which can be replenished quickly.

The platform, launched this week by the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) and called 'SAFc Connect', aims to help companies meet their aviation decarbonisation goals by connecting them with providers of SAF certificates, a market mechanism similar to renewable energy certificates for aviation fuel.

SAF certificates decouple the environmental benefits of sustainable aviation fuel from its physical volume (one metric tonne per unit), allowing companies to claim emissions reductions even if they do not have direct access to SAF.

The platform aims to support the development of the SAF market by allowing certificate providers to tap into near-term corporate demand through a more flexible commercial cycle. Authorised buyers can access SABA-vetted offers all in one place, with key details such as carbon intensity performance, sustainability certification standard, pricing, feedstock, fuel type, and term length. After reviewing these details, they can get in touch with providers to complete offtake discussions.

According to SABA surveys, the alliance’s member companies (which include Bank of America, Boeing, Boston Consulting Group, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, McKinsey & Company, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix and Salesforce) have an “immediate demand for approximately US$30 million worth of SAF certificates”.

Six SAF certificate providers committed

SABA notes that six SAFc providers (Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group, JetBlue, Targray, and Valero) have committed to participating in the SAFc Connect platform, and expects that number to increase in the coming months.

""To meet the decarbonisation goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near and long-term investment into SAF,"" said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of SABA Secretariat. ""With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.""

SABA’s work to support sustainable aviation fuel

The alliance was launched in 2021 to ramp up the SAF demand signal by aggregating corporate demand. In April 2024, SABA members collectively purchased US$200 million in SAF certificates, following a proof-of-concept pilot procurement exercise.

This month, SABA also launched a third request for proposals for next-generation fuels, hoping to facilitate 5 to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members and support the final investment decision for a new SAF production facility.

SAFc Connect gives participants a more flexible pathway to invest in high-integrity, commercially available SAF and is designed to support a faster offer-to-sale cycle that lets SAFc providers tap into near-term corporate demand.

SABA surveys indicate that SABA-member companies accessing SAFc Connect have an immediate demand for approximately $30 million worth of SAF certificates.

The annual-demand volume is expected to grow significantly year-on-year as SABA membership expands and companies ramp up investment to meet 2030 climate targets.

Approximately six SAFc providers—including Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group, JetBlue, Targray and Valero—have committed to participating in SAFc Connect with up to double that number expected to come on board in the coming months.

“To meet the decarbonization goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near- and long-term investment into SAF,” said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA secretariat. “With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF-procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.”

Since launching in 2021, SABA has worked with corporate buyers to aggregate demand for over $400 million in SAF certificates, first through a proof-of-concept pilot procurement and followed by 2023-’24’s groundbreaking multiyear procurement that supported tens of millions of gallons of SAF.

Earlier this month, SABA launched a third request for proposal (RFP) for next-generation fuels designed to facilitate five- to 10-year forward-purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final-investment decision (FID) for a new production facility.

SABA said SAFc Connect represents a next evolution of its commitment to aggregate demand and connect SAF suppliers with buyers seeking to invest in decarbonized aviation.

With the May 28 go-live, both buyers and providers stand to benefit, according to SABA.

Upon logging in, SAFc buyers can view posted offers all in one place, with each offer vetted by SABA and accompanied by key details such as carbon-intensity performance, sustainability certification standard, pricing, feedstock, fuel type and term length.

User-level permissions ensure that only authorized SAFc buyers can view sustainability and commercial information associated with the offers, which are subject to strict confidentiality requirements.

After reviewing available offers, buyers can then contact providers to complete offtake discussions.

Participating SAFc providers gain access to a committed community of buyers who want to make near-term purchases to meet their ambitious climate targets.

The platform will be updated on a recurring basis with additional platform participation and offer volumes.

The enhanced flexibility and responsiveness built into the system is expected to encourage new SAF production and capture long-term pricing benefits associated with economies of scale.

SAFc Connect will leverage SABA’s existing book-and-claim model that separates SAF’s environmental benefits from the physical fuel and captures them as a SAFc.

Purchasing SAF certificates allows corporate travelers to invest in SAF and capture the environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on.

The travelers’ investment allows them to make a greenhouse-gas emissions-reduction claim on their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF flows to an aircraft operator.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_28111cba61764e9591ed1066d536ac67~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_895,h_459,al_c,q_85/80995f_28111cba61764e9591ed1066d536ac67~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-05-29 11:56:44.585331

Wheat has always been a staple at Larson Seed Farm, started by Laird and Kathy Larson.
Grain farming was new to Briggs when he came to work for the Larsons after high school.
Much of their crop is trucked to Hamlin County Cooperative or AgWrx Cooperative in Garden City, South Dakota.
Soybean planting started April 15, and corn April 19 and wrapped up May 10, a record at Larson Seed Farm.","When South Dakota farmer Casey Briggs isn’t in the field, he’s often on the road making other farmers look good.

In the last year, his photo and video-making hobby took him to five states and 18 farms that grew nearly a dozen crops. He’s striped cotton in Oklahoma and Texas, cut milo in Kansas and harvested beets in North Dakota.

“It’s a hobby that has given me a lot of cool opportunities,” Briggs said from his home office at Larson Seed Farm near Clark, South Dakota.

Briggs, 32, will serve as Tri-State Neighbor Crop Watcher for the northeastern part of the state this year, providing bi-weekly reports and some top-notch photos.

The self-taught videographer picked up his camera during COVID.

“Everybody needed something to do back then,” he said.

Since then, he’s gotten some sponsored deals to showcase farm equipment or seed brands, and he’s provided footage for commodity organizations. Mostly though, he shares his photo and video work on social media for other farmers, some of whom have become good friends.

Each time he visits a new operation, he takes back a nugget of wisdom to improve his own business.

“If we all take some time, we can learn something from everybody we meet,” he said.

His goal is to show that there’s more to farm fields than corn and soybeans.

“That’s what I love about South Dakota, the diversity in agriculture,” Briggs said.

At Larson Seed Farm, Briggs has a four-crop rotation. It’s something that’s becoming rare on eastern South Dakota farms. He typically strip tills and plants corn into wheat stubble. That’s followed by no till soybeans or sunflowers.

Wheat has always been a staple at Larson Seed Farm, started by Laird and Kathy Larson. From 1984 to 2021, Laird Larson raised public variety wheat and soybean seed for South Dakota State University. He sold seed corn, too.

Grain farming was new to Briggs when he came to work for the Larsons after high school. He grew up in West River in northeastern Haakan County, where his family has raised cattle since the 1890s.

He met the Larsons when Laird hunted turkey at their ranch. For the last 10 years, Briggs has been part owner of Larson Seed Farm and is now the major decision maker in day-to-day operations. Laird is mostly retired, and Briggs works with another full-time employee and an intern from Lake Area Technical College to handle the work.

Last season brought good corn yields and a good winter wheat crop. Spring wheat was “dismal,” Briggs said, and soybeans were a little light. Much of their crop is trucked to Hamlin County Cooperative or AgWrx Cooperative in Garden City, South Dakota. Spring wheat went to Ardent Mills in Hastings, Minnesota, and sunflowers to Sunbird in Huron, South Dakota.

Briggs works with a marketing firm out of Lincoln, Nebraska, to shop around for the best grain price. Eventually he would like to build more on-farm storage to allow more flexibility in marketing.

The last growing season had a wet start from May into July. It began drying out in August, allowing for a quick harvest.

Planting season 2025 played out ahead of schedule, too. Spring wheat was planted in early March. Soybean planting started April 15, and corn April 19 and wrapped up May 10, a record at Larson Seed Farm.

Hot and windy conditions early in the season caused some of the soybeans to crust in. Then after a warm start to May, freezing temperatures crept in around May 19, coupled by 50 mph winds. Some corn and sunflowers were frozen, Briggs said.

With cooler temperatures came about an inch of rain each day over five days. The wet weather disrupted spraying work, and the crops could use some sunshine, Briggs said.

Farming in Clark and Hamlin counties, in the prairie pothole region and prairie coteau, fields are never too dry.

“We always say, ‘too wet, too cold, too long,’” Briggs said.

Many farmers’ answer to that is heavy tillage to warm up and dry the soil, Briggs said, but he uses no till and strip till management in an effort to keep the soil structure and increase water filtration.

Earlier this year, Briggs joined in on another venture, forming an LLC called Agland Technologies and selling an autosteer system that can work with older tractors. Between farming, the business and his video hobby, Briggs is following his mentor’s advice.

“Laird said it’s always good to have at least three augers running at once so you have something to come back to,” Briggs said. “I like to have a lot of projects.”

Michael Grunwald reports for Yale Environment 360.

In short:

President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” aims to expand subsidies for crop-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), despite cutting most other clean energy incentives.

The bill forbids including indirect land-use change (ILUC) in emissions accounting, allowing fuels from corn and soy to qualify as sustainable even though they drive deforestation.

Though the bill has no Democratic backers overall, the SAF provision has bipartisan support, particularly from lawmakers aligned with U.S. agricultural interests.

Key quote:

“Agriculture has an extremely well-oiled lobbying machine. So even as Congress guts all these things that reduce emissions to save money, they get Congress to spend lots of money to expand the one thing that increases emissions.”

— Dan Lashof, climate scientist and senior fellow at the World Resources Institute

Why this matters:

Growing corn and soy for fuel doesn’t come free. Globally, forests and grasslands are being cleared to make way for new farmland — releasing massive amounts of stored carbon and stripping the planet of vital carbon sinks. This land-use change, often invisible in simplified emissions models, makes many biofuels worse for the climate than the fossil fuels they’re supposed to replace. The U.S. government’s move to ignore these land-use emissions when calculating the climate impact of so-called sustainable aviation fuels effectively writes them out of existence — on paper, if not in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, taxpayer dollars are being funneled into subsidies for fuels that scientists say will accelerate global warming.",https://assets.rbl.ms/60333736/origin.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 07:56:10.077789

These deals will help the airline group reduce carbon emissions and deepen its understanding of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) systems, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

In the first of the two agreements, SIA acquired 1,000 metric tons of Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)-eligible neat SAF from Neste. The fuel was produced at Neste’s refinery in Singapore, blended locally, and supplied through Changi Airport. This marks the airline’s second such purchase from the same refinery, contributing to the growth of Singapore’s SAF infrastructure and boosting the resilience of its supply chain.

In a separate deal, the SIA Group purchased emissions reductions equivalent to 2,000 metric tons of SAF from U.S.-based World Energy. This was done using the Book & Claim model, allowing SIA to claim the environmental benefits of SAF without requiring physical delivery of the fuel.

Completed in the first quarter of 2025, the combined transactions are expected to cut over 9,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

SIA is also a participant in the Green Fuel Forward campaign—an initiative launched by the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero—to increase SAF demand in the Asia-Pacific region. The campaign promotes greater awareness, encourages partnerships, and supports the broader adoption of sustainable fuels in aviation.

“These agreements represent important steps in the SIA Group’s broader strategy to scale up its use of sustainable aviation fuel,” said Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer of Singapore Airlines. “By working with different suppliers and exploring diverse sourcing models and certification pathways, we gain crucial insights into the SAF landscape and can better understand the pathways towards a more sustainable aviation ecosystem.”

“Every part of the palm oil tree now creates value—from biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel to biomass and biogas.
Johari stressed that Malaysia has implemented strict no-deforestation policies and developed its own certification system—the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil standard—ensuring traceability, compliance, and inclusivity for smallholders.
“Palm oil is not just an edible oil; it is a strategic asset.","Malaysia is committed to becoming a global leader in sustainable agrocommodities, particularly in the palm oil industry, said Plantation and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani. He made the statement during his keynote address at the 12th Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources, organized by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.

In his speech, titled “Reinventing Commodities: Malaysia’s Competitiveness in Global Trade,” Johari outlined the transformation of the country’s palm oil sector through a circular economy model that embraces sustainability, innovation, and value creation across the entire supply chain. “Every part of the palm oil tree now creates value—from biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel to biomass and biogas. We are moving beyond linear growth to build a regenerative model that supports economic resilience, energy security, and climate action,” he noted.

Johari also highlighted that waste materials, previously discarded, such as empty fruit bunches, mesocarp fiber, palm kernel shells, and palm oil mill effluent, are now being repurposed into renewable energy and value-added products. “Malaysia is encouraging all mill operators to transition to renewable energy systems within the next decade,” the minister added. He expressed concern over the European Union’s recent Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which classified Malaysia as a “standard risk” country based on outdated 2020 FAO data. Johari stressed that Malaysia has implemented strict no-deforestation policies and developed its own certification system—the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil standard—ensuring traceability, compliance, and inclusivity for smallholders.

The minister reaffirmed Malaysia’s commitment to working with the EU Commission to secure fair recognition of the country’s progress by providing updated, science-based evidence to support its request for “low risk” status. Malaysia is also actively participating in international sustainability efforts, including commitments to net-zero emissions by 2050, methane reduction, and maintaining over 50% forest cover, a pledge dating back to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.

As Chair of the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC) and Co-Chair of the Forest, Agriculture, and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue, Malaysia is championing science-based narratives and equitable global trade frameworks that do not leave producing nations behind. “Palm oil is not just an edible oil; it is a strategic asset. Its unparalleled yield efficiency makes it the most land-efficient crop to meet global edible oil demands without further deforestation,” Johari concluded, calling for deeper global collaboration to redefine the value of commodities based on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact.",https://ukragroconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/66kelapasawit.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 06:56:10.132402

New Delhi: Ethanol, the renewable fuel made from plant materials, is fast gaining prominence in India's clean energy sector with its increasing use in replacing fossil resources as part of a larger movement favouring biofuels. Consider the fact that the average Ethanol Blending Percentage achieved by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) reached 18.4 per cent at the end of March 2025, from 14.6 per cent in the previous year, inching closer to the national target of 20 per cent.

""As far as use of biofuels in the transport sector is concerned, ethanol blending has been a great success and we are now touching 20 per cent of ethanol bending in gasoline. There are discussions on ethanol blending beyond 20 per cent. There are talks about using flex fuel vehicles which are also coming up. All the OEMs have been given a target to come out with flex fuel vehicles in this year. With that ethanol blending percentage will go higher,"" said Alok Sharma, Director (R&D) at Indian Oil Corp.

The oil companies are also working on an Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) fuel plan. While these plants are in the initial stages they will also come up in the next 2-3 years as the blending percentage increases slowly. Thanks to the aviation boom and the upcoming CORSIA mandates oil firms are shifting focus to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). IOC, for instance, is trying to use Used Cooking Oil (UCO) for making SAF, and the first plant is likely to be commissioned by October 2025 on Coprocessing route. IOC plans to produce at least up to 1-2 per cent of SAF blended ATF.

""By 2030, there is a likely mandate that 5 per cent of aviation fuel will be SAF. We are also trying to modify some of the plants where we can use UCO in our refineries. There are dedicated plants also being thought of where we can use UCO without co-processing to produce neat SAF. So, Ethanol is definitely going to be a centerstage going forward in the form of ethanol blending in gasoline, ethanol blending in diesel, and it will also be used as feed for producing aviation fuel,"" Sharma said.

Parallely, Indian Oil has set up its first plant for 2G Ethanol -- produced from agricultural residues and non-food crops -- at Panipat even as it faces a few issues in handling of the feed. It is running the plant at around 50 per cent capacity while the scale up-related issues are sorted. Other OMCs are also setting up at least three more plants. The companies see 2G ethanol too playing a critical role in boosting clean energy uptake as the issues surrounding feed supply chain, feed handling and the high price of 2G ethanol are addressed.

Apart from Ethanol, the past few years have witnessed progress on bio-CNG front too, which is receiving push under the SATAT scheme. Indian Oil has already set up three CBG plants under SATAT and it has plans to set up around 30 plants this year. ""The CBG programme has received a push also because of the CBG blending mandates -- 1 per cent by 2026, and increasing to 5 per cent by 2030. There are various schemes launched by the government on these initiatives including on Ethanol blending, biofuel policy, PM JI-VAN Yojana, Gobardhan etc. A lot of policies have been launched to push these fuels in the energy mix,"" Sharma said.

Another key promising area in fuel research is bio-Hydrogen used in the transport industry. IOC is working in this direction. Apart from Hydrogen production from the electrolysis of water, work on biomass gasification as a pathway is gaining traction. Indian Oil is trying to produce green Hydrogen via this route jointly with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). The OMC has already developed a process allowing 5 kg per hour of Green Hydrogen to be produced from biomass gasification and it plans to scale it up in one of its refineries. The company also sees potential in using CBG reforming as a Green Hydrogen pathway.

Overall, the biofuel sector in India is grappling with five broad challenges including skills, standards, segregation of waste, scale up and supply chain but Sharma believes there are many opportunities too in areas like 2G Ethanol, WTE, and non-food crops. India is aiming to become Net Zero by 2070, and in the Oil & Gas sector most of the companies have already announced their Net Zero targets.

For example, IOC has plans to achieve operational Net Zero by 2046. Sharma believes in order to achieve the Net Zero goal, action is required on key areas like energy efficien cy, renewable energy including biofuels, Green Hydrogen, and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS). The focus on biofuels must be ramped up specifically in view of their critical role in the decarbonisation of the automobile sector too.

So we’ve focused on making sure we’ve got that understood, and we’ve invested heavily to reduce the risk.
So it’s important to our overall recovery that we increase these rates.
We won’t be shy to make the necessary changes we need to drive the culture change that’s important for our future.
The Boeing programs, and certainly the proprietary parts, are critically important to our economic engine and to the support of our customers.","In Kelly Ortberg’s first in-depth interview since being tapped in August 2024 as president and CEO of Boeing, he met with Aviation Week editors Joe Anselmo, Guy Norris and Sean Broderick at the company’s 737 final assembly factory in Renton, Washington. During the wide-ranging and often frank discussion, Ortberg shared his plans for turning around the company, reforming its culture and navigating market uncertainties.

AW&ST: The big story for Boeing this year is your win of the U.S. Air Force’s F-47 fighter contract. Congratulations. It’s the single largest investment we’ve ever made in a defense program. We’ve been investing for years. This was a well-run competition, and I think we did an excellent job in putting an offer forward that was superior to the competition. We invested in prototype aircraft and facilities, and I think that investment has paid off. So, a huge win for us, because we don’t have a position in the current fifth-generation fighter. To have this sixth generation really sets the stage for our St. Louis fighter operations. We still have the F-15 and F/A-18 programs, but they’re reaching end of life, particularly the F/A-18. So this is going to be really important for us for decades to come.

Before Boeing won the F-47, its defense business was widely viewed as floundering. There were even questions about who would want it if you tried to spin it off. It resets the stage for our future in the fighter business. We’ve got the T-7 [trainer] franchise, which is just coming in. We’ve got continuation of the [KC-46] tanker franchise. So this was an important element in several ways. It’s the first sixth-generation program, and we had the technology ready to do that. I think a lot of people were probably surprised at that. What we’ve been doing in the dark cloud in investment for that program really paid off. I’m pleased to say we have what it takes to be providing state-of-the-art, next-generation capability. And some of those things from the defense business will help us as we think about our next commercial platforms as well. So we’ve got what it takes to recover this business. I’m not worried that we’ve lost a step and can’t recover. We’ve just got to execute better.

You’ve been big on program execution. What is Boeing doing differently on the F-47? Much more rigorous baseline management, making sure we have our supply chain aligned with the contract. Some of the large fixed-price contracts that we’ve had in the past have been problematic because we didn’t have back-to-back alignment with our supply chain, and that got us into real challenges. So we’ve focused on making sure we’ve got that understood, and we’ve invested heavily to reduce the risk. We’re at a very mature stage for a program of this nature. We’re going to be able to go faster and not incur those risks in the middle of the development program.

What are the two or three biggest risks current tariff policies pose to Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA)? The input tariffs, where we pay a 10% tariff, are predominantly impacting us for wings and fuselages in Japan and Italy. We’re not in a position to pass those [costs] along to our customers. I’m hopeful that, as each of these country-by-country negotiations resolve, those tariffs will go away in the long run. Luckily, 80% of our supply chain comes out of the U.S. In some cases, if you pay a tariff and then [export] the airplane, you actually can draw back on the tariff. A large portion of our backlog is international, so that would be more of a cash timing issue than a margin performance issue.

The other issue, probably more impactful, is if any retaliatory tariffs are applied. We are seeing that right now in China, and that is causing Chinese airlines not to take delivery of [U.S.-made] aircraft. We certainly hope this doesn’t escalate to where other countries apply retaliatory tariffs and we get in a situation that we can’t deliver the airplanes we have in the production system today. Now, there is tremendous demand for airplanes overall, so we can [find another buyer] if there is a certain region where we can’t make deliveries. But it’s not easy to shift quickly, because airplanes are painted in an airline livery, the interiors are aligned to that airline, so to go sell that to a different customer takes work. I’m in regular contact with the administration, all the way to POTUS. They are clearly focused on making sure the aerospace and defense business continues to be an export engine. They’re watching very closely, and their intent is to help us, not hurt us. It’s a very dynamic time. Every day is a new day with tariffs.

Boeing is the prime contractor for NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) core stage. The Trump administration is proposing to terminate the SLS, and there is much uncertainty about NASA’s future direction. Do you see space as a core part of Boeing’s future? Absolutely. I think some of the challenges we’ve had with Starliner [Boeing’s crew vehicle] have overshadowed our space portfolio. We’ve got a tremendous portfolio, particularly in the secure national security space regime. I think the manned space, commercial and NASA business is going to be dependent on where the budget goes and what the country wants to invest in those programs. But that doesn’t implicate our overall commitment to space and national security space. With the work we’re doing with the X-37B [orbital test vehicle], there are great opportunities for us in the future. We’re a world leader in space. A lot of that is classified business, but we’re going to stay committed to the space sector.

Do you think the SLS could survive in a different form or at least be extended further? I have no privileged insight to give you. I’m following the budget and the [Trump] administration priorities as much as everybody. We’re just going to have to react to what that is. Whether that’s a few more launches and then a wind-down or a redirection is yet to be seen.

Boeing’s decision to put NASA’s X-66 Transonic Truss-Braced Wing demonstrator aircraft on ice was a bit of a surprise. Your predecessor, Dave Calhoun, had pointed to the X-66 as a potential pathway to the 737 single-aisle replacement market. What changed? I don’t know if anything really changed as much as the value we thought we were going to get out of the program. We’ve redirected the resources to continue to invest in the areas we think are going to be more impactful to a future aircraft program. So I think it’s making sure we’re not spending valuable resources on a prototype airplane that’s not getting us what we need in terms of technology development. It has been a great program, and we learned a lot from it. And we are going to continue our investments in elements that we think will have value in our future airplanes.

Namely thin-wing technology? Yes. We didn’t want to spend a lot of our resources on what I’ll call mundane maintenance of an aircraft. We’re focusing on the technology areas. That’s the shift you’re seeing.

As you look to Boeing’s next commercial airplane, where do you see the company prioritizing research? The near-term priorities are, from a commercial perspective, getting the current development programs through the certification process. We’re hoping to get the two variants of the 737 MAX wrapped up this year so we can start deliveries of the -7 and the -10, two airplanes that are very, very important to our customers and our backlog. And then the 777-9, which will be the largest dual-engine widebody in the market. We’ve got four [777-9s] in flight test, and we’re making great progress. I think that’s going to be a game-changing platform for us.

In terms of what’s next, I view it as different work streams:

One: “When is the market ready?” Two: “When is the technology ready?” And three: “When are we ready and can financially handle that?”

We’re not ready on any of those work streams today, but we need to be when the market is ready for a new aircraft. Remember, we have half a trillion dollars of backlog, and most of that is commercial products. We have huge demand for those products, and I would say there’s more focus on upgrading existing aircraft, putting new engines and capability on them.

There is growing demand for airplanes in the midmarket sector, which Boeing looked at five years ago. Now startups such as JetZero are trying to penetrate that market. Do you think you’ll begin to look at a new product for the 2030s? We’re constantly looking. Looking is one thing; launching is another. We’re in the early innings of our recovery. We’re still in a negative cash situation. We’re going to get that turned around by the second half of the year, but we’ve got to get our company healthy. We’ll continue to do our research to be ready, but I’m not going to put a date on it because all three of those work streams have to have a thumbs-up for us to go. And right now, they all have a thumbs-down. Hopefully our recovery will stay on track, and that will give us more flexibility to do something.

Are you concerned that Airbus is pulling too far ahead in its market advantage? No. We are behind [in certifying] the 737-10 in that segment of the market. We need to get that airplane certified so we can compete. We’re in great shape with our widebody product line. We’ve got to get the 777 in place. But I’m not too concerned that we’ve fallen significantly behind. We’re doing things in our labs that we’re not talking about to be prepared for the next generation.

You’ve called out certification as a focus area for BCA leadership and talked about Boeing needing to be more proactive. Could you expand on that? What I was specifically talking about is working with the FAA in a more proactive way to ensure that we don’t see continuous delays in the certification process, especially when it’s administrative or documentation review or documentation back-and-forth between us and the FAA. I’m very encouraged with the new FAA leadership. I’ve had meetings with Secretary [Sean] Duffy at the Department of Transportation, and he’s come out and talked with our employees. We need to work together to streamline that process. It has gotten way too elongated. We’ve seen progress. We recently got FAA type inspection authorization approvals for the 777-9. But there’s still a lot of work to do, particularly on the 777X, to get that certification complete. That’s going to be a continued focus for us for the rest of the year.

The 777X program was launched at the 2013 Dubai Airshow. You had just become CEO of Rockwell Collins, a key supplier to the program. Could you have ever imagined at that time we would be here in 2025, and it still wouldn’t be in service? No. I’m still shocked. Now, it’s partially driven by circumstances outside of the 777X program. The extra regulations that came out and the whole certification process were driven more by the MAX situation than anything on 777X. It’s amazing that it has not been in service for years. But it isn’t, and the task at hand is to get it over the finish line.

Are you satisfied with where the program is today? Yes. The performance of the four that are flying is fantastic. We’ve got more hours on this airplane than any other we’ve ever put into production service. So we feel really good about having a good entry into service. Customers have hung with us through that long delay because they see value in the airplane. I think it’s going to be a great product for us once we get through the near-term certification challenge.

Where are you on ramping up 737 MAX production? We now have three lines running and flowing, and we have [an FAA-imposed] rate cap of 38 [per month]. It is important to get beyond that 38 rate. What day or month we do that is less important than ensuring we have a stable quality system and that we can move to a higher rate in a stable way. We’re in a cash-negative situation, and for us to be generating cash, we need to have the MAX production up around 38-40 a month. So it’s important to our overall recovery that we increase these rates. But we’re going to do it in a smart, safe way, in accordance with our safety and quality plan. Year-to-date, we’re ahead of our plan on deliveries, and we haven’t been pushing the deliveries; we’ve been pushing the safety and quality plan. So it’s playing out like we want.

The current 777F freighter is a valuable cash-earner for you, but under International Civil Aviation Organization emissions rules, production must end in 2027. Can you deliver the existing backlog by that deadline? We’re quite comfortable in being able to deliver the metal-wing freighters and meeting the certification timeline. So as you know, we have another freighter version with the composite wing, so that’ll come later. But yes, we’re pretty comfortable with our ability to do that, and our manufacturing flow for the freighters is going quite well.

Another delayed program is the new Air Force One. Donald Trump complained about it when he was elected president in 2016. Eight and a half years later, he’s still waiting, and he’s not happy. What changes are you making to execute on this program differently? A lot of changes. The president has asked Elon Musk to oversee and help us as we look at the program. We have been struggling with certain requirements that were just unachievable. In some cases, we’ve gotten relief from those requirements, and Elon has been very helpful. I will tell you that we’ve made more progress on the airplane in the last four months than we made in the last four years. We are closing jobs; the design is getting very, very close to completely closed. And then it’s just a matter of building up the aircraft to that design. I’m pretty pleased with the progress. It’s not fast enough for POTUS, and he’s made that perfectly clear. So we’re going to do everything we can to go faster. Having said that, we’re not cutting any corners. We’ve got to make sure that this is a super-safe airplane and it meets the needs of the president and the national security.

Where are you in the program? We’ve been through a series of design reviews. We haven’t published a schedule yet with the Air Force, although I think we’re getting close. The Air Force has made some statements talking about a 2027 delivery, which has pulled up significantly from where it was. So we’ll be making more public announcements on the details of the schedule in concert with the Air Force.

The main thrust of Boeing’s internal safety and quality plan is instilling a culture of change all the way down to the factory floor. They have to buy into your system, safety first, the leadership. From your seat as CEO, what is the most effective thing you can do to help drive that change? Major culture change is one of my key turnaround focus areas. I’ve talked to our leadership about the need to get close to the people building and designing the airplanes. That’s literally why I’m here in Seattle. That’s why, right after this interview, I’m going out on the factory floor to talk to people building the 737 MAX. We’ve got to be closer and helping our people be successful. We did a voice-of-the-employee survey this year, the first one in five years. It gave us great feedback on areas where we’ve got to improve. We’re creating action plans to address that. I’ve done a lot of work in changing the culture of a company. It’s not a poster on the wall. People watch the behaviors of the leadership, and that’s what drives change. This is going to be an important year as we drive that into the organization. People need to see us walk the talk from the top down.

You’ve made a few changes to your leadership team. Is what we see now the team going forward for the foreseeable future? I think the leadership team is getting pretty well, and that’s helping, as we’re starting to see progress. But we’ll continue to supplement the team as necessary. I think as we move through our values and behavior implementation this year, that could cause some shift in leadership—maybe not at my direct level, but at other levels. Because we’re making it clear that we’re going to shift the culture of the company, and our leaders have to buy into that or we’re going to have to put different people in those roles. We won’t be shy to make the necessary changes we need to drive the culture change that’s important for our future.

You’re renowned for what you did with the culture at the old Rockwell Collins. Boeing is a much bigger company. How do you reduce bureaucracy and internal complexity in an enterprise as big as Boeing? It’s a good question. When I ran Collins Aerospace, we had 77,000 employees. At Boeing we have 160,000 employees, so the scale is massively different. And to scale the culture change is probably the biggest challenge I have. When we went through our workforce reduction last fall, we targeted layers of management, and in certain areas we’ve eliminated two entire layers of management so that we can make decisions faster, be more streamlined, get closer to our employees. It’s the same process. It’s just a bigger scale, and it’s going to take more diligence and probably a little longer.

Boeing had zero write-downs in its first quarter. Does this mean we’re done seeing these every quarter? We had a good quarter, no write-downs, but we are definitely not claiming victory. We’ve got a lot of work to do on these fixed-price [military] programs. I am proud of the team’s focus on baseline management, and in some cases where we’re working with the customers to adjust the contract in win-win ways. This allows us to be more successful and them to get their product at an earlier date. The T-7 is kind of our case-study program. We restructured that through a [memorandum of agreement] with the Air Force. We are ticking off the new milestones on schedule, and they’re very pleased. The more we can get into an environment where we’re working with the customer to create the win-win, the less the large [write-downs]. I think we’ve changed our focus and are making progress on these big fixed-price programs.

Boeing Global Services (BGS) recently divested several businesses that were platform-agnostic. In the future, will BGS be more focused on supporting Boeing programs versus agnostic? There’s two answers to that. The Boeing programs, and certainly the proprietary parts, are critically important to our economic engine and to the support of our customers. That’s super-core to the company. But we also have parts distribution businesses where we’re selling parts that aren’t a part of Boeing. That’s a nice business—it generates a good cash flow and is operating really well. So I think our BGS business remains core to us. [But] we’re looking across portfolios. You mentioned the divestiture that we recently announced out of BGS in our digital data services business. We’ll continue to look at those things that maybe don’t create value to the core of what we’re doing. But in the main, the BGS business is critical to our success, our customers’ success and our future.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-05-29 03:56:33.220648

This can be resolved either by uncovering new feedstock sources, or by retaining more feedstock during the refining process.
Choosing the right adsorbent for feedstock pretreatment can also help contribute to a lower total cost of ownership for the refinery.
For instance, TRISYL® silica adsorbents help retain more feedstock in the refining process, lowering feedstock costs.
• Vacuum and filtration: A vacuum removes moisture from the adsorbent/feedstock mixture, after which solids and contaminants are filtered out.","Chelsea Grimes, global strategic marketing manager at Grace, outlines how the company has been supporting the biofuels industry.

Can you outline Grace’s solutions for biofuels and SAF?

Let me start by saying that Grace is one of the leading global suppliers of speciality chemicals and solutions that enable industries to enhance modern life. To that end, we have been supporting the biofuels sector for over 60 years, helping to innovate new and improved renewable production processes. Today, we offer a range of biofuel and SAF solutions — from silica adsorbents for feedstock pretreatment to molecular sieves for ethanol dehydration and hydroprocessing catalysts. One of our flagship products, TRISYL®, is a synthetic amorphous silica adsorbent that helps refiners reduce impurities in a variety of feedstocks down to trace levels during pretreatment. It is used for renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and first-generation biodiesel, and its specially engineered structure helps it adsorb polar contaminants and prolong catalyst life. TRISYL® silica may reduce solid waste from pretreatment by up to 85%, while improving productivity and reducing the overall cost of pretreatment. TRISYL® is a synthetic hydrogel, containing roughly 60% moisture and 40% pure amorphous SiO₂. Due to its chemical and physical properties, polar contaminants in the feedstock have a higher affinity to TRISYL®, and the risk of metals leaching back into the feedstock is reduced compared to bleaching earth (BE) adsorbents. Another advantage is that it does not contain detectable levels of crystalline silica, unlike BE, making it a safer alternative for material handling purposes. We have also been manufacturing molecular sieves for ethanol dehydration since the 1970s. Today, our SYLOBEAD® molecular sieves dry ethanol produced from edible feedstocks, cellulosic feedstocks, and synthetically produced ethanol. One of our newer innovations is EnRich® catalysts from Advanced Refining Technologies (ART), a Chevron and Grace joint venture, which acts as a “drop in” solution for hydrotreating feedstocks into renewable fuels.

What are some of the challenges when it comes to producing SAF? Is there enough feedstock to go around?

Producing SAF comes with its challenges, especially when it comes to feedstocks. Right now, there are limited amounts of lipid-based feedstocks available to turn into fuel making it difficult to source enough oils, fats and grease to consistently feed your refinery. This can be resolved either by uncovering new feedstock sources, or by retaining more feedstock during the refining process. That’s where our TRISYL® silica adsorbent comes in. It helps refiners achieve the same level of feedstock purity with a lower adsorbent dosage than alternative methods by introducing fewer solids and generating less filter cake waste — so less oil is lost in the process. Feedstock flexibility is another issue. The quality and source of feedstock can change daily, but that shouldn’t impact the refining processes if you have a pretreatment process that is compatible with a range of feedstock sources. Depending on the oil and fat used, contaminant levels can also vary widely – a highly efficient pretreatment process should be able to remove impurities without leaching any back into the feedstock. Most pretreatment technologies have been adapted from the edible oil industry and often use BE adsorbents, which often result in a large amount of solid waste. Managing the logistics of purchasing large amounts of clay and disposing of the resulting mounds of solid waste can be a challenge. As colour is not a specification for non-edible oils, BE is not necessary to use as an adsorbent for renewable fuels. TRISYL® silica’s larger surface area of roughly 700 m2/g and higher adsorption capacity mean refiners can achieve the same pretreatment performance as with traditional clays, but with much less adsorbent.

What types of feedstocks are compatible with TRISYL® silica adsorbents?

TRISYL® silica adsorbents have been utilised globally in the refining of plant oils and fats for the past 40 years. They can remove polar and ionic contaminants, such as some phosphorus- and metal based species, down to trace levels, and can be used in all HEFA pretreatment units utilising lipid-based feedstocks such as used waste oils, cover crops and other novel oils. When introduced into a non-polar environment such as triglycerides, partial glycerides, and fatty acids, TRISYL® silica’s hydrogel composition and hydrophilic surface area of over 700 m²/g creates a strong affinity for polar compounds, efficiently adsorbing impurities and improving the feedstock’s suitability for SAF production.

Do you think that the cost of producing SAF can come down and, if yes, how?

I do. The cost of producing SAF is expected to decrease over time as production technologies develop at scale and mature, regardless of the pathway used. Of the four main pathways — hydroprocessing esters and fatty acids (HEFA), alcohol-to-jet (AtJ), biomass-to-liquids (BtL), and power-to-liquids (PtL) — I believe HEFA will likely remain the most cost-competitive route to SAF until 2050, with most production costs linked to lipid-based feedstocks. Choosing the right adsorbent for feedstock pretreatment can also help contribute to a lower total cost of ownership for the refinery. For instance, TRISYL® silica adsorbents help retain more feedstock in the refining process, lowering feedstock costs. TRISYL® silica’s adsorption capacity is not hindered by feedstock qualities such as free fatty acids, enabling refiners to use a variety of feedstocks, including waste streams and cover crops that natural silica adsorbents cannot purify.

Can you describe your feedstock pretreatment processes for SAF?

Pretreatment is especially critical for renewable fuels like renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Compared to traditional crude oil, lipid-based feedstocks often contain elevated concentrations of uncommon impurities, such as phosphorus and metals, which must be removed to prevent impacts on the refinery’s catalyst and downstream operations. Pretreatment also ensures a variety of feedstocks can be used, regardless of their source and initial contaminant level.

It is a multi-step process, similar to how the edible oil industry has been refining oils for decades:

• Feedstock blending: Feedstocks are blended depending on supply availability. This often includes two or three different sources, but blends can involve up to eight or more.

• Straining: Depending on the source, feedstocks may contain plastics, bone fragments, or other particulates, which are removed through a series of strainers.

• Acid conditioning: The feedstock blend is conditioned with a mild acid, usually citric acid, to chelate metals and phospholipids, causing them to precipitate out of the matrix.

• Caustic treatment/water washing: This optional step, depending on contamination levels, can remove up to 75% of phosphorus and metals after water washing — though additional treatment is needed to protect downstream processes.

• Impurity adsorption: The critical step for removing remaining phosphorus and metals down to trace levels (3 ppm and 7 ppm, respectively). In a slurry tank, an adsorbent material such as TRISYL® silica is added to adsorb residual impurities. Its high functional moisture content, large surface area and high purity enable efficient attraction of polar contaminants without leaching metal oxides back into the feedstock.

• Vacuum and filtration: A vacuum removes moisture from the adsorbent/feedstock mixture, after which solids and contaminants are filtered out. TRISYL®’s mass shrinks to about 40% of its original amount during drying, introducing fewer solids into the filter and minimising feedstock loss. This extends filter cycles and increases renewable diesel and SAF yields. Hydroprocessing catalyst technology licensors set strict specifications for phosphorus and various metals. The adsorbent must be capable of treating a wide range of contaminants. If feedstock is not sufficiently pretreated, catalyst licensors may not guarantee performance. There is no one-size-fits all solution for pretreatment — it depends on the specific refinery setup, production capacities, feedstock sources and impurity levels. We work closely with customers to collect and analyse feedstock samples to determine optimal adsorbent dosage levels.

The forward-looking statements included in this release are made only as of the date hereof.","ENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Agri-Energy, LLC (“Agri”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Gevo, to A.E. Innovation, LLC (“A.E.”) for $7 million. The transaction includes Agri’s 18-million-gallon-per-year ethanol-production facility located in Luverne, Minnesota. Gevo will retain ownership of certain isobutanol-production-related assets and a portion of the vacant land at the site for future use. With these retained assets, Gevo could potentially produce up to 1 million gallons per year of isobutanol, which can be sold as a specialty chemical, or converted into isooctane and jet fuel.

A.E., an agriculture-oriented buyer group located in Minnesota, will acquire the ethanol plant and a portion of the land with the intent to restart ethanol production, which has been idled since 2022. A.E. also intends to make the site available for other companies to scale up new technologies and ideas as an innovation hub.

“We’re seeing rapid innovation in the direction of bio-based fuels and chemicals and Agri-Energy has the demonstrated history that it can work on the cutting edge,” says Dave Kolsrud, principal of A.E. Innovation, LLC. “We see Gevo and others making strides and we know we’ll be a part of that. We are excited to host the next generation of biofuel innovations that need a friendly, practical place where they can scale them up. That’s Luverne, with its history of innovation, its low-carbon corn supply, wind power, and great people.”

Over the last several years, the Luverne plant, in conjunction with local farmers, has been used as a demonstration site for educating Gevo’s stakeholders about regenerative agriculture and the versatility of corn and its co-products, as well as biofuel production, including synthetic aviation fuel (“SAF”), isobutanol, and ethanol. Gevo and A.E. look forward to continuing and expanding upon this valuable stakeholder outreach.

“We see tremendous potential for future growth and new partnerships with A.E. Innovation,” says Patrick Gruber, CEO of Gevo. “Minnesota’s farming communities, especially in places like Luverne, are leading the way with smart, sustainable agricultural practices. We believe it's the perfect foundation for building innovative solutions in carbohydrate-based energy and chemicals that the world urgently needs.”

Gevo notes that the sale of Agri-Energy to A.E. Innovation provides $2 million of cash upon closing and an additional $5 million of future cash under the purchase agreement, along with an estimated annual savings of approximately $3 million per year of current facility idling costs. Gevo also anticipates potential future benefits from isobutanol fermentation through a side-by-side operational model with the ethanol assets. Restarting ethanol production is expected to bring positive impacts to the City of Luverne, including support for local farmers and strengthening the regional economy.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2025, subject to the procurement of financing by A.E. and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.

He said: “If we are committed to Net Zero by 2050, the only way to get there is greatly expanding sustainable aviation fuel.

“The roadmap that the International Air Transport Association puts forward is that 65% of CO2 reduction can come from SAF, so that is a big chunk.

“There are obviously environmental benefits with SAF, but there are also economic benefits for Australia. As a nation, we import 100% of our jet fuel, we don’t produce a single drop of it. So if SAF can become a domestic product, that’s also good for jobs and the economy here.”

SAF benefits

One major benefit of SAF is that its physical and chemical characteristics are almost identical to conventional kerosene jet fuel, which is derived from petroleum. This means SAF can be mixed in with regular jet fuel with no impact on performance, with the current regulations allowing for up to a 50% mix.

SAF can also be supplied via the existing infrastructure, and used in aircraft without needing to modify airframes - the ‘skeleton’ of the plane - and fuel tanks.

However, SAFs are more expensive to produce and currently limited in terms of availability compared to conventional jet fuel, which is why they currently account for less than 0.1% of all aviation fuels consumed.

Existing and planned SAF projects in advanced stages are predicted to meet just 2-4% of jet fuel demand by 2030.

Which is why the IEA has stated: “Increasing the use of these sustainable aviation fuels to get in line with the Net Zero Scenario will require supportive policies and a significant ramp-up of investments in production capacity.”

UNSW Scientia Professor Rose Amal, opens in a new window is the network lead of the NSW Powerfuel Including Hydrogen Network, opens in a new window (PFHN), which is part of the part of the NSW Decarbonisation Hub, opens in a new window - a NSW Government initiative whose aim is to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.

PFHN, in collaboration with the NSW Office of the Chief Scientist and Engineer, recently helped to produce a report, the ‘NSW Synthetic Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) Value Chain Study, opens in a new window’, which outlines the pathways and challenges for developing a local e-SAF industry and highlights its role in supporting deep emissions cuts in the aviation sector.

e-SAF is a particular type of sustainable aviation fuel which is produced by combining captured carbon dioxide with hydrogen that has been generated by renewable electricity.

Prof. Amal said: ""Decarbonising aviation is not just about solving problems in the lab, it is about connecting the whole value chain.

""Through PFHN, we are bringing together feedstock suppliers, hydrogen producers and airlines to help identify and scale the right solutions for Australia.

""While eight SAF pathways have already been approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), we still need strong R&D to develop new technologies and significantly improve the efficiency of existing ones, so we can bring the cost down and find the right mix for Australia’s long-haul future.""

So what exactly is SAF, what problems need to be solved to speed up its development and implementation, and how can these challenges be overcome?

Not just a single SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel is a term for any jet fuel made from renewable sources – like plant oils, waste materials, and even captured carbon – which are designed to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

SAF cuts greenhouse gas emissions significantly and it works seamlessly with existing aircraft and fuelling infrastructure.

There are several types of SAF in development, including HEFA (made from vegetable oils and animal fats), Alcohol-to-Jet (produced from plant-based alcohols), and eFuels (created using green hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide).

Each type uses different feedstocks and processes, but all aim to make flying more sustainable for the future.

Bio-SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from sustainable organic feedstocks, in which case it is known as bio-SAF.

Biological materials – such as used cooking oil, animal fats, or plant oils — can be refined through chemical processes to create a fuel almost identical to conventional jet fuel.

One common method, called the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) process, uses hydrogen to remove unwanted elements from these oils and fats, then rearranges their molecules to match the structure needed for aviation fuel.

HEFA is the most commercially mature SAF technology and is widely available, with Virgin Australia recently announcing a deal with Viva Energy to supply it with a 30% HEFA fuel blend for some of its flights out of Queensland.

However, limited supply of the required raw materials means there may not be enough feedstock to meet the aviation industry’s full demand in the next 10 to 20 years, especially as competition for these resources grows.

Modelling prepared for the Air Transport Action Group’s Waypoint 2050 report, opens in a new window says that bio-SAF feedstock might only supply 50% of the SAF required to meet the net-zero by 2050 target set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

e-SAF

e-SAF is the name given to synthetic sustainable aviation fuel which is derived from renewable energy.

Here, the production starts by using the likes of wind or solar power to split water into hydrogen, which is then combined with carbon dioxide captured from the air (or from industrial processes) to create a liquid fuel.

This is done via the Fischer-Tropsch process, well established for almost 100 years, which uses a catalyst to transform the hydrogen and CO2 gases into synthetic crude oil, which is further refined into aviation-grade fuel.

A major benefit of e-SAF is that renewable energy, green hydrogen and carbon dioxide are vastly more abundant than organic feedstocks needed for bio-SAF.

However, Dr Emma Lovell, opens in a new window from UNSW’s School of Chemical Engineering, opens in a new window who has a research focus on carbon dioxide conversion, acknowledges the cost of e-SAF is currently prohibitive.

“It is around four to 10 times more expensive than current conventional fuels,” Dr Lovell says.

“But I absolutely believe that can be brought down significantly. The two main factors at the moment are the cost of producing green hydrogen and the cost of direct air capture which extracts carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

“However, there is widespread research into making both of those processes more efficient and there is significant potential for cost reductions to get to a point where there is at least competitiveness, if not parity, with the price of sustainable aviation fuel.

“The advantage compared to bio-SAF is that there’s no need to make that choice between growing feedstocks for food or for fuel. The other benefit is that the e-SAF actually makes a whole range of materials, such as sustainable diesel, useful waxes and other products that are used in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

""So you get all of those, but in a green way, as well as fuel.”

ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet)

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) fuel is another type of sustainable aviation fuel which is made by converting alcohols like ethanol or isobutanol into jet fuel through a series of chemical processes.

The alcohol is first obtained by fermenting biomass such as plant materials or agricultural waste, before being dehydrated to remove water and then chemically manipulated to create hydrocarbons that closely resemble jet fuel.

Several airlines have entered agreements to purchase ethanol-based SAF for use in major airports starting as soon as 2027.

However, challenges remain – such as the high cost of alcohol feedstocks, the need for further technological improvements, and competition with other uses for biomass, which could limit widespread adoption and keep prices higher than conventional fuels.

Other non-SAF sustainable options

The development of electric planes, powered by batteries, is also advancing rapidly with several prototypes and short-range commercial models in the pipeline.

But while electrification may be feasible for short-haul or regional trips, the huge weight of the batteries needed for long-haul flights, as well the energy density currently possible, is a major challenge.

Hydrogen is also being developed and tested as a fuel for aircraft. However, existing infrastructure would likely need to be significantly redeveloped for hydrogen to become the main jet fuel of the future, while aircraft themselves would also need to be potentially redesigned to deal with the heavy storage systems needed to carry hydrogen on board.

Overall, Dr Lovell says all options for SAF need to be researched and potentially developed, as their use-case may differ depending on where and how they can best be implemented.

“I think the fair assessment is that the transition to a sustainable aviation fuel market will not be driven by one source of one feedstock, it will have to be driven by a diverse mix of feedstocks and approaches which are specifically designed for a variety of contexts,” she said.

“There are places where we have an abundance of biomass and in those cases the bio-SAF pathway makes a lot of sense and can even already be close to being economically competitive.

“But in other circumstances there may be a significant benefit to trying the capture carbon dioxide that’s already in the atmosphere, or would otherwise be a harmful emission, and using that to produce a sustainable fuel.”",https://www.unsw.edu.au/content/dam/images/photos/stock/2025-05-sustainableaviationfuel/AdobeStock_1359932126.cropimg.width=700.crop=landscape.jpeg,N,,2025-05-28 23:56:12.627984

“The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) sets the strict quality specifications for fuels to be eligible for use in the aviation industry, and they have approved eight different pathways for the production of SAF.

“So there are a lot of ways to potentially solve the problem and that’s what the PFHN and others are doing – to develop all the new technologies. But we also need feedback from the aviation industry to tell us exactly what they need.”

So what exactly is SAF, what problems need to be solved to speed up its development and implementation, and how can these challenges be overcome?

As the letter noted, states are permitted to regulate the sale and use under FIFRA but are preempted from creating additional labeling requirements or requiring different labels and packaging.

""Nevertheless, in recent years, we have seen actions from states that directly and unjustifiably contradict EPA's scientific findings on pesticide safety,"" the groups wrote to lawmakers.

Those moves by states risk creating an ""inconsistent patchwork of state pesticide labels"" that can complicate sales and access to crop-protection tools. The labeling demands from states also risk jeopardizing public confidence in EPA's authority and science-based regulations, the groups stated.

The letter added, ""Growers and users need reaffirmation from Congress that while states have authority to regulate the sale and use of pesticides within their jurisdiction, they cannot impose labeling or packaging requirements in addition or different from the scientific conclusions of the EPA.""

PETITIONED EPA

Eleven attorneys general from Republican-led states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and South Carolina -- petitioned EPA in January to amend FIFRA to prevent states from requiring labels inconsistent with EPA's findings, such as a pesticide's likelihood to cause cancer, birth defects or reproductive harm. The attorneys general said such labels by states should be considered as misbranding the product.

A lot of the complaints go back to California and the decision in 2017 to require warning labels for pesticides such as glyphosate. California listed glyphosate as a known carcinogen but faced immediate legal challenges. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023 blocked California from enforcing the warning label.

Agricultural groups filed an amicus brief earlier this month asking the Supeme Court to hear a petition from Bayer/Monsanto in one of its cases tied to more than 100,000 plaintiffs across the country suing Bayer for not warning people that glyphosate causes cancer. Bayer is appealing a ruling against it by a state court in Missouri. The case, Monsanto v Durnell, was filed with the Supreme Court back in April. Beyond agricultural groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others have also weighed in so far, arguing that upholding such state-level claims would preempt federal authority.

WANT CLARITY

Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, said agricultural groups are taking an ""all of the above"" approach right now to bring some clarity to spelling out federal authority over pesticide labels and liability.

""Unless there is clarity, we're worried manufacturers could exit the market and leave farmers without much-needed tools needed to protect crops and provide affordable food for consumers,"" Ragland said.

Bayer executives have already suggested the company could stop manufacturing products such as Roundup without some relief from the litigation it faces.

States also have been debating bills that would seek to limit legal liability for cancer-related litigation and spell out that state law aligns with EPA requirements. North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong (R) signed such a bill back in April and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) signed a similar law earlier this month.

UNCERTAINTY FOR AGRICULTURE

Without action, Congress risks creating uncertainty for agriculture. ""The ability of farmers, land managers, and other users to produce an abundant food, feed, and fiber supply, combat public health threats, implement important conservation practices, and maintain vital transportation and utility infrastructure will be significantly impaired.""

All of that could risk higher food prices, and the farm groups state, ""Important infrastructure will fall into disrepair; our population will be increasingly vulnerable to vector-bone diseases; and our ability to combat climate change and other environmental challenges will be undermined.""

The Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act was introduced in 2023 by Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., and Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif. The bill only had six other co-sponsors.

The agricultural groups stated, ""Congressional action on this important matter will ensure our nation's farmers and other users have reliable access to these vital tools in the years to come.""

It should be noted the letter from 365 farm and agribusiness groups comes less than a week after the Trump administration released its initial ""Make America Healthy Again"" report. As DTN reported, the report ""calls out the potential hazards of glyphosate-based Roundup while saying a balanced approach is needed between improving pesticide safety in general and the needs of farmers.""

The National Association of Counties (NACO) in February urged its members to oppose the Agricultural Labeling Uniformity Act and prevent it from being added to the next farm bill, stating the bill would undermine local authority. NACO noted hundreds of counties across the country set standards for pesticides that go beyond FIFRA, ""including restricting pesticide use around schools and parks, protecting drinking water supplies and implementing safety guidelines for workers.""

The Class VI well is engineered to inject CO₂ more than a mile underground into secure geologic formations, in full compliance with EPA regulations to ensure safety and long-term containment.
The project will enable Conestoga to capture and store 100% of the CO₂ emissions generated from its bioethanol production process.
Conestoga previously purchased the associated CCS equipment and CO₂ flood field, as well as all the leases and easements for the Class VI well, from a third party in 2024.
The company owns 100% of all carbon capture and related assets associated with the well.","Conestoga Energy, the leading provider of low carbon intensity biofuel, on May 28 announced the successful completion of drilling operations for its first Class VI well designed for carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS). The well, located near the company’s Bonanza BioEnergy ethanol plant in Garden City, Kansas, will serve as the cornerstone of Conestoga’s initiative to permanently store carbon dioxide emissions generated during the ethanol production process.

Conestoga intends to submit its full Class VI permit application to the U.S. EPA this summer, marking the next critical step in the company’s fully integrated CCUS/ethanol production strategy that will significantly reduce the carbon intensity (CI) score and increase margins of its bioethanol.

The Class VI well is engineered to inject CO₂ more than a mile underground into secure geologic formations, in full compliance with EPA regulations to ensure safety and long-term containment. The project will enable Conestoga to capture and store 100% of the CO₂ emissions generated from its bioethanol production process. Once operational, the facility will sequester over 150,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually. Additionally, the project presents opportunities to store CO₂ from third-party sources, allowing Conestoga to earn additional carbon credits.

Located 14 miles from Conestoga’s enhanced oil recovery (EOR) site, the Class II well enables 100% of the captured CO₂ to be utilized for EOR. This proven technique involves injecting CO₂ into mature oil fields to restore depleted reservoir pressure and increase production efficiency while simultaneously storing carbon underground — offering both economic returns and emissions reductions in line with Conestoga’s financial and carbon management goals.

Conestoga previously purchased the associated CCS equipment and CO₂ flood field, as well as all the leases and easements for the Class VI well, from a third party in 2024. The company owns 100% of all carbon capture and related assets associated with the well.

The successful drilling operation further enhances Conestoga’s standing as an early leader in developing CCUS projects, building on the company’s proven track record of capturing CO₂ for over a decade. Conestoga was the first in the industry to sequester CO₂ for EOR.

“This milestone further advances our mission of being the leading provider of low carbon intensity biofuel and reflects our deep commitment to innovation and sustainability in bioethanol production,” said Tom Willis, CEO of Conestoga Energy. “Carbon capture and sequestration is a proven solution that allows us to dramatically cut emissions while also expanding our presence in the growing, low carbon fuel markets, both domestically and internationally, unlocking additional financial value.”

With drilling complete, the company is now focused on comprehensive data analysis and preparing the application materials for EPA’s rigorous review process. The permitting submission will include detailed geologic, seismic, and environmental data to demonstrate the site’s suitability for permanent carbon storage.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Conestoga_Logo_028a4d37cd.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 20:56:16.920720

In addition, the Group purchased approximately 2,000 metric tons of CORSIA-eligible SAF in the form of emissions reductions from World Energy, a United States-based producer, utilizing the Book & Claim Chain of Custody model. This allows the Group to claim associated emissions reductions without physical fuel delivery.

Both deals were completed in the first quarter of 2025 and these transactions are projected to reduce more than 9,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

SIA also participates in the Green Fuel Forward campaign, an initiative designed to boost the demand for SAF in the Asia-Pacific region. Launched by the World Economic Forum and Singapore’s GenZero, the campaign seeks to enhance awareness and understanding of SAF, while actively promoting its use and fostering strategic partnerships between regional corporations and airlines.

Lee Wen Fen, chief sustainability officer, Singapore Airlines, said: “These agreements represent important steps in the SIA Group’s broader strategy to scale up its use of sustainable aviation fuel. By working with different suppliers and exploring diverse sourcing models and certification pathways, we gain crucial insights into the SAF landscape and we can better understand the pathways towards a more sustainable aviation ecosystem.

“The SIA Group will continue to work with partners around the world to test and implement solutions that support the airline industry’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO): A US-based innovator turning agricultural waste into renewable jet fuel.","In the skies above Britain and across the Asia-Pacific, a green revolution is accelerating—not in the fields, but in the jet streams. Two major international moves this month signal that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is no longer a niche technology but a critical pillar of the future of flight. And as Earth-bound aircraft start to go green, a tantalizing question arises: can space travel do the same?

The United Kingdom has taken a decisive step in accelerating SAF adoption by raising its co-processing blend limit from 5% to 30%. Endorsed by the UK Ministry of Defence and enshrined in Defence Standard 91-091, this regulatory leap allows waste oils and renewable feedstocks to be refined alongside fossil fuels—without requiring massive infrastructure overhauls.

Industry players like BP and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) have applauded the move, highlighting that SAF produced under these standards meets rigorous global aviation fuel benchmarks such as ASTM D1655. This isn’t a backdoor greenwashing scheme. It’s vetted, safe, and compatible with existing jet engines.

The UK’s action sends a powerful signal to the global market: SAF isn’t tomorrow’s promise—it’s today’s policy.

Meanwhile, Singapore’s GenZero, in partnership with the World Economic Forum, has launched the Green Fuel Forward Initiative, aiming to scale SAF across the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative unites airlines, aerospace manufacturers, and financiers to create a self-sustaining SAF market—one that can meet the demand of one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation hubs.

Where the UK is setting standards, GenZero is building ecosystems. Together, these initiatives create a transcontinental roadmap for clean flight.

Despite the momentum, experts caution against declaring SAF a silver bullet. While SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, this is contingent on the sustainability of feedstocks, regional production capabilities, and carbon accounting accuracy. Feedstock availability, economic viability, and infrastructure bottlenecks all remain significant hurdles.

In short: cleaner skies are coming—but we’re not off the hook yet.

Companies like Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin, and SpaceX are pushing commercial spaceflight into the mainstream. But their environmental footprint is enormous. One rocket launch can emit hundreds of tons of CO₂ and black carbon, which lingers in the stratosphere, disrupting climate systems more than emissions at lower altitudes.

Some progress is being made. Blue Origin uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen—fuels that, when combusted, emit only water vapor. But hydrogen’s production is often energy-intensive, and other space companies still rely on kerosene-based propellants.

Startups and research labs are quietly experimenting with green rocket fuels made from bioethanol, renewable methane, or even algae-based feedstocks. But these remain in early stages, with limited commercial uptake.

Could SAF tech inspire the next leap? Perhaps. SAF producers like Gevo, Neste, and Velocys are already investing in Fischer-Tropsch and gasification technologies that could be adapted for high-energy rocket fuel equivalents.

For investors with one eye on Earth and the other on the stars, SAF is emerging as one of the most promising clean tech sectors. Here are a few companies at the forefront:

Neste (Finland): The world’s largest SAF producer, partnering with airports and airlines globally.

Gevo (NASDAQ: GEVO): A US-based innovator turning agricultural waste into renewable jet fuel.

Velocys (UK): Converts municipal and forest waste into aviation-grade hydrocarbons.

XCF Global (NASDAQ: XCF): Set to become the only pure-play SAF producer on the US public market after acquiring New Rise Renewables.

SkyNRG (Netherlands): A pioneer in SAF deployment, collaborating with airports and corporate clients.

Shell and World Energy: Though fossil giants, both are investing heavily in SAF R&D and infrastructure.

Flying sustainably is no longer science fiction. But guilt-free air travel—let alone guilt-free space tourism—isn’t as simple as swapping fuels. It requires layered transformation: regulatory reform, feedstock innovation, public-private collaboration, and bold investment.",https://www.greenprophet.com/wp-content/uploads/Ocean-sky-Hybrid-Air-Vehicles-Ltd-and-Design-Q-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-29 03:57:06.791242

It’s had a change of name and is now going full steam ahead (or should that be electric!) to drive modal shift to train travel. Rail Delivery Group’s Green Travel Data (formerly known as the Green Travel Pledge) is delivering granular, transparent carbon emissions data to provide the industry with a credible benchmark for carbon calculations for rail versus road and air. The sustainability initiative has been in the making since 2023, when RDG began asking rail operators to provide detailed data on train occupancy, fuel type and journey distance (amongst other factors) to generate emission results for specific routes. In July 2024, Phase 2 expanded the dataset from 100 to over 40,000 direct business routes (more than 80,000 journeys in both directions) and emissions data for car travel was added, enabling direct comparison between rail and road. The initiative took another leap in April 2025 with a refreshed Green Travel Data identity and branding and a new online carbon calculator that can be embedded on external websites. The calculator also includes emission comparisons with air on routes with scheduled domestic flights. Organisations across the UK are now using these emissions insights to shape travel policies, achieve ESG goals and support Net Zero ambitions. Green Travel Data is helping corporates meet CSRD reporting standards and drive real change in their operations. There’s more to come, so watch this space.

Train Hugger

We love the catchy name of this new entry for 2025, which is as simple as its concept. Train Hugger is a specialist rail booking platform for corporates, travel management companies and individuals. Not only does it save its customers an average of 10% on their train fares, for every booking it also plants a tree in the UK via an exclusive partnership with the Royal Forestry Society. For every booking, Train Hugger will contribute around 25% of its revenue to restoring the British countryside. So far, it has planted close to 500,000 trees through over 50 separate projects and is being used by the likes of JD Sports, McLaren Construction, The England and Wales Cricket Board and advertising and communications giant WPP. Customers receive reports on the quantity, species and location of their trees and larger corporates and TMCs have the option to plant their own diverse forests, with employees invited to volunteer on specially-organised days out. Train Hugger’s platform can be integrated as an OBT into a TMC, or can be offered as a standalone to corporates with back-end integrations into existing technology stacks. Other useful features of the platform include the opportunity to use split ticketing, the ability for payment on account and credit card payments, multi-carrier European travel for the whole of Europe, multiple travel policies and custom fields, and e-tickets are sent directly to the traveller’s wallet. Customers will also get the support of dedicated account management. It seems they’ve thought of everything!

Greengage

It’s been another busy year for Greengage, the creator of ECOsmart accreditation, which helps hotels, venues and other travel businesses improve and showcase their sustainability credentials. It’s now in the process of rolling out SMARTscan, a time-saving AI tool for its clients, and also a carbon calculator, which enables businesses to measure environmental impact across all event elements – from travel and accommodation to catering, utilities and waste management. Greenage has also created 360 Consulting, a new division headed up by Consultancy Director, Sam Cande. To date, more than 500 properties in the UK hold the ECOsmart certification, which is fully aligned with Travalyst, GTSC, and UN SDGs frameworks. ECOsmart’s four-tier system drives continuous improvement with 37% of certified properties advancing to higher award levels within a year. The impact of the ECOsmart certification is demonstrated in a partnership with Village Hotels, where all 33 of the group’s properties achieved Gold Certification and reduced their carbon footprint by nearly 40% in just one year. Impressive results. It’s also been working closely with TMC partner Clarity Travel Management, which has integrated ECOsmart into its booking platforms ClarityGo and MeetingsPro, which leads us nicely to our next entry…

Clarity Business Travel

Investment in people, solutions, services and technology is helping Clarity Business Travel lead by example as a sustainable TMC. By introducing ECOsmart to its proprietary ClarityGo and MeetingsPro booking tools, users can now search and select accredited properties and make informed environmental decisions. But that’s just one of many initiatives. Clarity’s sales and account managers have undertaken ESG training sessions to equip them with the tools to discuss sustainability confidently with customers and partners, building internal knowledge and growing sustainability know-how across their community and also empowering people to be actively involved in the business’s sustainability goals. The TMC is committed to becoming a net zero business and in 2023 decided to fully re-baseline its carbon footprint with the aim of achieving verified science-based targets in 2025 alongside a revised Carbon Reduction Plan. Clarity’s events division, Brighter, also achieved an industry first ISO 20121 accreditation, demonstrating commitment to delivering sustainable events. A recent ESG Knowledge Exchange workshop for customers has led to the launch of a separate ESG Working Group, made up of customers and sustainability experts, driving further actions and it is also offering clients Sustainability Deep Dives with actionable insights to drive environmental responsibility alongside financial efficiency. Clarity is also set to launch a new consultancy arm in partnership with Greengage to provide customers with specialist advice and support on making eco-conscious business travel decisions.

Lemon Lane

Creating sustainable events is no easy task but boutique event management agency Lemon Lane is putting sustainability at the forefront of every decision. Despite being small and relatively new, it has a full-time in-house Sustainability Manager to ensure consistency and continuous improvement of ESG initiatives for its own business and those of its clients. It has created a bespoke Sustainable Event Plan which is used for every event to question, challenge and inform decision-making. Developed in collaboration with clients and suppliers, the plan is split into four areas – catering, operations, energy and travel/transport. It has also invested in TRACE, a solution that captures emissions and waste data from virtual/hybrid/live events, and provides clients with real-time impact reports. Looking ahead, it has commissioned a comprehensive sustainability review from Bulb Consultancy, to shape the agency’s ongoing sustainability strategy, and all of the Lemon Lane team have completed comprehensive training provided by Isla, a non-profit organisation focusing on a sustainable future for events. It doesn’t stop there. In 2025, Lemon Lane is expanding its focus to encompass the Social and Governance aspects of ESG, which will see the launch of a comprehensive client-facing ESG Playbook, embedding a strong DEIBA framework across operations and events, working on a clear practical pathway to reach Net Zero by 2050, designing every event using circular economy principles and and working with suppliers/partners to deliver an Ethical Procurement Framework.

Clarasight

Back in this list for the second consecutive year, New York-based Clarasight is showing its commitment to the UK/European market with the opening of an office in London and the expansion of its European team. Its latest addition is Sally Higgs, formerly with Festive Road, who has joined as Sustainability and Operations Program Manager. Globally, Clarasight now manages more than $2 billion in managed travel spend on its Carbon Planning and Cost Intelligence platform, which helps global organisations close the gap between climate-related intention and action with carbon planning and analysis software. Rather than just straight-line planning or one-size fits all policies, Clarasight empowers companies to give travel emissions the same attention as their financials. The platform brings together travel and expense related data sources, then automatically cleans and analyses that data to give clients a complete and accurate picture of carbon and costs in one place. It calculates emissions based on an organisation’s preferred methodology (DEFRA, IATA, Google TIM, etc), creates tailored dashboards allocating emissions and costs to each relevant member of the business, and delivers smart reduction opportunities. Crucially, it also provides forecasting and scenario modelling for any policy or initiative so companies can set, allocate and track carbon budgets, adjusting plans as business needs evolve. It also delivers real-time updates and actionable recommendations to drive better decision-making for each business leader or department.

PredictX

Data is key to driving more sustainable travel decisions and the tech wizards at data intelligence specialists PredictX are setting standards with their sustainability reporting solutions. Unlike other solutions, which primarily rely on TMC data, PredictX consumes data from both on- and off-channel bookings in real time from more than 200 T&E sources via pre-built connectors. Using machine learning, this data is validated, fused and enriched to give travel managers one consolidated source of clean, actionable data with unparalleled accuracy. PredictX’s Sustainability Module uses AI-powered measurement and industry-leading methodology to give corporates deep-dive insights into the real carbon impact of their entire travel programme, including performance versus goals and budgets, modal comparisons and offsets applicable. The platform can also generate forecasted emissions based on current activity to provide effective sustainable travel planning. Non-techy travel managers will be pleased to hear that the data is communicated in an understandable way, through dashboards, automated stories, AI assistants, infographics or alerts, from a global perspective all the way down to individual employees. PredictX invests 50% of its turnover each year in R&D to continuously enhance the platform. Most recently, it has launched an Internal Carbon Pricing tool to enable users to define the carbon price via an automated portal, where they can set the currency, amount and date range and map it out to travel activities, including air, hotel, and ground transportation.

easyJet

Well done to easyJet, the first airline to make it into our Sustainability Movers & Shakers since the list was launched in 2022. Its success is down to its new corporate SAF programme, developed in partnership with its corporate customers – mainly Airbus – and which is designed to stimulate demand and drive increased production of SAF in Europe while driving down the green premium. Describing it as “admin-light” the initiative sees easyJet pool demand twice a year from corporates, regardless of size, to bring down the purchasing price of SAF within Europe. So, the scheme enables SMEs as well as larger corporations to purchase SAF at a more attractive price point and register the ISCC-aligned certificates as part of their Scope 3 reporting. All SAF purchased as part of this scheme is in addition to any mandated requirements and the jet fuel and ETS (tax) are paid by easyJet, meaning companies can simultaneously help to stimulate the growth of the SAF industry while addressing their corporate air travel. As the model is based on mass balance rather than book and claim, the non-tradeable SAF certificates are aligned with SBTi guidance, including the ability to show beyond reasonable doubt that the fuel has been consumed, and are based on physical delivery to a European airport. Customers also have the option to purchase SAF for all of their bookings across their travel programme, not just for their easyJet flights. It’s still early days and easyJet says the scheme will continue to adjust if needed, based on customer feedback.

Thrust Carbon

Thrust Carbon has established itself as a frontrunner in emissions calculations and its solutions have been integrated by big names in the industry. But, it’s not resting on its laurels and has earned itself a place back in our list for 2025 thanks to some key developments in the first few months of this year. It has launched Compliance Suite, a suite of tools that turns overwhelming climate regulation into clear, actionable steps and is designed to save sustainability teams weeks of prep. It means they’re not just focusing on reporting but on actually reducing. Meanwhile, a new Spotlight feature gives travel managers the ability to cut emissions by up to 30% by providing supplier sustainability data, and with TripsAI, Thrust Carbon is pioneering the use of AI in sustainability, helping send instantaneous, personalised nudges directly to travellers’ inboxes to drive sustainable decision making. In 2024, it became the first company in business travel to certify its emissions calculations to ISO 14083, the globally recognised standard for travel emissions reporting. SAP Concur Travel alone has already delivered over 500 million ISO 14083-compliant calculations powered by Thrust Carbon.

Global Business Travel Association (GBTA)

Moving from words to action is the mantra of the GBTA’s new Acceleration Challenge. Launched last September 2024, it challenges organisations of all sizes and in all geographies to “start, advance and accelerate” the integration of practices that materially reduce their business travel emissions. The association has developed a pathway with Accenture and will track year-on-year progress by the industry, providing concrete strategies to reduce emissions across four categories: travel decisions, emissions tracking, sustainable procurement and investments in decarbonisation solutions like clean fuels and renewable energy. So far, more than 240 companies have participated in the Acceleration Challenge, representing a $14 billion in travel spent.​ The GBTA has also launched Sustainable Procurement Standards to help send a stronger, more harmonised signal for sustainable suppliers. The industry-wide, open-source standards offer a simple, concrete, universal way to evaluate the environmental and social performance of travel suppliers and enable corporate travel buyers to make procurement decisions and deliver on their sustainability objectives. The Sustainable Procurement Standards have been endorsed by key players across the value chain and already downloaded by more than 1,000 professionals. The association is also incubating a platform to scale demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel​.",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-2160439251-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 22:56:12.149239

The impact of Trump's energy policy on U.S. hydropower activity will take longer to unfold.
Hydropower accounts for 27 percent of renewable energy generation in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy.
Such facilities account for the overwhelming majority of renewable energy storage capacity in the U.S. at 96 percent.","The Donald Trump administration has taken extraordinary measures to reverse the transition to renewable energy in the United States, but the decarbonization stage is already set. Wind and especially solar already far outpace natural gas for new power generation additions to the nation’s grid, and that trend is expected to continue as signs indicate the demand for renewable energy has nowhere to go but up. Here are three of them.

1. More information about greenhouse gas emissions is available at the click of a button

Federal energy policy aside, many U.S. states continue to pursue vigorous clean power portfolios. Global firms operating in the U.S. also require information about the sources of electricity flowing through the grid in order to fulfill their clean power commitments.

Responding to these demand-side forces, in 2022 the leading U.S. grid operator MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator) launched an online greenhouse emissions dashboard, enabling users to track the carbon intensity of the MISO grid across 15 midwestern and southern states. Last year the organization improved its projections to achieve emissions reporting almost in real time.

MISO is one of several regional operators established in the 1990s to support national grid reliability and resilience. Its territory includes Iowa and other states with a considerable stake in wind energy. Part or all of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin also come under the MISO umbrella, along with a small foothold in Texas.

Even after President Trump took office in January, MISO continued to improve its emissions reporting, launching a new ""Consumed"" feature to the dashboard in March that provides a high level of detail on carbon emission at the user end.

“Increasingly stringent regulations, member goals and customer needs are driving requests for MISO to leverage its operational data to provide credible emissions data estimates,” the organization noted in a recent report on its emissions tracking activities. “Drivers for this interest include meeting and reporting emission reduction goals, creating new tariffs to support end use customer demands, increased visibility for operational decisions making, and information to aid investment decisions.""

2. They said it couldn’t be done, but it can

Another indication of the permanency of the U.S. energy transition comes from the green hydrogen industry. Green hydrogen can be produced from water in electrolysis systems that run on renewable electricity, but it is much more expensive than conventional hydrogen extracted from natural gas. Globally, the industry has struggled to find buyers. But industry analysts have identified Texas as one market where green hydrogen can compete against natural gas, partly due to co-location opportunities for combining green hydrogen with waste carbon to produce synthetic liquid fuels called e-fuels or electrofuels. The co-location strategy reduces the considerable cost of transporting hydrogen over long distances.

Energy producers are starting to catch up to this analyst consensus. This month, for example, the leading e-fuels producer Infinium started construction on the new Project Roadrunner e-fuels facility near Pecos in West Texas. Electricity to run the facility will come from a new 150-megawatt wind farm.

“The site is expected to become the world’s largest e-fuels production facility when operational, producing 23,000 tons per year (7.6 million gallons) of sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other e-fuel products,” Infinium wrote in a press announcement. The company has already enlisted buyers in the aviation industry that are motivated to reduce their dependence on conventional jet fuel, including American Airlines and IAG, the parent of British Airways and Aer Lingus.

The co-location strategy is already at work outside of Texas, too. In Iowa, for example, a solar-powered electrolyzer will supply green hydrogen to produce ammonia fertilizer locally, eliminating long-distance transportation costs. Additionally, the New York startup Ecolectro has introduced a containerized, transportable electrolyzer designed for on-site use in multiple hydrogen-dependent industries including fertilizer and steelmaking as well as e-fuels

3. The call is coming from inside the house

For all of President Trump’s enthusiastic embrace of fossil fuels, his “American Energy Dominance” plan includes three major renewable resources — biomass, geothermal and hydropower — under its protective umbrella. All three represent significant opportunities to reduce the nation’s reliance on fossil energy.

In the case of biomass, the effect of that policy protection has been almost immediate. While the Trump administration delayed or abandoned other federally supported renewable energy projects, in February the biofuels firm Montana Renewables received approval to draw $782 million from a $1.44 billion loan guarantee issued by the Department of Energy during the Joe Biden administration.

The funds will enable the firm to expand its existing facility in Great Falls, Montana, that uses biomass to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The drawdown was announced by its parent company, Calumet, which said the expanded facility will be one of the biggest in the world with a capacity of 300 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.

The impact of Trump's energy policy on U.S. hydropower activity will take longer to unfold. New hydropower dams are long-term, capital-intensive infrastructure projects. But federal funding for upgrades and energy-efficiency improvements will enable the hydropower industry to maintain its aging facilities and continue its status as a major contributor to the nation’s renewable energy profile. Hydropower accounts for 27 percent of renewable energy generation in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy. Hydropower can also be used for energy storage in systems that pump water into an elevated reservoir at times of excess power and release it into turbines when power demand is high. Such facilities account for the overwhelming majority of renewable energy storage capacity in the U.S. at 96 percent.

An even more significant impact will be felt in the geothermal industry, as new drilling technology expands the range of geothermal power plants into new regions of the U.S. Unlike wind and solar energy, geothermal is available at a constant, steady rate on a 24/7 basis, providing gas power plants with a new source of competition.",https://back.3blcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/ratio_3_2/public/triplepundit/wide/hydropower%20dam%20in%20North%20Carolina%20%E2%80%94%20renewable%20energy%20in%20the%20US.jpeg?h=ea6a6e00,N,,2025-05-28 15:56:15.090017

by Bhok Thompson (Green Prophet) The United Kingdom has taken a significant step in advancing sustainable aviation by approving an increase in the co-processing blend limit for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from 5% to 30%. This decision, endorsed by the UK Ministry of Defence and incorporated into Defence Standard 91-091, aims to accelerate the production and adoption of SAF within the aviation sector.

Safety is paramount in aviation fuel standards. The updated Defence Standard 91-091 ensures that SAF produced through co-processing meets stringent aviation fuel specifications. This standard aligns with global benchmarks, such as ASTM D1655, guaranteeing that the fuel is compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. Industry stakeholders, including BP and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), have collaborated to achieve this milestone, emphasizing the fuel’s safety and performance.

Britain’s Leadership in Sustainable Aviation

...

This move allows for the integration of renewable feedstocks, such as waste oils and fats, into existing refinery processes, facilitating a faster and more cost-effective path to SAF production. The approach reduces the need for constructing new facilities, thereby accelerating the availability of cleaner aviation fuels.

...

The production and use of SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and production methods.

...

Therefore, while SAF contributes to more sustainable air travel, achieving guilt-free flying will require a combination of technological advancements, policy support, and broader systemic changes in the aviation industry.

SAFc Connect will increase liquidity and transparency in the SAF market while helping companies meet their aviation decarbonization goals

WASHINGTON, May 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) announced the go-live of SAFc Connect, a secure online platform to help connect corporate buyers with sustainable aviation fuel certificate (SAFc) providers and accelerate near-term progress in decarbonizing aviation. SAFc Connect gives participants a more flexible pathway to invest in high-integrity, commercially available SAF, and is designed to support a faster offer-to-sale cycle that lets SAFc providers tap into near term corporate demand. SABA surveys indicate that SABA member companies accessing SAFc Connect have an immediate demand for approximately $30 million worth of SAF certificates. The annual demand volume is expected to grow significantly year-on-year as SABA membership expands and companies ramp up investment to meet 2030 climate targets. Approximately six SAFc providers — including Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group (parent company of leading airlines including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL, and Vueling), JetBlue, Targray, and Valero — have committed to participating in SAFc Connect, with up to double that number expected to come on board in the coming months.

Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of SABA Secretariat, said, ""To meet the decarbonization goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near and long-term investment into SAF. With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.""

Since launching in 2021, SABA has worked with corporate buyers to aggregate demand for over $400 million in SAF certificates: first through a proof-of-concept pilot procurement and followed by 2023–2024's groundbreaking multi-year procurement that supported tens of millions of gallons of SAF. Earlier this month, SABA launched a third RFP for next-generation fuels designed to facilitate 5 to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final investment decision (FID) for a new production facility. SAFc Connect represents a next evolution of SABA's commitment to aggregate demand and connect SAF suppliers with buyers seeking to invest in decarbonized aviation.

With today’s go-live, both buyers and providers stand to benefit. Upon logging in, SAFc buyers can view posted offers all in one place, with each offer vetted by SABA and accompanied by key details such as carbon intensity performance, sustainability certification standard, pricing, feedstock, fuel type, and term length. User-level permissions ensure that only authorized SAFc buyers can view sustainability and commercial information associated with the offers, which are subject to strict confidentiality requirements. After reviewing available offers, buyers can then contact providers to complete offtake discussions.

Participating SAFc providers gain access to a committed community of buyers who want to make near-term purchases to meet their ambitious climate targets. The platform will be updated on a recurring basis with additional platform participation and offer volumes. The enhanced flexibility and responsiveness built into the system is expected to encourage new SAF production and capture long term pricing benefits associated with economies of scale.

SAFc Connect will leverage SABA’s existing book and claim model that separates SAF's environmental benefits from the physical fuel and captures them as a SAFc. Purchasing SAF certificates allows corporate travelers to invest in SAF and capture the environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on. The travelers' investment allows them to make a greenhouse gas emissions reduction claim on their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF flows to an aircraft operator. SAFc Connect will only host offers for SAF that meets SABA's world-leading sustainability criteria.

Buyer participation in SAFc Connect is offered exclusively to SABA members. For organizations interested in learning more about SABA membership, email info@flysaba.org. For SAF providers looking to post volumes to SAFc Connect, email SAFcConnect@gmacenter.org to learn more.

In the supply chain sector, where logistics and emissions intersect daily, the shift to lower-carbon aviation fuel holds significant implications for global freight networks.

Two major players enabling that shift are Neste and FedEx. Neste is the world’s largest producer of SAF and renewable diesel, while FedEx stands as the largest express cargo airline globally.

The pair have recently committed to a sizable SAF agreement at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), marking the largest SAF purchase to date by a US cargo airline at that location.

SAF deployment in the FedEx air logistics network

The agreement between FedEx and Neste will see the delivery of 8,800 tonnes of blended SAF to LAX.

The fuel blend includes at least 30% neat Neste ‘MY SAF’ – a form of sustainable aviation fuel that must be blended with conventional jet fuel for use.

As a “drop-in” fuel, neat SAF is compatible with existing aircraft engines and refuelling systems, which means no technical modifications are required.

FedEx estimates that this SAF blend will make up around 20% of its annual jet fuel consumption at LAX for the 2025 financial year. This volume represents a substantial shift in the company’s fuel sourcing and aligns with its broader emissions-reduction goals.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and Chief Executive Officer, Airline, FedEx.

“While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

According to Neste, MY SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% when used in neat form.

The fuel is produced entirely from renewable waste and residue materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, ensuring it does not compete with food supply chains.

Supply chain implications of SAF investment

FedEx’s involvement in SAF is not new. The company has taken part in multiple collaborations to explore sustainable aviation technologies.

One notable project includes the ecoDemonstrator programme with Boeing, which tested the world’s first commercial flight powered entirely by SAF in both engines in 2018.

Beyond fuel procurement, FedEx also pursues operational strategies to reduce emissions, including fleet modernisation, fuel conservation measures and optimised flight planning.

These efforts together enabled the company to meet a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity in fiscal year 2024, using a 2005 baseline. The company set its first targets in this area back in 2008.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” comments Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel used globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions. As we work toward our goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Neste’s growing global SAF capacity

Neste has ramped up SAF production significantly already in 2025. Its renewable products refinery in Rotterdam has undergone major upgrades and now produces up to 500,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Combined with existing production in Singapore and Porvoo, Finland, Neste’s global output has reached 1.5 million tonnes per year, equal to roughly 1.875 billion litres.

The company plans to expand capacity further. By 2027, the Rotterdam facility alone is expected to produce 2.7 million tonnes of renewable products yearly, with overall renewable fuel capacity rising to 6.8 million tonnes.

SAF will make up 2.2 million tonnes of this volume.

This expansion supports European policy efforts such as the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which aims to accelerate adoption of low-carbon fuels across the aviation industry.

With air cargo being among the most emissions-intensive forms of transport, SAF adoption by freight giants like FedEx represents a step toward reducing the sector's environmental footprint.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/efee9015a32d2d6048c016313078ca6b:508122d8e7d4cdb0e7694546b6aae030/neste-saf.png.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 12:57:19.466913

WASHINGTON, May 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) announced the go-live of SAFc Connect, a secure online platform to help connect corporate buyers with sustainable aviation fuel certificate (SAFc) providers and accelerate near-term progress in decarbonizing aviation. SAFc Connect gives participants a more flexible pathway to invest in high-integrity, commercially available SAF, and is designed to support a faster offer-to-sale cycle that lets SAFc providers tap into near term corporate demand. SABA surveys indicate that SABA member companies accessing SAFc Connect have an immediate demand for approximately $30 million worth of SAF certificates. The annual demand volume is expected to grow significantly year-on-year as SABA membership expands and companies ramp up investment to meet 2030 climate targets. Approximately six SAFc providers — including Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group (parent company of leading airlines including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, LEVEL, and Vueling), JetBlue, Targray, and Valero — have committed to participating in SAFc Connect with up to double that number expected to come on board in the coming months.

""To meet the decarbonization goals for the aviation sector, we need to encourage both near and long-term investment into SAF,"" said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and Head of SABA Secretariat. ""With SAFc Connect, participants have a continuous SAF procurement opportunity that progresses climate goals now, while strengthening the foundations of the SAF market for future growth.""

Since launching in 2021, SABA has worked with corporate buyers to aggregate demand for over $400 million in SAF certificates: first through a proof-of-concept pilot procurement and followed by 2023-2024's groundbreaking multi-year procurement that supported tens of millions of gallons of SAF. Earlier this month, SABA launched a third RFP for next-generation fuels designed to facilitate 5 to 10-year forward purchasing commitments on behalf of its members at sufficient volumes to support final investment decision (FID) for a new production facility. SAFc Connect represents a next evolution of SABA's commitment to aggregate demand and connect SAF suppliers with buyers seeking to invest in decarbonized aviation.

With today's go-live, both buyers and providers stand to benefit. Upon logging in, SAFc buyers can view posted offers all in one place, with each offer vetted by SABA and accompanied by key details such as carbon intensity performance, sustainability certification standard, pricing, feedstock, fuel type, and term length. User-level permissions ensure that only authorized SAFc buyers can view sustainability and commercial information associated with the offers, which are subject to strict confidentiality requirements. After reviewing available offers, buyers can then contact providers to complete offtake discussions.

Participating SAFc providers gain access to a committed community of buyers who want to make near-term purchases to meet their ambitious climate targets. The platform will be updated on a recurring basis with additional platform participation and offer volumes. The enhanced flexibility and responsiveness built into the system is expected to encourage new SAF production and capture long term pricing benefits associated with economies of scale.

SAFc Connect will leverage SABA's existing book and claim model that separates SAF's environmental benefits from the physical fuel and captures them as a SAFc. Purchasing SAF certificates allows corporate travelers to invest in SAF and capture the environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on. The travelers' investment allows them to make a greenhouse gas emissions reduction claim on their climate disclosures, while the physical SAF flows to an aircraft operator. SAFc Connect will only host offers for SAF that meets SABA's world-leading sustainability criteria.

Buyer participation in SAFc Connect is offered exclusively to SABA members. For organizations interested in learning more about SABA membership, email info@flysaba.org. For SAF providers looking to post volumes to SAFc Connect, email SAFcConnect@gmacenter.org to learn more.

“Our investments are going to help these two entities complete their R&D with a view to being able to produce sustainable aviation fuel in Canada,” Al Meinzinger, president of Boeing Canada, told Skies.
Additionally, the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels has set an objective to produce one billion litres of domestic SAF annually by 2030.
Boeing’s investments support those targets, said Meinzinger.
“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high value-jobs and economic growth,” she said.","Boeing is investing in Canadian technology to convert sawmill residuals and industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuels.

The aircraft manufacturer announced the $17.48 million investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production on the opening day of CANSEC, Canada’s largest defence and security trade show, in Ottawa.

The funding will support two projects, in Quebec and British Columbia, part of Boeing’s industrial and technological benefits (ITB) commitment for the selection of its P-8A Poseidon as the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force CP-140 Aurora maritime patrol plane.

Since winning the CMMA contract in November 2023, Boeing has announced investments of more than $300 million in Canadian companies and institutes, targeting skills training, especially aircraft maintenance engineers, and research and development around emerging technology, including data analytics and urban air mobility.

But the largest investments have been in sector sustainability, including over $100 million for the Aerospace Development Centre in the Québec Espace Aéro Innovation Zone.

The two SAF-related projects announced at CANSEC involve $10 million for Project Avance, a joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Que., to convert wood residuals from existing sawmills into a low-carbon intermediate “biocrude” that can be changed into SAF, and $7.48 million for Dimensional Energy of Richmond, B.C., to scope the development of its carbon utilization project to convert industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel.

“Our investments are going to help these two entities complete their R&D with a view to being able to produce sustainable aviation fuel in Canada,” Al Meinzinger, president of Boeing Canada, told Skies.

The Canadian government has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and Transport Canada is seeking to ensure sufficient availability of SAF to meet a 10 percent use target by 2030. Additionally, the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels has set an objective to produce one billion litres of domestic SAF annually by 2030.

Boeing’s investments support those targets, said Meinzinger. “These two efforts have the potential, according to their long-term visions, of producing in the order of 50 million gallons of SAF in the out years. That is a significant output and we’re excited about being partnered with these two entities to ideally help them get to that commercialization phase to meet those production numbers.”

The Project Avance effort forecasts eventually being able to produce 10 million gallons (approximately 37,854,000 litres) of unblended SAF annually in Quebec, while the Dimensional Energy study aims to support the eventual conversion of 500,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions into over 40 million gallons (approximately 151,416,000 litres) of SAF annually.

“Our proprietary Alder Renewable Crude product has enormous potential to fast-track the production of SAF in Canada,” Darren Fuller, chief commercial officer, said in a statement. “The support of Boeing and local government leaders in Quebec is supercharging our commitment to securing a low carbon future for the aviation sector. Close collaboration with our industry partners — Boeing and Bioenergie AECN — coupled with government support is essential to get to the next phase. We’re ready to play our part.”

“Making high performance hydrocarbons is an innovative use for carbon dioxide that turns unwanted waste into valuable fuels and products,” added Jason Salfi, CEO of Dimensional Energy. “This investment from Boeing provides essential predevelopment capital to catalyze projects and scale our proven power-to-liquid technology to market now.”

Chris Lohmann, who leads Boeing’s sustainable aviation fuels market development, said the company has spent that past two years meeting with Canadian companies to identify technology that fits with its investment plan. The two projects were selected in part for the technology readiness levels.

“There is certainly a sweet spot for this pilot phase, where it is millions of dollars but not tens of millions of dollars they need to move forward,” he explained. “The critical things we identified with these two projects were, how do we unlock some of the vast energy resources that Canada has and equip Canada with the ability to turn these new resources into something that Canada can depend upon for fuel and energy, and can ultimately export.”

Project Advance addresses a problem the forestry sector has been trying to solve with the decreased demand for pulp and paper, and could be replicated with sawmills from B.C. to the Maritimes. Boeing’s funding could help “overcome the integration [challenge] of the biocrude into the downstream established refineries,” said Lohmann, noting what while the oil and gas sector has solved how to refine various types of crude, SAF production will still require some creative engineering and trial and error to “turn the intermediate product into a finished product.”

Dimensional Energy’s technology to capture carbon dioxide from the flu gas of a cement plant “is a highly replicable application across Canada where industrial facilities can reduce their impact on the climate, [and] monetized what is otherwise a waste product,” he said.

“Hopefully, we can get them very close to the point where they can go to a large infrastructure investor and get final decision for their full-scale plans.”

Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, commended the partnerships.

“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high value-jobs and economic growth,” she said. “The Government of Canada is committed to reducing aviation emissions and reinforcing Canada’s position as a global leader in aerospace innovation.”

He said the latest investments were about trying to fine tune the engineering of sustainable aviation fuel and get its production up to scale.","Boeing Canada says it’s investing millions of dollars into business ventures in B.C. and Quebec with the eventual goal of producing close to 200 million litres of sustainable jet fuel every year.

The announcement, made Wednesday, includes nearly $17.5 million split between two projects looking to turn wood waste and carbon captured from industrial smokestacks into sustainable aviation fuel.

The fuel, known in industry as SAF, has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent over its lifecycle and “offers the fastest route to decarbonization in the aviation sector,” according to Boeing.

Boeing's latest investment will direct $10 million to Project Avance, a joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Que. The project aims to convert wood residue from sawmills into low-carbon bio-crude that can later be converted into almost 38 million litres of unblended jet fuel every year.

In B.C., Dimensional Energy will receive $7.5 million to scale up its industrial CO2 capture operations and eventually quadruple the Quebec project's output of synthetic aviation fuel.

“We’ve always envisioned doing the scale-up in British Columbia,” said Dimensional's CEO Jason Salfi. “With the uncertainty in the U.S. right now, it seems like a great time to double down on our work there.”

Replacing an 'enormous' volume of jet fuel

Between 2000 and 2019, the aviation industry’s emissions grew faster than rail, road or shipping, only dipping at the end of that period when the COVID-19 pandemic caused air traffic to plummet. But by 2023, the industry had recovered to more than 90 per cent of pre-pandemic flights.

At a global level that year, commercial flights produced 950 megatonnes of carbon pollution — or 2.5 per cent of that year’s global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Aviation emissions are expected to surpass their 2019 levels in 2025, once again growing year over year, according to the IEA.

Meanwhile, Canada’s aviation industry consumed about eight billion litres of turbo jet fuel in 2023, according to Statistics Canada. That ranks the country 11th globally, one index says.

Boeing Canada president Al Meinzinger said that while country’s jet fuel needs are “significant,” they require more than new technology.

That’s why a decade from now Meinzinger said he expects the aviation industry to make much of its emission reductions through increased operational efficiencies — perhaps by taxiing aircraft less, improving flight plans or by replacing old aircraft with newer less fuel-hungry engines and air frames.

“Obviously, it matters how much we're consuming,” he said.

Chris Lohmann, Boeing’s sustainability lead for Canada, acknowledged the total volumes that go into aviation are still enormous. He said the latest investments were about trying to fine tune the engineering of sustainable aviation fuel and get its production up to scale.

Lohmann said Canada's large forestry industry and industrial emissions base offers the country a chance to play a big role in the manufacturing of sustainable jet fuel.

“Canada has every right to step in and be an energy superpower here,” said Lohmann. “We're really excited to see that.”

Long-term bet on B.C.

Dimensional Energy was founded in New York State in 2016 when a group of Cornell University professors collaborated to find a way to create sustainable fuels. After a successful pilot project at a power plant in Gillette, Wyo., in 2020, the company set up its research and development operations in Arizona, where today it pumps carbon dioxide into an experimental reactor.

Instead of releasing CO2 into the air, Dimensional’s technology turns captured industrial carbon pollution into recycled barrels of oil. The idea is to create a net-zero fuel that doesn’t make climate change worse.

Today, the company operates its only industrial pilot facility at the Lafarge Canada cement plant in Richmond, where it partners with the Burnaby-based carbon capture technology company Svante Inc.

“Everything we tested in Arizona, we moved up to British Columbia,” said Salfi.

Synthetic oil from that reactor has been used to make everything from non-combustible industrial lubricants to waxes for surfboards and the cosmetic industry. But as a pilot project, its capacity remains extremely limited, producing only one to two barrels of oil a day.

Boeing’s pre-capital investment seeks to change that, allowing Dimensional to accelerate a preliminary engineering study designed to cost out every aspect of building a much bigger facility by mid-2026 — from the nuts and bolts all the way up to labour requirements, off-take agreements and the reactors themselves.

Such a facility could capture 3,000 barrels of oil per day, enough to create 151 million litres of recycled carbon jet fuel a year, according to the company. It would also likely cost several hundred million dollars to build, though Salfi says at least three big investors are already waiting for the results of the study.

“These are folks that would write $100-million cheques,” he said.

If the money comes through, the CEO said Dimensional’s next step would be to find a suitable 20 to 25-acre site — preferably next to a heavy emitter, or if that's not possible, a site that could receive captured and cryogenically liquefied CO2 shipped by rail or barge.

“We look to be that output for the pulp and paper and the cement industry,” said Salfi. “They need a place to put all that carbon. We want to be that hub.”

Salfi, whose company is incorporated in Canada, said Dimensional has every intention to stay in B.C. because of its friendly regulatory framework for clean technology companies. At the same time, he said, B.C. doesn’t have a lot of places to store captured CO2 in the ground, unlike Alberta. That, he said, presents an opportunity.

“It could just snowball,” said the CEO.

​Investments linked to military contract

Boeing's B.C. and Quebec investments are in response to the Canadian government’s November 2023 decision to acquire up to 16 Boeing P-8A Poseidon aircraft.

Set to be Canada’s newest generation multi-mission aircraft, the Poseidon is capable of advanced anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare; conducting intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions; and providing search and rescue and disaster relief, according to Boeing.

Boeing Canada says it has now invested more than $280 million in Canadian clean technology projects through the Poseidon aircraft program and more than $2 billion in contracts related to its acquisition.

Boeing cited an independent study from Ottawa-based Doyletech Corporation that found the acquisition of the Poseidon aircraft will generate almost $358 million in annual economic benefits to Canada.

Last year, as part of Canada's procurement requirement around the P-8A, Boeing put $48 million into developing complex modelling and machine learning techniques to increase aircraft performance at the aviation company's Vancouver headquarters.

Another $13 million was invested in the Indigenous-owned, Parksville-based company COTA Aviation to build up a hands-on aerospace manufacturing training facility.

While linked to a military contract, the latest investments to build up sustainable fuel capacities are meant to provide fuel to both the Royal Canadian Air Force and the country's commercial aviation sector.

The aircraft are slated to be based out of the Royal Canadian Airforce's 14 Wing in Greenwood, N.S., and 19 Wing in Comox, B.C.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/glaciermedia/images/climate-enviro-solutions/carbon-capture/dimensional-energy-aviation-fuel.jpg;w=960;h=639;mode=crop,N,,2025-05-28 11:56:53.828027

Under a memorandum of understanding (MoU), the partners aim to achieve this by linking India’s net-zero clusters to Europe and supporting the development of key port infrastructure for distribution of hydrogen-based fuels and products.

This could enable exports of up to one million tonnes per year as part of AM Green’s ambitious goal to develop five million tonnes of green ammonia production capacity by 2030. This is equivalent to about one million tonnes of green hydrogen, and part of a push to meet the rising global demand for green fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAF could potentially decarbonise up to 65% of the aviation industry’s net-zero targets by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), though the road to get there is long.

IATA states that SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80% compared with traditional jet fuel.

“With India’s vast potential for green hydrogen production, combined with Rotterdam’s strategic location and advanced infrastructure, the collaboration will lead to a … sustainable green energy supply chain between the two regions,” said Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam Authority.

The port was chosen due to its role as a logistics and hydrogen hub for the European continent, with some 13% of the total energy demand in Europe entering via Rotterdam.

The site is already home to several developments to scale-up hydrogen and ammonia import infrastructure. The port aims to facilitate 20 million tonnes of hydrogen equivalent throughput per year by 2050, with the majority being imports.

The news follows a recently announced partnership signed by renewable energy firms from India and Germany that aims to jointly develop and market green ammonia produced in Andhra Pradesh in southern India.

Under an MoU formalised during the recent World Hydrogen Summit 2025 in Rotterdam, that project is designed to produce up to one million tonnes a year of green ammonia.

The $1.3bn project will convert seawater into the high-purity water needed for electrolysis, which will be fully powered by renewable energies.

The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.
“We don’t have to guess about that.” In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives.
Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.
“They met their most recent target three years early.” In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic lawmakers rallied alongside clean fuel advocates on Tuesday at the State Capitol to push legislation that could slash greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 20% within eight years. The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, S1343A/A472A would create an incentive system that rewards using cleaner fuels while generating billions for electric vehicle infrastructure.

The proposal would require all fuel companies—including providers, refiners, blenders, and electricity suppliers—to lower the amount of greenhouse gas pollution produced per unit of fuel energy their products consume or emit. That dirtiness is called carbon intensity, which they’d lower through a credit trading system, just like in California, Oregon, and Washington. Under the legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Kevin Parker and Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, providers who hit emissions targets would be able to earn credits they could then sell off to companies that miss the mark.

Transportation produces more than 34% of New York’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the state’s largest pollution source, according to State Senator Pete Harckham, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. The bill outlines the initial target as a 20% reduction by 2033.

The full lifecycle emissions assessment, measuring all pollution from a fuel from start to finish, would include all stages from fuel production through consumer use—including growing crops for biofuels, and refining, transporting, and burning the fuel. Providers would have also have to meet transparency requirements and submit annual reports. Alternative fuel examples include electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel made from waste cooking oil or agricultural products, biofuels made from plant materials, and renewable natural gas from farm waste.

Beyond 2033, the Department of Environmental Conservation would set specific reduction targets every five years, with limits based on new technology and stricter climate requirements under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Companies providing electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel, or advanced biofuels would generate the most credits. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline and diesel suppliers would have to buy credits offsetting their environmental impact or be subject to penalties.

When utilities or government agencies earn money by selling credits, they must spend 40% of that amount on clean transportation projects in disadvantaged communities, including electric school buses, truck charging stations, and multi-family housing charging infrastructure. The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.

According to Julie Tighe, president of the New York League of Conservation Voters, that money would flow directly to transportation electrification projects without requiring new state spending. She said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, would receive approximately $20,000 per electric bus annually through credit sales.

“The clean fuel standard will improve air quality tomorrow, especially for our environmental justice communities, taking harmful pollutants out of the air,” Harckham said at the press conference. “It does this in a tax-neutral way.”

Dairy farmer David Fisher from the New York Farm Bureau said his operation already produces renewable natural gas equivalent to 2,500 gallons of diesel daily through anaerobic digestion of manure. That means that bacteria break down the manure to produce methane that’s used as fuel. Currently, about 12% of New York’s cows produce renewable natural gas that could replace diesel fuel, he said.

The legislation includes sustainable aviation fuel as a credit generator because European regulations require planes leaving their airports to use jet fuel made from renewable sources like waste oils or plant materials instead of petroleum, producing fewer emissions.

But flights departing New York airports still rely on traditional jet fuel. “They’re leaving Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia dirty. It doesn’t make any sense,” Woerner said. Here’s the Assemblymember on those tougher airline regulations:

Aviation fuels are exempted due to federal preemption, but sustainable aviation fuel can opt-in for credits. Spokesperson Patricia Ornst endorsed the legislation on behalf of Delta Airlines, saying it would bring suppliers to New York by creating market incentives.

And, “We’ve seen what’s happening in California and Oregon and Washington state,” Tighe said, noting those programs showed minimal impact on fuel prices while generating substantial clean energy investment. “We don’t have to guess about that.”

In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives. Their transportation fuels also produce 15% less greenhouse gas pollution per gallon compared to when the program started. Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.

The Golden State boasts that nearly 30% of new car sales are electric, compared to under 10% in New York. “They’ve met their transportation goals several years in advance,” said Michael Lerner from the nonprofit Energy Vision research group. “They met their most recent target three years early.”

In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said. But despite 96 Assembly cosponsors, the legislation has stalled in the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, Woerner acknowledged.

Fuels derived from waste cooking oil and other sustainable sources are at the heart of the aviation industry’s efforts to decarbonize, but purchasing SAF is nothing like booking a flight. Buyers, working individually or through the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), generally begin by asking SAF suppliers to submit proposals for vetting.

“Those are fairly time-consuming efforts,” said Andre de Fontaine, a managing director at the Center for Green Market Activation, one of the non-profits that runs SABA. “They take somewhere between 18 and 24 months to run.”

Members only

The alliance has moved to streamline the process with today’s launch of SAFc Connect, a platform containing information on carbon intensity, pricing, feedstock and other attributes of SAF certificates for fuels pre-vetted by SABA. The platform is open to alliance members, which include Amazon, Deloitte, Netflix among 32 other companies.

“Instead of running an RFP every year whenever they want to buy SAF certificates, they can now go into a managed database confident that the fuel has been vetted for quality criteria,” said de Fontaine.

At least five SAF providers — Alaska Air, Future Energy Global, International Airlines Group, Targray and Valero — will be part of SAFc Connect at launch. SABA expects up to double that number to come on board in coming months.

Book and claim

The scheme operates on a book-and-claim basis, meaning that buyers can use the certificates to offset Scope 3 aviation emissions without actually flying planes that burn SAF. This approach, also being used in maritime shipping and for rail freight, allows buyers to support sellers even if they cannot directly access the low-carbon transport on offer.

Although de Fontaine would not disclose likely prices, he noted that SABA’s last RFP produced certificates with prices in the range of $350 to $400 per metric ton of carbon dioxide. An economy-class round trip from New York to London creates around 0.6 tons of CO2, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.

This decision, endorsed by the UK Ministry of Defence and incorporated into Defence Standard 91-091, aims to accelerate the production and adoption of SAF within the aviation sector.

Safety is paramount in aviation fuel standards. The updated Defence Standard 91-091 ensures that SAF produced through co-processing meets stringent aviation fuel specifications. This standard aligns with global benchmarks, such as ASTM D1655, guaranteeing that the fuel is compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. Industry stakeholders, including BP and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), have collaborated to achieve this milestone, emphasizing the fuel’s safety and performance.

Britain’s Leadership in Sustainable Aviation

It’s not just Virgin Atlantic or the hope for sustainable space travel: By increasing the co-processing blend limit, the UK positions itself as a leader in sustainable aviation. This move allows for the integration of renewable feedstocks, such as waste oils and fats, into existing refinery processes, facilitating a faster and more cost-effective path to SAF production. The approach reduces the need for constructing new facilities, thereby accelerating the availability of cleaner aviation fuels.

While the adoption of SAF represents a significant advancement in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint, it’s important to recognize that SAF is not a complete solution. The production and use of SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, depending on the feedstock and production methods.

However, challenges remain, including feedstock availability, production scalability, and economic factors. Therefore, while SAF contributes to more sustainable air travel, achieving guilt-free flying will require a combination of technological advancements, policy support, and broader systemic changes in the aviation industry.

In contrast to a battery, the fuel cell can be quickly refuelled rather than recharged.
Making breakthroughs in electrically powered aviation The researchers discovered that the fuel cell has the potential to be revolutionary in the aviation sector.
The fuel cell technology could also serve as an enabler for other sectors, such as marine and rail transportation.
Importantly, the new fuel cell is inherently safer than many other batteries, Chiang said.","Researchers have identified a fuel cell solution that could help electrify transportation systems and overcome limitations of traditional batteries.

The fuel cell packs three times as much energy per pound as today’s best electric vehicle batteries, offering a lightweight option for powering trucks, planes, or ships.

In contrast to a battery, the fuel cell can be quickly refuelled rather than recharged. In this case, the fuel is liquid sodium metal, an inexpensive and widely available commodity.

In a series of experiments with a prototype device, the researchers demonstrated that this cell could carry more than three times as much energy per unit of weight as the lithium-ion batteries used in virtually all electric vehicles today.

Making breakthroughs in electrically powered aviation

The researchers discovered that the fuel cell has the potential to be revolutionary in the aviation sector. In aviation, where weight is especially crucial, such an improvement in energy density could be the breakthrough that finally makes electrically powered flight practical at a significant scale.

“The threshold that you really need for realistic electric aviation is about 1,000 watt-hours per kilogramme,” explained Yet-Ming Chiang, professor of materials science and engineering at MIT.

“Today’s electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries top out at about 300 watt-hours per kilogramme – nowhere near what’s needed. Even at 1,000 watt-hours per kilogramme, it wouldn’t be enough to enable transcontinental or trans-Atlantic flights.”

That’s still beyond the reach of any known battery chemistry, but Chiang said that achieving 1,000 watts per kilogramme would be an enabling technology for regional electric aviation, which accounts for approximately 80% of domestic flights and 30% of aviation emissions.

The fuel cell technology could also serve as an enabler for other sectors, such as marine and rail transportation.

Fuel cell technologies vs traditional batteries

A significant amount of research has been conducted over the past three decades to develop lithium-air or sodium-air batteries; however, achieving full rechargeability has proven to be challenging.

“People have been aware of the energy density you could get with metal-air batteries for a very long time, and it’s been hugely attractive, but it’s just never been realised in practice,” Chiang stated.

By applying the same basic electrochemical concept, but utilising a fuel cell instead of a battery, the researchers were able to harness the advantages of high energy density in a practical form. Unlike a battery, whose materials are assembled once and sealed in a container, a fuel cell’s energy-carrying materials are replenished.

Can the fuel cell be scaled for commercial use?

The researchers envision using this system in an aircraft, where fuel packs containing stacks of cells, similar to racks of food trays in a cafeteria, would be inserted into the fuel cells. The sodium metal inside these packs undergoes chemical transformation as it provides the power.

Then, a stream of its chemical by-product is released, and in the case of aircraft, this is emitted out the back, much like the exhaust from a jet engine.

However, there’s a very big difference: There would be no carbon dioxide emissions. Instead, the emissions, consisting of sodium oxide, would actually soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

This compound would quickly combine with moisture in the air to form sodium hydroxide, which readily reacts with carbon dioxide to form a solid material, sodium carbonate. This, in turn, forms sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda.

As an added benefit, if the final product, the sodium bicarbonate, ends up in the ocean, it could help to de-acidify the water, countering another of the damaging effects of greenhouse gases.

Importantly, the new fuel cell is inherently safer than many other batteries, Chiang said.

While the device so far exists only as a small, single-cell prototype, Chiang says the system should be quite straightforward to scale up to practical sizes for commercialisation.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2019422624-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 06:56:22.477387

Papua New Guinea’s national carrier, Air Niugini, is set to significantly expand and modernize its fleet with the addition of new aircraft from Airbus. The airline has officially confirmed the acquisition of two more A220-100 single-aisle jets, reinforcing its earlier commitment made in 2023 when it ordered six of these advanced aircraft. This strategic move is part of Air Niugini’s broader plan to enhance its operational capabilities, improve fuel efficiency, and offer passengers a more comfortable flying experience.

The A220-100 is well-known for its versatility, efficient performance, and ability to serve short- to medium-haul routes effectively. These aircraft are designed with the latest technology, allowing airlines to operate with lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions, aligning with global aviation sustainability goals. For Air Niugini, the introduction of these planes will help boost capacity and connectivity within the Oceania region, which is vital for Papua New Guinea’s tourism and business sectors.

In addition to the purchase of the two new A220-100 jets, Air Niugini has also arranged leasing agreements for three larger A220-300 aircraft through Azorra, a prominent U.S.-based aircraft leasing company. The A220-300 model offers greater passenger capacity while maintaining the same efficiency and modern features as its smaller sibling. By combining owned and leased aircraft, Air Niugini is optimizing its fleet flexibility to respond dynamically to passenger demand and route expansion plans.

This announcement coincides with a major milestone for the airline as its first A220 jet progresses toward completion at Airbus’s Mirabel assembly plant in Canada. The Mirabel facility is renowned for its expertise in producing the A220, which incorporates advanced materials and cutting-edge aerodynamics. The nearing delivery of this initial aircraft marks the beginning of a new era for Air Niugini, symbolizing its commitment to modernization and growth.

Overall, Air Niugini’s investment in the Airbus A220 family signals a strong future vision aimed at enhancing service quality, operational efficiency, and environmental responsibility. As Papua New Guinea’s flagship airline prepares to welcome these new jets, it strengthens its position as a key player in the Pacific aviation market and reaffirms its dedication to providing safe, reliable, and comfortable air travel for its customers.

Gary Seddon, Chief Executive Officer of Air Niugini said: “The A220 is set to form the backbone of our domestic and regional fleet and will support economic development in Papua New Guinea. As we continue to forecast strong growth we have made the decision to increase our orders for this fuel efficient type, bringing a whole new level of efficiency and comfort for our operations.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales of Airbus’ Commercial Aircraft business said: “This is Air Niugini’s second order for the A220. We are committed to working closely with the airline as we support its fleet renewal programme. The A220 is quite simply the most efficient aircraft in its size category, with a wider and spacious cabin and the range to fly non-stop to any destination on the carrier’s network.”

The A220 is recognized as the most cutting-edge aircraft within its category, boasting the longest operational range and superior fuel economy. It is capable of seating between 100 and 160 passengers, with a maximum flight distance of up to 3,600 nautical miles (around 6,700 kilometers). The smaller variant, the A220-100, caters to cabin layouts accommodating 100 to 135 travelers, whereas the larger A220-300 serves routes demanding capacity for 120 to 160 passengers.

Powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation GTF™ engines, the A220 delivers an impressive 25% reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions per seat relative to older models. Reflecting Airbus’s sustainability goals, this aircraft can currently operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with plans to enable 100% SAF usage fleetwide by 2030.

As of the end of April 2025, Airbus had amassed more than 900 firm orders for the A220 from over 30 different customers, having delivered in excess of 410 units. The aircraft is actively deployed by 24 airlines globally, serving more than 1,600 flight routes to upwards of 470 destinations, thereby maintaining its status as a leader in the compact single-aisle aircraft market.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed-2025-05-28T105237610-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-28 02:56:09.953445

In the past, U.S. renewable fuel producers would import Canadian feedstock to make biodiesel or renewable diesel, then sell the fuel into Canada.
Hybrid vehicles’ decarbonization potential when combined with renewable fuels offers drivers a cheaper option to pursue a lower carbon footprint.
The potential for a robust Canadian renewable fuels industry is there, but experts agree that the government needs to take action, ensuring that Canadian fuels get a fair shot.","Trade turbulence supplies both new challenges and opportunities as tensions with the United States, Canada’s closest trading partner, remain high. Meanwhile, provincial governments are increasingly recognizing their local renewable fuel producers and looking for ways to encourage local use of Canadian-made fuels. According to Canadian industry experts, however, the expiration of the U.S. Biodiesel Blenders’ Tax Credit and the implementation of its subsequent replacement, the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, will harm the Canadian industry. Unlike the BTC, 45Z is paid to the domestic (U.S.) producer, and the fuel is exportable to Canada. Before the BTC expired, Canadian fuel was able to be sent to the U.S. where it was blended to receive the BTC.

The federal and provincial support structures built to promote renewable fuels production and usage in Canada are part of the country’s strategy to decarbonize. Each year, Advanced Biofuels Canada commissions a study to track the state of the country’s biofuels industry. Titled the “Biofuels in Canada Report,” prepared by Naivus Research, it assesses the impact of low-carbon fuel policies across the country. Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, explains that his organization has commissioned this report series to track the state of the biofuels industry in Canada since 2010. The study’s longitudinal tracking provides helpful context to newly collected biofuel use information. The 2024 report reflects on data from 2023 and provides a helpful jumping-off point for deeper dialogue with government entities looking for data about renewable fuels.

One of the study’s key data points is the change in clean fuel consumption each year. The report shows that ethanol consumption increased by 13% from 2022 to 2023, and biomass-based diesel consumption grew by 68% with much of that increase due to a “surge” in renewable diesel usage.

Production Volumes

Canada possesses over 2 billion liters (approximately 530 million gallons) of installed ethanol capacity and 1.9 billion liters of biomass-based diesel capacity, which includes both renewable diesel and biodiesel. The biodiesel sector produces 550 million liters per year, and the two renewable diesel facilities have the collective capacity to produce roughly 1.2 billion liters yearly, according to Dany Laferriere, vice president of communications and outreach with the Canadian Biofuels Association. The country’s biomass-based diesel production volume will likely expand in 2025 when the new Imperial Oil RD facility, located near Edmonton in Strathcona, Alberta, comes online with a production capacity of 1.16 billion liters.

A total of 16 biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facilities are either under construction or producing fuel in Canada, according to research from Biodiesel Magazine’s data specialist, Chloe Piekkola. The country’s production portfolio includes five operational biodiesel facilities and 11 RD or SAF facilities, six of which are under development, two under construction and three operational facilities.

The report reflects the impact that Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations have had on the fuel supply since they came into effect in June 2022, explains Ghatala. The CFR received support from a broader base of constituents because the regulations contain compliance pathways “that are an opportunity for the refining sector,” Ghatala says. Refineries are able to generate Category 1 compliance credits by implementing refinery improvements. “There are lots of ways that you can nip and tuck emissions around a refinery and that can generate compliance credits,” Ghatala adds.

To date, most of the volume obligations under the CFR have been met through imports, explains Laferriere. He describes the Canadian low-carbon fuels industry as “small but growing.” Renewable diesel projects make up much of the industry’s development focus at the moment. Canadian biorefineries have room to grow in order to meet the projected demand of 4 billion liters by 2030. ABFC’s report shows that the nationwide blending for biomass-based diesel reached 6.5% in 2023, projected to increase up to 7% when 2024 numbers are released.

In 2030, the volume demand for renewable fuels in the national gasoline pool is expected to reach 7 billion liters. The Canadian ethanol industry likely will not be able to supply this volume on its own. “We could be just about self-sufficient on the diesel side, but we are forecast to continue being importers on the gasoline side, which generally reflects Canada’s agricultural landscape,” Ghatala says. “Because of our canola sector, we are larger lipid producers than we are sugar producers—we simply don’t grow as much corn as the U.S. does[.]”

Provincial Standards

Canada’s plethora of provincial clean fuel standards stand alongside the country’s CFR. In recent months, however, economic pressures led Prime Minister Mark Carney to remove the consumer carbon tax, which was an achievement of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s environmental agenda.

Provinces across the country have enacted renewable fuel and clean fuel regulations with different structures. Because 95% of fuels supplied in Canada are covered under a provincial regulation, producers are able to stack compliance credit values in some provinces, explains Ghatala. Renewable fuel programs exist in “every province [from] Quebec and west [of it],” he says.

In 2023, renewable diesel blend rates hit above 20% in British Columbia—far exceeding the province’s 4% minimum volumetric blending requirement—in order to meet carbon intensity reduction requirements. When 2024 numbers come out, Ghatala anticipates that B.C.’s numbers will stand at around 30%. After the trade turbulence began, B.C. increased the minimum volume obligation to 8%, along with a requirement that the obligated volumetric portion must be met with domestically produced renewable fuels. The requirement came into effect on April 1.

“We see the renewable and lower-carbon fuels being pulled to markets that have this visible credit price,” Ghatala says. “Of all the provinces, British Columbia’s policy has the most transparent compliance credit market.”

Most other provincial programs, such as those in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, have volumetric requirements without any compliance credit trading. Manitoba’s clean fuel mandates for 2025 are set at 5% for diesel and 10% for gasoline. Saskatchewan’s blending mandate stands at 2% for diesel and 7.5% for gasoline.

Quebec holds the highest minimum volume requirements of any province, with the 2025 minimum set at 12% renewable content in gasoline and 5% renewable content in diesel; the requirements are set to increase to 15% and 10%, respectively, by 2030.

Ontario’s 2025 volume requirements are set at 11% for gasoline and 4% for diesel. Alberta’s requirements are lower on the gasoline front this year, standing at 5%, with diesel at 2%.

ABFC’s report found that the renewable fuels industry saves Canadians half a cent per liter of fuel. Ghatala explains that this calculation originates from the price for renewable diesel and biodiesel being more expensive than conventional fuels by five cents, and ethanol being cheaper by six cents. “We’re seeing the average cost of carbon abatement through renewable fuels to be about $123,” he says.

Coprocessing Production

Coprocessing constitutes a small portion of Canada’s renewable fuels volume, but it provides a cost-effective option to increase renewable fuel production, according to Laferriere. This process uses renewable content such as vegetable oil or animal fats and requires mixing with a crude oil input at a petroleum refinery. Depending on where the renewable material is inserted into the refinery’s hydrotreater or fluid catalytic cracker unit, the renewable material ends up in one of the refinery’s products.

Provincial regulations across the country include methodologies for calculating credit generation, such as carbon-14 dating and a monitoring, measurement and verification program, he explains. According to ABFC’s report, 100 million liters per year of coprocessing capacity are available.

Refineries across the country are limited in the amount of organic content they can add, Ghatala explains. For example, jet fuel can only have 5% organic feedstock added. “Policymakers, I think, view the opportunity that coprocessing provides as an additional means through which to pursue reducing emissions of liquid transportation fuels. The fact that we have coprocessing diesel, renewable diesel, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel and related products like biodiesel distillation bottoms [and] arctic-grade renewable diesel, and that those fuels can be used in different transportation modes means that we have the tools at hand to address transportation emissions growth.”

Opportunities and Obstacles

Policy structures for increasing biofuel usage across Canada are present at both the provincial and federal level. However, implementation of the U.S. 45Z tax credit constitutes a significant challenge to the Canadian biofuels industry. “Our domestic sector has been negatively impacted by the 45Z tax incentive and its exportability to the Canadian market, along with other factors,” Ghatala says. Concerns abound as to whether Canadian producers can compete with U.S. imports and Canadian policies are durable enough to handle the influx of foreign fuel.

The shift away from the Biodiesel Blenders’ Tax Credit to 45Z’s Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit has triggered a “rationalization” in the North American biomass-based diesel market, Ghatala explains. In the past, U.S. renewable fuel producers would import Canadian feedstock to make biodiesel or renewable diesel, then sell the fuel into Canada. In light of 2025’s trade turbulence, Canadian federal and provincial governments started looking for strategies to encourage energy security and domestic resilience. Rather than crossing the border, Canadian feedstocks are used to produce biofuels at home, and those fuels are sold into local markets. “We are seeing renewable fuels be a big part of that conversation because they link so many things in our economy together,” Ghatala says. “They link agriculture with industry, they link agriculture with oil and gas refining, with greenhouse gas targets and energy security, and all of those things tied together is a very formidable consortium to encourage action.”

Even before trade turbulence, renewable fuels grew in popularity as the conversation around decarbonization has shifted in recent years, and policymakers have realized how long the road to full electrification is, Ghatala explains. A growing understanding that other options are needed to attain the net-zero target—especially for Class 7 and 8 vehicles—has brought renewable fuels back into the spotlight. “Renewable fuels do provide the ready-made, available now, commercially distributed technology that can reduce emissions immediately and pairs very well with electrification,” he says. Hybrid vehicles’ decarbonization potential when combined with renewable fuels offers drivers a cheaper option to pursue a lower carbon footprint.

Mandated volumes of SAF provide a firm basis for the growth of the country’s domestic SAF industry, another positive for the biofuels space. B.C. has implemented the first SAF mandate in North America, starting in 2026. The province’s revised LCFS regulations, which came into effect January 2024, mandate a 2% carbon intensity reduction for aviation fuel in 2026, increasing to 10% in 2030. A volumetric mandate begins in 2028, set at 1%, and increases to 3% in 2030.

The potential for a robust Canadian renewable fuels industry is there, but experts agree that the government needs to take action, ensuring that Canadian fuels get a fair shot. “Canada is well-positioned to lead globally in low-carbon fuel production, thanks to its abundant natural resources, existing infrastructure and technical expertise,” Laferriere says. “To realize this potential, CFA supports clear, stable and technology-neutral policies based on carbon intensity. These principles are critical to attracting long-term investment and building a resilient clean fuel sector.”

Otherwise, they say, we run the risk of ignoring the problem.

Who bears the most responsibility?

Experts warn that global governments are on track to exceed the Paris Agreement of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

Burning fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, releases CO2 and other molecules into the atmosphere which trap heat close to the Earth’s surface, resulting in a greenhouse effect, warming the planet. This human-induced climate change is leading to ocean acidification, rising sea levels, more extreme weather events, and is even a risk to health.

The Paris Agreement requires greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2025 and drop by 43% by 2030.

Some researchers have suggested that a “net-zero carbon debt” should be applied to assess which groups are responsible for overshooting the goals of the Paris Agreement. A framework for this is detailed in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“As we near the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit, the question is not just about when we will exceed it, but also how we collectively deal with the consequences in the subsequent period,” says lead author Setu Pelz, a researcher at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, based in Austria. “To guide efforts that minimise overshoot and establish who should pay for harms caused during this period, we measure who is responsible and to what extent under a range of scenarios and approaches.”

“Our findings reveal how the lack of global cooperation prolongs climate harms,” the authors of the paper write. “Moreover, they show how responsibilities persist beyond budget exhaustion, informing the need for increased international support, ambitious mitigation targets, and reparative measures for those most affected.”

The research highlights the disproportionate effects of climate change on younger generations and regions which have contributed less to emissions.

Example: E-fuels for aviation

Global aviation is responsible for about 2.4% of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions – about the same as the historic emissions of Canada. The mix of gases produced by aeroplanes translates to about 4% of human-induced global warming.

An increasing role is being played by private aviation.

Small reductions of global aviation – as little as 2.5% – could lead to future contributions of aviation to global warming being halted, according to one study. There is also research into carbon-neutral fuels for aeroplanes.

The European Union (EU) even has a roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels. They say these synthetic “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” will make up 2% of the supply in Europe by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050.

Recent research has shown improvements in the process for making carbon-neutral aeroplane fuel. But even this is likely not enough according to some experts.

Other experts warn that the focus on e-fuels highlights a major disparity in the way that people of different socioeconomic backgrounds are treated in the energy market.

This “energy injustice” means poorer people who need energy for every day life are priced out of being able to use energy while corporations can use their resources and direct link to governments to make the most of energy subsidies and “green energy” initiatives.

Unequal approach harms the most vulnerable

New research published in the Climate Policy journal, for example, explains that working-class and poor people are disproportionately affected by energy tax policies during the transition to renewable sources for aviation.

The paper focuses on the EU’s energy policies.

The wealthiest 1% of the EU’s population is responsible for 66% of the distance currently travelled by air, while air travel is almost non-existent for the poorest 50% and limited for the bottom 90% of EU citizens.

In fact, this is a global phenomenon. Estimates vary, but research suggests that about 90% of the world’s population does not fly in a given year. And frequent flying is restricted to the wealthiest.

The Climate Policy findings indicate that the bottom 90% of people in the EU emit less than 0.1 tonne of CO2 equivalent emissions per person, per year. Meanwhile the top 1% emit about 20 tons per person/year.

On the other hand, electricity costs for primary needs such as heating and lighting is up to 3 times more expensive than electricity for long-distance travel.

Electricity serving household and local mobility needs cost about A$341 per MWh (Australian dollars per megawatt-hour) – or €194 per MWh. Meanwhile, e-fuel for aviation costs just A$115 per MWh, or €65.5 per MWh.

EU tax policies accounted for A$211/MWh (€120/MWh) of this cost in the case of household and local mobility fuel needs but only A$19.70/MWh (€11.2/MWh) in the case of aviation.

“As e-fuel, along with other energy carriers based on electricity, is still within its infancy, it’s time for policy-makers to address the potential social injustices which may arise when formulating e-fuel policies,” says author Jean-Baptiste Jarin, an expert on decarbonisation from the University of Pau and the Adour Region in France.

“Electricity for basic needs such as heating or cooking benefits everyone but using it for air mobility mostly benefits the upper classes.”

“And that is what I find most worrying about the findings from within my paper, that, essentially, low carbon policies could foster energy injustice to people across society,” Jarin adds.

“Sadly, a massive production of e-fuel – especially when dedicated to aviation – could mean that tax inequalities, along with volume inequalities, spread the gap between the very wealthiest and the rest. That is why policy makers need to pay close attention.

“In the Global South, but also within the EU, during winters of 2022 and 2023, electricity bills were so high in most EU countries that people had to – and even were asked to by some – reduce heating and other appliances consumptions.”

A collective approach

A chemical engineer at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures in Australia, Maartje Feenstra, agrees that there is discrepancy between household users and industry.

“In general, industrial users use electricity that is less expensive than what households use. There’s an interaction there with politics and keeping the industry there. So that’s a difficult topic, of course, with all kinds of different aspects of that problem,” Feenstra tells Cosmos.

“The technical challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. So, they’re the only sustainable solution we have, but they’re also a factor 2 to 6 more expensive than our conventional fossil fuel-based fuels.”

University of Adelaide researcher and global expert on energy policy. Tracey Dodd, emphasises the importance of collective action to reduce carbon emissions, rather than individually-based solutions which can result in ordinary people feeling “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2 emitting aircraft.

“We have to have what we call a “just transition” [to clean energy sources],” she says. “I think that it’s really hard. You want to make sure that that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive, and that it’s not going to price certain people out of the market to fly, or price certain people out of the market of things like flowers or coffee that we ship.

The other two locations being considered are Portage la Prairie, Manitoba and Port Colborne, Ontario. According to federal government data, Azure got $10 million for front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies, with $5 million going to each study.

Sc.wenwen Economic Development Corporation Manager, Krista Stoesz, told CFJC Today that the Kamloops facility was the recipient of similar funding “early in the life of the project.”

“Some of this work applies to the facility, wherever the location may be (all sites), and some of it is location specific,” Stoesz said in an email.

“We have established critical partnerships with leaders in their respective industries that are required to successfully construct and operate a facility of this nature. At the same time, we have worked closely with federal, provincial and Indigenous governments to adhere to all regulations and requirements.”

That Azure news release also said that it had partnered with Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc “to co-develop a facility on their ancestral lands” and that it was continuing to advance discussions with Indigenous groups in Manitoba and Ontario.

“Azure has sought to maximize optionality by pursuing a multi-site strategy through developing three Canadian SAF-focused renewable fuels production facility sites in parallel,” the company said. “All FEED work for each of the three sites will be complete by the end of 2024, positioning Azure to reach a Final Investment Decision (‘FID’) in the first half of 2025 as to enable an in-service date in 2027.”

Stoesz told CFJC Today that there was some misunderstanding in the community regarding the number of facilities being proposed across Canada, and that only one of the three projects was “ever intented to move forward.”

“For a number of strategic and operational reasons, the B.C. location remains the most desirable of the three,” Stoesz said. “The project location in Tk’emlúps is a desirable site and the partnership with TteS is one of those reasons.”

CFJC Today has also reached out to Azure Sustainable Fuels for more on its plans and the status of the proposed project.

If it moves ahead, the Kamloops facility is slated to rise on a plot of land across the North Thompson River from Westsyde. An exact location wasn’t specified, but it’s expected to be alongside the CN Rail tracks south of Rayleigh.

“We’ve been working with Tk’emlúps since about 2021,” Vanessa Vredenburg, Azure’s Director of Indigenous and Stakeholder Relations, told a Kamloops committee meeting in December.

“Our founders were looking along Google Maps and found this nice chunk of land along the railway and that’s where our partnership kind of started, and it’s really progressed from there.”

While there has been some pushback from residents in the Westsyde and Rayleigh area owing to concerns about things like pollution, odour and impacts to the environment, others say the project is necessary as it will bring high paying jobs to the area.

According to Vredenburg, the facility is expected to create around 1,500 jobs during construction and about 150 when it is up and running.

Stoesz said Tk’emlúps band members can still have their say into the project if they missed Monday’s information session. While she wouldn’t release details, Stoesz added it was “was well attended,” with nearly 100 attendees either in-person or online.

The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.
“We don’t have to guess about that.” In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives.
Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.
“They met their most recent target three years early.” In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic lawmakers rallied alongside clean fuel advocates on Tuesday at the State Capitol to push legislation that could slash greenhouse gas emissions from transportation by 20% within eight years. The Clean Fuel Standard Act of 2025, S1343A/A472A would create an incentive system that rewards using cleaner fuels while generating billions for electric vehicle infrastructure.

The proposal would require all fuel companies—including providers, refiners, blenders, and electricity suppliers—to lower the amount of greenhouse gas pollution produced per unit of fuel energy their products consume or emit. That dirtiness is called carbon intensity, which they’d lower through a credit trading system, just like in California, Oregon, and Washington. Under the legislation, sponsored by State Sen. Kevin Parker and Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, providers who hit emissions targets would be able to earn credits they could then sell off to companies that miss the mark.

Transportation produces more than 34% of New York’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the state’s largest pollution source, according to State Senator Pete Harckham, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee. The bill outlines the initial target as a 20% reduction by 2033.

The full lifecycle emissions assessment, measuring all pollution from a fuel from start to finish, would include all stages from fuel production through consumer use—including growing crops for biofuels, and refining, transporting, and burning the fuel. Providers would have also have to meet transparency requirements and submit annual reports. Alternative fuel examples include electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel made from waste cooking oil or agricultural products, biofuels made from plant materials, and renewable natural gas from farm waste.

Beyond 2033, the Department of Environmental Conservation would set specific reduction targets every five years, with limits based on new technology and stricter climate requirements under the 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. Companies providing electricity for electric vehicles, renewable diesel, or advanced biofuels would generate the most credits. Meanwhile, traditional gasoline and diesel suppliers would have to buy credits offsetting their environmental impact or be subject to penalties.

When utilities or government agencies earn money by selling credits, they must spend 40% of that amount on clean transportation projects in disadvantaged communities, including electric school buses, truck charging stations, and multi-family housing charging infrastructure. The credit system is supposed to generate over $1 billion annually, with fossil fuel companies buying credits from utilities, transit agencies, and clean fuel producers.

According to Julie Tighe, president of the New York League of Conservation Voters, that money would flow directly to transportation electrification projects without requiring new state spending. She said that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for example, would receive approximately $20,000 per electric bus annually through credit sales.

“The clean fuel standard will improve air quality tomorrow, especially for our environmental justice communities, taking harmful pollutants out of the air,” Harckham said at the press conference. “It does this in a tax-neutral way.”

Dairy farmer David Fisher from the New York Farm Bureau said his operation already produces renewable natural gas equivalent to 2,500 gallons of diesel daily through anaerobic digestion of manure. That means that bacteria break down the manure to produce methane that’s used as fuel. Currently, about 12% of New York’s cows produce renewable natural gas that could replace diesel fuel, he said.

The legislation includes sustainable aviation fuel as a credit generator because European regulations require planes leaving their airports to use jet fuel made from renewable sources like waste oils or plant materials instead of petroleum, producing fewer emissions.

But flights departing New York airports still rely on traditional jet fuel. “They’re leaving Kennedy Airport and LaGuardia dirty. It doesn’t make any sense,” Woerner said. Here’s the Assemblymember on those tougher airline regulations:

Aviation fuels are exempted due to federal preemption, but sustainable aviation fuel can opt-in for credits. Spokesperson Patricia Ornst endorsed the legislation on behalf of Delta Airlines, saying it would bring suppliers to New York by creating market incentives.

And, “We’ve seen what’s happening in California and Oregon and Washington state,” Tighe said, noting those programs showed minimal impact on fuel prices while generating substantial clean energy investment. “We don’t have to guess about that.”

In California, for example, the 2011 clean fuel standard led to 31 billion fewer gallons of regular petroleum fuel being used, replaced instead with cleaner alternatives. Their transportation fuels also produce 15% less greenhouse gas pollution per gallon compared to when the program started. Electricity used to power vehicles now accounts for 20% of all the clean fuel credits generated through the program.

The Golden State boasts that nearly 30% of new car sales are electric, compared to under 10% in New York. “They’ve met their transportation goals several years in advance,” said Michael Lerner from the nonprofit Energy Vision research group. “They met their most recent target three years early.”

In the New York State legislature, the Senate has passed similar clean fuel legislation twice in previous years and expects to do so again this session, Harckham said. But despite 96 Assembly cosponsors, the legislation has stalled in the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, Woerner acknowledged.

“There are some environmental groups that are really convinced that eliminating internal combustion engines is the only path to achieving our climate goals,” Woerner said.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2024/09/GettyImages-954558336-e1715959219184_79f904.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-27 17:57:10.293845

The move comes as operating expenses rise but revenues fall, per quarterly reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as the company plans to halve its rented space at Skokie’s Illinois Science + Technology Park.
LanzaTech filed plans to lay off 44 to the Illinois Department of Commerce on May 12, offering “mass layoff” as the reason.
LanzaTech was founded in New Zealand and has headquartered in Skokie since 2014 in the Illinois Science + Tech Park, according to previous reporting.
The decision to downsize the company was not influenced by the political climate regarding green energy, nor the tariffs, she added.","Skokie-based clean energy company LanzaTech Global, Inc., which has been heralded in TIME magazine and by Prince William’s global environmental competition, plans to lay off 44 of its 383 employees in the first two weeks of June, per state of Illinois filings.

The move comes as operating expenses rise but revenues fall, per quarterly reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and as the company plans to halve its rented space at Skokie’s Illinois Science + Technology Park.

Last month, the company acknowledged it received an offer from Carbon Direct Capital Management to buy the carbon recycling company at $0.02 a share, according to a press release from LanzaTech. In January 2023, the stock was valued at $10.43 a share, per Nasdaq.

LanzaTech filed plans to lay off 44 to the Illinois Department of Commerce on May 12, offering “mass layoff” as the reason. The first layoff date is scheduled for June 1, per state filings.

LanzaTech was founded in New Zealand and has headquartered in Skokie since 2014 in the Illinois Science + Tech Park, according to previous reporting.

The company’s SEC filing said it “transforms waste carbon into the chemical building blocks for consumer goods such as sustainable fuels, fabrics, and packaging that people use in their daily lives.”

“We are a gas fermentation company,” Dr. Zara Summers, chief science officer at LanzaTech previously told Pioneer Press. “You might know about sugar fermentation if you drink beer or wine. We use a bacterial catalyst that takes gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and convert those to ethanol at a commercial scale.”

TIME Magazine named LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren to its worldwide Top 100 Climate Leaders for Business for 2023, and it was named the sole United States finalist for Prince William’s November 2022 Earthshot prize, which honors the best solutions worldwide for tackling climate change.

In its recent quarterly SEC filing, however, the company wrote, “We have not achieved operating profitability since our formation. Our net losses after tax were $19.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and $25.5 million for the prior year period. As of March 31, 2025 we had an accumulated deficit of $988.8 million compared to an accumulated deficit of $969.6 million as of December 31, 2024. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until we sufficiently commercialize our technology.”

Kate Walsh, LanzaTech’s VP of Investor Relations and Tax, told Pioneer Press that LanzaTech is in a transition phase and is ready to put into practice the research knowledge it has gained these past few years.

“We’re pivoting the company from a Research and Development hub to one that’s commercially focused on deploying our proven technology,” Walsh said. “…So there’s a transition that comes along with that.”

Walsh said the downsizing and the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel, especially with regulated markets in the UK and the EU, will help make the company profitable.

The decision to downsize the company was not influenced by the political climate regarding green energy, nor the tariffs, she added.

LanzaTech also will save money by cutting in half the space it rents at the Skokie tech park, from 106,661 to 53,616 square feet, effective July 1, per SEC filings.

Per the filings, LanzaTech said it was unsure how the layoffs will affect health of the company overall, “and may result in significant adverse consequences.”

As LanzaTech moves forward, the group also runs into danger of having its stock delisted from the Nasdaq due to its low valuation, per the filing. Delisted companies generally face steep challenges in raising money.

The village of Skokie’s Director of Communications and Community Engagement Patrick Deignan released a statement on behalf of the village.

“Innovative companies like LanzaTech play a vital role in strengthening Skokie’s local economy, supporting high-quality jobs and enhancing the Village’s longstanding reputation as a center for scientific advancement. The Village remains committed to fostering a strong climate for innovation and will continue supporting the success of LanzaTech and other companies contributing to our community and beyond.”

“LanzaTech is an important part of Skokie’s science, technology and local business landscape,” said Mayor Ann Tennes in a statement emailed to Pioneer Press. “Although we’re disappointed that the company’s strategic actions will result in a reduction in their local workforce, we remain confident in LanzaTech’s future and the continued impact they’ll make here in Skokie and around the world.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/12/13/KNDBCIZHKFGQXPGVVWG26Y7IKU.png?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-05-27 16:56:33.261933

Organised by Centralny Port Komunikacyjny (CPK), LOT Polish Airlines, and Business & Science Poland, the event called for aviation to be recognised as a strategic sector for the EU economy – and warned that without action, Europe risks a systemic loss in global competitiveness.

While celebrating Poland’s infrastructure ambitions – not least the planned construction of CPK – industry leaders warned that the EU aviation sector faces growing competitive pressures. LOT Polish Airlines, which recently published business and decarbonisation strategies up to 2030, pointed to rising costs driven by environmental regulations. The Draghi Report estimates decarbonisation will cost the sector €61bn annually from 2031 to 2050, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) requirements escalating to 70% by 2050.

SAF remains three to four times more expensive than traditional fuel, however, and Poland currently lacks local SAF production facilities, placing additional financial strain on carriers such as LOT. In 2025, LOT’s SAF-related costs are expected to reach €40m, rising to €100m by 2030. These factors threaten the global competitiveness of European airlines compared to carriers from regions with looser environmental rules.

Michał Fijoł, CEO of LOT Polish Airlines, said: “I’m here to speak on behalf of the entire European business sector. We believe in our intelligence and our advanced technologies. That’s why we can be extremely successful. But we must have equal opportunities – the same chances as our competitors from around the world.

(Synhelion) The Lake Lucerne Navigation Company (SGV) AG has used solar fuel from Synhelion for the first time. The steamboat Gallia was symbolically fueled with solar diesel from Synhelion’s industrial scale plant DAWN – a milestone for more sustainable mobility on the water. -- The over 110-year-old steamboat was symbolically fueled by Synhelion with the first barrel of solar diesel. The solar fuel comes from Synhelion’s first production plant DAWN in Jülich, Germany, which has been producing sustainable, synthetic fuels on an industrial scale since summer 2024. The fuel is fully compatible with conventional combustion engines. This makes SGV the first shipping company in the world to use Synhelion’s solar fuel. The symbolic first fueling took place as part of the launch of SGV’s new premium experience “Legends of Lake Lucerne.”

Renewable fuels key to sustainable shipping

The renewable fuel used in this historic ride was produced at DAWN, Synhelion’s first industrial-scale demonstration plant. With plant DAWN, Synhelion has successfully validated its technology in an industrial setting, proving that the technology is now ready for large-scale deployment. Synhelion uses solar heat to drive a thermochemical process that turns a biogenic carbon source and water into synthetic drop-in fuel, namely sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), gasoline, and diesel. Unlike fossil fuels, Synhelion’s solar fuels are nearly CO2-neutral, emitting only as much CO2 as was used to produce them. Synhelion’s technology presents a solution available today for defossilizing transportation without requiring modifications to existing infrastructure, engines, or vehicles.

SGV a pioneer in shipping

The navigation company plans to regularly purchase solar fuel from Synhelion in the future and has already signed a five-year offtake agreement. As a pioneer customer, SGV is making an important contribution to scaling up Synhelion’s technology. “Sustainability is a key priority for us. Synhelion’s solar fuel offers us a concrete solution to reduce our CO2 emissions,” says Stefan Schulthess, Managing Director of SGV.

Further applications for Synhelion fuels planned

By successfully starting fuel production at its industrial plant DAWN, Synhelion has demonstrated that its technology is ready for market ramp-up. The fuels produced at DAWN will now be gradually introduced into other means of transport to showcase their potential in driving the transition to a net-zero transportation sector. The world’s first motorcycle ride powered by Synhelion’s solar gasoline already took place recently. At the same time, the company is working intensively to expand its production capacities in order to supply commercially relevant quantities of renewable fuels in the future.

The company is focused on producing: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Green Hydrogen Green Ammonia Green Chemicals Biofuels The company plans to produce 5 million tons of green ammonia annually by 2030, which equals around 1 million tons of green hydrogen.","In a major step toward global energy transition, AM Green and the Port of Rotterdam Authority have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to create a green energy supply chain linking India and Northwestern Europe. The collaboration will use the Port of Rotterdam — Europe’s largest energy port and a key entry point for hydrogen carriers — to transport green fuels from India.

The partnership aims to support the supply of sustainable bunkering fuels and Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs). It also includes plans to assess infrastructure needs for terminals in Rotterdam and along the broader European supply chain.

Anil Chalamalasetty, Founder of AM Green and Greenko Group said,

“This partnership is part of our ambitious global growth strategy in green fuels including 5 MTPA of green ammonia and 1 MTPA of SAF. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in establishing a global carbon-free energy ecosystem. It will enable the seamless movement of green molecules and fuels from India to Europe, reinforcing AM Green’s position as a global clean energy transition platform and accelerating industrial decarbonization globally.”

Why India Is Betting Big on Green Hydrogen?

India’s Green Hydrogen Revolution report reveals that the country spends over USD 90 billion each year to meet more than 40% of its energy needs from other countries.

Thus, India is focusing on green hydrogen to reduce its dependence on imported fuels and cut carbon emissions. Furthermore, domestic production would also be cost-effective.

Reaching Emission Goals

India is the world’s third-biggest carbon emitter, responsible for nearly 7% of global CO₂ emissions. Earlier, it had promised to reduce its emissions intensity by 33–35% under the Paris Agreement. Now, the goal is even higher—45% by 2030.

India also aims to be energy independent by 2047 and reach net-zero emissions by 2070. To get there, green hydrogen will play a major role. It’s clean, renewable, and can help the country meet its climate targets while supporting industries.

Notably, green hydrogen is made using renewable energy like solar and wind. It can help power industries and vehicles while lowering the need for imported fossil fuels.

National Green Hydrogen Mission

To support this vision, the Indian government launched the National Green Hydrogen Mission in January 2023. This mission provides a full action plan to grow the green hydrogen sector in India. It includes steps to attract investments, build the needed infrastructure, and promote research and development.

Many countries have already introduced hydrogen strategies as part of their clean energy plans. By moving early, India hopes to become a global leader in green hydrogen production and exports.

With this mission, India is working toward a future that’s cleaner, greener, and more energy secure.

Rotterdam’s Green Gateway Role

The Port of Rotterdam plays a crucial role in energy security and trade for the Netherlands and all of Europe. Thanks to its strategic location, top-tier infrastructure, and excellent inland connections, Rotterdam is a powerhouse for global commerce. The Port Authority is deeply committed to sustainable development, safe port operations, and efficient logistics.

Their long-term goal is to transform Rotterdam into a climate-neutral, future-ready logistics and industrial hub, aligning economic strength with environmental responsibility.

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam Authority, stated,

“We are delighted to collaborate with AM Green BV to further strengthen our commitment to the energy transition. This agreement marks an important step towards establishing a robust supply chain for low-carbon fuels and chemicals. With India’s vast potential for green hydrogen production, combined with Rotterdam’s strategic location and advanced infrastructure, the collaboration will lead to a robust and sustainable green energy supply chain between the two regions.”

Powering the EU’s Net-Zero Target

The supply chain has the potential to export up to 1 million tons of green fuels annually, supporting trade valued at around $1 billion.

Initial production is expected to begin in Kakinada, India. Meanwhile, the Port of Rotterdam will continue its role as Europe’s hydrogen gateway, already handling about 13% of the continent’s energy demand.

Together, AM Green and the Port of Rotterdam are setting the stage for a clean energy corridor that supports India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission and helps Europe hit its climate goals.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2482745469.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 14:56:44.827593

In other words: It’s not an outright ban throughout the entire county, but it is as it relates to the aquifer.
SP: It’s not just this company under the leadership of X, Y, or Z CEO.
SP: We’re talking about preventing the process of sequestering under the aquifer, but I haven’t seen much talk of how to address things after a leak.
SP: It’s not like these power plants are on renewable energy.","This spring, Smile Politely has been publishing interviews with different organizations that are involved with and knowledgeable about the Mahomet Aquifer and the issues surrounding carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Over the last few months, I’ve interviewed representatives from Prairie Rivers Network (here and here), Prairie Research Institute, and Eco-Justice Collaborative to find out what is going on with the Mahomet Aquifer. I asked about the science and context for the threats to its well being through CCS, and what we can do to keep our sole source aquifer as uncontaminated as possible.

Earlier this year I interviewed Pam Richart, co-director of the Eco-Justice Collaborative. Richart also co-founded the Protect the Mahomet Aquifer collaborative. In part one of our interview, we discussed the Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) carbon capture and sequestration research and development project — that is currently paused — with regards to other CCS projects that are being proposed in the area. In this second and final installment, we talk about potential long term effects of CCS and banning the practice in and around the aquifer.

Just last week, the Illinois House passed a bill to ban CCS in the Mahomet Aquifer; it awaits Governor Pritzker’s signature. Earlier this year, the Champaign County Board decided to place a moratorium on CCS in the county.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Smile Politley: What is EJC’s take on the county board’s decision on a moratorium?

Pam Richart: It was marvelous! It took a long time to get there. Their process is really long. We started in August [2024] for this moratorium that got passed. They did the right thing and we were glad to see it.

SP: What does it mean, exactly?

Richart: A 12-month moratorium will give the county the time it needs to draft an ordinance and that will protect the aquifer. It will ban the injection of CO2 through and storage under the aquifer. By special use you can do it in other parts of the county. In other words: It’s not an outright ban throughout the entire county, but it is as it relates to the aquifer.

That’s something that we’re trying to get other counties to do as well. I’ve been working with Ford County who did a ban the day before Thanksgiving. Their ban prevents injection through; they didn’t get the storage under. The other county is DeWitt. They had prohibited injection in all of their zoning districts. They pretty much did a full ban. It’ll enable them to say: “Not here. If you go here you have to follow our special use criteria. You have to demonstrate that it’s going to be safe, it’s not going to impact water.”

SP: How can people voice their concerns about this?

Richart: What I would like to see is for people talk to their local governments. Folks that I’m working with are talking to Logan County, for example, to see if the first step they would do would be to adopt a resolution that would encourage the state to pass the sole source aquifer ban that we’re talking about. They can talk to their county boards and their elected officials at the municipal level to say please do this. I think that if we have a groundswell of noise from all those who get their water from the aquifer, that’s going to say to the [Illinois] Senate and the House, this isn’t just a few nonprofit organizations who are making noise. These are people who rely on the water.

The other thing they can do is write letters to the editor, and the third thing they can do is to set up meetings and make calls, but also meet with their state rep and the state senators, to say, “I want you to pass this ban. I’m your constituent. I need the water that I’m drinking. You’re probably drinking too. Protect it, right? I’m here to say I care. I’m here to say I expect you to do what’s right by the people here in Central Illinois.”

SP: Is there a way for them to get involved with Eco-Justice Collaborative?

Richart: Oh yeah, heck yeah. We have a multi-county group that meets every Thursday night and we do strategy and get commitments from people to take action. If they’re interested in doing that, that would be great. When there are meetings that are being held — if it’s not far geographically — if you’re in Champaign County, you can go to a meeting in McLean County because we’re going to be talking more with McLean County. [We’re] not quite an hour from Bloomington. Go to their meeting, support the folks who are organizing there. Putting your body on the ground and in those locations would be great.

SP: Where do you see this going in the short- to mid-term?

Richart: I don’t know; it’s going to be exciting. Andrew [Rehn, of Prairie Rivers Network] and I met with Senator Faraci and Governor Pritzker’s Climate Advisor, JC Kibbey, and asked about the governor’s position on the ban. He said he will not oppose it. And he said it was okay to share that information, so I’m sharing it.

Now that doesn’t mean behind the scenes, that he’s not getting all kinds of calls from labor. When you look at what’s at stake for industry here, then I don’t really know where he sits. I think he looks at CCS as a way to attract investments here in Illinois.

SP: It creates jobs, ostensibly.

Richart: Theoretically, it creates jobs. But everything that we’ve looked at, the jobs numbers are always inflated. Everybody says it’s about jobs. Yes, there would be some jobs. You’d have people laying pipe. You’d have people building carbon capture equipment. How many jobs, I think, is crazy. The governor was able to attract a billion dollars to get a hydrogen hub going here with Indiana and Michigan. And then, there’s sustainable aviation fuel.

The interesting thing is that farmers have not wanted CO2 pipelines, do not want sequestration, but they do feel that their markets are being threatened by the electrification of transportation systems. Sustainable aviation fuel, if it’s from ethanol, does require sequestration. And so it’s a very interesting balance in conversations we’re having. It’s like, “I don’t want it here, but it’s okay there.”

Days before Trump took office, the federal government released a rule that would make carbon pipelines safer. And it’s a good rule. It’s got some things that need to be enhanced, but it’s much better than anybody ever hoped for. And now Trump is taking it off the shelf. I don’t imagine it’s going to come back the way it was, and so we’ll all have to work on that.

The EPA [is] going to change under Trump. We’re probably going to look at acceleration and permit review. We’re not going to get anything more stringent. All of this leads to uncertainty. And uncertainty means uncertainty even in the state of Illinois. You have to have post-closure [care, the monitoring of closed sites] for a minimum of 30 years. What happens after that? And who’s reviewing what happens after that? And who’s in charge after that to do that kind of review? And who at the state, after the company goes bankrupt, is going to be able to have the time and the capacity to deal with this stuff?

SP: These are intergenerational issues.

Richart: Oh, they are.

SP: It’s not just this company under the leadership of X, Y, or Z CEO. It’s 30 years, 50 years.

Richart: Navigator CO2 Ventures said in their application, it takes 10,000 years for CO2 in a saline aquifer to become 90% inert. I’ve never read anything except that from them, although I’ve heard that said elsewhere. It’s like a thousand years or more. Under the aquifer, what can happen in a thousand years?

SP: We’re talking about preventing the process of sequestering under the aquifer, but I haven’t seen much talk of how to address things after a leak. Are there conversations being had about what to do to solve some of these problems should things become contaminated?

Richart: I don’t know if there’s anything that can be done. There are filters that remove lead from water. It probably depends on what’s there as to how hard it is and how expensive it is. That would be, at the source where people are drinking it, not necessarily where else it is.

One of the things that we’re looking at is the hydrological connection between an aquifer and a stream or a river. What if the CO2 makes it up and then there’s connectivity with the surface water, and what happens to aquatic life? Nobody’s talking about that. All the scientific papers that I’m reading have to do with the geochemical stuff because there’s a concern, especially in some formations, that over time you’ve got this reactive brine and CO2 and the solution becoming acidic. What will that do over time to a rock? What happens when it gets out and into the water, and they can’t claw it back? That’s the problem. Here we are putting all this crap in our atmosphere to begin with. Now we’re going to say, “We’ve got a problem having it in our atmosphere.” We’ve created a crisis, right? Now we’re going to put it underground where we can create another crisis.

SP: With regard to climate change initiatives.

Richart: Yeah. If we’re trying to meet the target — if we’re trying to keep our species alive, let’s put it that way — we’re still relying on fossil fuels. I think that’s something most people aren’t thinking about. Fossil fuel industry interests are for running the power plants harder, building new plants, building the capture equipment. They know how to do that. They also know how to build the pipeline infrastructure. Although the CO2 pipelines are different for all kinds of reasons, are more prone to running ductile fractures, and they’re more sensitive to water because it forms carbonic acid, which means it leaks, which means you’ve got all this stuff going up in the atmosphere, which displaces oxygen and cars won’t run and people will die.

We’ve got a problem. We’ve got to get our greenhouse gases under control. Capturing carbon does nothing for what’s in the atmosphere already. I think most people think it’s taking it out of the atmosphere. It doesn’t do that. It prevents more from going in. It doesn’t take anything out.

To be able to do CCS, you have to have carbon capture equipment and to run that equipment — you have to build it — there’s a whole life cycle analysis that could be done there. To run it, you have to build a whole new power plant where you’re not capturing the emissions. You use all that energy and you release CO2 doing that, or you have to run it longer and harder. So, and the bottom line is you’re keeping the fossil fuel industry going. At a time when we’re saying we cannot afford to put more carbon in the atmosphere, we’re keeping the fossil fuel industry afloat.

SP: It’s not like these power plants are on renewable energy.",https://www.smilepolitely.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/484870910_676253538088478_9107323210054892427_n.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 12:56:25.858348

The initiative aims to position Rotterdam—Europe’s first energy port and a vital hydrogen hub—as the central gateway for transporting green fuels between the two regions.

The agreement outlines collaboration in developing infrastructure for the storage, transportation, and bunkering of hydrogen-based fuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The two parties will assess the infrastructure needs within Rotterdam and along the corridor to Northwest Europe to enable a reliable and efficient supply chain.

A major focus of the partnership is the development of port infrastructure that supports the safe handling and distribution of hydrogen and its derivatives. By connecting India’s emerging Net Zero industrial clusters to Europe, the agreement targets enabling exports of up to 1 million tons of green fuels annually.

The initiative could unlock up to $1 billion in green fuel trade each year between India and Europe, supporting both regions’ decarbonization goals. AM Green is advancing plans to develop 5 million metric tons per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia production capacity by 2030. This volume is equivalent to roughly 1 million tons of green hydrogen. Initial production will begin in Kakinada, India.

Meanwhile, the Port of Rotterdam serves as a crucial energy and logistics hub for Europe, handling about 13% of the continent’s total energy demand. The port plays a strategic role in supporting the European Union’s energy transition and broader climate goals.

Boudewijn Siemons, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam Authority, said the partnership represents a major milestone in building a low-carbon energy supply chain.

“We are delighted to collaborate with AM Green to further strengthen our commitment to the energy transition,” Siemons said. “With India’s vast green hydrogen potential and Rotterdam’s strategic location and infrastructure, this partnership will establish a strong, sustainable energy link between our regions.”

Anil Chalamalasetty, founder of AM Green and the Greenko Group, emphasized the global significance of the agreement.

“This partnership is a key part of our international growth strategy in green fuels, including 5 MTPA of green ammonia and 1 MTPA of SAF,” Chalamalasetty said. “It will enable the seamless movement of green fuels from India to Europe and solidify AM Green’s position as a global clean energy platform.”

The collaboration supports both India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission and Europe’s climate targets, marking a significant step forward in global energy transition efforts.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-27 12:56:29.783121

The two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world have made significant commitments to achieving their sustainability goals in the next five years, and where Airbus and Boeing lead, the rest of the aerospace industry follows.","A closer look at what a sustainable future means for Airbus and Boeing.

Sustainability goals for large enterprises are a bit like fitness goals for individuals: ambitious and well-intentioned, but easily put off in the face of more immediate concerns, such as an all-you-can-eat buffet or an executive compensation package consisting mostly of stock options.

The two largest aerospace companies – Airbus and Boeing – both have lofty goals for reducing their carbon emissions and becoming more sustainable, but many of their targets are set for 2050. To put that in perspective, based on average life expectancy in the United States, anyone reading this article today over the age of 53 is unlikely to be alive to see whether or not those targets are achieved.

Apropos of nothing, the average age of a C-suite executive is 56.

So, rather than looking to the far future, let’s focus on the targets for 2030 and what Airbus and Boeing have committed to achieving in sustainability initiatives over the next five years.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in aerospace

While it’s certainly not the only measure of sustainability, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – particularly CO2 – is frequently a top line item in the sustainability goals of large enterprises. Airbus and Boeing are no exceptions, with both manufacturers setting targets for their Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.

Scope 1: emissions from sources an organization owns or controls directly

Scope 2: emissions caused indirectly as a result of energy purchased for operations

Scope 3: emissions generated as part of an organization’s supply chain

Airbus has stated that it’s aiming to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 63% and Scope 3 emissions by 46% by 2030, using 2015 as its baseline year. Meanwhile, Boeing has stated that it’s aiming to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 using 2017 as its baseline. The company has also pledged to switch to 100% renewable electricity “purchased directly and via renewable energy credits” by 2030.

For Airbus, that amounts to an average reduction of 4.2% per year for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 3.1% per year for Scope 3 emissions. Coincidentally (but probably not), Boeing’s average annual reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions works out to the same amount: 4.2%.

This puts both companies slightly ahead of the targets from the Paris Agreement in 2015, which settled on a 45% reduction (i.e., 3% annually) in GHG emissions globally by 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel

Arguably the most immediately impactful effort Airbus and Boeing can make involves the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a synthetic jet fuel similar to kerosene but made from renewable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and agricultural waste. According to Airbus, SAF can reduce CO2 equivalent emissions by up to 80% on average compared to traditional jet fuel.

Currently, Airbus aircraft can operate a mixture of up to 50% SAF and traditional jet fuel, but the company has committed to being able to operate on 100% SAF by 2030. Meanwhile, Boeing stated in 2024 that its military aircraft can operate on SAF up to an approved 50% blend limit and has similarly committed to all production commercial airplanes being 100% SAF compatible by 2030.

Of course, there’s a big difference between compatibility and implementation, and a 2023 report by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) stated that SAFs accounted for less than 0.1% of all aviation fuels consumed. This may be due, in part, to the fact that SAFs are considerably more expensive than traditional jet fuel – as much as triple the cost, according to some estimates.

Other sustainability efforts in aerospace

Airbus and Boeing have both made a variety of other sustainability commitments. In order of their likelihood to contribute to sustainability over the next five years, these include incorporating recycled parts and materials into new aircraft construction, new propulsion systems that use hydrogen fuel cells or electricity, and investing in carbon capture and storage technologies.

Setting cynicism aside for a moment (with much reluctance), it’s clear that sustainability does matter to the aerospace industry. The two largest aircraft manufacturers in the world have made significant commitments to achieving their sustainability goals in the next five years, and where Airbus and Boeing lead, the rest of the aerospace industry follows. There’s no question that there’s much more that could be done (getting rid of private jets for example) but, hopefully, we’re on the right track to meet our targets for 2030.",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bigstock-Industrial-Blueprint-Of-Airpla-227239771.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 12:56:39.935140

Net-Zero Emission Commitments from Airlines

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a wise move toward a circular economy and more than just a greener way to fly. SAF repurposes resources that would otherwise wind up in landfills by employing waste-based feedstocks such as spent cooking oil, animal fats, agricultural leftovers, and even domestic waste. This addresses actual waste issues and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%. SAF is demonstrating that sustainability in aviation doesn't need to be a thing of the future; it's now gaining traction.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Segmentation

By Fuel Type

The SAF market is segmented by fuel type into biofuel, hydrogen, power-to-liquid, and gas-to-liquid. In 2024, biofuels account for over 85% of the market, driven by technologies like ATJ and HEFA. Power-to-liquid fuels account for around 8%, offering ultra-low emissions. Power-to-liquid fuels, which have extremely low emissions, around 8%. Gas-to-liquid and hydrogen fuel account for around 7%, with GtL being viewed as a transitional alternative and hydrogen as a transitional option.

By Production Technology Type

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is segmented by production technology into FT-SPK (10%), ATJ-SPK (5%), CHJ (2%), HEFA-SPK (75% market share), and Power-to-Liquid (<5%).

The product will be commercially available starting August 10 and represents a significant advancement in sustainable fuel technology for the maritime sector, reported Chemanalyst.

Biofuels have been increasingly adopted in shipping due to their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Made from renewable sources such as used cooking oil and agricultural products like grains, biofuels offer a promising path toward greener maritime operations. However, biofuels also present challenges, primarily because of their high levels of unsaturated fatty acids, which make them more prone to oxidative degradation compared to traditional petroleum fuels.

Oxidation leads to the formation of acids and sludge, which can lower fuel quality, reduce engine efficiency, and cause operational issues such as corrosion, blockages, and fouling in fuel systems. To address these problems, Nippon Yuka developed BioxiGuard after thorough analysis of biofuels used in NYK-operated vessels. This specialized antioxidant improves the oxidative stability of marine biodiesel, slowing degradation and helping maintain fuel performance over time.

Laboratory tests showed that adding BioxiGuard at a ratio of 1 part per 500 reduced oxidative degradation by about 50% compared to untreated fuel. This improvement extends the storage life of biofuel onboard ships and supports more reliable and cost-effective operations.

Beyond BioxiGuard, Nippon Yuka continues to develop advanced solutions to tackle challenges associated with marine biofuels, aiming to help ship operators transition to sustainable fuels without sacrificing safety or efficiency.

The launch of BioxiGuard highlights Nippon Yuka’s commitment to innovation and environmental stewardship.

Project Roadrunner will also provide revenue streams for its oil and gas partners by turning CO2 into a commodity.
A majority of the sustainable aviation fuel that will be produced will be exported, said Schueltze.","Once the site of an airfield that trained pilots during World War II, Pecos, Texas is now home to a new plant producing sustainable aviation fuel.

Infinium, a leading producer of commercially available eFuels, has begun construction of Project Roadrunner in Reeves County, near Pecos. Once in operation in 2027, it is expected to become the world's largest eFuewls production facility, producing 23,000 tonnes per year — 7.6 million gallons — of sustainable aviation fuel and other eFuel products for customers including global aviation leaders American Airlines and IAG, owner of British Airways, Aer Lingus and other international airline brands.

eFuels are synthetic fuels produced from waste CO2 and renewable energy that are chemically identical to conventional petroleum-based fuels.

""We do use waste CO2 as an input and have a great partner in Kinetik Holdings,"" said Robert Schuetzle, Infinium chief executive officer.

Project Roadrunner will also provide revenue streams for its oil and gas partners by turning CO2 into a commodity.

He noted the company has built facilities in West Texas before and found it to be a great experience with a great labor market. Reeves County has also been business-friendly, he added.

The project will create a number of jobs in West Texas. Schuetzle said it will create many construction jobs and jobs for its contractors. Long-term, it will create jobs in operations, maintenance, logistics and field management.

Currently under construction, Roadrunner has secured 150 megawatts of new wind generation capacity from a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources through a long-term power purchase agreement. Schuetzle said Infinium also has the ability to tap into the electric grid so the plant can run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Infinium selected electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen to supply its complete 100-megawatt HYPRPlant solution for the project, which will be integrated on site for green hydrogen production. This large-scale system will not only produce hydrogen for the eSAF facility but will also have the capacity to support future hydrogen offtake opportunities.

Raffi Garabedian, Electric Hydrogen's chief executive officer and co-founder, told the Reporter-Telegram by email this is the company's first announced project with Infinium and a major milestone for its continued presence in Texas.

""We manufacture our electrochemical stacks in Massachusetts and our plant fabrication and assembly take place in Texas — close to project sites like Roadrunner. This allows our regional manufacturing model to support local industry while accelerating national progress toward clean hydrogen deployment,"" he wrote.

He added that the contract highlights his company's technical innovation and focus on bringing down the cost of clean hydrogen. It also demonstrates that U.S. technology can compete globally and deliver at industrial scale to critical sectors like aviation, trucking and maritime transport.

""Clean hydrogen is happening now and it's being deployed at real scale in real projects, like Project Roadrunner in Texas,"" he wrote. ""The hydrogen economy is here, and Texas workers and manufacturers are key contributors to its continued growth.""

A majority of the sustainable aviation fuel that will be produced will be exported, said Schueltze.

""I see us being similar to the way liquefied natural gas grew — an abundant U.S. resource that generates fuel and exports it,"" he said.

Project Roadrunner will produce aviation fuel but will also produce eDiesel, something Amazon uses in its long-haul trucking fleets, and eNaptha that will be shipped to Europe for use in plastics manufacturing.

It is the company's second Texas facility. In 2023, Infinium became the world's first to produce and ship commercial volumes of eFuels to customers in the U.S. and Europe from its production facility, Project Pathfinder, in Corpus Christi. Schuetzle said the company is looking at other Texas sites.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/static/logo/site_logo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=solid&fill-color=&w=1200&h=627",N,,2025-05-27 10:56:33.505425

Outlook: A Sector at a Crossroads Japan’s domestic aviation sector stands at a critical point.
If stakeholders act decisively, Japan’s domestic aviation industry can recover and adapt.","Japan is pushing hard to reform the aviation industry in 2025 with its home-based airlines under increased pressure from sustainability-related expenses, continuous supply chain interruptions, and sustained falling demand for passengers. Aeroplanes from around the country are struggling to meet new environmental regulations—as in, sustainable aviation fuel targets—while also grappling with exploding operating expenses fueled by the devalued yen and restricted access to essential plane components. Concurrently, a dwindling and aging population has decreased demand from within the country, especially in regional markets, to make numerous routes unprofitable. These factors combined have compelled government policymakers and stakeholders to speed policy interventions into a beleaguered Japanese domestic aviation market to stabilize and restructure.

Japan’s domestic aviation sector in 2025 faces significant challenges as it navigates economic instability, demographic decline, and rising regulatory demands. The industry, a core component of the country’s transportation infrastructure, struggles to maintain profitability amid rising costs, labor shortages, and weakening passenger demand.

Carriers across Japan, from major airlines to smaller regional operators, find themselves in a turbulent environment that demands rapid adaptation and strategic reform.

Rising Operational Costs Weaken Profitability

Airlines in Japan are dealing with a surge in operational expenses driven by the yen’s depreciation. As fuel, aircraft maintenance, and leasing costs are largely pegged to stronger foreign currencies, domestic carriers are now spending more to keep operations running.

These increased costs pressure margins, especially on domestic routes where ticket prices remain highly competitive. Airlines struggle to raise fares without losing customers, leading to a squeeze on profitability. At the same time, the financial burden limits their ability to invest in new aircraft, advanced technologies, or improved service offerings.

Shrinking and Aging Population Dampens Demand

Japan’s shrinking and aging population continues to shrink the market for domestic air travel. The population fell from 128.5 million in 2010 to about 122.6 million in 2024, and the trend shows no signs of reversal.

Fewer working-age individuals mean fewer business travelers, while the rise in elderly residents reduces demand for frequent travel. Regional routes, which serve smaller cities and rural areas, have seen a significant drop in passenger numbers. These routes become increasingly unsustainable as airlines struggle to fill seats and maintain regular schedules.

Domestic Routes Struggle with Long-Term Profitability

Domestic flights in Japan often operate at a loss. Larger carriers typically rely on international routes to generate profit while absorbing losses from their domestic networks. This strategy has become increasingly fragile as global travel patterns shift post-pandemic.

Without a sharp increase in fares or deep cost reductions, analysts warn that major airlines could face serious losses. The current network model no longer guarantees financial sustainability, especially as demand plateaus and operating expenses rise.

Geopolitical Issues and Supply Disruptions Add Pressure

Global tensions and supply chain disruptions have added new complications. The ongoing closure of Russian airspace has forced airlines to reroute flights to Europe and North America, raising fuel consumption and costs. Though these are international challenges, they impact overall airline budgets, affecting domestic operations as well.

Meanwhile, global supply shortages make it difficult to source aircraft parts, upgrade fleets, or carry out routine maintenance. Airlines now operate with greater uncertainty, as they wait longer for equipment and face higher prices across the board.

Green Targets Introduce New Financial Burdens

Japan’s national goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 requires its airlines to adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and reduce carbon footprints. By 2030, carriers must replace 10% of their fuel consumption with SAF.

This transition comes at a high price. SAF is significantly more expensive than traditional jet fuel, and newer low-emission aircraft require costly investments. For many regional carriers, these green mandates represent an existential challenge as they struggle to meet environmental goals without compromising their financial stability.

Workforce Shortages Threaten Operations

A nationwide labor shortage further threatens the sector. Airlines lack pilots, technicians, and ground staff, as the workforce continues to age and younger professionals avoid aviation careers.

Layoffs during the pandemic broke the talent pipeline, leaving gaps in training and recruitment. Airlines now scramble to attract skilled workers and keep operations running smoothly. This shortage impacts flight schedules, service quality, and the overall passenger experience.

Opportunities Emerge Despite Uncertainty

Despite these headwinds, opportunities exist. Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has launched a task force to develop policies that address systemic weaknesses and support long-term recovery.

Technology could also play a vital role. AI-driven route optimization, predictive maintenance, and fuel-efficient aircraft offer cost-saving potential. Government incentives for regional travel and subsidies for remote areas may also help airlines maintain routes that are currently unprofitable.

Outlook: A Sector at a Crossroads

Japan’s domestic aviation sector stands at a critical point. Airlines must navigate a complex mix of economic, demographic, and environmental challenges while preparing for an uncertain future.

Japan is advancing aviation sector reform in 2025 as domestic airlines struggle with rising sustainability compliance costs, disrupted access to aircraft components, and declining passenger demand caused by an aging, shrinking population. These combined pressures have made many domestic routes financially unsustainable, prompting urgent policy action.

The path forward requires policy reform, innovation, and strategic investment. Airlines must restructure operations, adopt new technologies, and balance sustainability with financial stability.

If stakeholders act decisively, Japan’s domestic aviation industry can recover and adapt. But without immediate action, the sector risks further erosion of its operational capacity and market relevance.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-27T123941473.jpg,N,,2025-05-27 09:56:37.580967
