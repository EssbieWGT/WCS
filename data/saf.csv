Europe’s early lead in the e-kerosene market has been driven by the EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels, ReFuelEU, which set specific targets for using e-fuels in aviation.
Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential.
Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail.
Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs.","A new T&E study shows that Europe can be a leader in e-kerosene (also called e-SAF), housing more than half of the world’s announced production capacity. Around 40 large-scale projects [1] are planned in Europe, with a potential e-kerosene production capacity of close to 3 million tonnes (Mt) per year – roughly 5% of the fuel that Europe’s aviation sector needs to operate.

Europe’s early lead in the e-kerosene market has been driven by the EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels, ReFuelEU, which set specific targets for using e-fuels in aviation. If all the announced projects were built, the EU could meet these targets – but none of the large-scale plants identified in this report are even under construction. Only four are at an advanced stage [2], and none have reached a final investment decision (FID). This slow progress is due to an array of challenges, with financing posing the biggest barrier, and traditional fuel suppliers being notably absent from the conversation.

Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential. Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

Despite favourable conditions, e-kerosene projects continue to face significant hurdles in Europe, including challenges related to energy costs, infrastructure, and CO₂ sourcing. Regulatory uncertainty is also in the mix, brought about by industry pressure [6] to delay ReFuelEU’s SAF targets in anticipation of the scheduled review of the legislation in 2027

Financing poses the biggest barrier, with each plant requiring €1–2 billion in capital, bringing total capital requirements to €10 - 20 billion by 2030. EU funding mechanisms for e-kerosene are not strong enough to support the level of investment needed to get these projects off the ground, and traditional fuel suppliers are notably absent from the conversation. To date, major oil companies have made negligible contributions to e-kerosene, while continuing to spend billions on fossil fuels.

“Despite their huge financial capacity, major oil companies are largely absent from the e-kerosene market,” Camile Mutrelle acknowledged. “Startups have taken the lead, but lack the internal resources to finance the capital-intensive infrastructure that is urgently needed. Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs. The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a chance to set the right flight path by prioritising e-SAF, providing a comprehensive mechanism to address the challenges EU projects face.”

T&E urges EU leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the existing ReFuelEU targets, especially in the run-up to the legislation’s scheduled review, and prioritise e-kerosene in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). It also calls for a European market intermediary using a double-sided auction mechanism to be established to address the current issues around financing.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/header-images-te-1.png?mtime=1749716016,N,,2025-06-15 19:59:08.522798

Charles requested the symbolic moves “as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy,” Buckingham Palace said.

An Air India flight from the northwestern city of Ahmedabad to London crashed shortly after takeoff on Thursday, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. The plane was carrying 169 Indians, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian. One man survived.

In addition to being Britain’s head of state, Charles is the head of the Commonwealth, an organization of independent states that includes India and Canada.

The monarch’s annual birthday parade, known as Trooping the Colour, is a historic ceremony filled with pageantry and military bands in which the king reviews his troops on Horse Guards Parade adjacent to St. James’ Park in central London.

The military ceremony dates back to a time when flags of the battalion, known as colours, were ""trooped,'' or shown, to soldiers in the ranks so they could recognize them.

Charles, wearing a scarlet military uniform, traveled to Horse Guards Parade in an open-topped, horse-drawn carriage accompanied by Queen Camilla.

Aviation accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions and is difficult to decarbonise.

A push to replace fossil fuel with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) is raising the prospect of a new market for the Australian-grown oilseed.

Canola, known for its pretty yellow flowers, is harvested in grain-growing regions around the country, with the majority exported to Europe for biofuel production.

Liquid fuel made from canola

Australian-owned fuel company Ampol, publicly-listed GrainCorp, and industry super fund IFM Investors are working on a plan to refine canola oil in Australia for use in the aviation industry.

Subject to a feasibility study, GrainCorp expects to establish a canola crush with capacity to process 1 million tonnes a year, almost twice the capacity of its existing crush at Numurkah in northern Victoria.

It hasn't identified a site for the prospective crush yet, but Western Australia or New South Wales are the more likely options.

Canola meal would be extracted for use as livestock feed and the oil transported to Ampol's Brisbane refinery, to be manufactured into a renewable diesel and processed into SAF.

Brent Merrick, a general manager at Ampol, said the project would require a multi-billion-dollar investment but could come to market relatively quickly.

""Our plan is to aim for the sort of 2030 time range for production, and engineering is well underway,"" Mr Merrick said.

""It is a big deal, it is exciting,"" he said.

Industry seeks assistance

Before the canola-fed fuel business gets the green light, project managers are seeking federal government assistance.

""The cost of SAF today is more expensive than jet fuel, so we need some temporary support to stand up this industry and get it going,"" GrainCorp general manager nutrition and energy, Don Campbell, told Landline.

""How much? That's what we're working on.""

Assistance could include mandates for airlines to use a certain percentage of renewable fuel, subsidies for start-up costs associated with manufacturing, and help to ensure the final product meets global emissions reduction certification standards.

Australian airlines already using SAF

Last month Qantas imported close to 2 million litres of SAF from Malaysia, enough so that once it is blended it will fly the equivalent of 900 flights between Sydney and Auckland.

Last year the federal government committed more than $30 million for the development of an SAF industry using renewable feedstock.

It included $8 million for Ampol and $6 million for GrainCorp.

Speaking at GrainCorp's Newcastle port facility at the time of the funding announcement, Transport Minister Catherine King said establishing a low-carbon liquid fuel industry in Australia made sense.

""These are things we should be making here in Australia. It's good for farmers, it's good for our manufacturing sector, it's good for sectors like GrainCorp.""

Earlier this year, the government also announced $250 million from its Future Made in Australia Fund would be provided as grants to accelerate a domestic low-carbon liquid fuels industry.

SAF would boost economy, fuel security

The CSIRO has estimated an Australian low-carbon liquid fuel industry, reliant on a variety of technologies and feedstock, could contribute up to $12 billion a year to the economy.

Zach Whale, a spokesperson for the farm lobby group GrainGrowers, believes much of that benefit would be felt in regional communities.

""If demand does really spike, we don't anticipate every farmer turning away from wheat and chickpeas and barley.

""We think canola will just remain a mainstay, but with greater domestic demand and hopefully favourable pricing for our growers.""

Food and fuel, or food vs fuel

CSIRO senior research scientist Cathryn O'Sullivan said SAF made from a variety of feedstock, including tallow, sugar and canola, needed to be certified to ensure any carbon abatement stacked up.

""We need really strong sustainability measures and metrics to make sure that we get that balance right between food and fuel and carbon abatement in these systems,"" Dr O'Sullivan said.

""I don't really consider [it] a roadblock, but it's a factor that needs to be considered in making sure these things are sustainable, and they don't compete with our food system.""

She said canola was a good example as it produced fuel and food.

""Our canola gets crushed and the oil can go into human consumption or it can go into fuel production, and the remaining canola meal that's left over goes into animal feed, so from one product you're getting both food and fuel,"" Dr O'Sullivan said.

Mr Whale said a canola-fed SAF sector would not come at the detriment of food production.

King Charles’ actual birthday is November 14, but Trooping of the Color has always been held in June.

For the third year in a row, Prince Harry and his family were absent from the event.

Prince William and Princess Catherine put up a family picture from the day on their Instagram account, writing, “Another brilliant day at Trooping the Colour for His Majesty’s Birthday Parade. Thank you to everybody who came, and to all those who took part.”

The Royal Family Instagram account also posted a video of the day, but made no mention of Harry and Meghan’s absence. The caption reads, “👏 A huge thank you to our Military personnel for a truly triumphant Trooping today!

Over 1,000 soldiers, around 200 horses and approximately 300 musicians came together in a display of Military precision, horsemanship and fanfare to mark The King’s official birthday.",https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-92.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 18:59:05.897885

CFM LEAP-1A The LEAP engine was first introduced in 2016 with the -1A variant that has been used exclusively for the Airbus A320neo family (including the A321XLR).
Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM The Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM is part of the PW1000G family.
Boeing did not need such a powerful LEAP family engine as the A321XLR because the aircraft has a much lower range and is smaller across all variants.
The greater weight means the 757-200 is powered by the more powerful Rolls-Royce RB211-535-E4(B) or Pratt & Whitney PW2000-37/40/43, producing up to 43,500 lbf.","Developed from the A321neo, the A321XLR is an upgraded aircraft that delivers a range of up to 4,700 nautical miles, allowing for non-stop flights of up to 11 hours. It can carry up to 244 passengers. This range is 1,200 nautical miles more than the A321neo and 700 nautical miles more than the A321LR.

The increased range requires the A321XLR to have substantially larger fuel tanks than the other aircraft in its family. It can carry up to 8,700 US gallons (32,940 liters) of fuel compared to the A321neo's 6,205–8,679 US gallons (23,490–32,853 liters). As a result, this aircraft has the highest maximum takeoff weight of its family at 223,000 lbs. However, it uses the same engines as the A321neo and A321LR. Discover in this article how much power output this aircraft's powerplant can achieve.

The Airbus A321XLR's Powerplant

The A321XLR is powered by the same engines as the rest of the A321neo family. Carriers can choose between the CFM LEAP-1A and the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM. These engines mean that the A321XLR has access to between 32,160–33,110 lbf (143.05–147.28 kN) of thrust.

The two engines achieve similar levels of thrust and facilitate the A321neo family's fuel burn efficiency enhancements. However, they emerge from different philosophies on how to achieve over 30,000 lbf efficiently. The table below breaks down the A321XLR's key specifications:

Pratt & Whitney's innovative technologies have been utilized to develop an efficient engine architecture for enhanced propulsive efficiency. This centers on their use of a geared turbofan, allowing the fan and turbine to operate at different speeds. In a conventional turbofan, they are locked at the same speed, while it is often more efficient for the fan to rotate more slowly.

Meanwhile, CFM's LEAP family of engines focuses on improving thermal efficiency, allowing them to operate at a more optimal temperature. The following sections give further details on the A321XLR's engine options.

CFM LEAP-1A

The LEAP engine was first introduced in 2016 with the -1A variant that has been used exclusively for the Airbus A320neo family (including the A321XLR). A year later, CFM International introduced the -1B used as the exclusive engine option for the Boeing 737 MAX. The final variant is the -1C, used as the exclusive option for the Comac C919. This variant was introduced in May 2023, with the engine family the result of a long-running joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines.

The family is the successor to the CFM56, and it has leveraged modern advancements to enhance the engine's efficiency and reduce emissions. Architecturally, the engine uses a scaled-down version of the low-pressure turbine developed for the GE GEnx (787 Dreamliner and 747-8). CFM International has used composite materials for the fan blades that untwist under load for enhanced aerodynamic efficiency, and ceramic matrix composites that achieve high temperature resistance at a lower weight.

This combination of design decisions and materials technology advancements has led to a 16% fuel consumption reduction compared with eCFM56 engines. When announcing the LEAP family, Eric Bachelet (CFM president and CEO), said:

""When we launched the LEAP56 technology development program in 2005, fuel was at $1.30 a gallon. Today, airlines are paying nearly $4.00 a gallon. Our customers are hurting and we are responding. We have set aggressive targets for this engine, and the technology plan is in place to achieve them.""

Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM

The Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM is part of the PW1000G family. Other variants, including active and proposed engines, include the PW14000G (Yakovlev MC-21, but exports halted due to the War in Ukraine), PW1500G (A220 family), PW1900G (E-Jet E2), and the experimental but canceled PW102XG (Boeing X-66).

The PW1000G family's innovation focuses on the concept of a geared turbofan. The large front fan can rotate slower than the turbine, improving efficiency. Pratt & Whitney claims this advancement is a 16% improvement in fuel efficiency and a 75% reduction in noise pollution. The table below outlines the PW1100G engine family's key specifications:

Geared turbofans could revolutionize the aviation industry. Research conducted by Kevin Cullinane for his book Airline Economics in Europe found that a Pratt & Whitney GTF-powered turbofan would result in savings of $29 million over 12 years compared to the Boeing 737-800. The drastic noise reductions offered by geared turbofans may also challenge the necessity of flying curfews at busy airports like Sydney Kingsford Smith and London Heathrow.

How Do Boeing's Aircraft Compare?

There is not currently a directly comparable Boeing aircraft that combines next-gen efficiency advancements with a relatively long range for a narrow-body aircraft. The 737 MAX and 757 offer potential points of comparison in terms of powerplant output. The 737 MAX is noteworthy in this discussion because it also uses an engine from the CFM International Leap family. It uses a similar but smaller LEAP-1B powerplant. This engine has a fan diameter of 69.4 inches and can produce 26,786–29,317 lbf (119–130 kN).

Boeing did not need such a powerful LEAP family engine as the A321XLR because the aircraft has a much lower range and is smaller across all variants. This means that even the largest variant (737 MAX 10) has a lower maximum takeoff weight of 197,900 lb (89,800 kg) compared to the A321XLR's 213,800–222,700 lb. The table below compares key statistics for the LEAP-1A (A321XLR) and LEAP-1B (737 MAX).

The A321XLR may also compete with the Boeing 757, a narrowbody airliner. The 757-200 variant has a range of 3,915 nautical miles, far less than the A321XLR, but more than the 737 MAX and enough to compete in the medium-to long-haul market. This aircraft is larger, with a length of 155ft 3 in to the A321XLR's 146 ft. Moreover, its less efficient engines require more fuel-per-mile. The 757-200's fuel capacity is 11,489 US gal (43,490 L) compared to the A321XLR's 9,613 US gal - 10,437 US gal (36,390-39,511 L).

Therefore, the 757-200s maximum takeoff weight is 255,000 lb compared to the A321XLR's 213,800–222,700 lbs. The greater weight means the 757-200 is powered by the more powerful Rolls-Royce RB211-535-E4(B) or Pratt & Whitney PW2000-37/40/43, producing up to 43,500 lbf.

A Modestly Successful Variant

According to Reuters, Airbus has sold over 500 A321XLRs, constituting a modest success, showing that the choice of Pratt & Whitney and CFM International engines for the powerplant was a good one. It has exceeded the expectations of some detractors who were concerned that narrow-bodied aircraft would not be comfortable enough for long-haul flying. Carsten Spohr, the Lufthansa CEO, named the A321XLR a ""niche"" product, arguing that passengers should not be asked to sit in a narrowbody aircraft for over four hours.

It certainly isn't only ""niche"" airlines that have invested heavily in the A321XLR. United Airlines made a firm order for 50 A321XLRs in December 2019. This purchase was valued at $7.1 billion ($142 million per aircraft) before the inevitable discounts are applied. Speaking to CNBC, Scott Kirby, United's CEO, teased what destinations might be served by the aircraft:

""Smaller cities in Europe and North Africa that we’ll be able to fly the airplane [to] out of Newark.""

However, the A321XLR is still relatively new to the market. The aircraft received its type certificate from the EASA on 19 July 2024 and the FAA on 2 October 2024. The aircraft conducted its first revenue flight on 6 November 2024 and first long-haul flight with passengers on 14 November 2024.

Furthermore, only a handful of the hundreds of ordered A321XLRs have been delivered, with Iberia being the first airline to receive the jet. All this points to an aircraft that will be interesting to watch over the coming years to see how the airlines that have invested hundreds of millions into it will perform. It will also be fascinating to see whether the Pratt & Whitney or CFM International engine option becomes more popular.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/this-is-how-powerful-the-airbus-a321xlr-is.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 18:00:33.962633

Despite manufacturing delays, Algeria’s national airline prepares to modernize its fleet, expand global routes, and lead regional sustainability efforts through a bold strategic transition in aviation.

─────────────◆─────────────

Algiers, Algeria | June 15th, 2025 — In a major announcement that underscores a transformative phase for Algeria’s aviation sector, Air Algérie CEO Hamza Benhamouda confirmed on Saturday that the airline will begin receiving new aircraft starting September 2025. The delivery, initially expected in June, was delayed due to supply chain disruptions and global manufacturing setbacks largely attributed to the post-COVID aviation crisis.

Speaking on the sidelines of the International Conference on Sustainability in Civil Aviation in Algiers, Benhamouda reaffirmed the airline’s strategic objective to become a regional aviation hub, in line with President Abdelmadjid Tebboune’s vision. The fleet expansion plan—comprising 15 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus—is designed to bolster the national carrier’s international competitiveness and operational capacity.

Global Supply Crisis Delays Delivery Timeline

Benhamouda attributed the delay to international bottlenecks affecting both aircraft manufacturers and interior equipment suppliers. Despite the setbacks, the CEO assured that the revised delivery schedule will not derail Air Algérie’s expansion goals.

The delivery plan is expected to unlock a wave of new air routes across Africa, Asia, and Europe throughout 2025 and 2026, with two new lines to Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Guangzhou (China) expected to launch before the end of 2025.

Commitment to Sustainable Fuel and Carbon Reduction

Air Algérie is simultaneously pushing forward with a bold energy transition strategy, announcing plans to begin operating aircraft using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at selected international airports. The use of SAF within Algerian airports, however, will be contingent upon the completion of local production infrastructure, which is currently under development.

Benhamouda stated: “Air Algérie aims to be a continental leader in aviation energy transition. We are no longer operating under business as usual—we are building a new model centered on carbon efficiency, innovation, and long-term ecological responsibility.”

The airline’s five-axis sustainability roadmap includes:

Modernizing flight operations for greater energy efficiency

Greening its infrastructure and enhancing operational energy performance

Embracing digital transformation to reduce waste and boost transparency

Integrating sustainable fuel alternatives

Implementing circular waste management systems across all service sectors

A Domestic Subsidiary on the Horizon

Benhamouda also revealed plans to launch a new subsidiary dedicated exclusively to domestic air transport, a move aligned with the national transport strategy initiated in 2019. The roadmap for the subsidiary is complete and will be unveiled in the coming weeks. Domestic air traffic has grown by more than 25% between 2019 and 2024, highlighting a renewed focus on regional connectivity.

Geopolitical Tensions and Route Adjustments

Addressing the impact of regional instability, the CEO confirmed the temporary suspension of flights to Amman (Jordan) due to security concerns in the Middle East. However, he clarified that flights to other destinations in the region remain unaffected and will continue as scheduled.

Algeria’s Environmental Leadership Recognized

During the conference, Minister of Environment Nadjiba Djilali praised Air Algérie for being one of the first African airlines to comply with the CORSIA protocol (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), describing the airline as a model of regional climate responsibility.

Hassan Boulfelfel, Director General of the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), called for urgent investments in SAF production, the modernization of the national fleet, and adherence to international environmental standards. He warned that starting in 2027, non-compliance with global sustainability norms will be subject to financial penalties.

The high-level conference—held under the theme “Sustainability in Mindsets for a Greener Sky”—brought together key government officials, including Minister of Transport Saïd Sayoud, Major General Abdelhafidh Bakhouche, Benhamouda, Djilali, and Boulfelfel, alongside international experts and aviation executives.

Scientific panels and expert-led workshops provided a platform for showcasing innovative solutions and actionable strategies, reinforcing a collective resolve to institutionalize sustainability across all facets of Algerian air transport.

Lawmakers had their work cut out for them during a 21-hour special session, debating and passing 14 key bills before the deadline to avoid a partial July 1 government shutdown. With a tied House (67 Republicans, 67 Democrats) and a one-seat Democratic majority in the Senate, negotiations were particularly sensitive, requiring bipartisan cooperation.

While the budget addressed immediate financial concerns, it also set the stage for ongoing debates over health care, taxation and economic policy in the 2026 Minnesota Legislative Session before the November 2026 elections.

The passage of the bills Monday caps a year that started with a power struggle and Democratic boycott in the House, and ended with missed deadlines that necessitated the Legislature needing to return to the Capitol to finish the job.

The Minnesota Soybean Growers Association celebrated legislative wins, including protecting crop inputs, but lamented missed policy opportunities that could’ve boosted a struggling ag economy.

“This session was a bit of a mixed bag,” said Joe Smentek, MSGA executive director. “We’re frustrated by the inability for lawmakers to work together to better the environment for Minnesota soybean farmers. However, we were pleased to see many of our priorities included in the ag bill and we extend our appreciation to Ag Committee leaders on both sides of the aisle for working in good faith to help farmers, who contribute to one of Minnesota’s top economic industries.”

Special session takeaways

Environmental and Natural Resources Omnibus Bill (2025 Legislative Special Session)

Following a strong advocacy push throughout the session by MSGA and fellow ag groups, the 2025 Minnesota legislative special session did not include any new restrictions or bans on pesticides, fertilizers or seeds, despite discussions on environmental policy. While some lawmakers pushed for stronger regulations on pesticide-treated seeds and groundwater contamination, the final bill maintained existing agricultural policies without imposing additional limitations.

The session focused primarily on budget negotiations, tax adjustments and infrastructure funding, leaving agricultural regulations unchanged. This decision reflects a balance between environmental concerns and industry interests, ensuring farmers can continue using current agricultural practices without new legislative hurdles.

“We’re very pleased to see that our advocacy efforts to protect those tools were successful,” said Darin Johnson, who delivered a “State of Soy” report to the Senate Ag Committee early in the session.

Bonding (2025 Legislative Special Session)

The agreements, which focused on transportation and water infrastructure, would fund those projects and more with about a net $700 million, including more than $646 million in proceeds from bond sales, $73 million from the transportation fund and $6.5 million in cash. Cancellations from previous appropriations help lower the overall total.

• $44 million for natural resources purposes, including $33 million for asset preservation and $9 million for flood hazard mitigation

• $60 million in asset preservation for both Minnesota State and the University of Minnesota

The Legislature last passed a bonding bill in 2023 to the tune of $2.6 billion. The House approved a $71 million cash-only bill in 2024, but the Senate did not.

Tax Bill (2025 Legislative Special Session): MSGA earns partial SAF win

One of the top priorities in the biofuels space for MSGA during the 2025 legislative session, including during Hill Visits, was the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) tax incentive program, which would boost demand for Minnesota soybeans. Executive Director Joe Smentek testified in multiple hearings about not only the need to extend and expand the program, but even more importantly, get the details right on how SAF is incentivized to be produced.

MSGA and others helped build a strong bipartisan coalition of supporters, including Gov. Walz, Senate Tax Chair Ann Rest, House GOP Tax Co-Chair Greg Davids and all four legislative caucus leaders. This work showed in the release of the Senate Omnibus Tax Bill, which included the following SAF-related provisions:

• Modifies the definition of SAF to further specify how biomass must be produced

• Moves the effective date of the previous funding for SAF

• Allows qualifying taxpayers to claim a supplemental tax credit equal to 2 cents per gallon for each additional whole percentage of carbon intensity reduction beyond 50 percent, up to 50 cents per gallon

• Increased the allocation limits for credit certificates in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 from $2.1 million to $7.4 million and extends the credit through 2035

• Allows unallocated funds from each fiscal year to be available in the following fiscal year

• Extends the expiration date from 2030 to 2035

As budget negotiations continued, opposition in the House DFL caucus meant that the majority of these provisions had to be taken out. In the initial leadership agreement, every SAF tax provision was removed. MSGA and others worked hard to at least get the carry forward of the previous appropriation included in the final special session deal. While we are disappointed that we did not get any of the expanded language that Joe Smentek and others worked so hard to negotiate, getting the carry forward language saved the program and allows us to fight another day.

The bills now await Gov. Walz’s signature. With the special session completed, MSGA and its lobbying team will continue engaging with lawmakers and agency leaders on our policy priorities.

“We look forward to meeting at Farmfest with lawmakers and candidates to continue promoting our priorities, from SAF to tax reform to diversifying our markets,” Johnson said.

The 2026 session begins Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026.

Sustainable aviation fuel industry looks for trans-Tasman takeoff

The King has celebrated his official birthday with an eco-friendly flypast by the Red Arrows and remembered all those killed in the Air India plane disaster.

Trooping the Colour was a display of military pomp and pageantry but Charles asked for the traditional programme to include a minute’s silence, and for senior royals and officers taking part to wear black armbands as a mark of respect.

When the royal family gathered later on Buckingham Palace’s balcony they acknowledged the crowds and watched an aerial display of vintage and modern aircraft with the Red Arrows’ finale powered by a blend of sustainable aviation fuel.

The world-famous aerobatic team also used vegetable oil to produce their trademark red, white and blue vapour trails over the royal residence – believed to be a first.

Trooping, also known as the King’s Birthday Parade, fell silent after Charles had inspected hundreds of troops on Whitehall’s Horse Guards Parade from a carriage with the Queen by his side.

The moment of reflection acknowledged the aviation disaster on Thursday that killed 241 passengers and crew, including more than 50 British nationals, and around 30 people on the ground.

Charles led the royal colonels in wearing black armbands, with the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, Princess Royal, Colonel Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Colonel Scots Guards, all wearing bands on their left arms.

Young royals delighted monarchy fans by making an appearance, with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis riding in a carriage with their mother Kate.

George, Charlotte and Louis joined other members of the royal family, including the Duchess of Edinburgh in the former office of the Duke of Wellington, to watch the spectacle in honour of their grandfather the King.

Kate took her place next to the King and Queen on the dais, in her role as Colonel of the Irish Guards – a symbolic position and one she was unable to take up last year because she was receiving cancer treatment, and instead watched the ceremony with her children.

Trooping the Colour is as much a social occasion as a ceremonial celebration, and stands around Horse Guards Parade were filled with around 8,000 wives, girlfriends and parents of the guardsmen and officers on parade.

The colour – or regimental flag – being trooped this year was the King’s Colour of Number 7 Company, Coldstream Guards, also known as the sovereign’s bodyguard, which is celebrating its 375th anniversary.

The minute’s silence was observed when Charles and Camilla returned to the dais, following an announcement to the spectators and a bugler sounding the Last Post.

During the pageantry, the colour was first trooped through the ranks of soldiers before the guardsmen marched past the King, first in slow then in quick time, with Charles acknowledging the command of “eyes right” with a salute.

Lieutenant Max Martin, 24, who carried the regimental flag at the heart of the ceremony, said: “The King’s Colour emphasises and symbolises everything that has ever gone before in the Coldstream Guards.

“The gold embroidered silk of the flag is physically heavy, especially in the flourish, but the symbolic weight is heavier still.

“It bears 44 of our 113 battle honours: the achievements and sacrifices of countless generations of our forebears.”

Thousands lined the royal procession route from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade where Trooping was staged.

A group of activists from the anti-monarchy group Republic staged a “not my King” protest.

During the fly-past Louis, who was dressed in an identical red tie and suit outfit as older brother George, was seen chatting to his father, William, and waving to the crowds.

The sustainable display be the Red Arrows is in keeping with Charles decades long support for sustainability and climate action.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was not involved in the decision but was “delighted” because he has been encouraging use of the fuel on royal flights where practical and hopes the example will lead to wider use across the aviation sector.

In the sweet snap posted on Instagram, Prince Wiliam and Catherine pose with their three children George, 11, Charlotte, ten and Louis, seven.

'Another brilliant day at Trooping the Colour for His Majesty's Birthday Parade,' the caption read. 'Thank you to everybody who came, and to all those that took part.'

Catherine, 43, looked resplendent in an aquamarine coat dress from her late mother-in-law Princess Diana's favourite designer Catherine Walker - complete with a wide-brimmed hat by Juliette Botterill.

The mother-of-three accessorised with the Irish Guards regimental brooch as well as the Bahrain Pearl Drop earrings in a sweet tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II.

They were crafted from pearls gifted to the Queen and Philip from the ruler of Bahrain at the time of their wedding in 1947.

Her mini-me daughter Charlotte also paid tribute to the late monarch by rewearing the Diamond Horseshoe brooch she wore to her great-grandmother's funeral.

The brooch, which has been in the Royal Family for generations, had been a gift from her 'Gan-Gan' the Queen, and was a fitting nod to Her Majesty's love of horses.

Meanwhile, the boys, George and Louis, wore matching suits with striking red ties to match their father's scarlet military tunic.

The King, 76, and Queen Camilla, 77, led the royal appearances on Saturday as they watched a flypast involving aircraft including the Red Arrows, Chinook helicopters and a Lancaster bomber, a model that was used during World War II.

But it was the Wales Family - particularly little Prince Louis - who stole the show on the Buckingham Palace balcony where they were joined by the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, as well as the Princess Royal and Sir Timothy Laurence.

The late Queen's cousin the Duke of Gloucester and his wife also watched the flypast, alongside Prince Michael of Kent.

Cheeky Prince Louis captured the hearts of the nation once again as he waved to the gathered crowds with a large beaming smile.

Earlier, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were seen bowing their heads in respect as the royal family led a minute's silence to remember the 270 people so far known to have been killed in the Air India disaster.

Prince William and Catherine's children watched on from a nearby balcony after taking part in the Trooping the Colour parade from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guard's Parade while their parents carried out official roles during the ceremony.

Led by a regal Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, the youngsters joined the rest of the royals in a quiet moment of reflection to remember the lives lost in the disaster.

Fans gathered early on the Mall on Saturday and braved the rain while hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal family. A small group of protesters carrying placards reading 'Not my King' was also in attendance.

The procession was led by a carriage carrying the Duchess of Edinburgh and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, ahead of a second in which the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will travel.

The Prince of Wales, Princess Royal and the Duke of Edinburgh followed behind on horseback.

It is the first time Princess Anne has ridden in public since she suffered a head injury, thought to be caused by a horse, at her home last year.

While Prince William rode on horseback, the Princess of Wales travelled down the Mall in an Ascot Landau seated beside her daughter Princess Charlotte, while Prince George and Prince Louis sat opposite.

Alongside the Princess Royal, Colonel Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Colonel Scots Guards, the Prince of Wales wore a black armband in remembrance of those killed in the Air India plane crash on Thursday.

King Charles requested a minute's silence to be held during the ceremony in tribute to the 241 passengers and crew killed when a Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for Gatwick Airport came down on Thursday in the Indian city of Ahmedabad.

Some 53 Brits were onboard the doomed flight - all but one are believed to have been killed, along with dozens on the ground bringing the final death toll to at least 270.

Following the procession, the King, who is receiving cancer treatment, and Queen were seen waving and smiling as they made their way down the Mall in an open-top carriage before the national anthem was played.

Camilla wore a white silk crepe dress with silver embroidery by Anna Valentine with a hat by Philip Treacy and a Grenadier Guards brooch.

After arriving at Horse Guard Parade, Catherine took her place next to the King and Queen on the dais, in her role as Colonel of the Irish Guards - a symbolic position and one she was unable to take up last year because she was receiving cancer treatment and instead watched the ceremony with her children.

A minute's silence was then held to remember all the victims of this week's Air India disaster.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Charles requested amendments to the Trooping the Colour programme 'as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy'.

The King issued a written message soon after the plane crash, saying he was 'desperately shocked by the terrible events' and expressed his 'deepest possible sympathy'.

Posting on social media ahead of the ceremony this morning, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: 'Sending my best wishes to His Majesty The King today at Trooping the Colour. God Save The King.'

The occasion transforms the Mall as crowds line up the streets waving flags as 1400 soldiers parade alongside 200 horses and 400 musicians from Horse Guards Parade to Buckingham Palace.

After the Trooping ceremony is over, the Royal Family made their group appearance on the Palace balcony before the day concluded with a flypast.

Today, the Red Arrows made history when they used sustainable fuel and vegetable oil for their flypast over London for The King's birthday.

Jets from the world-famous aerobatic display team were powered by a blend of sustainable aviation fuel, and used the vegetable oil to produce their trademark vapour trails.

It follows groundbreaking trials by RAF engineers and logisticians.

All nine of the team's British-built Hawk fast-jets were topped up with a high-ratio blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the team's home base of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, before they set off, in what is thought to be a world's first.

Charles has been championing sustainability and climate action since before he ascended the throne.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was not involved in the decision but was 'delighted' because he has been encouraging use of the fuel on royal flights where practical and hopes the example will lead to wider use across the aviation sector.

Squadron leader Andy King, the Red Arrows' senior engineering officer who led the project, said: 'Ever since the Red Arrows' first display in 1965, the team has aimed to inspire future generations and represent the best of British. Using this technology is the latest example of our relentless pursuit of excellence.'

He continued: 'The flypast for His Majesty The King is the perfect opportunity to showcase this innovation.

'The vibrant vapour trails that we generate is what sets the Red Arrows apart and so to be the first aerobatic team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.'

Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard, said: 'The iconic Red Arrows are one of the world's premier aerobatic display teams and by adopting a more environmentally friendly sustainable aviation fuel, the Royal Air Force is blazing a trail as part of our work to combat climate change.'

The Red Arrows' 2025 season runs until October, with 60 shows planned across the UK and mainland Europe.

As a former polo player and one of the Royal Family's most accomplished equestrians, King Charles rode for years in the parade - both for his mother's official birthday celebrations and then for his own.

But he did not appear on horseback at the event this weekend and instead travelled in a carriage for the procession from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade and back.

Trooping the Colour is a centuries-old tradition that marks the Sovereign's official birthday.

It dates back to the 17th century and is rooted in battlefield custom, when regimental flags, or 'colours,' were trooped in front of soldiers to ensure they could be recognised amid the smoke of combat.

Last week a full-dress rehearsal, known as The Colonel's Review, took place serving as the final run-through before the King's official celebration.

This year, the honour of trooping the Colour falls to the Coldstream Guards, who will officially present their regimental flag, known as the Colour, to King Charles.

As expected, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle did not attend this year's celebrations.

Having chosen to walk away from being working royals, they have not been present at Trooping the Colour since 2019.

The other notable absentee was Prince Andrew, who remains exiled from public royal events amid the fallout from his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein and the claims made by late accuser Virginia Giuffre.

Andrew's daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are not expected to be there either amid Charles' desire for a slimmed-down monarchy and to keep the focus on working royals.

Queen Elizabeth attended all but two of her Trooping the Colours, missing it in 1955 when a national rail strike resulted in the event being cancelled and in 2020 due to lockdown restrictions.

In 2017, Trooping was held a few days days after the Grenfell Tower blaze and the loss of life was marked by a minute's silence, a decision taken by Queen Elizabeth II.

The parade is open to members of the public through an online ballot with ticketing ranging from £10 to £30 and is broadcast live on the BBC.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/14/19/99379035-0-image-m-18_1749926229636.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 14:01:16.923846

But in 2025, the tradition-steeped spectacle brought with it a series of firsts, farewells and subtle shifts that signalled changing times for both the royal family and the institution itself.

Princess Catherine’s look is reminiscent of Princess Diana’s

While not her first public appearance since confirming her cancer diagnosis in March, Princess Catherine’s attendance at Trooping the Colour marked her return to high-profile ceremonial duties. She rode in a carriage with her three children — Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis — and later appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony with the wider family.

She wore a turquoise Catherine Walker coatdress with white collar detailing and a matching Philip Tracy hat. This outfit was reminiscent of Princess Diana’s ensemble at the same event in 1988, highlighting Kate’s ongoing tradition of honouring Diana’s legacy through fashion. Complementing her attire, Kate wore the Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings, originally a wedding gift to Queen Elizabeth II and previously worn by Princess Diana. Her daughter, Princess Charlotte, matched her mother’s ensemble, echoing the coordinated appearance of Diana and a young Prince Harry in 1988.

The Wales family shared a lovely image on their Instagram account with the caption:

“Another brilliant day at Trooping the Colour for His Majesty’s Birthday Parade. Thank you to everybody who came, and to all those who took part.”

King Charles attends despite ongoing treatment

The King, who is also receiving cancer treatment, opted for a carriage procession rather than riding on horseback as he did last year. Royal Correspondent Juliet Rieden remarked on ABC News Breakfast that he may have been advised against horse riding as usual due to his cancer. Queen Camilla accompanied him in the carriage.

She chose a refined ensemble that paid homage to her military role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards. She wore a white silk dress previously seen during a recent state visit to France for D-Day commemorations

RAF Flypast goes green

In a first for the event, the iconic Red Arrows flypast used a 40 per cent blend of sustainable aviation fuel, marking a rare but meaningful climate-conscious shift for one of Britain’s most-watched public spectacles. The move echoed King Charles’s long-standing environmental interests and was framed by some as a gesture toward modernising the monarchy’s approach to tradition.

A moment of silence for Air India victims

The ceremony also included a sombre pause. Members of the military and royal family wore black armbands and observed a minute’s silence for the victims of Air India Flight 171, which recently crashed en route to the UK. The tribute added a poignant note to what is typically a celebratory occasion.

Notable absences and attendances

While the crowd outside Buckingham Palace numbered in the thousands, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were again absent, marking the third consecutive year they’ve missed the event. Additionally, Lady Louise Windsor and James, Earl of Wessex, children of Prince Edward and Sophie, were not present, reportedly due to academic commitments.

The senior royals who did attend included Princess Anne, the King’s sister, who participated on horseback, Sir Timothy Laurence, Princess Anne’s husband, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, who also rode on horseback, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the King’s first cousin, Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester, Prince Richard’s wife, and Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the King’s first cousin.

What felt different

While much of the choreography remained familiar, this year’s Trooping felt more pared-back. Royal watchers noted fewer horses, a shorter procession, and a less theatrical tone overall. Whether due to the King and Princess’s health issues or a broader shift in tone, 2025’s edition stood out for its quieter, more reflective mood.",https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/aww-digi-42-684e481336344.png?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-06-15 17:01:47.346649

Let's start by taking a deeper look at the Boeing 797.
The principal purpose of this aircraft type would be to fill the middle-of-the-market segment, which had until that point been mostly unserved by Boeing aircraft.
A Deeper Look At Everything The 797 Will Bring To The Table The Boeing 797 promised to bridge a capacity gap that global air carriers were desperate to fill.
Back in January 2020, Boeing put plans on hold for the Boeing 797, as well as a full-scale reevaluation of the project's potential.","Two massive planemakers dominate the global market for jet-powered airliners. In the United States, there is Boeing, a legacy manufacturer that emerged from multiple mergers of different massive aircraft manufacturing conglomerates over the years. Despite ongoing difficulties related to its troubled Boeing 737 MAX program, the manufacturer remains America's largest exporter and one of the nation's most important companies. Across the Atlantic in Europe, there is Airbus, a significantly younger manufacturer, but today it stands as the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry's most important player.

The next two major aircraft to hit the market will be the Boeing 797 and the Airbus A390, aircraft which will be so named to fall in line with the two manufacturers' naming conventions. At the end of the day, these will be the most important aircraft to enter service with airlines next, and each could have a vastly different impact on the market. Let's take a look at these two future development concepts and evaluate what Boeing and Airbus might be about to build next.

What Is The Story Behind The Boeing 797?

Let's start by taking a deeper look at the Boeing 797. US-based planemaker Boeing made an error a couple of decades ago when it ended production of the Boeing 757, an aircraft that perfectly bridged the gap between smaller narrowbody jets and large widebody aircraft. To address this capacity gap in its lineup, Boeing began to develop the New Midsize Airplane (NMA), an aircraft that was unofficially referred to as the Boeing 797. The principal purpose of this aircraft type would be to fill the middle-of-the-market segment, which had until that point been mostly unserved by Boeing aircraft.

Back in 2015, Boeing's research analysts determined that this market was large enough to be lucrative enough to support a new clean-sheet aircraft. Boeing quickly got to work designing the aircraft and attempting to find potential buyers for the jet. By 2017, multiple different international airlines had expressed their interest in purchasing a composite, seven-abreast twin-engine airliner that featured an elliptical cross-section. This new jet would be named the Boeing 797 to fall in line with the airline's current naming conventions, according to Popular Mechanics.

This aircraft would be offered in two different variants. The first of these would seat 225 passengers and would offer an extended range of 5,000 nautical miles. A 275-seat variant that could fly up to 4,500 nautical miles would also be available. Multiple third parties attempted to determine the potential size of this kind of market, and most settled upon a size of roughly 2,000-4,000 jets. Boeing forecasts indicated that the demand would likely lie towards the top of this range.

A Deeper Look At Everything The 797 Will Bring To The Table

The Boeing 797 promised to bridge a capacity gap that global air carriers were desperate to fill. The jet would come along with a purchase price of between $65 and $75 million, meaning that it could comfortably be worth the investment for many global carriers. The NMA promised to generate more than 30% more revenue in comparison to narrowbody jets on the market today, while also offering 40% lower overall trip costs in comparison to widebody jets like the Boeing 767, according to Flight Global.

The jet was to be one of the most powerful on the market, with a new ultra-efficient engine set to be designed for the jet. This engine was rumored to be a turbofan designed by GE Aviation or Pratt & Whitney, and it would be rated at 50,000 pounds of thrust. In order to offer airlines maximum operational efficiency, this engine would have a bypass ratio of 10:1 or more while also having an overall pressure ratio that exceeded 50:1.

Back in January 2020, Boeing put plans on hold for the Boeing 797, as well as a full-scale reevaluation of the project's potential. The aircraft manufacturer noted that it would be focusing on the Boeing 737 MAX, which had multiple fatal accidents take place in the years leading up to the pandemic. In February 2021, it appeared that the company had plans to develop a shorter variant of the Boeing 797 that would enter service in the late 2020s. However, these plans were put on hold in June 2022 pending the development of more advanced engines.

Airbus Also Has Plans To Develop A New Aircraft

The next Airbus jet to hit the market will most likely be called the Airbus A390, although some industry analysts have suggested that it could be called the Airbus A360. This likely stems from the fact that there is no Airbus A360 or A370 in the company's lineup despite there being an obvious hole in the organization's nomenclature.

Nonetheless, Airbus has its sights on something very bold for its next-generation aircraft, one which will be conceived from scratch and based on no preexisting designs. This aircraft will not simply be a larger or smaller variant of something that the company already operates.

Airbus already has jets that fill pretty much the entire capacity range airlines would be willing to serve. It sells low-capacity narrowbodies like the A220, and it offers something for pretty much every customer up to the Airbus A350-1000.

What Is Airbus' New Plane Going To Be?

Airbus is currently in the process of developing a next-generation single-aisle jet that is intended to replace the airline's current Airbus A320 lineup in about 15 years. This jet will include advanced sustainable technologies that will improve fuel efficiency and reduce the aircraft's carbon emissions. There are a number of specific design features under evaluation, but the company has already decided that the new model will be powered by an open-fan engine, one which will be developed by legacy engine manufacturer CFM International. This new engine promises to offer an improved fuel burn of around 20% on account of a much higher bypass ratio.

This new plane will also feature a ""Wing of Tomorrow,"" a longer and more slender wing that will fold at the tips to make sure that the aircraft remains compatible with gates that are already designed to serve existing narrowbody aircraft. The aircraft development program's principal objectives include reducing emissions and maximizing aerodynamic efficiencies. The jet is also going to be fully compatible with the use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), something that will set it apart from existing jets that are limited to a 50% SAF blend.

These latest developments serve as a major bridge for Airbus as the company pursues its ambitious hydrogen-powered aircraft project, one that looks further off than ever. The new propfan-powered aircraft that is currently being evaluated by Airbus will be representative of the company's large-scale strategic shift towards the development of high-efficiency, lower-emission aircraft. The flight testing process for many of these advanced technologies is set to begin later in the decade.

What Market Would This New Airbus Plane Serve?

This new Airbus single-aisle aircraft is designed to play the same role in global fleets that aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 currently play. This will include domestic flights and transcontinental services, as well as regional international flights within certain markets. The aircraft is expected to compete directly with whatever Boeing decides to replace the Boeing 737 MAX with, meaning that it will serve airlines that operate dense, high-volume routes and seek to minimize both fuel and operational expenses as much as possible.

The aircraft is expected to offer an enhanced range, meaning that it will be able to serve similar markets to a jet like the Airbus A321XLR. The plane could potentially open up more thin long-haul routes due to its impressive operating economics. This could further increase the number of transatlantic routes where current operations are deemed economically infeasible. The anticipated efficiency of the aircraft's new open-fan engine will make it one of the most sustainable aircraft to ever take to the skies.

Furthermore, the aircraft's full compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel makes it extremely attractive to airlines that are looking to develop fleets that will not be targeted by stricter emissions restrictions, something especially true in Europe. Low-cost airlines and legacy carriers, alongside other kinds of non-traditional carriers, are all expected to have an interest in the jet.

What Is Different About How Boeing And Airbus Are Developing Future Aircraft?

Airbus and Boeing are both approaching the development of future aircraft in different ways. Boeing is taking what most would think of as the natural route, as the company is looking to fill a gap in its lineup.

This is the safer way forward, but it is also likely to be less lucrative than developing a completely new kind of flying machine. There are only so many carriers that would want this kind of jet, so its potential is somewhat limited.

Airbus is definitely a bit more ambitious when it comes to the future of its commercial lineup, and it also likely has much more interest in ensuring the development of sustainable jets. However, we will simply have to see which of these two development programs more adequately addresses the needs of the market.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/airbus.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 12:05:36.806923

Jetstar’s exit leaves Scoot the sole Singapore-based budget carrier and closes a chapter on the once high-flying budget carrier scene.","[SINGAPORE] News of the impending shutdown of Jetstar Asia, with the loss of more than 500 jobs, has sent shockwaves through the aviation sector.

Comments on social media site Reddit lamented the budget carrier’s closure as it was the only airline that plied between Singapore and the holiday destinations of Okinawa in Japan, Wuxi in China, Labuan Bajo in Indonesia and Broome in Australia.

On Wednesday (Jun 11) the Qantas unit announced its closure and said that its last day of operations would be Jul 31.

Budget flights have become a staple of the travel industry, accounting for one-third of the 49.8 million passengers who passed through Changi Airport in the first nine months of 2024.

As the low-cost carrier scene continues to battle stiff competition, rising fuel costs, price wars and the entry of new players, The Business Times takes a look back at the Singapore budget carrier landscape.

Early 2000s: Budget airlines take off

Budget airlines made their appearance in the Singapore aviation sector in the early 2000s, bringing cheap fares and new destinations to an emerging class of cost-conscious travellers.

With their trademark low fees and no-frills offerings, they revolutionised travel and made flying – once considered a luxury – much more affordable and accessible.

South-east Asia underwent a budget travel boom after Malaysia’s Tony Fernandes pioneered the low-cost carrier model in the region with AirAsia in 2002.

Singapore’s first low-cost carrier Valuair took flight in May 2004, ferrying 162 passengers on its maiden trip from Changi Airport to Bangkok.

The privately owned startup was co-founded by former SIA deputy chairman Lim Chin Beng, alongside other investors.

With fares at a fraction of those offered by full-service airlines – up to 40 to 50 per cent lower – it became a competitor to SIA’s now-defunct subsidiary SilkAir, which plied regional routes.

That same year, SIA Group launched Tiger Airways with state investor Temasek and the founders of Irish budget carrier Ryanair while Australia’s flag carrier Qantas established Jetstar Asia.

The year 2005 proved to be a rocky one for low-cost carriers as fuel costs rose and full-service carriers slashed prices to never-seen-before levels to compete with and undercut their budget rivals.

Governments in the region, such as Indonesia, also shut their doors to foreign budget carriers. This left Singapore-based airlines with only a few crowded regional routes to compete in.

That year, Jetstar Asia and Valuair merged under the holding company Orangestar, with both retaining their original names. Amid challenging conditions, the two carriers struggled to make money.

Still, there was no stopping travellers’ wanderlust. In 2007, Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways featured on a list of Changi Airport’s top 10 carriers by passenger numbers.

In January 2010, Tiger Airways listed on the mainboard of the Singapore Exchange (SGX).

Entrances and exits: Players scoot in and out

Over the years, Singapore’s budget carrier market expanded by 21 per cent from 2004 to 2024, outpacing that of full-service airlines, which grew 1.4 per cent, according to Alton Aviation Consultancy.

The number of budget flights from Changi Airport also soared with the expansion of low-cost airlines.

From just 1,705 flights in 2004, the number of budget flights from the airport climbed to 16,798 in 2009 and hit a peak in 2018 with 64,618 flights to more than 100 cities.

But as air fares and earnings fell, carriers scaled back on operations, causing a string of consolidations and exits.

Indonesian budget airline Tigerair Mandala ceased operations in 2014, when its shareholders pulled the plug on funding. Tiger Airways owned a 35.8 per cent stake in the loss-making carrier, which had contributed to it racking up hefty losses for the financial year ended March 2014.

During this time, SIA launched a new and second low-cost carrier, Scoot, in 2012, in response to growing competition with brands such as Jetstar and AirAsia. It made its inaugural voyage to Sydney in June that year.

Scoot was meant to capture the medium- and long-haul market, while Tiger Airways would focus on short-haul flights.

Tiger Airways, which had been renamed Tigerair, struggled with consecutive full-year operating losses for FY2014 and FY2015.

The airline began to scale back its regional ambitions amid fierce competition, exiting the markets of Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan. Eventually, SIA took it private in 2016.

Tigerair was then folded into Scoot in 2017 as SIA consolidated its two budget carriers under the holding company Budget Aviation Holdings, to operate them under the Scoot brand, which fared better in market perception on issues such as comfort, safety and service quality.

The merger also aimed to boost cooperation between the two carriers and cut costs.

Meanwhile, Jetstar Asia enjoyed growth in the early part of the 2010s, as higher passenger numbers and an expanded regional network brought its earnings to S$18 million for the financial year ended June 2011.

However, its growth slowed near the end of the decade.

As at 2018, its share of Singapore’s low-cost carrier market shrank to less than 20 per cent from over a quarter in 2010, a Centre for Aviation report showed. By then, its rival carrier Scoot had grown rapidly.

Pandemic turbulence and recovery

Covid-19 dealt the aviation sector a heavy blow with the curbs on travel. The inevitable result was that Changi Airport’s budget flight numbers dived and remained below 50,000 for 2020, 2021 and 2022.

In 2020, Jetstar Asia grounded its entire fleet, retired five aircraft and trimmed 26 per cent of its headcount or 180 staff.

Scoot suspended most of its flights and pivoted to chartering cargo as its parent company SIA Group cut some 4,300 positions across its airlines

By 2024, as the pandemic eased and travel recovered – with Changi Airport’s budget airline passenger traffic reaching 101.6 per cent of 2019 levels between January and September of 2024 – low-cost carrier operators were poised to resume growth.

Scoot added new destinations to its network, ramped up flights and expanded its fleet.

In comparison, Jetstar’s recovery was slower. Analysts observed that its 2024 capacity and traffic was only around half of pre-pandemic levels.

Meanwhile, despite a surge in “revenge travel”, low-cost carriers continued facing headwinds. These included stiff regional competition, volatile fuel prices and geopolitical tensions.

Challenges such as supply chain snags also delayed new plane deliveries and grounded existing ones, while sustainable aviation fuel mandates pushed costs up.

Airlines cited rising costs – including the fees charged by Changi Airport – as a challenge to operating in Singapore.

The Republic in November 2024 had announced airport fee hikes to fund upgrades to Changi Airport.

The move was lamented by Jetstar Asia’s chief executive John Simeone, who said it could affect the airline’s ability to sell tickets under S$100 – which comprised around two-thirds of the carrier’s flights as at December 2024.

Jetstar Asia grounded

When Jetstar Asia announced its exit – citing cost pressures as threatening its ability to offer the low fares that are key to its business – passengers and staff were shocked, but industry experts said the move was unsurprising, albeit unfortunate.

They pointed to how the Singapore-based carrier had struggled to turn a profit even before the pandemic, and was in the black for only six years in more than two decades of operations.

Jetstar Asia lacked the scale, local dominance and margin buffers of its stronger rivals, analysts said.

Moreover, its 2023 shift to Terminal 4 from Terminal 1, where its parent Qantas operates, severed the seamless connectivity between the two airlines and lengthened connecting times, which likely worsened its problems, analysts added.

However Qantas itself has displayed a respectable performance.

Qantas Airways in February announced an underlying profit before tax of A$1.39 billion (S$1.17 billion) for its first half ended December. It also declared its first special dividend in more than two decades and its first final dividend since September 2019.

What does Jetstar’s departure mean?

Jetstar’s exit leaves Scoot the sole Singapore-based budget carrier and closes a chapter on the once high-flying budget carrier scene.

As Changi Airport Group works with other carriers to plug connectivity gaps in the dust of Jetstar Asia’s departure, one thing is for certain: There will always be a demand for budget travel – but whether it is a profitable business remains to be seen.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/28a48a3c6123b9006feb820ae31fd52f20cb679b58e8c292aa1e635474235fbb?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-06-15 12:05:40.783797

The company raised $50 million in June 2024.","Business-to-business tech platforms are still leading the way in terms of travel startup funding.

As Skift has reported, that’s where the money is: Platforms that promise to modernize travel sectors that have aging tech.

Funding has been slow this year, but it picked up slightly in recent weeks with three significant raises in the B2B category for hotels and vacation rentals. Hotel tech company Canary Technologies just raised $80 million, one of the largest rounds of the year for a travel software company. Holidu and Wander, both offering operations management tech for vacation rentals, each raised around $50 million.

Kolet, an eSIM app that raised $10 million, also promotes its B2B offering for travel companies. It’s likely a more significant revenue driver compared to individual consumer sales.

SkyNRG, a renewable jet fuel producer, had the biggest raise, $285.7 million, for any travel startup so far this year. Companies of that type follow a different set of funding rules compared to software startups, which often have to prove a strong business model to raise that level. Renewable jet fuel companies need a lot of money to develop their tech in line with the airline industry’s zero-carbon goal by 2050.

Seven travel startups announced raises totaling over $560 million in the last four weeks.

SkyNRG: $346.8 Million

SkyNRG, which produces and distributes renewable jet fuel, has raised $346.8 million (€300 million).

Pension management company APG committed $285.7 million (€250 million) to the round on behalf of ABP, a pension fund in the Netherlands. The other ($57.1 million) €50 million comes from Macquarie Asset Management, which led SkyNRG’s $191 million round in 2023.

Amsterdam-based SkyNRG says it sources the feedstocks used to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The company produces SAF in its plants and then distributes it to airline clients. SkyNRG says it has supplied SAF to more than 50 airlines worldwide.

The company has facilities in Washington state, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

The company plans to use the funding to help construct facilities in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.S. It will also support research and development, advisory services, and client projects.

Canary Technologies: $80 Million

Canary Technologies, a platform for hotel guest management, has raised $80 million in series D funding.

Brighton Park Capital led the round, with support from Insight Partners, F-Prime Capital, Thayer Ventures, Y-Combinator, and Commerce Ventures.

Canary said that the latest round brings its valuation to about $600 million.

The company raised $50 million in June 2024.

‍The platform by San Francisco-based Canary includes products for mobile check-in and checkout, upselling, guest messaging, and digital tipping.

Canary last year added a generative AI chatbot for guest messaging, which is meant to answer specific property questions and sell add-ons like late check-out, without disrupting front desk staff.

The company has since released an AI voicebot product to handle guest phone calls, as well as an AI chatbot for hotel websites, meant to drive direct bookings.

The company said its tech supports more than 20,000 hotels for clients including Best Western, Aimbridge Hospitality, Marriott, Wyndham, TUI Hotels & Resorts, and others.

The funding will go toward strengthening its products and expanding business.

Holidu: $52.8 Million

Holidu, a vacation rental management platform, has raised $52.8 million (€46 million).

Key1 Capital led the round, with support from Vintage Investment Partners, Prime Ventures, 83North, and others.

The tech by Germany-based Holidu primarily targets hosts who own one property. Holidu now manages nearly 50,000 properties, which drives 70% of the company’s revenue. The company said that the number of properties has tripled, and revenue from that business has grown 3.5 times, since it raised $102 million of debt and equity in 2022.

Holidu also owns Bookiply, which helps owners generate more bookings.

The funding will go toward accelerating AI integration, expanding the property management business, and moving into new geographic markets. The company said its first AI chatbot for guests “reduced simple support tickets by 70% and complex ones by 30%.”

The company also said it acquired Cybevasion, operator of French vacation rental booking sites gites.fr and chambres-hotes.fr. Their more than 35,000 properties now have access to Holidu’s tech. Cybevasion employees will be integrated into the Holidu organization. Jean-Louis Desouche, founder of Cybevasion, will stay on to lead the business.

This is Holidu’s eighth acquisition, which it said is part of a strategy for “bolt-on growth across Europe.”

Wander: $50 Million

Wander, a property management platform for luxury short-term rentals, has raised $50 million in series B funding.

QED and Fifth Wall led the round, with support from Redpoint, Uncork, Starwood, Authentic, Breyer, Alumni, Hakluyt, Activant, Soma, and others.

The company last raised a $20 million series A round in 2022.

San Francisco-based Wander says its AI-powered operating system manages a variety of tasks for short-term rental logistics and guest needs. That includes listing creation, maintenance coordination, guest communication, check-in, and more. “Wander is on track to automate 95% of operational tasks within the next 18 months,” the company said. Wander also has a booking platform for travelers.

Wander said that more than 1,000 homes use the service. As of the second quarter of 2025, the company has logged more than 35,000 nights booked and a repeat customer booking rate of 27%.

Wander says it focuses on recruiting the top 5% of properties, those that already drive 30% of the industry's revenue. The company looks for properties that include amenities like WiFi, gyms, pools, and saunas. It estimates that there are more than 300,000 potential clients worldwide.

The funding will go toward expanding into new markets, strengthening the tech system, and building the brand.

Qashio: $19.8 Million

Qashio, an expense management platform, has raised $19.8 million in equity and debt.

Rocketship VC led the round, with participation from MoreThan Capital, regional banks, and family offices.

Dubai-based Qashio says its expensive management products and services include corporate cards, custom approvals based on client policies, reimbursement, AI-powered receipt matching, analytics, and more.

The company also offers a loyalty program, enabling users to earn air miles and hotel points. Partners on the loyalty program include Emirates, Air France, KLM, Avios (British Airways, Iberia, Finnair), Jumeirah One, Accor, and IHG Hotels & Resorts.

The company said that it generated $1.2 million in profit in the first quarter of 2025. Its revenue has grown over 800% year-over-year for three consecutive years, the company said.

The funding will go toward expansion in Saudi Arabia.

Kolet: $10 Million

Kolet, an eSIM app, has raised $10 million in series A funding.

Daphni led the round, with support from former Expedia CEO Peter Kern and Jon Gieselman, chief growth officer for Comcast and former exec for Apple and Expedia.

The round includes €1 million in non-dilutive funding from investment bank Bpifrance.

Kern and Gieselman are joining the board, along with Certares managing director Philippe Chérèque.

The company last year raised €5 million in seed funding.

Besides the consumer product, Paris-based Kolet provides the eSIM app as a product that travel companies can offer to customers. Clients include Air France-KLM, Evaneos, Kiwi.com, Exoticca, and Wego.

Kolet says the app includes “instant” eSIM activation and the ability to use unused data on a future trip. Pricing starts at €3.99 for one gigabyte.

The company said it has gained more than 300,000 users since it launched a year ago, and it’s on track to reach 1 million users by the end of the year.

The funding will go toward strengthening the mobile app, simplifying the installation experience, and hiring.

Truely: $2 Million

Truely, an eSIM app, has raised $2 million.

Investors included DG Daiwa Ventures, Goodwater Capital, Disrupt.com, Beenext.

The company last raised $3.5 million in 2024.

Singapore-based Truely says users download only one eSIM, eliminating the need to download new eSIMs for different countries or regions. The service is usable in more than 190 countries, the company said.

The pricing for most countries starts at $2.50 per day when purchasing 30 days, according to the website. The fewer days the user purchases at one time, the higher the daily price. The highest daily price for the U.S. is $5.52, while the lowest is $2.50.

The funding will go toward network scaling for lower latency, localized pricing and payments, and new tools for business travelers.

Travaras: $1.5 Million

Travaras, an experience booking marketplace focused on sustainable tourism, has raised $1.5 million in a pre-seed round.

The funding comes from Techstars following the startup’s completion of its accelerator program.

San Francisco-based Travaras says it curates ticketed experiences based on a proprietary ranking system. All the experiences at this point are based on four Hawaii islands.

The funding will go toward strengthening the tech and user experience, along with marketing.

The Tarzan Way: $234,000

The Tarzan Way, an AI-powered trip planner website, has raised $234,000 (20 million Indian rupees).

Inflection Point Ventures led the round, with support from Your Trips Limited and a group of angel investors that includes Prateek Maheshwari, founder of education tech company PhysicsWallah.

The Tarzan Way, based in India, says its site includes AI-powered itinerary creation, a booking engine, and 24/7 live concierge support. The company says it has facilitated a total of $1.6 million (135 million Indian rupees) in bookings.

Airbus is preparing a major upgrade to its A330neo series, giving both the A330-900 and A330-800 variants a significant performance boost. This planned upgrade, set to roll out by mid-2026, aims to provide airlines with greater range, payload capacity, and operational flexibility. But what exactly does this mean for the future of long-haul air travel?

The A330neo series has already made waves in the aviation world since its entry into service in 2018. Now, with enhanced capabilities on the horizon, Airbus is answering airlines’ calls for more performance without sacrificing efficiency.

What’s Changing: A Higher Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW)

The star of this upgrade is the increased maximum takeoff weight (MTOW), which will allow the aircraft to carry more weight while flying longer distances. For the A330-900, the MTOW will climb from 251 tons to 257 tons—an increase of six tons. While this might seem like a small number on paper, in aviation, even slight increases can make a significant impact.

This change means the A330-900 will be able to carry more passengers and cargo or travel farther without compromising on fuel efficiency. Airlines operating in challenging environments, such as hot and high airports, or those running ultra-long-haul routes, will benefit the most from this performance enhancement.

The A330-800 variant, while not as widely used, will also receive a similar upgrade. Though it’s a smaller player in the global fleet, the A330-800’s new capabilities will make it a more versatile option for airlines with specific needs.

A330neo’s Success So Far

The A330neo series has carved out a significant niche in the long-haul market, particularly as a more cost-effective alternative to larger aircraft like the Boeing 787. Thanks to its Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and aerodynamic improvements over the previous A330ceo model, the A330neo delivers up to 25% better fuel efficiency per seat.

Airlines have taken notice of the A330neo’s balance between affordability and efficiency. With a lower acquisition cost than the Boeing 787, the A330neo has become a popular choice for airlines seeking to keep long-haul operations affordable while maintaining high levels of performance.

Responding to Airline Needs: More Range and Flexibility

The move to increase the A330neo’s MTOW shows Airbus’s responsiveness to airline feedback. Many carriers are asking for aircraft that can do more—whether it’s flying longer distances, carrying heavier payloads, or handling operations in more demanding environments. This upgrade is Airbus’s direct response to those needs.

One of the key benefits of the A330neo is its fuel efficiency. The additional range and payload capacity will allow airlines to expand their route networks without having to worry about higher fuel consumption or operational costs. This makes the A330neo an even more attractive option for carriers, especially in regions like Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific, where long-haul travel is booming.

Airbus vs. Boeing: A Stronger Competitive Edge

With this upgrade, Airbus is tightening its grip on the widebody market, especially in the face of competition from Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner. The A330neo already has a pricing and operational cost advantage over the Dreamliner, and this MTOW increase strengthens Airbus’s competitive edge.

Airlines looking for more efficient aircraft without breaking the bank are likely to see the A330neo as the smarter choice, especially when operating in regions where every extra kilogram of payload or additional nautical mile of range counts. The fuel-efficient design, coupled with a lower price tag, makes the A330neo a powerful contender in the long-haul market.

Enhancements in Passenger Comfort and Sustainability

While the numbers matter, the A330neo is also designed with passengers in mind. Airbus’s Airspace cabin concept introduces larger overhead bins, quieter interiors, modern mood lighting, and wider seats—making the flight experience more comfortable for travelers.

For airlines, this emphasis on passenger comfort adds a layer of differentiation, especially in competitive long-haul markets. As airlines continue to differentiate their products, the A330neo’s improved cabin features could provide a competitive edge, particularly in markets where passenger satisfaction is key.

In addition to its performance improvements, the A330neo is also certified for up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with Airbus actively working to increase this number as part of its commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This focus on sustainability ensures that the A330neo will remain relevant as the aviation industry shifts towards greener technologies.

A330neo’s Future: What’s Next?

With an enhanced MTOW, the A330neo is poised to serve airlines even more effectively, especially on routes where passenger and cargo volumes are both high. Airlines like Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, and Etihad, who are already planning to purchase the A330neo, will benefit greatly from the upcoming upgrades.

Airbus’s efforts to streamline production with automated assembly and lighter materials ensure that the A330neo remains cost-competitive in a demanding market. These enhancements, combined with the new MTOW and improved fuel efficiency, make the A330neo a smart long-term investment for airlines looking to future-proof their fleets.

Conclusion: The A330neo is More Than Just a Sensible Option

With its new upgrades, the A330neo is no longer just a cost-effective option—it’s quickly becoming the smart one. Airbus’s decision to increase the aircraft’s range and payload reflects both industry trends and airline demands for more versatile, high-performance aircraft. The A330neo will continue to be a strong competitor against Boeing’s 787, offering airlines greater flexibility, improved performance, and a more comfortable passenger experience.

As the aviation industry moves towards more sustainable and efficient operations, the A330neo is proving that it’s ready for the future. With these enhancements on the horizon, the A330neo is set to solidify its position as a leading choice for airlines worldwide.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__86177-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 11:01:47.493414

At 13:00 twenty-nine aircraft took to the skies above the crowds on The Mall and over Buckingham Palace, watched over by Their Majesties’ The King and Queen, alongside other members of the Royal family.

The stunning formation was led by four Chinook helicopters from No 18 & 27 Squadrons of RAF Odiham, following the King’s Birthday Parade (Trooping the Colour).

The aircraft came from nine different RAF stations, many of whom flew in the VE80 celebrations in May this year.

It is an enormous privilege to be part of His Majesty The King’s Birthday celebrations, where the Flypast is an opportunity for the Royal Air Force to honour His Majesty The King, our Commander-in-Chief, on the occasion of his Official Birthday.

This year, the flypast will comprise twenty-nine aircraft, including the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, rotary wing assets from the Joint Aviation Command, training aircraft from No.22 Group and front-line aircraft from across No.1 Group representing the Air Mobility, Combat Air and ISTAR Forces; as always the flypast will conclude with the iconic Red Arrows.""

The aircraft, whose main purpose is to secure our skies and protect our citizens at home and abroad have a broad range of uses. These include training, air transport, lift capabilities, air-to-air refuelling, maritime, humanitarian missions, and fast jet combat.

It is a great honour to be part of an event that will bolster our national pride, and to be part of something much greater than myself. My role will include coordinating with civil air traffic and assisting the safe passage of all the aircraft back to their bases.""

Other aircraft in the formation included a Phenom, Typhoon, an F35 and a C17 Globemaster.

The flypast is also thought to be the first time anywhere in the world that a national aerobatic squadron has switched to both a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend for propulsion and a renewable biofuel - known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). This is a premium quality fuel, with a chemical structure almost identical to the regular diesel traditionally used by the aerobatic team for its vapour trails.

In addition to reducing its carbon footprint, the move demonstrates the RAF's commitment to new technology as well as becoming more energy secure and less reliant on fossil fuels.

The event culminated in a spectacular show of red, white and blue from the pilots of the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows.

It is a privilege to be a member of the Red Arrows. To me, the Red Arrows are an icon of the United Kingdom - so knowing that you had a key role to play in them bringing joy and excitement to thousands of people as they fly over the Mall is something I am incredibly proud of.

As head of all engineering and logistics on the team, I am even more proud to lead the amazing and diverse team of over one hundred ‘Blues’ that not only make major flypasts happen, but work tirelessly for twelve months a year, every year, to deliver a colourful and dynamic aerobatic show.

Working with the smoke generation system is the most unique part of the job. The vibrant vapour that we generate is what sets the team apart and so to be the first team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.”

The aircraft of the Armed Forces have a long and proud history of taking part in this occasion, with the first King’s Birthday Flypast taking place in 1913 and most recently formed part of Their Majesties’ Coronation in 2023 and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee in 2022.

The flypast has much poignancy for one of the Chinook pilots, Master Aircrew (MACr) Ruffles. The King’s Birthday Flypast was one of MACr Ruffles’ last flights as he leaves the RAF after forty years’ service and nine thousand hours flying with helicopters.

Being part of the King's Birthday Flypast after forty years of service especially on the 80th anniversary of VE Day is an honour I'll carry with me for many years to come.

With a legion of helpers at hand, and access to an extensive photographic historical record, if a royal wears something that immediately arouses a sense of nostalgia, that's very likely a deliberate move on their part to pay tribute to tradition.

And no-one does that better than the Princess of Wales.

For her appearance at Trooping the Colour overnight – also known as the King's birthday parade – Catherine wore an outfit that has drawn comparisons to that worn by her late mother-in-law, Diana at the same event in 1988.

Both outfits are Catherine Walker designs and feature wide, white contrasting cuffs and collars set against deep aquamarine (in Kate's outfit) and green (as seen on Diana).

We all remember the late Princess of Wales in that look because it was also the year when Prince Harry, who was three at the time, poked his tongue out while being held by his mother on the balcony, much to the delight of the world's watching media.

Royal women, in comparison to their male counterparts, know their sartorial choices for events, great and small, get scrutinised down to every minute detail.

And there is no bigger event on the royal calendar than Trooping the Colour, bar a coronation.

For the woman who currently holds the title of Princess of Wales, Kate's decision to wear an outfit that bears such resemblance to Diana's iconic 1988 look is absolutely deliberate.

Rather than being custom-made for Kate, the style is on the British designer's website and is known as the 'Bria'. It also comes in red and black.

Some may wonder, why wear something so similar to that seen on Diana more than 30 years ago?

Surely such an obviously-similar outfit will just invite the Diana-Kate comparisons, something which the 43-year-old has had to live with since marrying into the royal family in 2011.

The simple answer is tradition.

As the King walked out onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the culmination of Trooping the Colour – the part of the day most of us really want to see – he was joined by his family.

The 14 of them in total represented what many believe is the result of the King's slimmed-down monarchy, an attempt to modernise the 1200-year-old institution by involving only those working in service of the Crown, or those in the direct line of succession (as the Wales children are).

They were the King and Queen standing besides Prince William and Kate and their children Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, seven.

They were joined by the Princess Royal and her husband Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.

Absent from this year's balcony line up were the two children of Prince Edward and Sophie: Lady Louise, 21, and James, Earl of Wessex, 17. Lady Louise was included in last year's Trooping the Colour, including the carriage ride to Horse Guards Parade, while her younger brother last took part in 2022.

It was the late Queen Elizabeth II who used to include her wider family on the palace balcony at Trooping the Colour, though in 2022 – which coincided with her Platinum Jubilee – the line-up was noticeably smaller than in previous years.

Many took it as a sign of the 96-year-old monarch paving the way for her son and heir's hopes for a more streamlined royal family.

In recent years, other royal families across Europe have been scaling down their list of working members, notably the Danish royals and the Swedish royals.

This year's Trooping saw another attempt at modernisation by Charles III: the Red Arrows who took part in the fly past used a blend of sustainable aviation fuel and normal jet fuel for propulsion and a renewable biofuel for its smoke trails.

It is thought to be the first time anywhere in the world that two environmentally-friendly fuels have been used for such a spectacle.

The King, who has long talked about the need to be greener, was said to ""obviously be delighted"" about the use of sustainable aviation fuel, an aide said.

All the best photos from Trooping the Colour 2025

As Charles moves to propel the royal family into more modern times, it is the Prince and Princess of Wales who are determined to show the world that tradition still matters.

And a small, and non-threatening, way to do this is through fashion.

It was just months ago that Kensington Palace said there would be ""no change in our approach to sharing information"" about Kate's clothes after reports emerged that the princess wanted the focus to be on her work and not her wardrobe.

What followed were many appearances by Kate wearing repeat outfits (of which, she should be commended for) or clothes in darker, muted colours. Hardly inspiring for her legion of fashion followers and fashion writers, though.

Fast forward to now with this Diana-esque look at Trooping the Colour.

Much like Diana in 1988, when she matched her outfit to Prince Harry's green and white ensemble, Kate and her daughter Princess Charlotte were mirroring each other with similar hued dresses.

While there are countless examples of Kate wearing similar outfits to Diana, the most recent example (apart from Trooping) came earlier this month when the princess wore a navy and white Suzannah coat dress to christen a ship in Scotland.

It was nearly uncanny to a navy and white Catherine Walker outfit Diana wore to a nautical event in 1993.

Trooping the Colour has always been a family affair and children, and their parents, are at the heat of the celebrations.

King Charles attended his first Trooping aged three in 1951.

In 2015, Prince George made his balcony debut at the event wearing a recreation of the same outfit his father Prince William wore for his first Trooping the Colour appearance way back in 1984, just weeks shy of his second birthday.

When Prince Louis made his balcony debut in 2019, his outfit was a recreation of the one his uncle Prince Harry wore in 1986.

These fashion choices are not coincidence and any mother in charge of their children's wardrobe at such crucial family events knows all too well the importance of looking unified and looking smart.

Every year there is debate about the relevance of the royal family and their place in modern society, yet the key players in the House of Windsor know that what their public really want is a continuation of tradition.

Trooping the Colour is the most popular – and loved – royal event because it is one that is a throwback to times gone by.

The centuries-old parade attracts tourists from around the world, many coming from outside the UK to get a taste of the royal family's pomp and pageantry.

Seeing Kate wearing an outfit that is so remarkably like one of Diana's is exactly what nostalgic-loving royal watchers want to see.

Mr Shanks said the investment, announced by the Prime Minister at the Scottish Labour conference earlier this year, will help provide a “long-term, sustainable future” for the site.

More than 400 jobs were lost at the oil refinery as owners Petroineos transitioned it to a fuel import terminal.

The company said the facility was losing large amounts of money every day.

Speaking on BBC Scotland’s The Sunday Show, the energy minister said his Government was engaging with businesses on new projects for the area.

“We’ve had some really positive meetings around potential investors,” he said.

“In fact, there’s more than 80 potential investors come forward.

“Scottish Enterprise is driving forward due diligence on that.

“There’s a number of really credible projects that we’re developing at the moment.

“We hope we’ll have some really positive announcements to say soon.”

Mr Shanks said the “unprecedented” £200 million investment from the National Wealth Fund would help “create the jobs of the future” while providing the security of long-term investment.

He added: “I’m hopeful we will have announcements soon.

“I’m not involved in the due diligence, as you wouldn’t expect, but there are some really exciting, viable projects coming forward that will deliver jobs in Grangemouth long into the future.”

Following the announcement by Petroineos to close the plant, the Scottish and UK governments funded Project Willow, a report which laid out the potential future of the site in areas such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Earlier this week, Jan Robertson, Grangemouth director for Scottish Enterprise, said he had received a “mixture of inquiries” from businesses, including those interested in the site as well as some which “have a good opportunity to become projects in the relatively near-term”.

“What I mean by that is the next three to four years,” she told Holyrood’s Economy and Fair Work Committee.

Scotland’s Net Zero Secretary Gillian Martin said at the committee that the “door’s not closed” to companies and inquiries could still be made about working at Grangemouth, adding that Petroineos had also received approaches.

Ms Martin said she was hopeful for the future of Grangemouth.

“We could look back five years and start pointing fingers, but the most important thing is that in the last year – actually the last six months – Project Willow and the task force have moved things along in a way that’s been swift, agile, focused,” she said.

“I am feeling so much more confident than I did this time last year in the prospects for that site.”

Ms Martin added that she hoped, with approval from the cabinet, a just transition plan for Grangemouth would be published next week.

To date, the only SSTs to see regular service have been Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144.

Concorde is a British-French supersonic airliner. Concorde began scheduled flights with British Airways and Air France in January 1976. The Concorde had a top cruising speed of 2.179 km/h, or Mach 2.04, more than twice the speed of sound, allowing the aircraft to reduce the flight time between London and New York to about 3 hours. AF flew its last commercial flight on 30 May 2003, and BA retired its Concorde fleet on 24 October 2003.

One aircraft was scrapped in 1994, and another was destroyed in the Air France Flight 4590 crash shortly after taking off, with all 109 occupants and four on the ground killed 2000. And it was the end of the Concorde era.

Tupolev Tu-144, a Soviet supersonic passenger airliner designed by Tupolev, was in operation from 1968 to 1999. The Tu-144 was the world's first commercial supersonic transport aircraft, with a top speed of 2,430 km/h, Mach 2.35. The Tu-144 was bigger and faster than Concorde. Tupolev-144 crash... The incident at the 1973 Paris Air Show happened when the Tu-144 swerved to avoid a French Mirage IIIR fighter jet, which had taken off before the accident.

The flights were expensive, mainly shuttling business people and the rich and famous. Concorde was a product of the analog era when the idea of flying to London or New York for the day for an important business meeting seemed like a necessary thing. Today, in a world of remote work and video meetings, maybe for that reason, we don't need the supersonic flights. Cheaper, larger, and more efficient airliners (the Boeing 747 entered commercial service in 1970) blew Concorde out. Concorde may be gone, but that doesn't mean that supersonic passenger flights are over. The US is determined to restore supersonic air travel for all, and aerospace agencies and manufacturers are proceeding along this course. 14, 16, and more flight hours are awful.

Cutting it down to 4 will be great. SS doesn't make sense for short distances, but for trans-Pacific and Atlantic, it does. SS needs to climb to a very high altitude to make it practical. Eliminating the sonic boom and reducing costs are problems. Concorde was extremely fuel inefficient when taking off and accelerating. If those problems could be solved, a return to supersonic flight would become a definite possibility. Noise is a real problem for supersonic flight. A supersonic plane causes disturbances called 'sonic booms.' In 1970, sonic boom concerns led the United States government to ban supersonic passenger flight over land in the U.S.

Safety concerns, deafening sonic booms, high prices, and a crash in France in July 2000 spelled the end for Concorde. A future for supersonic travel relies on solving some or all of the issues Concorde faced. Endeavors by Boom Supersonic, Exosonic, Spike Aerospace, and several major airlines are putting the possibility of supersonic back in the game. American company Boom Supersonic has an ambitious goal to have supersonic airliners carrying passengers by 2029. Boom Aviation completed the production of its Overture passenger jet in the facility in Greensboro, NC. Deliveries are scheduled for 2027, supposedly.

The plane will be much improved over the Concorde in fuel efficiency and 50% longer range. In terms of gas guzzling (Boom Supersonic Overture), they plan to use up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel to reduce emissions and their carbon footprint.

Modern design methods and modern aerospace materials such as titanium and carbon fiber should allow Overture to weigh much less than Concorde, improving efficiency. An airliner called Overture can fly at Mach 1.7, and flying supersonically can drastically decrease flight times. The Boom company claims a trip from New York to Rome on Overture could take just four hours, cutting journey times to as little as half of their subsonic equivalents. Boom Supersonic XB-1 became the first civilian aircraft to fly supersonically since Concorde. The plane speed (with Mach numbers greater than 1) is faster than the speed of sound (meaning 'to break the sound barrier'). As the plane flies, it disturbs the air in front of it, and in supersonic flights, these disturbances combine to form shock waves around the vehicle.

The only manned aircraft to fly in the low hypersonic regime were the X-15 and the Space Shuttle during re-entry. The X-15 used a rocket propulsion system to achieve sustained Mach 6 flight. For Mach numbers greater than 5, the frictional heating of the airframe by the air becomes so high that very special nickel alloys are required for the structure.

With modern technological advances, supersonic passenger travel will become a reality, and the technology will build an ambitious aircraft that will be available in the foreseeable future. The hypersonic jet concept...is one of them, designed to travel at an incredible speed of 5-10 Mach. This conceptual supersonic aircraft (Paradoxal hypersonic) looks like a futuristic version of the B-2 stealth bomber. The paradoxical hypersonic jet has a flat fuselage with integrated delta wings. The Paradoxal is powered by a dual-engine system called the R4E, which delivers a two-stage journey. In the first stage, the hypersonic aircraft can accelerate to Mach 3.0 and climb to 60,000 feet using air-breathing engines. And in the second stage kicks in, introducing liquid oxygen into the propulsion system, which turns it into the rocket engine.

This will propel aircraft to Mach 5 and beyond, taking them to the edge of space. The hypersonic military jet (the fictional Darkstar jet) in the actor Tom Cruise's film Top Gun: Maverick had a top speed of Mach 10. Many scenes in the movie break numerous laws of physics. Flying at such speed and altitude would have dire consequences on the human body. The Stratolaunch aircraft is being used to test high-speed hypersonic flight research vehicles. Stratolaunch recently completed two successful test flights of its new hypersonic plane. The Talon-A2 autonomous plane flew faster than Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, before landing at the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

It was the first time a hypersonic test aircraft was flown in the United States since NASA left the X-15 program in 1968. Other companies in California and Georgia are also working on hypersonic engines and airframes. China, Russia, and the U.S. have been working on hypersonic aircraft for decades. Hypersonic flight is flight through the atmosphere below altitudes of about 90 km at speeds greater than Mach 5. The idea of hypersonic aviation is becoming more and more clear every year. On the civil side, hypersonic flight remains a long-term ambition, with research targeting Mach 5 passenger aircraft that could drastically reduce intercontinental travel times. China revealed a new hypersonic fighter jet that reaches the speed of light, surpassing Mach 5 and setting records in ways we could only imagine.

The Soviet hypersonic fighter MIG-15 achieved greater speed, a higher service ceiling, and heavier armament. With the creation of the 6th generation of hypersonic fighter concepts and its powerful and lethal air fighters, Russia is ready to dominate the world with its unrivaled military technology. Russia has created the ultimate weapon, the Sukhoi-57, designed with stealth technology. Northrop Grumman has successfully demonstrated GPS-independent navigation using a cutting-edge inertial measurement unit aboard its hypersonic test vehicle. The fastest jet in the world is NASA’s X-43 hypersonic experimental plane. Three of these were built in total. Thanks to its scramjet design, it was able to reach a speed of Mach 9.9, or 11,854 km/h. This is the future of air combat.

The hypersonic weapons are capable of traveling at hypersonic speed, defined as above Mach 5 (hypersonic missiles, hypersonic glide vehicles). Most supersonic military fighter aircraft are designed to fly at subsonic speeds and only to exceed the speed of sound for short periods, such as when intercepting an enemy aircraft. Supersonic military aircraft continue to be developed, focusing on enhancing speed, agility, and stealth capabilities. Programs like the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation air dominance and other international projects are focused on the requirements for the next generation of supersonic fighter jets. Key research areas include improving supersonic cruise efficiency, maneuverability at high speeds, and minimizing radar signatures. Hypersonic technologies may also be poised to revolutionize military systems by enabling vehicles that travel above Mach 5 with high maneuverability, making them nearly impossible to intercept.

Technology can be developed rapidly... The question is, do we need to go so fast?

Elon Musk debuts revolutionary hypersonic aircraft, which could be nearing the speed of light, which has sparked global shock waves. And it can use microwave energy. Concorde needed as much as eight times more fuel compared to a Boeing 747. The cost of developing, building, and testing a plane is pretty high. Development of modern jetliners runs into multiple billions of dollars, and maybe there will not be sufficient demand for a large production. Engineers take years and years of development, and a brand new one costs billions of dollars. Whether the issue of the sonic noise can be overcome remains to be seen. Prohibitively high costs are among the reasons both Soviet Union and the United States abandoned their quest for supersonic passenger flight.

The commercial aviation supersonic market is currently not a priority. But if it does ever take off again, we are more likely to see success in the business aviation market rather than with large-scale commercial planes. Of course, there is still hope that we could one day be whizzing around the world in a few hours. If the NASA project is successful and operational costs can somehow be lowered, supersonic jets can cover longer distances in a few hours. But we might have to wait a little longer. With modern technological advances, it will be interesting to see whether supersonic passenger travel once again becomes a reality or even goes mainstream. Only time will tell. The only possible way supersonic flights could return would be if someone like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos decided to bankroll the entire project and were fine with the massive overhead costs.",https://media.meer.com/attachments/274a03d71f3e6d75acfc3a40e87e0ded77f2f337/store/fill/860/645/92149f88ebc68636cf65ffa92b743058fb888a3cd7f7578de29ed9b211b0/Talon-A-An-autonomous-reusable-testbed-that-makes-flight-testing-more-accessible-and-affordable.jpg,N,,2025-06-15 13:02:13.562696

The European Commission is rolling out a major SAF subsidy scheme to accelerate the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel, offering up to €6 ($7) per litre to narrow the yawning cost gap between green fuels and conventional jet kerosene.

Funded through the auctioning of 20 million carbon permits under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the support package could underwrite around 216 million litres of SAF. Airlines will be able to apply for funding later this year.

Under the scheme, airlines can claim the maximum €6 for synthetic e-fuel, widely considered cleaner and more sustainable than alternatives. For bio-based SAF, just €0.50 would be claimable.

The heavy emphasis on e-fuels in this package reflects the EU’s desire to back a scalable, feedstock-light solution. But only a handful of e-fuel plants are operational, with some like INERATEC in Frankfurt producing their first litres in the last few weeks.

It’s the boldest financial intervention yet in Europe’s quest to decarbonise aviation. But despite its headline-grabbing size, the subsidy may not be enough to get sustainable fuels off the ground at the scale regulators hope for.

SAF subsidies don’t solve the issue of supply

Even at its upper limit, the fund would account for just a fraction of the SAF volumes needed to meet upcoming blending mandates.

Under the ReFuelEU mandate, the EU’s targets ramp up quickly. The currently mandated 2% will increase to 6% by 2030, and 70% by 2050. Within this, there’s also a sub-target for a proportion to be e-fuels: 1.2% by 2030, and 35% by 2050.

Global SAF production stood at only around 1.3 billion litres in 2024, while airline fuel consumption rose to an estimated 99 billion gallons – around 450 billion litres. Available SAF was less than 0.3% of airline fuel demand, and none of it was e-SAF.

A handful of e-SAF plants are underdevelopment or have recently come online, but to reach the ambitions of ReFuelEU and aviation’s net zero goal, more are needed. In Europe alone, dozens more have been proposed, but are yet to break ground due to a lack of Final Investment Decisions (FIDs).

For fuel producers and project developers, the announcement provides a stronger business case, but not a bankable one. Without longer-term guarantees or revenue certainty mechanisms, few will risk FIDs on new SAF facilities, particularly for costlier synthetic e-fuels.

Do SAF mandates really work?

While more is needed to get the fledgling e-SAF industry off the ground, the EU’s commitment is a good start.

For airlines faced with increasingly demanding mandates, the promise of financial help will be a welcome relief. Current SAF supplies cost between three and five times more than conventional jet fuel.

IATA has said that SAF production in 2025 could reach 2.5 billion litres, or around 0.7% of airline total fuel consumption. However, it warns that this could cost the industry dearly.

“Even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill,” says Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

The Association further warns that mandates are only serving to artificially inflate the price of SAF. The expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased in 2025 to meet European mandates should cost $1.2 billion at market prices.

However, producers, who are liable to fines if they don’t meet blending mandates, are now passing on compliance fees to customers. IATA estimates this will add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices to the SAF purchased in Europe this year.

“Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel,” IATA warns.

While airlines may welcome the news that some funding will be available to help offset the cost of SAF purchases, it’s not all good news.

:The global push for sustainable energy and carbon-neutral fuels has accelerated the innovation in biomass-to-energy conversion. Traditional methods like combustion, gasification, and anaerobic digestion are being enhanced with cutting-edge technologies to improve efficiency, scalability, and environmental performance. People are now talking about next-generation thermochemical conversion.

Advanced gasification with carbon capture is generating much interest. The integrated gasification combined cycle now incorporates carbon capture and storage (CCS), enabling bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Plasma gasification using high-temperature plasma arcs improves syngas purity and handles diverse feedstocks including agricultural waste, and sludge. Whilst catalytic gasification using Ni, Fe, or Ru catalysts enhances hydrogen yield while reducing tar formation is entering the market.

Pyrolysis technology has seen advancement. The microwave-assisted pyrolysis provides faster, more uniform heating, increasing bio-oil yields. Whilst the ex-situ catalytic upgrading using zeolites like HZSM-5 converts bio-oil into drop-in biofuels such as renewable diesel and jet fuel. Co-pyrolysis with plastics improves energy density and reduces waste. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) for wet biomass converts algae, sewage sludge, and food waste into biocrude without drying. And supercritical water gasification (SCWG) breaks down biomass at high pressure/temperature, producing clean syngas.

We have also witnessed breakthroughs in biochemical and hybrid conversion. These include anaerobic digestion, AD, fermentation, and microbial electrolysis. A two-stage AD systems separate hydrolysis and methanogenesis, boosting biogas yields by 20-30%. Co-digestion with food waste, manure, or algae optimizes nutrient balance and methane production.

Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) use microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) to convert organic matter into hydrogen plus electricity. The consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) for cellulosic ethanol capitalises on engineered microbes such as clostridium thermocellum to simultaneously break down cellulose and ferment sugars, thereby reducing enzyme costs. Whereas CRISPR-edited yeast and bacteria improve ethanol tolerance and yield. Algae-to-biofuel innovations have made progress. The genetic modification of algae strains (Chlorella, Nannochloropsis) produces higher lipid content. Whilst photobioreactors with AI-controlled lighting and CO₂ dosing can maximize growth rates.

The emerging technologies and hybrid systems include Waste-to-Energy (WtE) with advanced sorting. AI-powered waste sorting robots improve feedstock quality for gasification. Whilst the pyrolysis of non-recyclable plastics plus biomass creates high-energy synfuels. AI and machine learning enables real-time monitoring of gasification and pyrolysis reactors using IoT sensors. And predictive algorithms adjust temperature, pressure, and catalysts for maximum efficiency. Biorefineries co-produce biofuels, biochemicals, and fertilizers. Carbon-negative systems (biochar sequestration) enhance sustainability.

What then are the challenges and future outlook? The key barriers include high capital costs for advanced systems, feedstock variability affecting conversion efficiency, and policy and market incentives needed for scaling. Future trends include small-scale modular gasifiers and digesters for decentralized energy, solar-powered biomass conversion for net-zero operations, hydrogen production from biomass via supercritical water gasification, and bio-aviation fuels (SAF) from lignocellulosic waste.

Biomass-to-energy technology is clearly rapidly evolving beyond traditional combustion and anaerobic digestion. Catalytic processes, AI-driven optimization, and hybrid systems are pushing efficiencies to new heights while enabling carbon-negative energy solutions. The next decade will likely see commercial-scale BECCS, waste-integrated biorefineries, and cost-competitive biofuels dominating the sector.

Plasma gasification, a cutting-edge thermochemical process that uses extremely high temperatures (3,000–7,000°C) generated by an electrical plasma arc to convert biomass into syngas and heat is set to make heads turn. Unlike conventional gasification, plasma torches provide precise, ultra-high-temperature conditions, enabling near-complete breakdown of complex feedstocks with minimal tar or char formation.

Plasma torch ionizes gas into plasma using an electric arc. In the gasification chamber, biomass is exposed to plasma heat, breaking their molecular bonds. The syngas cleanup system removes particulates, acids (HCl, H₂S), and trace contaminants. The vitrification unit makes inorganic residues melt into inert, glass-like non-leachable slag.

The future should potentially see green hydrogen production using plasma gasification plus electrolysis. Machine learning would adjust torch parameters in real-time. Plasma gasification represents a paradigm shift in waste-to-energy and biomass conversion, offering unmatched feedstock flexibility, near-zero emissions, and high-value outputs including syngas, hydrogen, and vitrified slag.

While energy costs and scale-up challenges remain, advancements in renewable-powered plasma, hybrid catalysis, and modular systems are driving commercialization. The next frontier technologies would include plasma-assisted bioenergy carbon capture for carbon-negative energy. And plasma gasification of algae for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). With all such technology developments on the horizon, it is pertinent for biomass-rich Malaysia to plan a coordinated investment in the relevant R&D.

After the planes tore down The Mall and over Buckingham Palace — leaving their famous red, white and blue smoke trails — details were released of the historic moment.

A renewable biofuel, made from hydro-treated vegetable oil that does not release new carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, was used to create smoke trails.

“His Majesty hopes to be an early adopter whose example will encourage wider use across the aviation sector.”

Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales took a front row royal seat as she returned to full participation in Trooping the Colour — while also keeping a watchful eye on her three children.

Kate, 43, shared a dais at Horse Guards Parade with the King, 76, and Queen Camilla, 77, after being forced to watch much of last year’s event backstage as she was recovering from cancer.

She could not resist tapping her feet to the military music on parade and glancing over at hubby Prince William, 42, who was on horseback alongside Prince Edward and Princess Anne.

Executive Summary

The aviation sector is in a critical position where it must switch to environmentally friendly alternatives in order to lessen its impact on the environment. The implementation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in airline business models is thoroughly examined in this thesis, which uses the Business Model Canvas (BMC) and the Triple Layered Business Model Canvas (TLBMC) as its primary conceptual frameworks. A thorough examination of the airlines' SAF pricing tactics and business models has been conducted, considering the sustainability of the environment, the economy, and society. This has made it possible to identify strategies that will effectively encourage the use of sustainable jet fuel.

LanzaJet’s core mission aligns with urgent climate imperatives facing aviation—a sector responsible for up to 3% of global carbon emissions and projected to grow despite incremental operational efficiencies. The company’s technology, based on patented ethanol-to-jet (ATJ) processes, is widely regarded as a leading contender for decarbonizing air travel at scale. By converting widely available ethanol into SAF, LanzaJet presents a viable pathway for legacy carriers and new entrants alike to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with traditional jet fuels—a claim substantiated by industry reviews and the U.S. Department of Energy.

Microsoft’s participation adds credibility. The company’s own sustainability strategy, which includes direct investment in SAF projects and pioneering commitments to procurement of SAF certificates, exemplifies the emerging model of “climate-aligned capital plus commercial demand.” By integrating LanzaJet’s output into its own supply chain and emissions calculations, Microsoft is not only hedging operational risk but also sending a clear market signal about the viability and necessity of low-carbon fuels for business travel and logistics.

Recent Milestones and Industry Recognition​

LanzaJet’s progress has not gone unnoticed. The company’s inclusion in the 2024 TIME100 Most Influential Companies list, alongside recognition from S&P Global and Reuters, underscores both its technological leadership and its role as a bellwether for the clean energy transition. These accolades are backed by the deployment of LanzaJet’s technology at commercial scale, as evidenced at Freedom Pines Fuels and with expansion projects in Europe and Asia reportedly underway, according to both public statements and independent industry sources.

LanzaJet’s continued expansion coincides with a broader surge in SAF project investment, government policy support (such as tax credits and blending requirements in the U.S. and EU), and the formation of public-private alliances designed to accelerate net-zero targets by 2050. Within this context, early-mover advantage, robust IP (intellectual property), and effective partnerships provide critical differentiation.

Risk Assessment: Scaling Complexity and Market Realities​

Despite its notable strengths, LanzaJet’s path is not without challenges. Several potential risks merit scrutiny:

Feedstock Availability and Pricing: SAF scalability depends on the adequate, sustainable, and competitively priced supply of ethanol feedstock. Disruptions in agricultural markets, commodity price volatility, or increased competition from bio-based plastics and chemicals could constrain supply and drive up costs.

Market Adoption and Policy Risk: While corporate demand for SAF is increasing, supported by airline sustainability mandates and voluntary corporate procurement, price premiums and regulatory uncertainty persist. The future of policy incentives (e.g., tax credits under U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, EU mandates) remains subject to change with shifting political climates.

Technology Risk: Though LanzaJet’s ATJ pathway is already commercialized, continued innovation is vital for maintaining competitiveness with other SAF production routes, such as Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA-based (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) fuels. Further R&D and strategic alliances are required to fend off both incremental and disruptive competition.

Digital Integration Challenges: Migrating mission-critical systems to Azure offers clear security and operational advantages, but also carries integration risks, including data migration, staff retraining, and the need for ongoing cybersecurity vigilance.

LanzaJet appears acutely aware of these risks, focusing on digital resilience and supply chain transparency as key mitigants—a stance supported by their adoption of Azure’s federated data platform and advanced analytics toolsets.

The Next Frontier: Merging Digital Transformation with Climate Action​

The convergence of digital transformation and sustainable fuel production represents an emerging paradigm in clean tech. As LanzaJet scales its SAF projects and supply chain, Azure enables a single pane-of-glass visibility into plant operations worldwide, while automating complex reporting for regulators, partners, and customers alike. Cloud-based IoT edge computing, real-time anomaly detection, and secure blockchain-backed emissions accounting are all now within reach.

This infrastructure not only drives LanzaJet’s internal efficiency but also facilitates external collaboration with airlines, logistics providers, and government entities that demand—and increasingly legislate—end-to-end data transparency and chain-of-custody assurances for renewable fuels. As regulatory bodies in the EU and North America tighten requirements on emissions verification and SAF blending thresholds, integrated digital solutions become prerequisites for commercial success.

Market Impact: A Blueprint for the Sector​

By aligning with a global technology partner like Microsoft, LanzaJet establishes an operational template for SAF innovators and adjacent clean energy ventures. The partnership is also instructive for established airlines, logistics firms, and corporate sustainability leaders seeking to integrate decarbonization into their procurement and travel programs.

For Microsoft, continued support of LanzaJet strengthens its reputation not only as a technology provider but as an active participant in the circular carbon economy. The company’s willingness to commit capital, serve as an early SAF offtaker, and provide digital infrastructure signals a new model of enterprise engagement on climate—one that goes beyond marketing to drive sectoral change.

Looking Ahead: The Stakes for 2030 and Beyond​

The sustainable fuels sector is bracing for a steep growth curve over the next five years, fueled by escalating regulatory mandates, investor pressure, and corporate net-zero pledges. LanzaJet’s ability to rapidly scale production, ensure feedstock traceability, and build digital trust with partners and regulators may determine its long-term competitiveness in a market projected to reach $131 billion globally by 2030, according to multiple market research firms.

As of today, LanzaJet’s Azure-powered global platform is positioned to deliver:

Rapid project onboarding and cross-region expansion

Real-time performance monitoring and adaptive optimization

Robust audit trails for emissions and feedstock sustainability

Secure, scalable infrastructure capable of accommodating future innovations in advanced fuels and digital services

These outcomes are not guaranteed, but the blueprint provided by the LanzaJet-Microsoft alliance is widely viewed as one of the most promising in sustainable aviation.

Critical Analysis: A Promising Partnership, Real-World Hurdles​

The LanzaJet-Microsoft partnership stands as a compelling case study in sectoral innovation, with both measurable strengths and persistent uncertainties. The integration of capital, commercial offtake, and digital infrastructure represents a “triple-layer” partnership model that enhances resilience and accelerates climate impact.

Nevertheless, the path ahead will require deft navigation of feedstock, policy, and technological risks. The conversion of cloud-native insights into bottom-line operational efficiency and regulatory compliance will be tested as LanzaJet moves from project demonstration to high-volume, global deployments. Any expansion of this model must contend with mounting scrutiny over the true sustainability of feedstocks and the ongoing threat of greenwashing, particularly as the SAF market matures.

For WindowsForum.com readers—many of whom shape technology strategy, manage hybrid infrastructure, or advise on enterprise cloud and sustainability integrations—the lessons are clear: digital platforms are not only enablers of business transformation but are now inextricably linked to the delivery of global climate solutions. Partner selection, data transparency, and security must be prioritized just as highly as production efficiency.

Conclusion​

The expansion of LanzaJet’s partnership with Microsoft, underscored by the adoption of Azure as the core digital backbone, is both a validation of SAF’s commercial momentum and a signpost for the future merger of cleantech and cloud. If successfully scaled, LanzaJet’s integrated approach could redefine standards for transparency, accountability, and climate stewardship across the global aviation industry.

As climate deadlines loom and investment in sustainable infrastructure accelerates, the lessons from this multi-leveled collaboration offer practical insight—and a touchstone for what works—in the race to decarbonize critical sectors while maintaining operational integrity and digital trust.

The King has celebrated his official birthday with an eco-friendly flypast by the Red Arrows and a minute’s silence for all those killed in the Air India plane disaster.

Trooping the Colour was a display of military pomp and pageantry but Charles asked for the traditional programme to include the remembrance, and for senior royals and officers taking part to wear black armbands as a mark of respect.

When the royal family gathered later on Buckingham Palace’s balcony they acknowledged thecrowds and watched an aerial display of vintage and modern aircraft with the Red Arrows’ finale powered by a blend of sustainable aviation fuel.

The world-famous acrobatic team also used vegetable oil to produce their trademark red, white and blue vapour trails over the royal residence – believed to be a first.

Trooping, also known as the King’s Birthday Parade, fell silent after Charles had inspected hundreds of troops on Whitehall’s Horse Guards Parade from a carriage with the Queen by his side.

The moment of reflection acknowledged the aviation disaster on Thursday that killed 241 passengers and crew, including more than 50 British nationals, and around 30 people on the ground.

Charles led the royal colonels in wearing black armbands, with the Prince of Wales, Colonel of the Welsh Guards, Princess Royal, Colonel Blues and Royals, and the Duke of Edinburgh, Colonel Scots Guards, all wearing bands on their left arms.

George, Charlotte and Louis joined other members of the royal family, including the Duchess of Edinburgh in theformer office of the Duke of Wellington, to watch the spectacle in honour of their grandfather.

Kate took her place next to the King and Queen on the dais, in her role as Colonel of the Irish Guards – a symbolic position and one she was unable to take up last year because she was receiving cancer treatment, and instead watched the ceremony with her children.

Trooping the Colour is as much a social occasion as a ceremonial celebration, and stands around Horse Guards Parade were filled with around 8,000 wives, girlfriends and parents of the guardsmen and officers on parade.

The minute’s silence was observed when Charles and Camilla returned to the dais, following an announcement to the spectators and a bugler sounding the Last Post.

The European plane maker has announced plans to increase the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of both the A330-900 and A330-800 variants. This will provide airlines with increased range, payload, and flexibility.

Revealed at a recent industry event, the upgrade is expected to roll out by mid-2026. The A330-900, the more popular of the two variants, will see the MTOW increase from 251 to 257 tons. That will be approximately six tons higher than the earlier maximum takeoff weight.

That six-ton bump may sound modest on paper, but in practice, it means the aircraft can fly farther or carry more passengers and cargo, without compromise. The A330-800 will also get a similar upgrade, expanding its capability despite its more limited presence in global fleets.

Airbus A330neo New Variant

The A330neo series entered service in 2018. The A330neo has carved out a niche as a cost-effective and fuel-efficient widebody ever since its existence. It often served as a bridge between the single-aisle and the larger A350.

A330neos are powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines and feature aerodynamic improvements over the older A330ceo.

The A330neo burns up to 25% less fuel per seat. That efficiency, paired with a lower acquisition cost than the Boeing 787, has made it a favorite for airlines looking to manage long-haul ops without overspending.

With the MTOW upgrade, Airbus is clearly responding to airline feedback. Carriers are looking for aircraft that can do more: operate ultra-long-haul flights, handle freight-heavy missions, or serve hot-and-high airports where takeoff performance is a challenge.

The A330neo isn’t just about numbers and fuel burn. Its Airspace cabin concept brings in larger overhead bins, modern mood lighting, quieter interiors, and wider seats, giving passengers a smoother, more comfortable ride.

And for airlines, that comfort is part of the competitive edge, especially in markets like Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where product differentiation on long-haul routes is crucial.

Positioned for a Broader Market Battle

This move also sharpens Airbus’s position against Boeing’s 787, especially in areas where every extra kilogram of payload or every nautical mile of range counts.

The A330neo already undercuts the Dreamliner in terms of list price and operational costs. Now, with better performance, the aircraft becomes an even more attractive package, particularly for carriers operating in challenging environments.

Airlines planning to buy the A330neo aircraft—like Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, and Etihad—stand to benefit from the improved MTOW. This is especially true on routes where passenger and cargo volumes are both high. The Asia-Pacific and Gulf regions, in particular, could see a lot more A330neo activity in the coming years.

Beyond the performance bump, Airbus continues to optimize the A330neo’s production line. The use of automated assembly and lighter-weight materials ensures the aircraft stays efficient and cost-competitive.

The A330neo is also certified for up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with Airbus actively exploring ways to push that number higher as the industry aims for net-zero emissions by 2050.

Bottom line

In a market where widebody aircraft are expected to do more with less, Airbus’s decision to upgrade the A330neo is both timely and strategic.

The A330neo will have increased payload and range, lower fuel consumption, and strong passenger appeal. Airbus is proving that the A330 is not just a stopgap—it’s a serious contender for airlines looking to future-proof their fleets.

And with these enhancements on the horizon, the A330neo is no longer just the sensible option—it’s becoming the smart one.

Join us again on Monday, where we will be sharing the latest royal news. Good night and enjoy the weekend!

The royals you missed

While many of the royal attendees were seen out on the Buckingham Palace, some were more behind-the-scenes. Lord Frederik Windsor and Lady Frederik Windsor were also in attendance, with Sophie wearing a gorgeous purple dress.

The drastic change Prince William made this year

In an unexpected royal first, Prince William embraced his recent hair transformation and kept his beard for Trooping the Colour this year.

Ever since he first started growing it out, he's caused quite the stir, especially as he hadn't been pictured with any facial hair in over 15 years!

Given the strict grooming and style guidelines for the event, how did the Prince of Wales get away with it? Find out here.

William and Kate's latest post

William and Kate have marked the end of a busy day by sharing a new photo from their Kensington Palace home. The sweet image features all three of their beaming children. How cute!!

A quiet tribute to Princess Diana

I know, we've spoken a lot about Princess Kate's outfit today, but can you blame us?

One thing you might've missed is that she used her clothing to pay a major fashion tribute to her late mother-in-law.

In her beautiful Catherine Walker coat dress, Princess Kate harked back to one of Princess Diana's most iconic style moments. Get all the details here.

Surprise honours

While today has understandably been all about King Charles, the monarch still ended up finding a way to work, appointing two new Field Marshals. Congratulations go out to Lord Richards of Herstmonceaux and Lord Houghton of Richmond!

Blink and you'll miss it!

In an incredibly quick interaction, Prince William corrected his eldest son when the family were stood together on the balcony.

During the final few moments of the flypast, he was captured making a subtle signal to Prince Louis, to give him guidance.

We got another glimpse of the father-of-three truly clicking into 'dad mode' for a few seconds – find out more about this blink-and-you-miss-it moment here.

Extended members of the royal family pictured

While the main members of the royal family took centre stage at Horse Guards Parade, several extended royal family members were spotted watching the event from the windows of the Major General’s Office including Lord Frederick Windsor and the Earl and Countess of St Andrews.

A thank you from Charles

King Charles has taken to social media to personally thank everyone involved in making this year’s Trooping the Colour a success.

Alongside a heartwarming highlight reel from the day — which even includes a sweet moment of the King feeding carrots to the horses — His Majesty wrote a message of gratitude to all those who took part in the spectacular celebration.

""A huge thank you to our Military personnel for a truly triumphant Trooping today! Over 1,000 soldiers, around 200 horses and approximately 300 musicians came together in a display of Military precision, horsemanship and fanfare to mark The King’s official birthday. And what a great way to conclude the celebrations, with a flypast from our friends @RAFRedArrows flying for the first time with a mix of sustainable aviation fuel.""

And here's the video....

We’ve found the clip of Prince George and Prince Louis' interaction on the balcony — and it’s a must-see!

Keep calm, Louis!

In a newly released photo, Prince George appears keen to keep his younger brother Louis relatively calm during their time on the balcony.

Seven-year-old Louis can be seen enthusiastically waving while others focused on the flypast.

What do you think of the moment? A glimpse of royal sibling teamwork?

Charlotte's Alice in Wonderland moment

Many royal fans have already compared Princess Charlotte's Trooping look to Alice in Wonderland’s iconic blue dress — and it’s easy to see why!

The soft blue shade, the classic silhouette, and that sweet bow detail definitely channel storybook magic. Do you see the resemblance?

Nanny Maria on duty

With both the Prince and Princess of Wales attending the parade, their children - Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis - are being cared for by their nanny, Maria, inside the former office of the Duke of Wellington.

Tell us what you think!

Why didn't Prince Louis wear shorts to Trooping this year?

Royal watchers may have noticed that Prince Louis didn’t wear shorts to Trooping the Colour this year — and many are wondering why.

According to British etiquette expert William Hanson, there’s a traditional reason behind the royal dress code for young boys. In a 2018 interview with HELLO!, he explained:

“Upper-class and upper-middle-class parents believe that little boys should look like little boys, and so try to keep their offspring looking as cute and innocent for as long as possible. Young boys usually transition into trousers around age seven.”

Charles amused by Prince Louis

Pictures are still coming in — and look at this gem! King Charles looked thoroughly amused by his grandson Prince Louis during their time together on the balcony.

Strong neck muscles

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Well, actually - it’s the Red Arrows, and totally worth the neck strain afterwards!

What a view!

This is the view the royal family saw from the balcony - isn't it incredible? And just look at that blue sky!

What happens after the royals leave the balcony?

Ever wondered what the Royal Family does once the flypast is over? According to former royal butler Grant Harrold they head off for lunch!

""I’m not sure exactly which room they use for lunch, but there’s a good chance it’s the Chinese Drawing Room, which is often used as a dining room for the family. They have a private lunch, finishing with coffee and tea,"" he says.

""Depending on other engagements and commitments, some royals might leave straight after lunch, while others stay a bit longer. They can retreat to one of the sitting or drawing rooms on the private side of the Palace to have conversations. Knowing the King, he’s always busy, so once lunch is done, you’ll typically see the cars leaving as he heads back to Highgrove or Clarence House — most likely Highgrove.""

Behind-the-scenes photos

As we mentioned earlier in the blog, the Prince and Princess of Wales have shared a number of behind-the-scenes photos from today’s event on their Flickr account — and we’ve rounded them all up for you in this fantastic gallery. It’s a must-see!

One happy King

Everything went off without a hitch - the sun shone, his family was by his side, and no guards fainted. It was a smooth and successful Birthday Parade for the King. And judging by his big smile, he was a very happy monarch indeed!

One last wave!

Prince Louis was the last royal to wave to the huge crowd gathered outside Buckingham Palace - and his wave game is strong!

Prince Louis - the star of the show

It’s safe to say Prince Louis absolutely loved his time on the balcony — just look at that expression!

The full balcony line-up

And here they are - all the royals watching the flypast from the Buckingham Palace balcony! What a stunning shot.

Prince Louis powering through

Prince Louis seemed to have the same struggles as his big brother — but, just like George, he powered through.

The heat, the sun, the pollen....

It all seemed to get a bit much for the Wales children during Trooping. Was it the soaring temperatures? The glaring sun? Or maybe the pollen? Either way - they powered through like pros!

First balcony shot!

The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duchess of Edinburgh, the Duke of Kent, and Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence were the first to appear on the balcony ahead of the flypast.

Brotherly love

Gorgeous photo of Prince Louis smiling up at his big brother, Prince George! Such a heartwarming sibling moment.

Catherine on mum-duty

It might be one of the biggest royal events of the year, but above all else, the Princess of Wales is a mother - and here she is, looking out for her children as they make their way back to Buckingham Palace.

The Duke of Kent on the balcony

“India’s biofuel sector is transitioning from promise to partial implementation, driven by policy tailwinds,” the report states.
Among the different biofuel categories, ethanol blending has seen the most tangible progress, achieving a blending rate of approximately 18%.
In terms of policy mechanisms, the report highlights co-firing, the practice of blending solid biofuels with coal in thermal power plants.
The report concludes that while India’s biofuel sector holds considerable potential, its success will hinge on overcoming these operational barriers and ensuring steady, segment-wide progress.","India’s biofuel industry is gradually transitioning from a phase of promise to one of partial implementation, driven by robust government policies, growing pressure to decarbonize, and a push for rural economic development, according to a recent report by YES Securities.

The report emphasizes that while government initiatives such as SAMARTH (focused on biomass), E20 (ethanol blending), and SATAT (compressed biogas or CBG) provide strong policy support, infrastructure development across various segments remains uneven.

“India’s biofuel sector is transitioning from promise to partial implementation, driven by policy tailwinds,” the report states.

Among the different biofuel categories, ethanol blending has seen the most tangible progress, achieving a blending rate of approximately 18%. This has led to visible improvements in return on capital employed (RoCE) for ethanol producers. Additionally, solid biofuels are increasingly being used in industrial applications as substitutes for coal and furnace oil, supported by both favorable economics and pressure to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) targets.

However, the compressed biogas (CBG) segment continues to face notable hurdles. These include inefficiencies in feedstock logistics, underutilised plant capacity, and a lack of infrastructure to monetise by-products—factors essential to ensuring the financial viability of CBG plants.

The report advises investors to focus on segments that are demonstrating operational traction, backed by clear policy-linked offtake arrangements and a realistic roadmap for scaling up.

In terms of policy mechanisms, the report highlights co-firing, the practice of blending solid biofuels with coal in thermal power plants. A Ministry of Power (MoP) directive from 2021 mandates that all thermal plants with a capacity above 200 MW blend at least 5% biomass starting in FY22. In stubble-burning hotspots like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, the mandated blend increases to 7%, under the SAMARTH Mission, which promotes sustainable fuel alternatives.

India’s total coal-fired power generation capacity stands at around 210 GW. A 5% biomass blend would require roughly 10.5 GW of that to be generated from biofuels, translating to an annual demand of 15–20 million metric tonnes (MMT) of biomass. This opens up a potential market exceeding ₹500 billion.

NTPC, the country’s leading public sector power utility, has emerged as a front-runner in co-firing efforts. As of early 2025, NTPC had co-fired more than 2.5 lakh tonnes of biomass at several plants, including those in Dadri and Jhajjar, with some achieving 7–10% blending levels.

Despite the policy momentum, the report flags persistent challenges. These include inconsistencies in biomass calorific value, the perishable nature of feedstock complicating logistics and storage, and the need for plant-specific modifications to ensure efficient co-firing.

The report concludes that while India’s biofuel sector holds considerable potential, its success will hinge on overcoming these operational barriers and ensuring steady, segment-wide progress.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ethanol-fuel-5.png,N,,2025-06-14 19:01:23.976318

All nine of the team's fast jets were topped up with a high-ratio blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the team’s base of RAF Waddington before they set off.

A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King was not involved in the decision but was ""delighted"" because he has been encouraging the use of the sustainable fuel on royal flights where possible.

""Using this technology is the latest example of our relentless pursuit of excellence,"" Squadron Leader Andy King, the Red Arrows' senior engineer who led the project, said.

""The flypast for His Majesty the King is the perfect opportunity to showcase this innovation.

""The vibrant vapour trails that we generate are what sets the Red Arrows apart, and so to be the first aerobatic team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.""

Jets from the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team were powered with a high-ratio blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to provide the exciting finale at today’s big event.

The flypast is also thought to be the first time anywhere in the world that a national aerobatic squadron has switched to both a SAF blend for propulsion and a renewable biofuel – known as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) – to produce its distinctive trademark vapour trails.

The team has never before flown with the sustainable fuels at a public event and follows groundbreaking trials by RAF engineers and logisticians.

In addition to reducing its carbon footprint, the move demonstrates the RAF’s commitment to new technology as well as becoming more energy-secure and less reliant on fossil fuels.

Squadron Leader Andy King, the Red Arrows’ Senior Engineering Officer and who led the pioneering fuels project, said: “Ever since the Red Arrows’ first display in 1965, the team has aimed to inspire future generations and represent the best of British – using this technology is the latest example of our relentless pursuit of excellence.

“The flypast for His Majesty The King is the perfect opportunity to showcase this innovation, on an important occasion enjoyed by so many people and in front of a big, global audience.

“The vibrant vapour trails that we generate is what sets the Red Arrows apart and so to be the first aerobatic team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.”

Squadron Leader Andy King

Red Arrows Senior Engineering Officer

“Through our use of renewable fuel options, particularly the novel use for the trails, we are demonstrating the best of science, technology, engineering and maths – themes and skills that are at the heart of the Red Arrows and the Royal Air Force as a whole.”

The RAF is working with alternative fuels to power current and future aircraft. This lessens reliance on global fossil fuel supply chains and makes it more energy-secure, improving operational resilience.

There are also environmental benefits by switching to these alternative fuels, including cutting carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.

SAF is typically made from waste-based low carbon feedstocks. This sustainable option reduces lifecycle carbon emissions, on average, by up to 80 per cent compared to the conventional jet fuel it replaces.

HVO is a premium hydrocarbon-based fuel product made of 100 per cent renewable raw materials with a chemical structure almost identical to the regular diesel traditionally used by the aerobatic team for its vapour trails.

When judged against this standard diesel, HVO reduces emissions by up to 90 per cent across its life span.

The research and work into providing the Red Arrows with the ability to switch to the new fuels was carried out in less than six months and done entirely with existing resources and people.

These studies culminated in a successful trial flight during the team’s pre-season training earlier in the year.

The smoke trails used by the Red Arrows is a well-known part of displays and flypasts but it has a crucial flight safety role too.

They allow the pilots to judge wind speed and direction – enabling them to more easily locate other aircraft when different sections of the team’s formation are several miles apart.

All nine of the Red Arrows’ British-built Hawk fast-jets were topped-up with the new fuels at the team’s home base of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, before the big flypast over London.

Sqn Ldr King said: “The beauty of these alternative fuels is how easily they can be used and with little additional work.

“Those watching the flypast enjoyed the same vibrant colour, speed and excitement that has characterised the Red Arrows across the last 60 years.”

Squadron Leader Andy King

Red Arrows Senior Engineering Officer

“The team will now look to explore further opportunities to use this innovation at other events.”

Minister for the Armed Forces, Luke Pollard, said: “The iconic Red Arrows are one of the world’s premier aerobatic display teams and by adopting a more environmentally-friendly sustainable aviation fuel, the Royal Air Force is blazing a trail as part of our work to combat climate change.

“Following our Strategic Defence Review, we are increasing our investment in advanced new technologies to ensure our Armed Forces are ready to meet the threats of tomorrow and innovative solutions like this show that we can deliver on that goal while supporting sustainability and lowering our carbon footprint.”

Air Vice-Marshal Shaun Harris, the RAF’s Director Support, said: “The King’s Birthday Flypast is the perfect event to showcase to the next generation how our adoption of low emission alternatives, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel and biofuel, can decrease our reliance on fossil fuels.

“Importantly, this technology has the potential to increase our resilience and protect our operational outputs in a more volatile world, with no loss of performance. As the Red Arrows have shown today, the RAF is adapting to ensure we can continue to fly and fight globally, using any fuel source, as these alternative supplies become more common.”",https://www.raf.mod.uk/sites/raf-beta/cache/file/27748FD8-1FAE-4808-9573C781370D04E6_600x300.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 09:59:36.407115

Sustainable practices

Reducing carbon footprint: Freight transport accounts for 8 to 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In India, achieving net zero emissions by 2070 requires a shift towards more sustainable logistics solutions. Key strategies include transitioning to low-carbon fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sustainable marine fuel (SMF), use of EVs and investing in renewable energy to power logistics operations.

Many firms are experimenting with EVs and hybrid vehicles, optimising delivery routes, and shifting freight from road to rail to cut emissions. The government has been setting regulatory targets to encourage sustainable freight practices, including SAF blending mandates.

Eco-friendly packaging, transportation: Sustainability in logistics extends beyond fuel choices to packaging and transportation methods. Many businesses are adopting biodegradable and recyclable materials to minimise waste. Pre-stretched plastic wrap film, for example, is being used to improve efficiency, while reducing plastic consumption.

Adoption of EVs is gaining momentum in last-mile delivery services, helping cut CO2 footprint in urban areas. Some companies have partnered with clean energy firms to establish dedicated EV charging infrastructure, ensuring a reliable power supply from renewable sources. Additionally, intermodal transportation—integrating rail, road, and sea freight—has proven effective in optimising efficiency and reducing environmental impact.

More Low-Carbon Fuels and electric vehicles, alternative fuels and electric mobility are at the forefront of logistics transformation. The deployment of SAF in aviation, hydrogen fuel in trucking, and SMF in shipping are reducing dependence on fossil fuels. The impact of electric vehicles adoption depends on the energy mix used for charging. Countries investing in renewable energy are better positioned to maximise carbon reduction benefits of electrified logistics. Government policies continue to drive advancements in sustainable transportation. India, for instance, has introduced EV incentives and mandates for increasing SAF use, contributing to low-carbon supply chains.

Environmental impact reduction: Technology plays a pivotal role in low-carbon supply chain practices. Companies are increasingly using AI, Machine Learning, and big data analytics to optimise routes, consolidate shipments, and improve load planning. Reverse logistics—recycling and reusing products—has gained traction, reduced waste and extending product life cycles.

Smart warehousing solutions, such as energy-efficient lighting, automated inventory management, and real-time tracking, contribute to reducing emissions and operational costs. Blockchain is being explored to enhance supply chain transparency, help businesses track emissions and meet regulatory compliance.",https://cargotalk.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PAGE-53.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 19:59:39.338674

Thousands cheered and waved flags as King Charles and Queen Camilla attended the Trooping the Colour parade to mark the monarch's official birthday.

The royal couple rode in a carriage at the front of the military procession along the Mall and into Horse Guards Parade where hundreds of guardsmen were on parade.

They were joined by members of the Royal Family, including the Prince and Princess of Wales and their children.

The occasion was marked by pomp and pageantry but, at the King's request, there was a moment of silence to remember the victims of the Air India crash and the Royal Family wore black armbands.

The disaster killed 241 passengers and crew, including more than 50 Britons, as well as at least eight people who were on the ground when the aircraft came down.

There was a very different feel to the event compared to last year, when there was feverish interest in the return to public life for Princess Catherine after her cancer treatment.

This year she could be seen smiling alongside her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and seven-year-old Prince Louis - who gave a gap-toothed grin in a carriage alongside his brother.

The King, who is still undergoing his own treatment for cancer, rode in the carriage for the second year running rather than riding on horseback.

As well as the parade the event included the traditional flypast by the Red Arrows, with the royals taking to the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch.

This year the Red Arrows went green as they used a more environmentally friendly blend of fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel and a biofuel for the trademark vapour trail.

That will have pleased the King, an environmental champion, who has been encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuel where possible on royal flights and wants to promote its wider use.

Although King Charles' birthday is 14 November, the Trooping of the Colour has long been used to mark the official birthday of the British Sovereign - in an effort to hold the event in better weather.

It is performed each June by more than 1,350 soldiers and 300 musicians, and the military parade includes an inspection by the monarch as well as music, pageantry, a gun salute, and the RAF flypast over central London.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/db9c/live/79ca8c20-491a-11f0-84b6-6bf0f66205f1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 08:59:33.903244

While the change-making move ensures cleaner skies and tremendous environmental milestones, it could also see ticket costs skyrocketing, compelling airlines and flyers into a new paradigm of high-stakes green travel and reshaping the economics of global air travel.

The aviation industry is at a critical crossroads as it faces both unprecedented growth and mounting pressure to reduce its carbon emissions. The post-pandemic surge in travel demand has pushed airlines to evaluate not only how to accommodate rising passenger numbers but also how to meet aggressive climate targets. Central to this challenge is the global push toward adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a transition that promises significant environmental benefits but comes with substantial financial implications that may ultimately impact travelers’ wallets.

The Race Toward Net-Zero by 2050

Airlines across the globe have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This ambitious goal includes adopting innovative technologies, investing in new fuel sources, and improving operational efficiency. Currently, the aviation sector contributes approximately three percent of global carbon emissions, a figure poised to rise as air travel demand continues to grow. Among the most promising solutions is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which is derived from renewable resources like waste oils and biomass. SAF has the potential to cut emissions by up to eighty percent compared to traditional jet fuel, making it a cornerstone of airlines’ decarbonization strategies.

In addition to SAF, airlines are also investing in future technologies such as hydrogen-powered and electric aircraft, though these developments remain years away from full commercial viability. Improvements in air traffic management and flight path optimization are being pursued as well, though these too require significant investment and may contribute to higher operational costs that could be passed on to consumers.

The High Price of Sustainability

The financial burden of adopting SAF is a major concern for airlines and passengers alike. The production cost of SAF is currently as much as five times higher than that of traditional jet fuel. At present, SAF represents only about 0.2 percent of the total fuel used in global commercial aviation. In order for SAF to make a meaningful impact, production capacity must increase dramatically. This expansion will also stimulate job creation in agriculture, waste management, and biofuel production industries, offering broader economic benefits.

The environmental advantages of SAF are clear. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality by cutting sulfur oxides and particulates, and may even decrease contrail formation—a contributor to global warming. Additionally, SAF production supports rural economies by creating new revenue streams for farmers who can sell crop residues as feedstocks for fuel production. As countries invest more in SAF, the industry could also promote greater energy independence by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.

The Financial Impact on Passengers

Transitioning to greener air travel will not be cheap. Airlines such as Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, and Emirates have already invested heavily in SAF research, development, and blending, often without significant government subsidies. These investments will inevitably translate into higher costs for passengers.

It’s projected that airline ticket prices could rise by up to fifteen percent by 2030 as airlines shift toward more sustainable fuel alternatives. While premium travelers may absorb these increases, budget-conscious passengers may feel the financial pinch more acutely. Some low-cost carriers may introduce separate “green fees” during booking to offset the added costs without sharply raising base fares. Maintaining a delicate balance between environmental responsibility and affordable travel will be key.

Government Support and Policy Incentives

Government intervention is essential to make SAF adoption economically feasible for airlines. While airlines bear the primary responsibility for reducing emissions, government policies can help support the transition. Tax credits, subsidies, and research funding for SAF production will be critical to drive down costs and encourage mass adoption.

Several countries and regions have already introduced SAF blending mandates that require a certain percentage of SAF to be mixed with conventional jet fuel. For example, the European Union mandates two percent SAF use by 2025, while the United States aims for three billion gallons annually by 2030. Singapore, Norway, and Japan have also implemented similar targets, demonstrating a growing global consensus on the importance of SAF in aviation’s decarbonization.

Blending mandates, combined with government financial support, could stimulate the SAF market and drive innovation in production methods, making SAF more accessible and affordable over time.

The Cost-Benefit Breakdown of SAF

Major oil companies such as Shell are already expanding SAF production to meet anticipated demand. However, to achieve the aggressive targets set for 2030 and beyond, SAF supply will need to scale up rapidly to become a dominant fuel source for the industry.

The Growing Risk of Higher Costs Deterring Passengers

As SAF becomes more integrated into commercial aviation, there is a growing concern that rising airfares could discourage some travelers, particularly those who rely on low-cost carriers. Ultra-low-cost airlines like Ryanair, Frontier Airlines, and Southwest Airlines operate on extremely thin margins and rely on affordable fuel prices to maintain their business models. If fuel prices rise significantly due to SAF adoption, these carriers may struggle to keep fares low without sacrificing profitability.

Last year, Ryanair took a proactive step by purchasing one thousand tonnes of SAF from Shell, sufficient to power approximately two hundred flights. This indicates a willingness by even low-cost carriers to adapt, though on a limited scale. Balancing affordability with sustainability will remain one of the greatest challenges for these carriers moving forward.

France’s Bold Move Toward Domestic Air Travel Reduction

Some countries have taken even more aggressive steps to curb aviation emissions. In France, new legislation introduced in 2023 restricts short-haul domestic flights on routes where rail alternatives exist. For example, air travel between Paris and cities like Nantes or Bordeaux is now prohibited if a train journey can be completed in less than two and a half hours. While connecting flights remain exempt, this policy reflects growing governmental pressure to shift short-distance travel toward greener alternatives.

This type of regulatory action could become more widespread as governments strive to meet their climate targets, further reshaping the aviation landscape in the years ahead.

The Road Ahead: Balancing Sustainability and Affordability

Achieving net-zero aviation will depend on a combination of technological innovation, government support, and passenger acceptance of potentially higher airfares. While technological advancements may eventually drive down the cost of sustainable fuels, airlines still face enormous challenges in scaling production and transitioning their fleets. The question remains whether passengers will be willing to pay more for greener flights as the global push for sustainability intensifies.

The ultra-low-cost carriers that have fueled much of aviation’s post-pandemic recovery will be tested the most. These airlines, which revolutionized air travel with their affordable prices and simplified service models, now face the difficult task of adopting expensive new fuels while maintaining accessible fares.

The US, the UAE, Singapore, Norway, Japan, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Costa Rica, the Netherlands, Germany, and Ireland are transforming aviation with sustainable aviation fuel, promising greener skies but inducing skyrocketing airfare and transforming global travel economics.

Sustainability has shifted from being a choice to becoming an absolute necessity for the aviation industry. The next few decades will determine whether airlines can successfully transform their operations and whether passengers will embrace the higher costs required to ensure a cleaner future for air travel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__12413-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-14 08:59:36.697894

This change is in line with the King's well-known passion for protecting the environment and reducing the effects of climate change. Given his well-known interest, it is likely that the monarch will be delighted to hear news of the move to sustainable aviation fuel, as it is understood that he hopes to be an ‘early adopter’ and encourage wider use across the aviation sector.

Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT

While the King did not instruct the RAF to make the change, he has previously been the mastermind behind other changes to royal transport.

The Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team will be using an estimated 40% blend of sustainable aviation fuel and normal jet fuel, as well as a renewable biofuel – Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) – for its smoke trails.

This is thought to be the first time anywhere in the world that two environmentally friendly fuels are being used at the same time by a national aerobatic team.

This fact will undoubtedly come as a joy for the monarch as he previously had his Aston Martin converted to run on a form of bioethanol made from surplus wine and cheese in 2008.

Despite warnings from the engineers about potential risks, Charles revealed: ""The engineers at Aston said, 'Oh, it'll ruin the whole thing,' I said, 'Well I won't drive it then,' so they got on with it and now they admit that it runs better and is more powerful on that fuel than it is on petrol... and also, it smells delicious as you're driving along.""

However, this wasn't the only instance where the King aimed at enhancing royal transportation. In 2007, reports surfaced detailing a trial of the royal train running on vegetable oil.

Regarding this experiment, Charles said: ""It took me a long time to battle to get them to run it on used cooking oil. Which actually, in the end, worked quite well.""

Conclusion: The End of an Era, but a Brighter Future for Air France The retirement of the Airbus A380 marks the end of an era for Air France.","In a strategic shift that has reshaped its fleet and operational dynamics, Air France has made the bold decision to retire its Airbus A380 fleet, a move that has sparked significant debate in the aviation industry. Known for its iconic double-deck design and sheer capacity, the A380 was once hailed as the future of long-haul travel. However, Air France CEO Ben Smith defended the airline’s decision to retire the aircraft, citing high operational costs and limited profitability, especially in a post-pandemic world where efficiency and sustainability are paramount.

The decision to phase out the A380 fleet was accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced airlines worldwide to reevaluate their fleet compositions, operational models, and long-term sustainability goals. Air France‘s transition away from the A380 is not just about reducing capacity; it represents a shift towards more fuel-efficient, cost-effective aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777-300ER, which promise greater profitability, environmental benefits, and operational flexibility.

As Air France moves forward with these new aircraft, the retirement of the A380 is part of a broader strategy aimed at modernizing the fleet while enhancing passenger experience and minimizing environmental impact. This bold move is reshaping Air France’s approach to long-haul flights, sustainability, and competitive positioning within the global aviation market.

Why the Airbus A380 Had to Go

The Airbus A380, a marvel of modern aviation, was designed to carry more passengers, offer more luxury, and reduce the cost per seat. However, Air France‘s experience with the aircraft highlighted several challenges that made it unsustainable in the long term. Below are key reasons for the retirement of the A380 fleet:

1. High Operational Costs

While the A380 was popular among travelers for its comfort and spaciousness, the aircraft came with substantial maintenance and operational costs. Each aircraft required heavy investments for cabin refurbishments and engine overhauls, with estimates ranging between €50-60 million ($57-$69 million) per plane. These expenses made it difficult to maintain profitability, particularly given the aircraft’s limited usage during non-peak periods.

2. Seasonal Demand and Capacity Mismatch

The A380‘s high capacity was only fully utilized during peak travel seasons, such as summer holidays and holiday periods. During off-peak times, airlines struggled to fill such large planes, resulting in a poor cost-to-revenue ratio. The A380 was simply too large for many routes, making it less efficient compared to more versatile aircraft.

3. Environmental Impact

With growing pressure to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint, the A380‘s fuel consumption became increasingly untenable. Despite its size, the aircraft’s fuel efficiency per passenger was lower than that of newer, smaller aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777, which consume less fuel and produce fewer emissions.

4. Flexibility and Operational Efficiency

Air France recognized that it needed to optimize its fleet for operational flexibility. The A380, with its massive size and complex ground operations, was less adaptable to varying demand patterns compared to newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 777-300ER provide better flexibility for long-haul routes with improved range and capacity, without the operational constraints posed by the A380.

The Shift to More Efficient Aircraft: A Focus on the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777-300ER

With the retirement of the A380, Air France is doubling down on a future that prioritizes efficiency, sustainability, and passenger comfort. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 777-300ER are integral to this strategy, and they align with the airline’s broader goals of fleet simplification and reducing environmental impact.

Airbus A350: The Future of Long-Haul Travel

The Airbus A350 has quickly become one of the most popular aircraft in the world, praised for its fuel efficiency, passenger comfort, and advanced technology. The A350 consumes 25% less fuel per passenger compared to its predecessors, making it a more environmentally friendly option for long-haul flights. The aircraft’s carbon fiber fuselage and wing design contribute to reduced drag, further improving fuel efficiency.

Moreover, the A350 offers a more modern and comfortable cabin experience with larger windows, quieter engines, and better air quality, making long flights more enjoyable for passengers.

Boeing 777-300ER: A Proven Workhorse

The Boeing 777-300ER is another cornerstone of Air France’s fleet modernization. This aircraft has been a mainstay in the airline industry for years due to its versatility, range, and fuel efficiency. It can carry a substantial number of passengers while maintaining operational efficiency and low environmental impact. The 777-300ER has been particularly successful for Air France on long-haul routes, offering both high passenger comfort and superior fuel efficiency.

Environmental Challenges and Opportunities: A Focus on Sustainability

Environmental concerns have become a central issue for the aviation industry, with regulators and the public pushing for significant reductions in emissions. In the wake of Air France’s A380 retirement, Ben Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM Group, emphasized the airline’s commitment to sustainability.

The shift from the A380 to more efficient aircraft like the A350 is a step in the right direction. The A350 is designed to be 25% more fuel-efficient than its predecessor, the A340, reducing both fuel consumption and carbon emissions. Additionally, Air France is committed to purchasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a crucial component in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

However, Smith also voiced concerns about the regulatory pressures facing European airlines. He criticized the European Commission’s environmental tax policies, which he argued place European airlines at a competitive disadvantage compared to global competitors, particularly those from regions with less stringent environmental regulations.

As Air France continues to modernize its fleet and invest in greener technologies, it remains committed to achieving a 10% SAF mandate by 2030.

The Strategic Vision Behind the A380’s Retirement

The decision to retire the A380 is part of a larger strategic vision that prioritizes long-term sustainability and economic resilience. By focusing on fuel-efficient aircraft, Air France is positioning itself for the future of air travel, where environmental sustainability and cost-effectiveness are critical to remaining competitive.

In addition to the A350 and Boeing 777-300ER, Air France is enhancing its premium product offerings. The airline’s introduction of the La Première first-class suite on select Boeing 777-300ER aircraft is designed to cater to the growing demand for luxury air travel. This move reflects Air France’s commitment to enhancing the passenger experience while focusing on profitability.

Air France’s Future Outlook: Sustainability and Innovation

Looking ahead, Air France is focused on navigating the evolving landscape of the aviation industry. With its fleet modernization efforts, the airline is poised to become a leader in sustainable aviation, delivering a blend of modern luxury, operational efficiency, and environmental responsibility.

Moreover, Air France continues to adapt to global shifts in air travel demand, influenced by factors such as the pandemic recovery and shifting passenger preferences.

I’ve been in and among the crowd today, speaking to spectators who gathered in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the ceremony and the Royal Family.

As a reminder, the Trooping the Colour is a military parade which has long been used to mark the official birthday of the British Sovereign - in an effort to hold the event in better weather.

Soldiers, marching bands and horses made their way along the Mall earlier today, before King Charles III, Queen Camilla, the Prince and Princess of Wales and their three children, attended the Horse Guards Parade.

After an extravagant display, the Royal Family returned to Buckingham Palace to watch the RAF flypast on the balcony, to rapturous cheers from the thousands who attended.

Many who witnessed the events are now sat in St James’ Park or Green Park, soaking up the remaining sun and enjoying some lunch.

​​ ​​“Britain, we put on the best show,” Lucy adds.

What is the Trooping the Colour parade?

As the ceremony continues, let’s have a look at what this military parade of more than 260 years is all about.

Although King Charles’ birthday is 14 November, this event has long been used to mark the official birthday of the British Sovereign - in an effort to hold the event in better weather.

It’s performed each June by more than 1,350 soldiers and 300 musicians, and the military parade includes an inspection by the King, music, pageantry, a gun salute, and an RAF flypast over central London.

During the event, a regiment flag is “trooped” through the ranks of soldiers, with this being rotated among the five regiments of Foot Guards.

“Colours” is the name given to the different flags representing different regiments of the British Army and was used so soldiers could easily spot their unit when on the battlefield.

In the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade and the first involving a Boeing 787, a London-bound Air India passenger aircraft with 242 people on board crashed in a residential area shortly after take-off from the Ahmedabad airport on 12th June. The 11-year-old Boeing 787 aircraft—bearing registration VT-ANB—was operating flight AI-171 between Ahmedabad and London Gatwick airport. This is the first wide-body crash for an Indian airline in four decades. It is also the first crash of a Boeing 787 globally.

The Tata Group, which owns the airlines, announced Rs 1 crore compensation to each of the kin of the victims. Air India will have to pay a compensation of around Rs 1.5 crore, as per the Montreal Convention treaty.

Key Takeaways:

1. The Montreal Convention 1999, or MC99, is formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air. It was finalised under the aegis of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It provides a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air, introducing several elements to balance the interests of travelers and the shippers of cargo and the aviation industry.

2. India signed the Montreal Convention on Civil Aviation in 2009 to become its 91st member. The provisions of this convention are implemented through the Carriage by Air (Amendment) Act 2009 in India, which was enacted to cover the international carriage of passengers, baggage, or cargo by airlines.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) It is a specialised organisation of the United Nations created through the Chicago Convention (formally known as the Convention on International Civil Aviation) of 1944 to promote safe and orderly growth of international civil aviation throughout the world. According to the official website of ICAO, “on 4 April 1947, upon sufficient ratifications to the Chicago Convention, the provisional aspects of the Provisional ICAO were no longer relevant and it officially became known as ICAO. The first official ICAO Assembly was held in Montreal in May of that year.” On 6 June 1946, Montreal, Canada, was selected as the permanent headquarters of the Organization.

3. The convention imposes strict penalties on carriers for the death of passengers due to negligence and fixes a higher insurance premium for air disasters occurring on international flights. It sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. It supersedes all previous international instruments on air carrier liability.

4. As per the Montreal Convention treaty, Air India will have to pay a compensation of around Rs 1.5 crore each to the kin of victims of the plane crash. Air India will get adequate compensation for the lost aircraft from insurance companies.

5. Compensation is calculated using Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), which stood at 128,821 SDRs (approximately USD 1.33 per SDR) as of October 2024. The actual payout will depend on the coverage purchased by Air India.

6. According to Article 23 of the Convention, “The sums mentioned in terms of Special Drawing Right in this Convention shall be deemed to refer to the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. Conversion of the sums into national currencies shall, in case of judicial proceedings, be made according to the value of such currencies in terms of the Special Drawing Right at the date of the judgement.”

7. The primary insurers for the Air India policy are: Tata AIG General Insurance (lead insurer with over 40 per cent share), ICICI Lombard General Insurance, New India Assurance, and other PSU general insurers. The final bill will be taken by the reinsurers. Air India had paid a premium of $30 million (Rs 257 crore), the same as last year, for insuring over 300 aircraft.

What is the difference between Insurance and Reinsurance? According to the website of Sbilife, “Insurance is a financial contract where an individual or entity (policyholder) pays a premium to an insurance company in exchange for future financial protection against specific risks. Reinsurance, on the other hand, is a form of insurance purchased by insurance companies themselves. It allows them to share risks associated with their policies with other insurance companies (reinsurers).”

BEYOND THE NUGGET: Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)

1. Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that the temperature in the Air India plane, which crashed in Ahmedabad, was so high due to burning fuel that there was no chance to save the people.

2. This highlights the flammable nature of the aviation turbine fuel (ATF), which is used by airlines. Also, there have been concerns surrounding the carbon emissions from ATF. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2023, aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, having grown faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road, or shipping. In regard to this, the Indian government has been working on the roadmap for introducing Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with ATF for domestic flights.

3. The decision is in line with the mandatory phase of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which will take effect from 2027. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would require airlines globally to offset any growth in carbon dioxide emissions beyond the 2020 levels.

4. SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional ATF or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one of the ways through which carriers can keep their emissions under permissible levels.

This forward-thinking model supports India’s energy security, clean transportation goals, and the expansion of fuel access in remote regions.
Vijay Nirani, Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy, commented, “Achieving OMC status is a pivotal moment for TruAlt.
This creates value at the grassroots level while supporting the clean energy transition through solutions like ethanol and Bio-CNG.
This development coincides with a period of transformation in India’s fuel economy.","In a major step for India’s energy transition, TruAlt Bioenergy Limited, the nation’s leading ethanol producer and a top integrated biofuels company, has received official authorization as an Oil Marketing Company (OMC). This approval enables TruAlt to directly distribute clean fuels like ethanol and Bio-CNG, as well as market traditional fuels such as petrol and diesel throughout India, marking its significant entry into the fuel retail industry.

TruAlt becomes one of the first private biofuel firms in India to be granted this status, joining a select group licensed to market and retail petroleum products across the country. This achievement reinforces the company’s manufacturing capabilities and its leadership in advancing India’s clean energy future. It also allows TruAlt to provide a smooth retail experience, combining both biofuels and conventional fuels under one roof.

The timing of TruAlt’s foray into retailing is both strategic and transformative. With its strong foundations in ethanol and Bio-CNG production, the company aims to offer a distinctive retail model that combines traditional and renewable fuels, including petrol, diesel, E93, Bio-CNG, along with EV charging points and battery swapping services. This forward-thinking model supports India’s energy security, clean transportation goals, and the expansion of fuel access in remote regions.

As part of its OMC authorisation, TruAlt is committed to improving fuel access in underserved areas, planning to establish at least 5% of its outlets in remote regions as part of its contribution to the government’s last-mile connectivity initiative. In the initial phase, the company plans to roll out over 100 fuel stations in key areas of Karnataka and Maharashtra, creating a strong network that serves both conventional and next-generation blended fuels, such as ethanol and Bio-CNG. This expansion is set to generate over 2,000 jobs across urban and rural areas, driving local economies and supporting the broader energy transition.

Vijay Nirani, Managing Director of TruAlt Bioenergy, commented, “Achieving OMC status is a pivotal moment for TruAlt. This milestone allows us to directly address the evolving fuel demands in India while accelerating the adoption of cleaner energy. Our retail network will not only offer traditional fuels but will place a strong emphasis on biofuels and extending our reach to rural areas.”

“By setting up stations along high-demand routes and in remote regions, we aim to foster rural development, create jobs, and contribute to a sustainable and inclusive energy infrastructure. Our model is rooted in empowering farmers, with a focus on sourcing agri-residue and biomass directly from rural communities. This creates value at the grassroots level while supporting the clean energy transition through solutions like ethanol and Bio-CNG. This farm-to-fuel cycle promotes both environmental and economic sustainability,” he added.

As a vertically integrated player, TruAlt Bioenergy holds a 7% market share in molasses-based ethanol and 3.7% in overall ethanol supply, making it a key player in India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP). The company is also ramping up production of compressed biogas (CBG) and is poised to become one of the largest Bio-CNG producers in the country, reinforcing its leadership in the clean fuels sector.

This development coincides with a period of transformation in India’s fuel economy. The country saw a record 239.5 million metric tonnes of petroleum product consumption in FY 2024–25, driven by significant growth in petrol, aviation fuel, and LPG. The country’s petrol consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% over the last decade, signaling a shift in consumer preferences and presenting an opportunity for the next generation of fuel retail.

“India’s growing demand for mobility, with over 2.5 crore cars sold annually, is reshaping the market. Our focus is to build a network that caters to the current demand while transitioning to a more sustainable, intelligent, and purpose-driven fuel system,” Mr Nirani concluded.

India’s biofuel programme has been rapidly gaining momentum, with ethanol blending in petrol reaching 18.4% in the 2024–25 ethanol supply year and hitting 19.7% in February 2025, moving closer to the country’s 20% target. This progress opens up new opportunities for companies with integrated biofuel operations, especially as flex-fuel vehicles and E20-ready infrastructure become more widespread.

As part of its strategy to expand in the biofuels value chain and tap into global markets, TruAlt Bioenergy is making strides in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. The company plans to establish a facility with an annual capacity of 10 crore litres, positioning itself as one of the world’s largest producers of SAF from ethanol and helping India lead the global sustainable aviation movement.

TruAlt Bioenergy Limited is a leading biofuel producer in India, playing a crucial role in the country’s shift toward clean and sustainable energy. The company operates five distilleries that produce ethanol from sugarcane juice and molasses, with a combined capacity of 2,000 KLPD, making it the largest ethanol producer in India.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/TRuALT-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 05:00:07.519485

About 1/7 of all center-Gulf grain and soybean cargo volumes move through St. Louis.
Despite those tensions, Eriksen said, the 2025 marketing year may see the fifth largest grain and soybean export totals in history.
There has also been a surge of private investment in the inland river system, Eriksen said, but grain storage build-out has stalled.","Recently returned from the Inland Marine Expo in Nashville, Tenn., Ken Eriksen, principal of Polaris Consulting and a senior leader and strategic adviser in commodities, supply chain, logistics and transportation, gave a presentation at the St. Louis Freightweek STL2025 event, which ran from June 2 through June 6.

Eriksen spoke on “The Evolving Landscape of Barge Transportation and Agriculture.” The event was moderated by Mary Lamie, executive vice president of multimodal enterprises and executive director of St. Louis Freightway.

Eriksen noted that his firm has been commissioned by Big River Coalition to conduct a study of the Mississippi River Ship Channel from Baton Rouge to the mouth, including the effects of draft restrictions and reduced freight capacities on freight rates as a component of the “basis” crop price for farmers.

While preliminary results of that study were released earlier this year, it won’t be ready until late summer. Eriksen did share some insights on Mississippi River commerce, which he said averages $273 million a day in barge-loaded cargo—mostly grains, including soybeans, with some coal, steel and aggregate. Ninety-five percent of downbound grain movements to New Orleans arrive by barge, and there’s a “high correlation” with barge movement in St. Louis. About 1/7 of all center-Gulf grain and soybean cargo volumes move through St. Louis.

Asked about trends and outlooks for 2025, Eriksen acknowledged that the Trump administration’s trade war and frequent changes on tariff policies made data gathering challenging. Separately, the U.S. Trade Representative has also been proposing penalties on Chinese-built vessels, including a surcharge on all such vessels that visit U.S. ports, with exemptions for vessels of 80,000 dwt (dead weight tons) and smaller, although these have not been finalized and are still under debate.

Despite those tensions, Eriksen said, the 2025 marketing year may see the fifth largest grain and soybean export totals in history. Fertilizer movements on the rivers may be reduced, but “commodity associations are not resting,” he said. “Farmers are resilient!”

On the coal side, the Trump administration has been talking about reviving coal, although it’s unlikely that coal movements by barge will ever regain their former volume. There were 29 new barges added to the total in 2024, but with a slide downward on the number of open barges used for coal, sand and aggregate, Eriksen sees barge retirements looming over the next three to five years.

The tank barge fleet demand, on the other hand, is back at pre-pandemic levels. Steel prices remain high, and there are only two major barge-builders.

When Lamie asked about infrastructure investments, Eriksen pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act and the new 75-25 federal cost-share for locks and dams. There has also been a surge of private investment in the inland river system, Eriksen said, but grain storage build-out has stalled. This is at least partly due to the reluctance of some farmers to invest in new equipment due to higher costs. There has also been a build-out of crush plants to take advantage of low-carbon fuel standards and renewable diesel, which can be made from a variety of crops. Many of the new crush plants are within reach of the inland waterways of the United States. With livestock herds’ growth slow, he said, corn and soybean growers must look to export markets for soybean meal and to renewable fuels such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",https://www.waterwaysjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WJDefaultShareFB.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 05:00:24.877682

The move affected operations at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), where the airline previously based its A380 services.

Speaking at the Paris Air Forum on 13 June, Smith acknowledged the aircraft’s popularity but stressed that Air France-KLM (AF) prioritized long-term viability by shifting to more efficient aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777-300ER.

Air France A380 Exit Justification

Although the Airbus A380 offered strong customer appeal, Smith emphasized that maintaining the aircraft came with major financial drawbacks.

Each A380 required a €50–60 million ($57–69 million) investment for cabin refurbishments and engine overhauls. He added that the aircraft generated profits only during summer peak travel periods, making it unsustainable for year-round operations, Flight Global.

With no slot constraints at Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Air France lacked the operational need for such a high-capacity jet. Instead, it opted for the Airbus A350, which Smith says has been “extremely successful” and “makes much more money” per flight.

Air France has also upgraded its premium product offerings. The airline is gradually introducing its new La Première first-class suite on select Boeing 777-300ERs, with passenger feedback described as “extremely positive.”

Environmental Policy and Pressures

Smith also addressed regulatory burdens facing European carriers. He criticized the European Commission’s implementation of environmental taxes and mandates—particularly around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—as disproportionate compared to global competitors.

While Air France-KLM is a leading SAF purchaser in Europe, Smith warned that affordability remains a key concern. He urged policymakers to strike a balance between environmental goals and economic sustainability, saying, “We need to exist to reach the 10% SAF mandate by 2030.”

Smith also highlighted the geopolitical disadvantage European airlines face due to the ban on Russian airspace, introduced after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

He called for penalties or restrictions on non-European carriers, particularly Chinese airlines, that continue to use Russian overflight routes—proposing either landing prohibitions or a “safety charge” to level the competitive field.

The removal of the A380 aligns with a broader strategy to modernize the fleet and improve financial resilience.

Air France has invested in more fuel-efficient aircraft like the A350 and enhanced premium products to stay competitive in long-haul markets. These moves reflect a pivot toward sustainable profitability, fleet simplification, and regulatory adaptability.

Spike S-512 Diplomat Massachusetts-based Spike Aerospace is one of the few companies in the world working on a supersonic business jet.","The executive order will take about one and a half years to be put into practice, as the FAA will have to establish an interim noise-based certification standard and present a standard for supersonic aircraft noise certification based on research, development, testing, and evaluation of new supersonic technologies.

But the reality remains that the floodgates to traveling faster than the speed of sound over land have opened, and for the first time in ages the handful of startups that are working on civilian supersonic planes have something interesting to look forward to.

But what are these companies, and what kind of planes are they working on? Inspired by the executive order, we decided to give you a glimpse at what to expect in this exciting new manifestation of the aviation industry. So, without further ado, here's who is doing what to speed up air transportation.

Before getting into it, you should know that, given that none of the planes below have been built yet, making it impossible for us to rate them objectively, the list follows an alphabetical order.

Boom Overture

Colorado-based Boom Supersonic is just ten years old, but it has already upset the aviation industry with a proposed design called the Overture. That's because the company has the audacity to describe it as the world's fastest airliner.

The plane will use a new kind of twin-spool, medium-bypass turbofan engine called Symphony to go about its business. The powerplant is being researched by Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT), which was involved in the development of the engines that power the F-22 and F-35 fighter jets.

Four Symphony engines will be strapped to the Overture, and each of them will be capable of developing 35,000 pounds of thrust at takeoff. They'll give the plane a top speed of Mach 1.7 (1,100 mph/1,800 kph) while burning 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The medium-sized Overture will be capable of transporting 80 people (fewer than the Concorde) to distances of up to 4,800 miles (7,800 km).

Boom is fairly advanced in terms of researching the tech that will go into the airliner. Thanks to a demonstrator called XB-1, which has been undergoing testing since 2020, the company seems to have learned enough to be confident the project will succeed.

Last year, Boom completed work on a production facility located at the Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, North Carolina, which should soon begin assembling some 33 Overtures per year, with plans to increase that to 66 depending on demand.

Several airlines and aviation companies have already expressed interest in the project, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines, which have supposedly earmarked 180 of these planes. It's too early, though, to say when the Overture will fly operationally for the first time (the end of the decade is a safe bet), but we expect the first prototype to be shown as soon as this year.

Hermeus Halcyon

American company Hermeus (est. 2018) has been in the news a lot lately, thanks to the work it does in advancing supersonic flight. Most of the time, it made the headlines thanks to something called the Quarterhorse, but it's ultimate goal is to develop a supersonic plane called Halcyon.

Quarterhorse is the name slapped by Hermeus on a series of prototypes that are used to research the hardware needed to get the Halcyon. There's three of them on the table, each designed to research something different.

The Quarterhorse Mk 1, which was recently flown, is powered by a General Electric J85 jet engine, and it's designed to inform the build of the Mk 2, which will adopt a Pratt & Whitney F100 engine in the hopes it will reach speeds of Mach 2.5 (1,918 mph/3,087 kph).

Finally, the Mk 3, which will use the same powerplant, but in a modified configuration called the Chimera, will arrive in 2026 to challenge the speed record set by the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird - Mach 3 (2,193.2 mph/3,529.6 kph).

All of this should eventually lead to the Halcyon, which should be capable of reaching speeds of Mach 5 (3,800 mph/6,100 kph). That, technically, should cut travel times from London to New York from over 8 hours to just 1.5 hours.

There are no other details known about the project at this time, and we don't even have a timeframe on when to expect it.

Spike S-512 Diplomat

Massachusetts-based Spike Aerospace is one of the few companies in the world working on a supersonic business jet. It calls it S-512 Diplomat, and by all intents and purposes it is the best-looking bird on our short list. And one that nearly wasn't meant to be, judging by the company's struggles over the years.

The Spike supersonic plane has been in the news for about a decade now, but it was relaunched earlier in May 2025 with renewed vigor, allowing us to hope that it will eventually make it here, one way or another.

The plane is to be powered by a couple of yet unspecified engines that should be capable of taking the Diplomat to top speeds of Mach 1.6 (1,200 mph/1,976 km), and that should be enough to cut travel times between any points on Earth in half, more or less.

Only 18 passengers can fit inside the plane, enjoying a luxurious interior that makes it ideal for business trips or as a private jet. That, however, will only be the case when the plane actually gets here, and, at the time of writing, is unclear when will that be.

Venus Stargazer

Last but not least on our list comes the Stargazer, a plane currently being researched in Houston, Texas, by a company called Venus, which has been around since 2019. By all accounts, this is the fastest civilian plane in the works, with a top speed rated at Mach 9 (that's 6,900 mph or 11,100 kph). That's fast enough to put any destination on the planet within one hour of travel time.

Allowing it to do that is a combination between conventional jet engines to carry it to a set speed, and a rocket engine to take over and complete the job. That would be a rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) whose exact specifications have not been disclosed yet.

While being the fastest plane on our list, the Stargazer is at the same time the smallest, as it will only be capable of accommodating 12 people. Sadly, despite being around for a while now, the Venus Stargazer is still only a conceptual design, so I have no other info on it. Who knows, maybe this Trump order will give it a nudge in the right direction.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/these-4-supersonic-airplanes-america-is-working-on-will-turn-civilian-aviation-on-its-head-252708_1.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 05:00:28.496874

Bradley wants to know, what gives?” Shawn Hackett: Soy oil stocks are not burdensome with the news we have today.
Shawn Hackett: Thanks, Paul.
Shawn Hackett everybody.","Paul Yeager: Welcome back to the Friday, June 13th, 2025 installment of Market Plus. Joining us now, Shawn Hackett. Shawn, I think before, I'm not saying I've made fun. I've made light of your hand gestures. And you said something about a beach ball in the first discussion. I almost said right at that exact moment, it looks like you are doing a beach ball bounce with some of the some of the points you were making. What has amped you up the most this week, given all these headlines?

Shawn Hackett: It's the renewable diesel mandate shift. It's a major, major fundamental shift in the grain markets. It's just on a short term shift. It's a multiyear shift. It's a shift that was supposed to happen several years ago when we backed away from the whole thing. And it really just, it kind of removes a lot of these headwinds from trade wars and Brazil take our market share, at least for a little while. It really puts us in a much tighter spot, and it gives us a much better chance for economical prices.

Paul Yeager: And this could change the trade discussion, right? Because all of a sudden, I mean, there's a clamoring for we don't need trade. I'm guessing that's a partial negotiation ploy, but it also is let's take care of it ourselves in this country.

Shawn Hackett: No question. With what's been happening with China pulling back from our demand from our exports and with Brazil continuing to go grow and gain market share and us losing that market share, I absolutely believe that taking care of ourselves, bringing more demand home, finding those useful ways to create more domestic demand jobs, creation and economics here in rural America is absolutely the right approach. Doesn't mean we shouldn't sell to other people, doesn't mean that we won't sell to other people. But it shouldn't be the be all end all of our ag policy going forward. I think this week's change of affairs with the renewable diesel mandates is a step in the right direction in creating another source of income for our farmers.

Paul Yeager: Because, frankly, the market movement was muted on Monday, Tuesday, this framework between the US and China out of London, there were very few details. And so the market, I think has grown numb to oh yeah, we have something, right?

Shawn Hackett: Last time we went through this when he was president for the first time, until there was actual concrete evidence of how much for how long we didn't react to it anymore and we didn't get any for how much, for how long. We got that we're getting along and we're starting to become friendly again. We need how much and for how long. I'm not saying that's not coming, but you get that. Like we got from renewable diesel this week, the market will react. Right now it's saying ‘sounds good’ okay. We're going to go to rare earth metals. Probably you're going to get some extra corn exports and soybean exports. We haven't seen or anything for it yet. Show us the money as they say.

Paul Yeager: Or show your work.

Shawn Hackett: Show you work.

Paul Yeager: Show your homework. Yeah. All right. Here's some homework for you. Glenn in Iowa wants to know Shawn. What will the final corn acres be? You mentioned acres in cotton. Because I want you to answer where those cotton acres are going. And then what's the corn acres?

Shawn Hackett: Well, I mean, I think it's there's a lot of people are suggesting that, the Deep South lost corn acres and that the central west, central north gained corn acres and the same thing for soybeans because of the really poor weather versus the good weather in the planting phase, I don't really think it's going to change that much. I know it's probably not popular to say that, but, I mean, I think we could be 500,000 acres one way or the other, which is really, in my view, a statistical dead heat. I don't think we're going to get much of a change based upon that bifurcated weather we had taking away and adding another place. I really don't see that happening here.

Paul Yeager: I know it's really hard to do this, but play this ‘what if’ game for me for a moment? What if today's news about renewable volumes came a month ago or two months ago? Would that have changed the picture?

Shawn Hackett: So yeah, it would have made a great deal of difference. The timing of something like this. But that's the way the chips fell.

Paul Yeager: All right. Let's stick with weather and go Mike in Iowa. I know I told the control room we were going to go in order and I'm already out of order. Second question. Surprise. Without a weather scare and after this report, how low can we go on corn?

Shawn Hackett: Well, if we don't have a weather scare and we have trendline yields or higher, and we start pushing those corn carry out to a 2 billion bushels or higher, and we start pushing soybean ending stocks to 400 million bushels or higher. You know, I think you'd be looking at the lows that we had last year coming into it, coming into view again. I think it was whatever, $3.85 December corn last year. I'm thinking out loud, $9.50 November soybeans last year. I mean, I think those are the numbers we roughly got to on. Everybody got pretty negative last August. That would be to me is where we would be going, or at least in the short run, going. But we didn't have renewable diesel mandates in place. So I think if we do go down to those levels, it won't be a long lasting bottom. And if we're correct about a very, very difficult harvest season with a long drawn out harvest season and cold, wet weather, I think we could have a pretty exciting post-harvest rally to regain some of that price level and give farmers a chance to sell.

Paul Yeager: So we'll know in July if it's hot and dry. Yeah, but we won't know in June or July, August until we get to September if it's this miserable harvest season. So, let's go Kevin in Missouri then. With a good crop of beans and corn, we're just going to hypothetically say we're going to get that. Forget the drought. Again, how low can we go? Let's already kind of talk some low targets, but would the supply push us down?

Shawn Hackett: The supply always pushes you down during harvest time if it's big for at least a little while. But I would argue that because of the renewable diesel, we need more soybeans then we're going to be able to produce even if we have a good crop this year where I need more acres next year in order to produce the soybeans that we're going to be needing to crush to make the oil. So this is why I'm saying this is such an important fundamental that even with a large crop, if it's the first large crop or a trend line yield above crop in six years, it still would not, in my opinion, allow for the kind of negative fundamentals we were talking about last August. I mean, I don't think we can get ourselves back to that. I still feel last August we traded the largest supplies we're willing to trade for quite some time to come. Really? Yes.

Paul Yeager: Like two years. Three years?

Shawn Hackett: I would say I'm thinking at least three years, if not longer, that we've traded or traded the largest supplies we're going to trade for the foreseeable future, meaning 3 to 5 years.

Paul Yeager: All right, well, let's stick Bradley in Nebraska’s question then, right at that with what you just said there, because that follows up perfectly. He said, “Beans are currently up $0.23, but the cash price is $0.13 lower than Tuesday because processors roll to the November. Does the industry think the crop is already in the bin? Are old crop supplies more abundant and the USDA balance sheet? Are soy oil stocks burdensome? Bradley wants to know, what gives?”

Shawn Hackett: Soy oil stocks are not burdensome with the news we have today. We don't have enough of it. In terms of soybeans, whenever you go to the new crop month, when you have a good start, they're going to be projecting a great crop. Why not? So they have the ability to create any reality they wish, because no one can tell them that they're wrong about a big crop coming because it's off to a good start. And, until such time that we have a reason to believe otherwise, they're going to trade the basis as if a big crop is coming in. The minute you add weather problems or it does, things start to come up that's an issue. Then that basis can turn around on a dime, especially with this renewable diesel demand for cash coming in. So for now that's what they're doing. But I don't think it's sustainable.

Paul Yeager: We haven't even talked about sustainable aviation fuel in this factor. I mean that's also ethanol on the corn side. Do we expect other news maybe coming on either of those fronts?

Shawn Hackett: I think the Trump administration is clearly looking for ways to support U.S. agriculture through non-subsidy means economic ways, market ways to put more money in the farmer economy in the U.S. without trying to send more money from the government, when at a time that they're trying to cut costs and manage the budget. So I think they will look for other ways that makes sense to do that. And what you mentioned with sustainable oil, aviation fuel and ethanol and such makes perfectly good sense that they would want to push that envelope even further, creating greater demand and allowing the farmer to benefit from the market, not from payments. I know every farmer I ever talked to, they'll take the payments in bad times, but they prefer the market to give it to them.

Paul Yeager: Let them not answer the phone when someone calls to say to sell. But okay, again, I'm another what if. Let's just. I mean, part of today's discussion is using more stocks that are grown domestically. Some of these companies were using lower imported stocks. What happens if corn and beans and wheat all goes higher and a processor, a blender, a crusher just says, I'm sorry, my bottom line, I got to go somewhere else?

Shawn Hackett: Well, I mean, clearly, you know, you're not going to have $100 soy oil price and be able to make this thing work. I mean, what we're trying to do is are trying to sop up excess supply and give the market the signal to start planting more soybeans and take care of the problem through greater production domestically. Obviously we don't want prices to go to all-time record high prices and ruin the economics. And I don't think we're doing it at a time where we're at risk of doing that. All we're saying is we've had a long extended period where prices don't make sense, and we're trying to find a way to get them to make more sense, where it makes sense for the farmer, and it makes sense for the processor. And we have enough time for the market to produce more domestically to keep it going. And I think they can do it.

Paul Yeager: Lastly, then, is we need to figure out one more thing, and that's Gary in Wisconsin's question. Most farmers are undersold a lot because of so much drought talk and lower prices. Is it time to get aggressive on sales and catch up? Or is the drought still ahead?

Shawn Hackett: If you haven't sold a lot of old crop and get some old crop sold on any rally, you see, because your timing is short. We made recommendations early in the year at the highest to get 50 to 75% of old crop grain sold to our customers. I'm talking about new crop. I would not be in a hurry to sell a new crop right now. I believe that we're getting an initial first move higher after a long period of negativity from the highs that we had earlier in the year. And I think between renewable diesel, between geopolitics, and I'm very confident about at least a weather worry in the month of July that the farmer can get a better price for his new crop soybeans, corn and spring wheat to get a better penciled out price. I would not be in a rush, but if you're sitting with a lot of old crop corn and a lot of old crop soybeans, you don't have time to make a mistake and say, well, I can wait a little longer. You need to get it sold so I will not mess around with old crop supplies, get it done.

Paul Yeager: You wouldn't even hold just for a little bit?

Shawn Hackett: I didn't say hold for a little bit, but if you have a lot to sell, you're not going to try to sell it all at the top. You just start feeding the market, feeding the market.

Paul Yeager: Because we're coming into that point where we're emptying out bins June, July because, you know, it's a nice, temperature to do it.

Shawn Hackett: All right. I, I love to tell you, I pick the top perfect topic exactly when the weather is going to turn. All that sort of thing. I do a pretty good job. No one's perfect, but you have to scale in old crop sales. If you need to clean out the bins, you need to get yourself priced out. Don't wait till the last minute, because the minute we're we're going the other way and you're trying to sell into a hole very, very difficult to get a good price.

Paul Yeager: I just needed you to say it for the people in the back one more time. Thanks, Shawn.

Shawn Hackett: Thanks, Paul.

Paul Yeager: Good to see you. Shawn Hackett everybody. And I do want to remind everyone to get signed up for the Market to Market Insider newsletter.

Ultra-cheap air travel has fuelled the success of many of the world's most famous low-cost carriers.","Growth and demand in the aviation industry continue to surge post-pandemic, and this is placing the industry at a critical crossroads. The pressure to ensure that airlines are reducing their carbon emissions, alongside powering towards the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). However, the sector is expected to see this shift come at a cost, affecting the passengers' pockets.

Many of the world's airlines are committed to achieving a net-zero emissions target by 2050, utilizing research, and new green technologies to reach that goal. However, the cost-to-benefit ratio is being questioned as airlines warn that this will have the potential to raise passenger ticket costs, which will see the demand for air travel decline.

Achieving Net-Zero Targets By 2050

Overall, the aviation sector contributes up to 3% of all global carbon emissions, with this figure set to rise as the continued demand for air travel grows. Key strategies being introduced, or already in action for airlines, include the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is produced from renewable resources, like waste oils and biomass. The use of SAF has the potential to reduce emissions by up to 80% when compared to traditional jet fuel.

Climate summits have been a hot spot for airlines to pledge their net-zero emissions, and usually see carriers also pledging to new aircraft technologies, including the development of hydrogen or electric-powered aircraft. While this avenue sounds promising, the introduction of fully fledged hydrogen or electric passenger aircraft remains a few years off.

Air traffic management improvements and optimizing current flight paths could also lead to reduced carbon emissions. However, this is expected to come at a huge cost for airlines, and eventually could trickle down to the consumer.

The Cost Of SAF

Airlines and passengers, ultimately, will need to bear the brunt of the cost of SAF, with further research and investment required to realize its full potential. While today, passengers often have the choice to offset their emissions when booking flight tickets, some travelers are willing to pay a premium for a 'greener' flight.

At present, the cost of production for SAF is up to five times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. To date, the overall use of SAF in the commercial aviation industry hovers at around just 0.2% of all flights. This means that the scale required to realize the full benefits would need to be enlarged substantially. The impact of increased SAF product and use will stimulate job creation, future investment in agriculture, and waste management. Farmers, who are vital for putting food on our shelves, can also benefit from the sale of crop residues, which ultimately are part of SAF feedstocks.

The environmental benefits of SAF include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, increased economic growth in rural communities (for production), and improved air quality and reduced pollution. SAF is also believed to decrease the formation of contrails, another contributor to global warming. The significant economic and environmental benefits of SAF when compared to conventional jet fuel make it a crucial component in the industry's reduction of carbon. The economic benefits will also ensure farm income diversification, biofuel plant investments, and further energy independence as the industry continues to reduce its reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Paying More For Greener Air Travel

The cost of net-zero is going to be billions. Major airlines, like Air France, KLM, Delta Air Lines, and Lufthansa, have already invested heavily in research, production, and blending of SAF fuel into their current supply, however, this is without major government subsidies. The cost of this is eventually expected to increase airfares for consumers.

Emirates, one of the world's largest airlines and the biggest operator of the Airbus A380, operates a robust network of international destinations from its hub at Dubai International Airport (DXB). It's actively involved in the research, development, and use of SAF, with commitments to integrate this into its day-to-day operations. The carrier has already conducted several demonstration flights with 100% SAF, and is actively blending conventional fuel by up to 50%. The airline's president, Tim Clarke, believes that if airlines are serious about reaching environmental targets, the economics of flying must change:

“If we’re to meet these environmental targets, the economics of flying must change. That means fares will rise, there’s no way around it.”

To ensure that travelers understand the true benefits of using SAF and that airlines are operating cleaner, greener options for air travel, education must be prevalent. Carriers are encouraged to communicate the true benefits of reducing emissions and offer voluntary carbon offset programs. Furthermore, airlines must look at lobbying their carbon reduction initiatives to local and national governments for policy support. Already, there are blending mandates in several countries and regions, including the European Union (2% SAF by 2025), the United States (3 billion gallons a year by 2030), Singapore (1% SAF by 2026), Norway (0.5% SAF by 2026), and Japan (10% SAF by 2030) - please note this list is not exhaustive.

Policy Incentives

Government contribution is critical to the success of SAF and reducing carbon emissions in aviation. While it ultimately does fall on the airline to do the 'right thing', proposals with local and national governments are crucial to ensure that SAF producers can receive tax credits or subsidies to help cover the cost of SAF production.

Blending mandates are already being introduced in some regions, which boosts the demand and interest in SAF production. This will see a minimum percentage of SAF blended with traditional jet fuel. Further funding for SAF research could also lead to the development of cheaper production methods.

Within the European Union, SAF supply remains limited; however, large oil firms like Shell are already expanding their SAF output. But production will need to increase to meet the potential demands required by 2030.

High Costs Could Put Travelers Off

Ultimately, as airlines continue to adopt sustainable aviation fuel alternatives, this may result in an increase in passenger airfares by up to 15% by 2030. While premium passengers will be impacted the most, it could be expected to see that budget airlines could adopt a 'green fee' in the booking process. This requires a sufficient balance by carriers to ensure that airfares do not rise too sharply, putting off the cost-conscious traveler.

In a world that relies heavily on fossil fuels, some governments have adopted strict regimes to ensure that climate targets remain achievable. This has seen a reduction in domestic air travel - in France, for example, where passengers are now encouraged to use trains, or alternative transport when travelling a short distance.

This new legislation in France came into force in 2023, after two years of jostling between lawmakers. These new rules apply to journeys that can be done by train in under two and a half hours, limiting passenger air travel on certain routes, such as between Paris and the likes of Nantes or Bordeaux. Connecting flights are unaffected by these laws.

Where To Next?

Achieving the lofty targets of net-zero emissions will hinge on the success of multiple factors, including passenger acceptance that the cost of sustainable, 'greener' flights could cause airfares to rise. But there continues to be technological advancements to ensure that low-carbon flying could eventually be affordable, with the hope that government policies may incentivize the production of SAF.

Ultra-cheap air travel has fuelled the success of many of the world's most famous low-cost carriers. The likes of Ryanair, Frontier Airlines, or Southwest Airlines rely on razor-thin operating margins, which rely on the affordability of conventional jet fuel and minimal onboard inclusions. While the industry looks to move away from limited fossil fuel supplies, the adoption of more sustainable alternatives promises a cleaner future for air travel. However, this raises the question of how airlines can continue to maintain a low-cost model while needing to adapt to more expensive fuels. These carriers are already looking at ways to decarbonize their operations. Last year, for example, Ryanair committed to 1,000 tonnes of SAF from Shell, which is enough to power over 200 flights across its network.

Sustainability is non-negotiable, and this shift will redefine the economics of air travel. The question will remain whether passengers are willing to pay more for sustainable air travel, and the coming decades will be the ultimate test of whether budget airlines can transform their model to evolve alongside the industry's ambitious environmental targets.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/concern.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 23:57:45.688296

According to the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Scenario, global biofuel demand in the transport sector is projected to reach 215 billion liters annually by 2030, while investment in low-emission fuels has been rising at pace, with a 66% growth in 2022 alone. Demand is growing across aviation, marine and heavy transport. Emissions targets are tightening, and both governments and investors are putting significant capital behind low-carbon fuel projects. Successful project deployment includes managing a complex array of factors from the earliest stages of planning. This is where early strategic planning is critical for shaping intent into a fully fledged project. But what does success in that conceptual stage look like?

Different Starting Points, Same Principles

It starts with understanding the positioning of each developer. Some are legacy asset owners adapting to changing demands or emissions targets. Others start with a blank map in terms of specific approaches but have capital, a region or the ambition to develop low-carbon fuels in mind.

Many fall somewhere in between: power providers moving to liquids, technology developers seeking scale or consortiums built around emerging policy support. What they all have in common is a need for early-stage structure, consultation and realism to guide the success of their project.

At this stage, it's not about detailed engineering. It's about setting direction, clarifying what to build, where to build it and how it will succeed commercially and operationally.

Concept to FID and Operational Excellence

The goal of that early-stage work is often seen as reaching final investment decision (FID), and while that is critically important, it should also be recognized as the stage where the groundwork is laid for long-term operational success. The early decisions made on location, feedstock, partners and compliance will shape not just delivery but performance, adaptability and resilience for the life of the project.

The process begins with some fundamental questions to clarify goals and priorities. What are you trying to deliver and to whom? What technical and commercial constraints do you face and how will you overcome them? Is your project compliant with end market regulations? These questions shape everything that follows.

Site and Supply Chain

From those basics, location becomes the initial focus. On the surface, site selection appears to be a question of land, but in the case of greenfield projects, prior to selecting a site, the regional context needs to be understood. What does the region offer in terms of policy support, demand centers, infrastructure readiness and permitting conditions and the access to the supply chains needed to deliver the project? Feedstock logistics, construction materials and skilled labor are just as essential as grid capacity or water access. If any of these are missing or constrained, the location may not be viable.

One misstep to avoid is assuming what works in one region will translate directly to another. For example, in the US, the Inflation Reduction Act offers clear, bankable incentives but faces legislative uncertainty. For those in Europe, strong policy intent through RePowerEU is tempered by national-level complexity, whilst in places like India, there is growing support for renewable energy but direct low-carbon fuel incentives are still limited, making commercial structures more complex.

Once the regional context is understood, the focus can shift to identifying potential sites. A site may look promising on paper but fall short in critical areas, from limited water or grid capacity, to underdeveloped logistics routes or insufficient space to accommodate other technologies, like carbon capture, in the future.

Regional policy and market structure help guide the search. On-the-ground realities determine what remains feasible and guide the final shortlist. The outcome of working in this way is that sites are ruled out rather than projects being ruled out.

Developing the Concept

Concept development and site selection are closely linked. What you plan to produce affects where it makes sense to build — and the limitations of location often reshape the plan. This isn’t about detailed engineering plans but instead taking all factors into account and landing on a concept that can become a strong front end engineering design.

For example, in many markets, the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids route is no longer a reliable default for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)/renewable diesel production. In Europe, much of the supply is already contracted or feedstock already earmarked for projects in the pipeline, leaving little room for new facilities. Because of this, alternatives like second-generation ethanol, alcohol-to-jet and gasification are growing in prominence. Each of these routes comes with trade-offs in complexity, cost and readiness. What matters is matching the technology not just to feedstock, but to the specific conditions of the project: policy signals, logistics, local expertise and offtake potential. The right option is the one that comes with a robust supply chain.

On the Same Page

With a concept forming, the next step is alignment. This is the time to challenge assumptions, test thinking and build shared understanding between all stakeholders while the project is still at a stage when optimization and modifications are possible. Stakeholders may be at very different stages: some refining technology choices, others assessing permitting pathways or preparing early site development.

This stage is also an opportunity to start building trust with communities, laying the foundations of a social license to operate. The earlier these perspectives are brought together, the easier it is to adjust plans before they become locked in.

Money Talks

Once the concept is in place, financial modeling links technical ambition to commercial strategy, testing how projects perform under shifting conditions. It is not enough to model the expected case. Scenarios need to account for volatility in power pricing, carbon costs, permitting timelines and other potential environmental or social obligations. These factors often have a bigger impact than anticipated and should be built into early assumptions, not added later.

Offtakers also play a central role. Their requirements directly influence both the commercial structure and the facility design. For example, a SAF offtaker might require certification to a specific standard or minimum lifecycle emissions thresholds. Meeting those standards could shift the technology choice, design assumptions or add operational costs that must be reflected in the model.

Financial modeling becomes a foundation for resilience when done well. It validates assumptions, highlights risks and gives investors and stakeholders the clarity needed to move forward with FID and delivery.

Turning Ambition Into Reality

Strong models account for technical, commercial and policy realities. But delivery challenges still emerge when assumptions are not grounded in the practicalities of construction, integration and operation. Utility loads, integration risks or emissions monitoring might seem like secondary details during concept development, but if they are not addressed, they can become expensive constraints.

That does not mean delivery and strategy are the same. But strategy needs to be ready for delivery, and that means making space for execution expertise before decisions are locked in.

Low-carbon fuels are moving from ambition to reality. Getting there demands more than technology or good intentions. Success depends on structure at the start, clarity around risks and rewards, early alignment across partners and a strategy shaped for the realities of execution.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8ebd1d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1000x525+0+47/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F64%2F79%2Fab044572457f8ffc7d071e0724a8%2Fss-2256892601-co2-concept.jpg,N,,2025-06-14 05:00:32.481824

Developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is now in its first phase with imminent retirement deadlines. While some carriers have begun aligning their strategies accordingly, others are adopting a cautious, wait-and-see approach.

But with Phase I retirement deadlines fast approaching and the mandatory phase starting in 2027, the next two years present a critical window for action. Early engagement could provide not just compliance assurance – but a competitive edge.

The case for early action

The rationale behind the wait-and-see mindset is understandable. Airlines face a complex matrix of regulatory schemes – CORSIA, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates – each with their own timelines, cost implications and enforcement mechanisms.

Within that landscape, the supply constraints and evolving eligibility requirements associated with CORSIA Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) add further layers of uncertainty. However, by delaying action, airlines potentially expose themselves to unintended risks – including escalating EEUs prices and limited availability.

In addition, these risks are seemingly becoming tangible. For instance, the UK recently introduced draft legislation proposing fines of £100 per tonne of CO₂ for non-compliance under its ETS scheme*1 – which is aligned with CORSIA requirements. Meanwhile, Canadian legislation stipulates fines up to CAD $25,000 for non-compliance with its domestic implementation of CORSIA since 2021*2. While enforcement varies by jurisdiction and countries, these developments point to a clear trend: emissions-related costs and compliance obligations are gaining prominence across the regulatory landscape for the industry.

Early movers and hedgers

Despite the uncertainties, momentum is slowly but surely building, with a marked increase in airline engagement evidenced by recent activity on the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Aviation Carbon Exchange (ACE) platform – where participation and procurement volumes are rising. In March 2025, 15 airlines purchased credits at $22.25/tonne, up from $21.70 last year*3.

The SAF precedent

The path to CORSIA readiness mirrors the aviation industry’s journey with SAF. While SAF production volumes still account for only 0.3% of global jet fuel in 2024*4, SAF is emerging as a cornerstone of decarbonisation strategies – supported by mandates, incentives, and growing supply chains.

CORSIA is now at an inflection point: the policy structure is in place, but action is needed. Airlines that engage early can scale investment gradually, giving themselves a chance to build internal capability and avoid being outpaced by regulatory enforcement or market demand.

Beyond compliance

For the aviation sector, decarbonisation is not simply a regulatory obligation, it’s a societal licence to grow. By integrating CORSIA into broader energy transition strategies today, airlines can future-proof their operations, manage financial risk and advance their net-zero goals in an era of increased climate accountability.

As CORSIA moves towards full implementation, airlines can purposefully use the next two years to build internal readiness, secure access to eligible credits and integrate emissions compliance into broader decarbonisation strategies.

In previous years, the EPA proposed the biobased diesel targets in terms of gallons rather than RINs.
The proposed 2027 RVO of 24.46 billion RINs includes the nested targets of 1.36 billion cellulosic biofuel RINs, 7.5 billion biomass-based diesel RINs, and 9.46 billion advanced biofuel RINs.
Additional information, including a full copy of the proposed rule, is available on the EPA website.","The U.S. EPA on June 13 released a proposed rule to set strong 2026 and 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs). The rulemaking also alters the RFS to limit the participation of imported fuels and feedstocks, eliminates electricity from the program, and reduces the 2025 cellulosic RVO.

The EPA is proposing to set the total 2026 RVO at 24.02 billion renewable identification numbers (RINs), a nearly 8% increase when compared to the 2025 RVO. The proposed 2027 RVO is 24.46 billion RINs, up nearly 2% when compared to the previous year.

The proposed 2026 RVO of 24.02 billion RINs includes the nested targets of 1.3 billion cellulosic biofuel RINs, 7.12 billion biobased diesel RINs, and 9.02 billion advanced biofuel RINs. The implied mandate for conventional biofuel, primarily met by corn ethanol, would be set at 15 billion RINs. In previous years, the EPA proposed the biobased diesel targets in terms of gallons rather than RINs. The agency has proposed to now specify the biobased diesel target in RINs, projecting that 5.61 billion gallons of biobased diesel would be needed to comply with the 2026 RVOs.

The proposed 2027 RVO of 24.46 billion RINs includes the nested targets of 1.36 billion cellulosic biofuel RINs, 7.5 billion biomass-based diesel RINs, and 9.46 billion advanced biofuel RINs. The implied mandate for conventional biofuel would be set at 15 billion RINs. The EPA estimates that 5.86 billion gallons of biobased diesel would be needed to meet the 2027 RVOs.

The EPA is also proposing to reduce the 2025 RVO for cellulosic biofuel to 1.19 billion RINs, down from the previously finalized RVO of 1.38 billion RINs. To help avoid the need to make future cellulosic biofuel RVO adjustments, the EPA is proposing to change the way it projects cellulosic volumes. The new approach proposes to account for projected fuel use in the CNG/LNG vehicle fleet.

The proposed rule also includes provisions aimed at boosting domestic biofuel production by limiting the ability for imported fuels and feedstocks to participate in the RFS. Specifically, the EPA is proposing to modify the value of a RIN based on whether the biofuel is derived from domestic or foreign sources. Under the proposed regulations, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50% of the RIN value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.

Under the proposed approach, renewable fuel producers and importers would generate 50% fewer RINs than they generate for the same volume of import-based renewable fuel under the current RFS regulations. Renewable fuel produced by domestic producers using domestic feedstocks would continue to generate the same number of RINs that they currently do. The import RIN reduction would apply to all foreign-produced renewable fuel, regardless of whether those fuels are produced from domestic or foreign feedstocks.

To ensure renewable fuel producers are generating the appropriate number of RINs, the EPA is proposing that all domestic renewable fuel producers be required to keep records of feedstock purchases and transfers that identify the point of origin for each feedstock and report that information to the EPA.

The feedstock origin would generally be defined as the location where a feedstock is grown, produced, generated, extracted, collected or harvested. For planted crops, cover crops or crop residue, the point of origin would be the location of the feedstock supplier that supplied the feedstock to the renewable fuel producer or biointermediate producers, such as the grain elevator. For oil derived from planted crops, cover crops, or algae, the point of origin would be the crushing facility where the oil is extracted. For biogenic waste oils/fats/greases, separated yard waste, separated food waste, or municipal solid waste (MSW), the point of origin is the location of the establishment where the waste is collected, such as a restaurant or food processing facility. For biogas, the point of origin is defined as the location of the landfill or digester that produces the biogas, and for woody biomass, the point of origin is the location where the feedstock is harvested.

The proposed rule also aims to eliminate electricity, or eRINs, from the RFS. The EPA has taken steps in recent years to roll electricity into the RFS program, but, to date, has failed to approve a single eRIN pathway. The proposed rule aims to remove the definition of “renewable electricity” from RFS regulations along with the regulations associated with generating eRINs. If finalized, the proposed action will ensure that no RINs are generated in the future for electricity used in motor vehicles, according to EPA.

A public comment period on the proposed rule is open through Aug. 8. The EPA has announced it will hold a virtual public hearing on the proposed rule on July 8. An additional session could be held July 9, if needed.

The Renewable Fuels Association said the proposed rule provides crucial growth opportunities. “Today’s proposal is an important step toward achieving President Trump’s vision of lower gas prices, a stronger agriculture industry, and American energy dominance,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “The volumes proposed today provide crucial growth opportunities for U.S. ethanol producers and farmers, while boosting the supply of lower-cost, American-made energy. We thank Administrator Lee Zeldin and his team at EPA for listening to stakeholders from agriculture and the entire fuels industry as this proposal was being crafted.”

“This proposal sends a very positive and powerful signal to U.S. renewable fuel producers and farmers. It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,” Cooper added. “We look forward to providing more feedback to EPA on the proposed volumes during the public comment period, and we’ll continue to underscore the vital importance of a strong RFS to America’s rural communities.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol is calling the rulemaking a pivotal opportunity. “The stakes are high for this next phase of the RFS,” said Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. “Ethanol producers and farmers are under tremendous economic pressure, particularly due to uncertainty caused by current efforts to reorder international trade, and we need EPA to substantially increase domestic ethanol blending under the RFS in 2026 and 2027.

“This rulemaking is a pivotal opportunity for the Trump administration to fully utilize the RFS statutory authorities by setting ambitious blending targets that reflect the critical role American ethanol plays in strengthening U.S. energy security, boosting rural economies, and reducing prices at the pump,” he added. “While we’re encouraged the Agency has indicated it intends to move quickly toward finalizing the 2026-2027 RVOs, ACE will continue urging EPA to use its statutory authority to ensure conventional biofuel volumes are well above 15-billion gallons to support a growing U.S. ethanol industry.

“Our forthcoming comments will also emphasize the importance of projecting and reallocating small refinery exemptions (SREs) to provide greater certainty and uphold the integrity of the RFS program, as well as stress the need for EPA to adopt the most current GREET model for accurately accounting lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions — emissions that continue to trend lower for ethanol,” Jennings continued.

Growth Energy said the proposal will strengthen rural America. ""Today's proposed RVOs secure an economic lifeline for the nation's farmers and ethanol producers,” said Eimly Skore, CEO of Growth Energy. “EPA's proposal will unlock investments, create jobs, and support growth in rural America, expanding renewable fuel production and creating the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. Although EPA has yet to project future SREs, we expect that it will ensure that any lost gallons from exemptions will be reallocated to ensure that blending obligations are met. President Trump first proposed a way to account for lost gallons in 2019, and maintaining that approach will protect biofuel producers and their farm partners from demand destruction.

""Only biofuels can unlock the investments and jobs needed to strengthen the rural economy,” Skor continued. “ We applaud President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin for keeping their promise to fight for farmers and create opportunities in rural communities that have too often been left behind.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America is also welcoming the proposed rule. “Today’s RFS proposal is a welcome and timely signal to U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF producers as well as America’s farmers and agricultural businesses,” said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels. “The industry has made major investments in domestic production capacity and feedstocks to meet America’s energy needs and provide consumers affordable, cleaner fuels. We anticipate this will have a tremendous beneficial impact for American farmers and agricultural communities and we look forward to working with President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin to finalize this rule and fully unleash U.S. clean fuel producers.

“Our industry supplied more than 5 billion gallons of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF to the U.S. market in 2024, and is poised to deliver more in 2026,” Kovarik added. “The U.S. biomass-based diesel industry supports 107,400 jobs and generates $42.4 billion in economic activity. Continued market growth and stability through the RFS will enable more economic opportunities, create more jobs, and revitalize America’s agricultural sector.”

The American Biogas Council expressed disappointment in the proposed rule, noting the proposal is not a win for dairy and other livestock farmers. “The ABC is disappointed by EPA’s proposal, which reduces the growth of cellulosic biofuels under the RFS,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC. “The proposed D3 RVO cuts growth in half, two years in a row, down to 5% annual growth, ignoring the demonstrated 20-30% growth of D3 fuel production.

“This proposal is not a win for all farmers. In particular, dairy and other livestock farmers are the most harmed,” he added.T”he RFS supports these communities through steady income generated from converting their waste to renewable fuel. This misalignment is particularly surprising given the Administration’s welcome, outspoken support for American farmers and the natural gas industry.

“In addition to increasing the volumes to match actual production, EPA has several opportunities to increase the demand for more domestic, renewable fuels. We implore EPA to take action on outstanding pathways and tailpipe rules to help grow end-use markets,” Serfass continued.

The RNG Coalition said the proposal undervalues demonstrated growth in renewable natural gas (RNG) production. “RNG COALITION appreciates the timely release of the proposed volumes for 2026 and 2027 as well as efforts to get the program back on track,"" said Johannes Escudero, RNG COALITION founder and CEO. ""However, we believe RNG and the biogas value chain have a greater role to play in supporting the energy dominance pillar of the agency’s 'Powering the Great American Comeback' initiative.""

(Worley Consulting/Biofuels International) ... Without urgent action to develop supplies of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), emissions could reach 21.2 metric gigatonnes a year. However, with SAF supply still in its early stages and the window to meet these targets narrowing, there is growing pressure on the industry to accelerate SAF adoption now.

New investment

While investment and interest are growing, the global SAF rollout remains in its infancy. Projects currently in advanced development are expected to meet just 2 to 4% of global jet fuel demand by 2030. Today, SAF supply accounts for only 0.1% of all aviation fuel use.

To ensure success, SAF supply must scale up, and airlines must act swiftly in securing SAF contracts and collaborating with the right technical and strategic experts, as well as the appropriate project developers deploying the correct technology pathway with the right feedstock.

For aviation to meet its net-zero targets, developers and financiers must commit to projects built on access to sustainable feedstocks and renewable energy.

The focus of the Low Carbon team is to help industrial customers modify their businesses to manage emissions, meet sustainability targets, and align with evolving regulations.

Where customers have existing facilities, we help shape decarbonisation roadmaps using a greenhouse gas mitigation hierarchy – starting with energy efficiency, progressing to low-carbon hydrogen fuel switching, electrification, carbon capture, and nature-based solutions.

For customers with a bioethanol or SAF plan, we advise on business sustainability. That includes assessing feedstock sustainability, identifying the strongest business case, and exploring the best funding options – such as the EU’s Innovation Fund or the Inflation Reduction Act in the US.

Our integrated expertise across technical, commercial, and regulatory landscapes helps customers de-risk and strengthen their investment decisions.

How is the SAF sector maturing, and what trends have you noticed?

...

There is a lot of interest in eSAF, and we have been helping customers scale the technology, but today its production costs can be as much as ten times higher than fossil-derived aviation fuel.

...

Will there be enough low-carbon electricity supply for eSAF to go mainstream?

Access to affordable, low carbon-intensity electricity is critical. Without it, SAF may not reach a price point the market can widely adopt.

...

It is essential that projects ensure sustainable feedstock and access to water (if hydrogen production from electrolysis is required).

A fuel producer must understand the food situation of the country being considered as a production base.

To be sustainable, SAF must be produced from feedstocks that do not compete with food supply or compromise land use.

That means sourcing residues from food crops or using non-arable land that cannot support food crops.

It is also vital to assess local water availability, especially in agriculturally dependent or drought-prone areas. Feedstock sustainability is key – without it, SAF cannot be considered sustainable.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 20:02:21.865955

RINS PROPOSAL The RFS proposal also calls for a 50% reduction in the number of renewable identification numbers, or RINs, generated for imported renewable fuels and those fuels produced with foreign feedstocks.
""The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities,"" he said in a statement.
Geoff Cooper, CEO and president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the proposal was a good first step for biofuels producers and farmers.
Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement, ""Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history.","LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- The Trump administration proposed a record 24.02 billion gallons of biofuels be blended in 2026, with biomass-based diesel seeing a more than 2-billion-gallon jump from 2025 to 5.61 billion gallons in 2026, in a Renewable Fuel Standard proposal released Friday.

Biomass-based diesel was the big story as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposal also calls for another bump in 2027 to 5.86 billion gallons.

July soybeans closed Friday up 27 1/2 cents at $10.69 3/4 based on the news. November soybeans also ended the day higher by the same margin at $10.54 3/4. July soybean oil closed up the daily limit of 3 cents a pound at 50.61 cents per pound. July corn ended the day up 6 cents at $4.44 1/2.

""Definitely a welcomed event after months of uncertainty for the biofuel industry and by extension the ag industry,"" DTN Lead Analyst Rhett Montgomery said.

""It's felt for a while that federal guidance for biofuels was the missing demand piece, especially in the soybean oil market where exports are already very impressive and the newly announced RVOs as well as domestic protections for U.S. feedstocks just solidifies the demand for soybean oil amid fairly tight stocks. Soybean crush also continues at a record pace and is forecasted to set another record again in 2025-26, which is certainly hard to argue at this point given Friday's news.""

The much-anticipated proposal would keep conventional corn-based ethanol at 15 billion gallons during the next two years.

The Trump administration's proposal is a significant step up compared to the Biden administration's multi-year rule that set biomass-based diesel volumes at 3.35 billion gallons in 2025. The industry has been calling for much higher RFS volumes to match actual production, at a time when biodiesel plants have been cutting back or closing production in light of lingering tax uncertainty.

RINS PROPOSAL

The RFS proposal also calls for a 50% reduction in the number of renewable identification numbers, or RINs, generated for imported renewable fuels and those fuels produced with foreign feedstocks.

Devin Mogler, president and CEO of the National Oilseed Processors Association, said that aspect of the proposal is important.

""We applaud the administration for recognizing the need to reduce the RIN value for biofuels made from imports of tallow and so-called 'used cooking oil' which have been displacing U.S. soybean oil -- harming farmers and biofuel producers alike for years,"" Mogler said in a statement.

Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association and a famer from Magnolia, Kentucky, said the proposal is a boost to rural America.

""The significant increase in proposed volumes for biomass-based diesel will support soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers in rural America, and serves as a much-needed win for our communities,"" he said in a statement.

Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, said the proposal was a ""welcome and timely signal"" to U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers as well as America's farmers and agricultural businesses.

""The industry has made major investments in domestic production capacity and feedstocks to meet America's energy needs and provide consumers affordable, cleaner fuels,"" he said in a statement.

""We anticipate this will have a tremendous beneficial impact for American farmers and agricultural communities and we look forward to working with President Trump and EPA Administrator Zeldin to finalize this rule and fully unleash U.S. clean fuel producers.""

SMALL-REFINERY EXEMPTIONS

On small-refinery exemptions, the EPA offered an evaluation of where things stand.

EPA said the total volumes requirements remain the same regardless of SREs but the percentage obligations for non-exempt obligated parties increase when SREs are granted. So, the volume obligations would be achieved by fewer obligated parties.

""There is currently significant uncertainty regarding the number of small-refinery exemption petitions that could be granted for 2026 and 2027,"" the agency said in the proposal.

""We have yet to take further action on these petitions and are still determining how we will evaluate and decide those petitions, which would then inform how we would evaluate and decide any SRE petitions received for 2026 and 2027. We expect to communicate our policy regarding SRE petitions going forward before finalization of this rule.""

EPA provides a range of potential gallons exempted for 2026 and 2027 from what it says are about 34 qualifying and operational small refineries that produce about 18 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel. To qualify for exemptions, the RFS requires small refineries to show disproportionate harm from having to meet their obligations.

Geoff Cooper, CEO and president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the proposal was a good first step for biofuels producers and farmers.

""It represents an excellent starting point for the 2026 and 2027 RVO discussion,"" Cooper said in a statement.

""The entire supply chain is seeking certainty regarding EPA's plans on SREs and today's proposal helps to clarify the agency's approach moving forward. We agree that the agency has a legal obligation to reallocate any exempted blending volumes, consistent with the approach adopted by EPA near the end of President Trump's first administration. However, EPA's top priority for SREs should be maintaining a high standard for evaluating petitions and continuing to take a restrained and limited approach. The marketplace needs to be reassured that the RVOs published by EPA are real and will not be watered down or eroded by SREs.""

American Coalition for Ethanol CEO Brian Jennings said the ""stakes are high"" for this next phase of the RFS.

""Ethanol producers and farmers are under tremendous economic pressure, particularly due to uncertainty caused by current efforts to reorder international trade and we need EPA to substantially increase domestic ethanol blending under the RFS in 2026 and 2027,"" Jennings said. ""This rulemaking is a pivotal opportunity for the Trump administration to fully utilize the RFS statutory authorities by setting ambitious blending targets that reflect the critical role American ethanol plays in strengthening U.S. energy security, boosting rural economies and reducing prices at the pump.""

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said the proposal is a boost the industry needed.

""Today's proposed RVOs secure an economic lifeline for the nation's farmers and ethanol producers,"" she said in a statement.

""EPA's proposal will unlock investments, create jobs and support growth in rural America, expanding renewable fuel production and creating the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. Although EPA has yet to project future SREs, we expect that it will ensure that any lost gallons from exemptions will be reallocated to ensure that blending obligations are met.""

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association said in a statement, ""Agriculture is hurting, having just endured the largest two-year drop in net farm income in history. We need forward-leaning RFS blending levels to maximize American energy dominance. Midwest farmers are ready to help power our economy.""

Republican Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley said the proposed biodiesel volumes would help the industry rebound from when ""under the Biden administration, five biodiesel plants in Iowa closed or idled in part because RVOs were set too low.""

Abstract

Low carbon fuel policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as the 45Z tax credit are intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Cellulosic feedstocks, optimized biorefineries, and favorable farming locations can significantly reduce biofuel carbon intensity (CI). Despite advances in field-to-fuel GHG monitoring and flexibility in resource allocation within biorefineries (e.g., governing net electricity production), rigid CI accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and processing facilities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway using miscanthus and alcohol-to-jet (i) to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CIs and (ii) to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA). Results demonstrate GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors (feedstock CI, grid electricity CI) as scenario-specific LCA: most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits.

Representative Rick Larsen and Senator Jerry Moran receive 2025 GBTA Navigator Awards for championing business travel in the U.S.

Alexandria, VA – More than 100 members and constituents of the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) converged this week in Washington, D.C. for the GBTA U.S. Legislative Summit 2025 with the collective purpose of advocating for the vital role and value of business travel. Through direct meetings with Senators, Representatives and congressional staff, members from GBTA’s 38 U.S. chapters shared insights and championed policies to advance business travel’s impact as an economic driver and to create a more connected and resilient travel ecosystem.

Held June 10-12, the Summit provided industry professionals with the opportunity to network, learn, and engage directly with legislators to underscore the value of business travel in the U.S. economy. GBTA also advocated for streamlined international travel including policies that enhance the traveler experience and restore confidence in U.S. entry processes. GBTA participants also discussed the need to modernize the U.S. air traffic system, support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and improve passenger rail to provide viable travel alternatives.

For more than two decades, GBTA has hosted legislative fly-ins to connect business travel experts with U.S. policymakers to foster understanding, advocate for priority issues and facilitate a better experience for business travelers. By promoting the strategic role of business travel in driving economies, innovation, jobs and strategic collaboration, we foster a more resilient future for business travelers and those who support them. Suzanne Neufang, CEO, GBTA

Setting the Policy Agenda for Business Travel

Summit attendees heard perspectives directly from members of Congress including Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada) and Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington), as well as from various experts on critical topics including air traffic system modernization, the evolution of SAF and improving U.S. passenger rail travel.

In close to 150 meetings with legislators, attendees shared GBTA’s policy priorities for U.S. business travel. Based on these priorities, GBTA constituents asked legislators to:

Support the modernization of the air traffic system

Improve business travel at U.S. borders

Support funding for the hiring of 5,000 additional Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers

Reject efforts to extend the diversion of the 9/11 Passenger Security Fe

Support additional resources for CBP’s implementation of the Entry and Exit Program in order to accelerate the safe facilitation of business travelers at the nation’s points of entry

Support the inclusion of the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031

Support future funding for U.S. rail improvements

Summit attendees also shared with Congressional members key takeaways from the “GBTA U.S. Economic Impact Study: Business Travel’s Impact on Jobs and the U.S. Economy” outlining how U.S. business travel contributes $484.4 billion annually, or 1.9% of the U.S. gross domestic product. They also showcased GBTA’s recent poll results reflecting industry concern about the potential negative impact of U.S. government actions on business travel.

GBTA Recognizes U.S. Legislators for Championing Business Travel

GBTA announced Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) as the 2025 recipients of its prestigious “GBTA Navigator Award.” The award is presented to elected officials who have been strong advocates for issues integral to the business travel industry and recognizes them for championing the needs of business travelers and the broader travel sector.

Rep. Larsen is the Ranking Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and in his role, he has advocated for safety and efficiency for aviation. Last year, he worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the Federal Aviation Administration Re-Authorization Bill, which included several GBTA-supported priorities such as safety improvements to the National Airspace System, studies to improve accessibility concerns, and workforce investments to train more pilots and air traffic controllers. This year, Rep. Larsen has worked with the Department of Transportation to make improvements to our nation’s air traffic control system, strategically enhance the workforce for long-term success, and foster innovation to improve aviation safety.

Sen. Moran has championed increasing the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Late last year he formed the bipartisan SAF Caucus to find ways to promote technologically innovative solutions to create a sustainable aviation industry and increase U.S. competitiveness in the domestic production of SAF. Sen. Moran is actively involved in promoting aviation safety through legislative efforts and oversight of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). He has championed bills to improve aviation safety, including the NOTAM Improvement Act, and has pushed FAA leadership on safety system failures and progress in implementing improvements.

The GBTA U.S. Legislative Summit is the only event in the U.S. that advocates for legislation to make the business travel industry better. This year’s Summit was made possible by Altour, BWH Hotels, Cornerstone, Delta Airlines, Enterprise Mobility, CIBT, United Airlines and USiLAW.

“The pace at which we are approaching sustainability is incredible, and establishes business aviation as a leader in this space.”","Among business aviation companies, Gulfstream Aerospace is at the sustainability forefront. In addition to designing increasingly efficient business jets – its current fleet features fuel-efficiency gains of up to 33% over previous models – the company has implemented a series of initiatives to lower the environmental impact of its business operations during the past decade.

When, in 2024, the company wanted to get even more aggressive about sustainability, it needed just the right person to lead the charge in the new role of chief sustainability officer. The person Gulfstream hired was Smitha Hariharan.

Accelerating Progress in Business Aviation Sustainability

Gulfstream brought Hariharan on board to help accelerate the company’s progress towards industry and internal goals, which include meeting General Dynamics’ goals of reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by 2034, relative to 2019.

Biography of a Sustainability Leader

At the start of her career, Hariharan – who holds a Master of Science in Engineering Management from Missouri University of Science and Technology and a Master of Business Administration from Yale – worked in onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration. Next, she joined Halliburton, working in operations management, product management and business development, before becoming head of sustainability at Halliburton Energy Services.

Beyond the experiences and abilities detailed in her C.V., though, what made Hariharan stand out most to Gulfstream was the passion she brings to her work.

“You have to have a passion for sustainability, along with a clear understanding of sustainability principles,” she said, explaining how she progressed to her current leadership role.

Inside Gulfstream’s Sustainability Strategy

Using sustainable aviation fuel to lower flight operations emissions is central to Gulfstream’s sustainability strategy. The company is also creating more sustainable operations on the ground. Its newer facilities boast energy-saving features including recycled building materials, energy-efficient lighting, radiant heating systems, advanced HVAC control systems for heating and cooling, rainwater harvesting and preferred parking for low-emission automobiles.

That’s all great – but it’s not enough for Hariharan.

“All of these areas need to be more environmentally sustainable,” she said.

For her, ensuring that business goals and sustainability goals are mutually supportive is key to making meaningful progress. Doing sustainability right means really, deeply understanding how your business creates value – and how sustainability programs can accelerate value creation.

“Laying down the right framework for your company and where it is on the sustainability journey requires clear thinking, identifying priorities and understanding the role your organization plays in the business aviation value chain,” she explained.

Partnering With CLIMBING. FAST. to Drive Business Aviation Sustainability

As part of its effort to lead in sustainability, Gulfstream is partnering with CLIMBING. FAST., an advocacy campaign showcasing business aviation’s many benefits to society, from creating opportunities for today’s workforce to spearheading the drive to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The campaign highlights business aviation sustainability leaders, innovations, and milestones, in addition to the industry’s value to citizens, businesses and communities.

According to Hariharan, CLIMBING. FAST. effectively communicates the shared goals of business aviation companies and the industry’s significant sustainability achievements, while also identifying ways the industry can collaborate to lower emissions and reduce waste. Based on her work at Gulfstream and things like the company’s partnership with CLIMBING. FAST., she is optimistic about progress toward sustainability in business aviation.

“I am so glad to be a part of this company and this industry at this time,” Hariharan said. “The pace at which we are approaching sustainability is incredible, and establishes business aviation as a leader in this space.”",https://climbingfast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/d_g700_a_newsroom_00121.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 17:01:42.166945

New Aircraft Engines Run At Cooler Temperatures While newer aircraft have promised to run with lower carbon emissions, their engines run at cooler temperatures when compared to older generation aircraft.","It's no secret that the world is facing a climate crisis, and that businesses are looking at ways to limit their carbon footprint, in a bid to help lower greenhouse gas emissions amid the harsh reality of climate change. However, some researchers believe that newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft could be contributing more to global warming than older series aircraft. Around 65% of jets cruise at altitudes between 30,000 to 39,000 feet, a prime location for aircraft contrails to occur.

The aviation industry is under immense pressure to reduce its current carbon footprint, which has seen airlines and their aircraft manufacturers invest billions into fuel-efficient aircraft, which are promised to have less fuel burn, and as a result, emit far less greenhouse gases per passenger mile. The Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are the poster children for such initiatives, with promises to help reduce operating costs and lower emissions that he airline may attempt to offset.

Contributing More, Not Less

Recent research has identified that modern aircraft could inadvertently be adding more to global warming than older, less efficient aircraft. This is not due to their carbon emissions, but due to the contrail-induced cirrus clouds that the aircraft produce. The aviation industry has previously set lofty ambitions for environmental targets, promising to reduce emissions without fully discovering the technology required to hit these goals. Some carriers have set a 2050 date to cut their emissions footprint completely. However, the majority of this has so far been done by using recycled oils, carbon offsets, and adjusting their onboard offerings to limit waste.

Contrail-induced cirrus clouds are high-altitude clouds that are composed of ice crystals, produced from the condensation of freezing water vapor that comes from an aircraft's exhaust. These clouds result in contrails that spread out and evolve into cirrus clouds in unique climatic conditions.

The formation is done by water vapor that is present in the aircraft's exhaust, which mixes with cold, humid air and freezes into crystals. The contrails are the visible streaks that people below can spot in the clouds, which are left behind the airplane. These are seen when aircraft are flying at very high altitudes. Around 10% of all contrail production, known as persistent contrails, can remain for hours after the flight has passed. Aircraft fly at high altitudes such as 30,000 to 39,000 feet, as this is where the air is thin, but also where the air is more humid, resulting in contrails.

Impact On The World's Climate

Both contrail cirrus and natural cirrus trails are composed of ice crystals and have radiative effects on our world's climate. This is due to the impact on the quantity of sunlight that can reach the Earth's surface versus how much heat is trapped in the atmosphere. If the air is humid and cold enough, there are conditions where contrails can remain for hours, and even days, and slowly spread out, creating contrail cirrus.

Unlike CO2, contrails have a short but intense warming effect on Earth due to them trapping heat in the atmosphere, and on some occasions reflecting light into space. This results in a net effect of warming, and it is estimated that contrails can contribute significantly to global warming.

While contrails usually dissipate quickly, in some conditions they will remain for hours, and if this continues, they can spread into cirrus clouds, which are high, thin, wispy clouds formed of ice crystals. While more fuel-efficient jets, like the Dreamliner and Airbus A350, have been commended for lower CO2 emissions when compared to older generation aircraft, research reveals the paradox that they may be contributing more to global warming than previously thought.

New Aircraft Engines Run At Cooler Temperatures

While newer aircraft have promised to run with lower carbon emissions, their engines run at cooler temperatures when compared to older generation aircraft. This results in more water vapor being produced at high altitudes, which is a key contributor to persistent contrails.

This is where the industry is sitting on a knife-edge, as while newer planes can promise lower CO2 emissions, they may produce more contrails than older aircraft. Some researchers suggest, however, that persistent contrails could outweigh CO2 savings in the short term. Flights operating at night, which are usually in cooler temperatures, are the prime ingredient for contrail production, meaning that in the darkness of night, it is the worst time for contrails to happen.

Contrail-induced cirrus clouds do have the possibility to contribute to a greater immediate warming effect when compared to carbon emissions; however, as a short-term, but potent contributor, it has to be weighed up against CO2, for which aviation accounts for almost 2.5% of global emissions. As reported by PHYS.ORG, airlines are now admitting that the production of contrails at high altitudes could be a factor in global warming, and airlines such as American, and Southwest Airlines, are now looking at how and when these contrails are at their most harmful to the environment, and what can be done to reduce them.

How To Fix The Problem?

While there is no quick fix to the problem, there are a few adjustments that can be made to lower contrail formation. Avoiding humid air layers is the first step. If planes fly with small altitude changes, this could reduce the contrail warming by up to 50%, with minimal effect on the operating cost of the flight (i.e., fuel burn).

Sustainable aviation fuel (also known as SAF) has the chance to burn cleaner, which, as a result, reduces both CO2 and the contrail risk. With hydrogen power aircraft currently in development, this may eventually see the chance of contrails being eliminated in their entirety. Potential solutions outlined below:

This is a complicated trade-off, with the solution being that there needs to be a balance of CO2 emission cuts, with developed contrail mitigation. This can be done by using newer, engineered, smarter new flight paths, and the adoption of cleaner, more sustainable fuel. Without the industry looking to address both issues, the climate progress within aviation could be undermined by this warming effect.

A Study Fears Rerouting Flights Could Lead To More Climate Warming

A study by the University of Reading and Sorbonne Université looked at the formation of contrails above the North Atlantic and feared that rerouting flights to avoid contrail creation could also inadvertently add to climate warming. The researchers found that for flights that form contrails, the benefit of avoiding this airspace would outweigh the extra carbon emitted if flying a different route.

These findings identify that regardless of contrail avoidance, it will result in increased CO2 emissions. The study looked at over half a million flights in 2019, and the carbon dioxide emissions from these flights, as well as the contrails that were formed.

Co-author of the study, Professor Nicholas Bellouin, from the University of Reading, shared his findings, which stated: “Rerouting flights to avoid contrails could in theory reduce the climate impact of aviation and make air travel more sustainable. Our findings lift a major obstacle against implementing contrail avoidance, but we now need better forecasting and real-world trials to make this work in practice.""

A Tough Decision To Make

To decide a path forward means a tough decision for airlines, aircraft manufacturers, and regulators, which is either to focus on reducing CO2 emissions, and risk the short-term warming of the earth, by acting on smarter flights, operating with new, sustainable, cleaner fuels, with better regulations and policy. Carbon offset programs, which many airlines offer their passengers the opportunity to contribute, could in addition include contrail mitigations. The existence of contrails could be more damaging over the next two decades than carbon emissions. However, solutions do exist, as we have already explained.

Transparency from airlines and supported research into contrail mitigation, needs to see regulations that will cover all climate impacts, that are not just limited to CO2. Without action, this once invisible threat could completely unravel the industry's progress to lower carbon emissions from the growing demand of aviation and air travel.

The industry needs to find a new balance of how to manage CO2 reduction, alongside contrail mitigation. Fuel efficiency is critical not just for airline operations but also for long-term decarbonization of the aviation industry. Immediate action needs to be taken through research into cleaner fuels and smarter flight paths that can limit the effects of contrails. This will allow the industry to continue developing and becoming more sustainable, without the adverse effects of global warming.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/how-more-fuel-efficient-aircraft-are-linked-to-global-warming.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 15:56:52.895712

They have a 100-square-meter stand to showcase innovations in agriculture, climate, energy, artificial intelligence, and health (read more at: agencia.fapesp.br/54959).

The program at the stand also includes USP professors who, besides being available to investors, entrepreneurs, and visitors to the fair, are participating in roundtable discussions to present technologies developed by their centers of excellence.

One of the round tables was themed “Science and Innovation for a Sustainable Future: USP Advances in Climate, AI, Clean Energy, Health, and Technology,” and featured the following speakers: Julio Meneghini, Paulo Artaxo, Carlos Labate, Marcelo Zuffo, Fabio Cozman, and Vanderlei Bagnato.

Meneghini discussed some of the projects and innovations presented at VivaTech by the Research Center for Greenhouse Gas Innovation (RCGI), a research center based at the Engineering School (POLI-USP) and funded by Shell and FAPESP. The RCGI was responsible for organizing the institutional participation of USP and FAPESP in the Paris event, including stand design, technology curation, and activity programming.

“We brought some examples of innovations produced at the RCGI, such as startups involved in green methanol production, solar-powered hydrogen production, solid oxide fuel cells, and ethanol-powered electricity generation. We’re also presenting a system that uses virtual reality to produce a multisensory experience simulating the Amazon Rainforest with visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli,” he said.

“The RCGI is celebrating its tenth anniversary, and it’s very satisfying to see the results of important projects developed during this period by the approximately 600 researchers who are part of the project. Our center was created with support from FAPESP under the Engineering Research Centers/Applied Research Centers Program, and our mission is to become a globally recognized center of excellence that contributes to a sustainable future and helps Brazil meet its climate goals established in the Paris Agreement,” said Meneghini.

The RCGI’s executive and scientific director emphasized that the focus is on producing practical solutions based on solid science. One of the programs mentioned was Greenhouse Gases, with projects aimed, for example, at reducing leaks of methane – one of the most potent greenhouse gases – in industrial processes.

“Another RCGI program is Nature-Based Solutions, through which we seek to develop new technologies applicable to agriculture and livestock, making these sectors more sustainable,” said Meneghini.

“At the RCGI, we also have a cross-cutting project that seeks to focus the center’s internationalization efforts, as we believe that Brazil can lead the next great challenge of this century: making progress happen in a sustainable way,” he said.

Paulo Artaxo presented a project aimed at building a greenhouse gas emissions database for the Amazon region, which is also being conducted at the RCGI. The platform is being built using big data techniques to generate information that will enable the monitoring of emissions, a more accurate understanding of their causes, and support for the formulation of public policies aimed at mitigating these gases.

“Initially focused on the Amazon, the project is now being expanded to all of South America. Among the main features of the platform are a harmonized database and a user-friendly interface. All of this provides a solid scientific basis for decision makers to act more safely and effectively,” said Artaxo.

Cerrado solution

Carlos Labate, coordinator of the Multi-user Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Lipidomics Laboratory at the Luiz de Queiroz School of Agriculture (ESALQ-USP), gave a presentation on macaúba as a promising crop for sustainable development. In partnership with Acelen Renováveis, ESALQ-USP researchers are developing a project to produce biofuels from macaúba, a plant native to the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna-like biome) that has not yet been domesticated.

“Macaúba stands out for its extremely high oil productivity – it produces seven to ten times more oil than soybeans – and it’s important to note that it isn’t a food crop, meaning it doesn’t compete with crops such as soybeans or corn. This eliminates one of the main criticisms of using agricultural land for biofuel production: we aren’t taking space away from food production,” said Labate.

The goal of the project is to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. According to the professor, Brazil has a significant amount of land with agricultural potential, and macaúba is a sustainable way to utilize it. “Managing macaúba using degraded pastures won’t encourage deforestation or negatively impact land use,” he said.

The ESALQ-USP professor explained that they are studying three species of macaúba: Acrocomia aculeata, distributed mainly in the states of Bahia and Minas Gerais and in the southern region of the state of Mato Grosso; Acrocomia totai, present in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul; and Acrocomia intumescens, found mainly in the Northeast region of Brazil. “This diversity represents multiple opportunities for regional development, with species adapted to different environments, from the coast to the interior of the country. We’ve already sequenced the genome of A. aculeata and are finalizing the sequencing of A. totai. This work is fundamental for the genetic improvement of the plant,” he said.

The researchers are building a germplasm bank using samples collected from different regions. These samples show genetic variability in characteristics such as fruit size and quantity, which are essential factors for developing more productive varieties.

A trillion computers

The goal of the project presented by Marcelo Zuffo, coordinator of the Interdisciplinary Center for Interactive Technologies at USP, is to develop a real-time perception of the Amazon Rainforest through a new type of artificial intelligence.

“Our main challenge is to build a persistent perception of the biodiversity of the rainforest – a perception that’s accurate, direct, continuous, and long-lasting. It’s important to remember that many trees in tropical forests live for centuries, while most electronic devices today don’t even last a few decades,” he said.

The project, called Farm AI, proposes developing autonomous devices equipped with carbon dioxide, temperature, infrared, and other sensors. These sensors must operate safely, efficiently, and autonomously in remote environments. The researchers are also using technologies such as blockchain and encryption to ensure the security, traceability, and integrity of the data collected.

“What’s our vision? A trillion computers. We work with the concept of dust computing. Imagine computational grains of sand scattered throughout the Amazon – a simple handful of this sand containing billions of grains, each capable of processing data, communicating, and collaborating with others,” said Zuffo.

The researcher commented that the next big technological wave may be in such devices, which are embedded everywhere and capable of interacting, collaborating, and replicating themselves. “Intelligent devices interacting organically, creating a distributed collective intelligence – for example, a collective organic intelligence of the forest – leading to an internet of trees,” he said.

“We already have working prototypes. The idea is to create a swarm of robust, very low-cost devices with environmental sensor applications. We’ve already conducted the first tests, with ten devices launched in the forest, and we plan to produce 2,000 units,” he said.

Zuffo explains that each device is coin-sized and contains a 2 x 3 millimeter chip with 300 million transistors. “It’s a complete computer capable of running AI and encryption, and can connect to more than 200 different sensors,” he said.

Preserving Indigenous languages

For decades, USP has been a national reference in artificial intelligence research, conducting studies in various fields and units, including medicine, engineering, computer science, and social sciences. To consolidate this work, the Center for Artificial Intelligence (C4AI) was created as a partnership between USP, FAPESP, and IBM. The center brings together about 90 professors from various fields, explained Fabio Cozman, the director of the center.

“At the C4AI, we investigate everything from AI algorithms to their practical applications in sectors such as health, law, public policy, agribusiness, and natural language processing, with an emphasis on the Portuguese language,” said Cozman, who highlighted two C4AI projects focused on sustainability, which was the theme of the session at VivaTech.

“In the first, the idea is to predict extreme events in the South Atlantic, particularly studying storm surges, which cause flooding due to tides and winds rather than rain. The project uses a machine learning approach based on physical models that integrates ocean data with environmental modeling, in collaboration with researchers in engineering and marine sciences,” he said.

“The second project focuses on preserving Brazilian indigenous languages to ensure their continuity among new generations. The challenge lies in developing translation tools for Brazil’s indigenous languages. The country has more than 200 languages besides Portuguese. The proposal is to create applications and tools that help young people learn and become familiar with their language and their ancestral language,” said Cozman.

Photonics against bacterial resistance

“At the University of São Paulo, we work with three fundamental principles: doing science with excellence; doing science with relevance – that is, solving problems, especially with social responsibility; and third, being international. We don’t produce knowledge just for ourselves, but for humanity. That’s what we’re proud of,” said Vanderlei Bagnato, coordinator of the Optics and Photonics Research Center (CePOF) at the São Carlos Institute of Physics (IFSC-USP).

“In São Carlos, we have about 120 people working. We started as a center funded by FAPESP, and today we’re also part of a federal government program, with projects co-funded by companies. We currently have around 90 projects with the private sector – 60 already completed and 30 in progress. Our team is multidisciplinary: physicists, doctors, pharmacists, mathematicians – we work with technology development and instrumentation, from quantum physics to healthcare,” he explained.

“We work in human, environmental, and animal health, facing three major challenges. The first is cancer treatment. Despite advances in knowledge, access to treatment is still very limited – even in rich countries, the costs are extremely high. The second challenge is chronic diseases such as Parkinson’s, diabetes, fibromyalgia, and arthritis, which affect millions of people and require new protocols and equipment to improve patients’ quality of life,” said Bagnato.

“The third major challenge is infections, especially given the bacterial resistance to antibiotics. We’re developing an innovative treatment for resistant pneumonia: we’ve created inhalable molecules that attach themselves to the lungs at the site of infection and are activated by infrared light. This generates free radicals that destroy the bacterial colony or make the bacteria sensitive to antibiotics again,” said the CePOF coordinator.

“We’re already in phase 3 of clinical trials for this treatment. In Texas, we’re developing animal models of pneumonia in sheep and dogs – species that naturally develop the disease. We hope to begin clinical trials in humans next year. This approach could be a game changer because 10 to 15 million people die from resistant pneumonia each year, not due to a lack of doctors, but due to a lack of effective drugs,” said Bagnato. He is partnering with Texas A&M University to establish a CePOF-style center in the United States with funding from the State of Texas.",https://mediasvc.eurekalert.org/Api/v1/Multimedia/5a886106-657b-40ac-9552-9c36c5cc25c2/Rendition/thumbnail/Content/Public,N,,2025-06-13 15:56:58.245272

Speaking at a closed-door event with business partners on April 22, 2025, Rhenus Indonesia presented a comprehensive suite of services aimed at improving carbon management, reporting transparency, and emissions reduction across multiple transport modes. The offerings come as global regulations such as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) place mounting pressure on supply chains to decarbonize. Indonesia is also developing its own carbon pricing frameworks and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) roadmap to meet its Net Zero Emissions target by 2060.

Key elements of Rhenus’ sustainable logistics portfolio include:

Emissions Reporting & Monitoring: Emissions dashboards allow businesses to track CO₂ output across air, sea, and land transport. Partnering with EcotransIT, Rhenus helps optimize energy use and calculate freight emissions across multimodal supply chains.

Sustainable Aviation Solutions: Initiatives such as Rhegreen optimize aircraft selection for minimal emissions, while SAF insetting programs and Clean Cargo collaborations offer scalable decarbonization pathways.

Sustainable Shipping & Overland Transport: The Transport Mode Optimizer tool supports sustainable routing decisions, while investments in alternative drive vehicles—including electric trucks, CNG, LNG, and biodiesel fleets—reduce overland transport emissions.

Sustainable Facilities: Rhenus is integrating eco-friendly designs across multiple Indonesian sites, including photovoltaic power systems, rainwater utilization, and energy-efficient infrastructure.

With operations in Indonesia for over a decade, Rhenus supports industries ranging from automotive and healthcare to industrial and consumer sectors, operating from six locations across Java, Sumatra, and Batam.

“At Rhenus, sustainability is not an afterthought—it’s a core principle shaping how we build and operate supply chains,” said Fabian Kieble, Managing Director, Rhenus Indonesia. “From transparent emission reporting to cleaner transport solutions, our goal is to drive meaningful change across the logistics sector.”

Rhenus’ expanded sustainability offering reflects the growing urgency for logistics providers in emerging markets to align with global emissions frameworks while supporting local businesses facing new compliance obligations. As Indonesia positions itself to play a greater role in the sustainable fuel market and tightens carbon reporting standards, third-party logistics providers (3PLs) like Rhenus are increasingly serving as both compliance partners and operational advisors. The firm’s adoption of SAF insetting, multimodal optimization tools, and alternative fuel vehicles signals a proactive stance toward decarbonization, while its strong ISO certification portfolio reinforces its credentials for multinational clients navigating Scope 3 emissions reporting under EU and international sustainability mandates.",https://logistics-manager.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dghsrthwrthwrth.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 12:56:35.588661

Friday, June 13th, 2025

The geopolitical risk premium is back, with Israel’s strikes on Iran bringing ICE Brent futures to $75 per barrel in a world where OPEC+ continues to unwind its production cuts and global demand is decelerating due to Donald Trump’s tariff wars. Whilst oil infrastructure was not damaged in Israel’s strikes, the anticipation of Iran’s retaliation is already sending ripples across the oil industry, with the Red Sea becoming a target again and Israel’s gas fields pre-emptively halting production ahead of the weekend.

Israel’s Attack on Iran Marks Largest Daily Jump in Three Years. Israel’s attack on Iran sent crude prices to their highest in five months, stoking fears that further escalation would impede navigation through the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway transiting a fifth of global oil consumption, some 19 million b/d of crude and products.

Egypt Clinches Monster LNG Deal. The government of Egypt has reached agreements with global traders Saudi Aramco, Trafigura, Vitol and Shell for up to 160 cargoes of LNG, covering the needs of the North African country for H2 2025 and next year, with premiums of $0.70-0.75 per mmBtu above TTF.

Canada Plans New Pipeline to the Pacific. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith will be proposing a new crude pipeline route from Alberta to the Port of Prince Rupert in British Columbia to the Canadian government, currently gauging private companies’ appetite for the mulled 1 million b/d conduit.

Guyana to Mark First Oil From Yellowtail Soon. US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) expects to load its first oil cargo the Guyana’s fourth production unit in August-September, with the grade produced at the Yellowtail and Redtail fields called ‘Golden Arrowhead’ and being lighter than other Guyanese grades.

India Imports Record Russian Crude Oil. India is poised to hit a new all-time high after ratcheting up imports of Russian crude, importing over 2.2 million b/d in the first two weeks of June, equivalent to 46% of the South Asian country’s total needs, as Russian grades still trade below the price cap.

ADNOC Mulls Takeover Targets. ADNOC, the national oil company of the UAE, is reportedly mulling the potential acquisition of Australia’s upstream firm Santos (ASX:STO) whilst concurrently looking at BP’s (NYSE:BP) natural gas assets, some of which might be up for grabs as the UK major deleverages.

Algeria Has Had Enough of Being a Producer. Following the path charted by Middle Eastern national oil companies, Algeria has allocated $7 billion in refinery investments for the next five years, including a new refinery in Hassi Messaoud, a new naphtha cracker in Arzew and a new fuel oil cracking unit in Skikda.

EPA Disappoints US Biodiesel Producers. The US Environmental Protection Agency is widely expected to propose lower-than-expected biofuel blending requirements for 2026 and 2027, rejecting the 5.25-billion-gallon demand of biodiesel producers, a huge jump from this year’s 5.25 billion gallons.

The Citgo Drama Will Never End. A US judge in Delaware extended the schedule for the auctioning of Citgo’s shares to August 18, marking yet another hiccup in the eight-year court case as investment firm Red Tree and other bidders are expected to submit improved offers for the refiner’s asset by mid-June.

EU Offers to Subsidize SAF. With sustainable aviation fuel still pricing $1,000 per metric tonne above conventional jet fuel, the European Union offered to subsidize some 200 million litres of SAF to help airline carriers meet the EU’s own stringent mandates as Brussels’ quota rises to 6% by 2030.

US Oil Will Do the Unthinkable in 2026. According to the EIA’s updated Short-Term Energy Outlook report, US crude oil production will decline next year and mark its first annual dip since the COVID-19 impact of 2021, expecting 13.37 million b/d in 2026 after an average of 13.42 million b/d this year.

Not Every LNG Facility Needs to be Built. US natural gas developer Venture Global (NYSE:VG) withdrew its application for the proposed 24 mtpa Delta LNG facility in Louisiana, instead focusing on the 18 mtpa Plaquemines Expansion Project which already saw a preliminary regulatory nod from the FERC.

Texas Drilling Slowdown Becomes Reality. Drilling permits for new oil and natural gas wells in Texas dropped by 34% in May to 504, down from 759 in the same month last year, with oil-prolific Midland seeing the largest decline, whilst natural gas permits remained roughly stagnant at 40 permits.

US Carmakers Struggle to Secure Rare Earths. US carmaker Ford (NYSE:F) announced that it was forced to idle production at its Chicago plant producing the Explorer SUV as inventories of rare earth components were ‘day to day’, signalling that potentially other sites could be shut down soon, too.

Boeing will invest $17.48 million CAD to strengthen the energy security of Canada and bolster the country’s economic growth. The investments will promote the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and are part of Boeing’s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) commitment to Canada for its selection of Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon to fulfill its long-range, multi-mission aircraft role.

The investments will support two projects:

$10 million CAD for Project Avance: A joint venture between Bioenergie AECN and Alder Renewables in Port Cartier, Quebec, to convert wood residuals from existing sawmills into a low-carbon intermediate “biocrude” that can be converted into SAF. Project Avance is forecasted to enable future projects in Quebec to produce 10 million gallons (approximately 37,854,000 liters) of unblended SAF annually.

$7.48 million CAD for Dimensional Energy: The power-to-liquid technology provider will scope scaled development of its pioneering carbon utilization project to convert industrial CO2 emissions into synthetic aviation fuel production. This study will support future projects in North America to convert 500,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions to produce more than 40 million gallons (approximately 151,416,000 liters) of SAF annually.

“This significant investment in SAF production demonstrates our commitment to scaling sustainable aviation fuel and to our work in Canada, where we have driven innovation for over a century,” said Al Meinzinger, president, Boeing Canada. “With 2,000 employees across Canada, Boeing is committed to supporting Canada’s aerospace industry and domestic productivity and advancing exciting new energy innovations.”

“Our proprietary Alder Renewable Crude (ARC) product has enormous potential to fast-track the production of SAF in Canada,” said Darren Fuller, chief commercial officer of Alder Renewables. “The support of Boeing and local government leaders in Quebec is supercharging our commitment to securing a low carbon future for the aviation sector. Close collaboration with our industry partners — Boeing and Bioenergie AECN — coupled with government support is essential to get to the next phase. We’re ready to play our part.”

“Making high performance hydrocarbons is an innovative use for carbon dioxide that turns unwanted waste into valuable fuels and products,” said Jason Salfi, CEO of Dimensional Energy. “This investment from Boeing provides essential predevelopment capital to catalyze projects and scale our proven power-to-liquid technology to market now.”

“Boeing’s investments in Quebec and British Columbia highlight Canada’s position as a strategic partner of choice in sustainable aviation and will generate high-value jobs and economic growth,” said the Honourable Mélanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions. “The Government of Canada is committed to reducing aviation emissions and reinforcing Canada’s position as a global leader in aerospace innovation.”

The two SAF projects are part of Boeing’s over $280 million CAD investment in Canadian Clean Technology projects through the P-8 ITB program. Boeing investments will advance technologies that have the potential to unlock vast renewable resources and accelerate industries producing low-carbon fuels to meet the rising global demand. SAF has the potential today to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over the fuel’s lifecycle and offers the fastest route to decarbonization in the aviation sector.

The Government of Canada announced its decision to acquire the P-8A Poseidon aircraft in November 2023 as part of the Canadian Multi-Mission Aircraft (CMMA) project. These Boeing CMMA ITB investments build on more than $2 billion in P-8 contracts with Canadian companies to date, contributing to economic growth across the country. The purchase will generate benefits of nearly $358 CAD million annually in economic output to Canada, according to an independent study by Ottawa-based Doyletech Corp.

TIM ROBINSON FRAeS, STEPHEN BRIDGEWATER FRAeS and JACK RICHARDSON look ahead to what promises to be a fascinating event for the global aerospace, aviation and space industry.

From 16 to 22 June, Le Bourget airport on the outskirts of the French capital will play host to the 55th edition of the Paris Air Show. The event looks set to be large with 2,500 exhibitors from across 48 countries alongside 300,000 unique visitors and 300 start-up companies from 21 countries in attendance. 150 aircraft will be available with 210 flying displays scheduled. Like previous instalments, items on display will span the entire aerospace and defence sector with civil, military and space exhibits alike, alongside emerging fields such as urban air mobility as well as opportunities to progress careers.

This year, tragically, the aerospace industry gathers for this trade exhibition in the shadow of a horrific airliner crash - with the loss of an Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner with 242 people onboard from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick on 12 June as these words are written. Our thoughts are with the friends, families and colleagues of those involved in this tragedy and a reminder that although these trade shows may feature fierce corporate rivalry, in safety the industry works very closely together.

Yet more widely - this Paris Air Show comes at a time of massive geopolitical uncertainty and upheaval - with unexpected shocks rippling across all sectors, from commercial to defence and space, that is leaving aerospace professionals struggling to keep up with change. The War in Ukraine has now been joined by the US White House seemingly starting a trade war with the rest of the world, stepping back from its role as guarantor of European security and refocusing its space ambitions. All these have left partners, allies as well as adversaries floundering and scrambling to understand what the first, second and third order of effects will be from this reversal of globalisation and shake-up of the Post-WW2 security system.

The trouble with tariffs

A350 wing factory at Broughton - will the global aerospace industry get its wings clipped by protectionism? (Tim Robinson/RAeS)

Whereas announcements and discussions at the 2023 Paris Air Show focused on the rebound of global air travel demand in the post-pandemic era – and a growing push for sustainability – the 2025 edition is more likely to highlight how the airline sector can now navigate this large scale growth against the headwind of supply chain issues and global geopolitical uncertainty. The subject of tariffs will doubtless never be far from any announcements or discussions.

Airline manufacturing has been governed by the Agreement on Trade of Civil Aircraft since 1980. In the words of the World Trade Organisation, this eliminated import duties on “all aircraft, other than military aircraft, as well as on all other products covered by the agreement [including] civil aircraft engines and their parts and components, all components and sub-assemblies of civil aircraft, and flight simulators and their parts and components.” This mean that manufacturers could both sell aircraft around the world and also develop global supply chains without paying added costs in duties but now, 45 years later, this accord between 30 nations has been seemingly blown apart by US President Donald Trump’s global trade war.

Tariffs also have a non-direct impact on the airline industry, with the economic uncertainty they cause resulting in holiday makers and business travellers reducing spending on travel. That said, the long-term prospect for growth in air travel, buoyed by global GDP and a growing middle class in emerging markets remains strong.

Setting tariffs aside, supply chain issues remain the key concern for airlines and manufacturers. Aircraft deliveries peaked at 1,842 per year in 2018 and have never fully recovered from the pandemic-induced slump to 844 in 2020. Figures bounced back to a post-Covid high of 1,386 in 2023 but declined again to 1,264 last year as the fragility of the supply chain, lack of skilled workers and – in the case of Boeing – increased regulatory scrutiny – caused production bottlenecks. In 2024, Boeing’s production more than halved compared to the previous year but even Airbus continued to miss targets to ramp up production rates.

Elsewhere, Brazil’s Embraer recently recorded its best quarter of sales since 2016 in terms of revenue (across both commercial and military arms). The first quarter of 2025 accounted for $1.1bn in sales, representing a 23% year-over-year increase. Interestingly, while airline orders remained fairly stable over the period, the OEM’s business jet division reported a 35% increase in revenue.

The manufacturer expects to deliver between 77 and 85 commercial aircraft and 145 to 155 business jets this year. Over the first three months of 2025, its commercial aviation department delivered three E-195E2s and four E1 airliners while the bizav section handed over 23 executive jets to customers (two Phenom 100s, 12 Phenom 300s, three Praetor 500s and six Praetor 600s).

Meanwhile, Franco\Italian manufacturer ATR, the world’s largest producer of regional turboprop aircraft saw orders rise by 40% in 2024 including sales to 16 new operators. It received total orders for 56 aircraft (51 ATR72s and five ATR42s) over the year, giving it an order backlog of 150 airframes. The OEM says it will “highlight its commitment to accelerating sustainable connections” during the show. An ATR 72-600 in the colours of Brazilian airline Azul will be on static display throughout the week and a second example will participate in the daily flying display. Also expect an announcement of a further collaboration with RTX’s Pratt and Whitney Canada on future propulsion during the event.

In turboprops, De Havilland Canada's sales for 2024 saw a resurgence in orders, particularly for the Dash 8-400 with sales including ANA, Widerøe and the Tanzania Government Flight Agency. The Twin Otter is also proving a sales success and two examples will be on display at Paris during the week.

Although China’s COMAC is not slated to bring any airframes to Paris, the ongoing rollout of its C919 means the manufacturer will be hoping to seize the opportunity to tempt impatient airline bosses to jump ship from the ‘big two’. Whether COMAC speaks publicly about delays to the C929 programme and the threat to withhold US-manufactured engines and components for the C919 remains to be seen but the ongoing pariah status of Russian manufacturers and supply chain woes from Western OEMs presents COMAC with an opportunity to capitalise upon.

Despite the waiting lists there is still a strong appetite for fleet modernisation and new technology aircraft. Engine manufacturers are expected to make announcements at Paris over the future of open-fan, hydrogen, electric and hybrid propulsion, but can we expect any announcements of the much-awaited clean sheet narrowbody replacements for Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320 Family? It seems unlikely.

However, keep an eye on the blended wing body concepts – JetZero is exhibiting at the show for the first time and may prove to be the event’s wildcards.

Among the airliners so far confirmed to be on display at Le Bourget for the week are De Havilland Canada’s Twin Otter Classic 300-G (and the military Twin Otter 400 Guardian variant), Textron’s Cessna SkyCourier, at least one ATR42/72, an Airbus A220, an Embraer E192-E2, a Riyadh Air Airbus A321neo and a Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300ER in a special livery showcasing the Paris Saint-Germain football team. A last minute addition will be a Riyadh Air 787 in the carrier's second livery.

Defence top of the agenda

With US President Donald Trump demanding that NATO partners pay their own way in defence, the war in Ukraine now in its third year, China unveiling stealth platforms, a recent clash between India and Pakistan and now massive Israeli air strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure – expect military hardware to take a higher profile than previous shows as nations refocus on rearming and boosting their defences in this new uncertain world.

With the NATO Summit just the following week, and members nations being urged to sign up for 5% commitment of GDP defence spending (3.5% on ‘hard power’) the Paris Air Show will be the stage for the world’s aerospace and defence companies to show off their wares. This will also see some civil aviation companies and start-ups show off dual-use technology in a bid to a get a slice of this pie.

While US companies will be out in force as usual, a key question for buyers nations now worried that an erratic Washington could exert pressure on them via withholding spares or technology will be ‘is this ITAR free?’. Additionally, with initiatives like the European Defence Fund (EDF) Europe is also seeking to stimulate and invest in European military R&D and defence suppliers.

With China having unveiled its three-engined J-36 in December and the US having selected Boeing to produce its F-47 NGAD, future fighters will be a key focus at the show – with the Franco-German-Spanish FCAS the centrepiece of continental Europe’s next-generation combat aircraft effort. Upgrading existing combat aircraft - such as Eurofighter and Rafale to bridge the gap between these current platforms and the 'sixth gen' platforms in development will also be a key theme. On display will be a Rafale with conformal tanks - showing off an option to increase the types range, without compromising its weapons payload.

Yet – the stunning attack by Ukraine on Russian strategic bomber bases, in a highly innovative SF operation using small drones will also be uppermost in military minds – both from the need to protect infrastructure from these sorts of threats, to exploiting this revolution in autonomy, AI and uncrewed systems.

Finally – there is likely to be a strong focus on boosting production of existing missiles and munitions – as lessons from Ukraine show how quickly nations can burn through stocks of missiles in a peer-on-peer conflict.

At the show, US company Anduril will showcase its Fury collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) in mock-up form, while Lockheed Martin/Sikorsky will be bringing its S-97 co-axial helicopter. Eurofighter, now increasing production with follow-on orders from Germany, Italy and Spain will have a Typhoon mock-up, while Boeing will be bringing an F-15 and Apache – the latter, incredibly, celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. The US DoD 'corral' will also feature a range of Boeing products including the C-17, CH-47, F-15, F/A-18, KC-46 and P-8. A Lockheed Martin F-35 will also be in the DoD static display.

The increasingly popular Embraer C-390 Millennium will be represented by the KC-390 variant in both the flying display at static exhibition. It will be joined on static display by an example of the company's A-29 Super Tucano light attack and advanced trainer.

Commercial aviation

Will Vietjet make a splash at the show? (Vietjet)

Paris ‘week’ has traditionally provided a flurry of orders for airliners manufactured by both Airbus (the home team) and Boeing, but recent years have also seen ATR scooping significant numbers of orders. The 2023 show also saw Canada’s De Havilland Aviation announce a slew of orders for its DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-8 airframes.

However, much has changed over the two years since the last show. Supply chains are even more fractured, Boeing has been tarred with both safety and regulatory brushes and – the latest wild card – tariffs are now threatening to impact orders on both sides of the Atlantic.

In 2024, Boeing secured 569 orders for new airliners with Airbus receiving firm commitments for 878 airframes. By the end of May 2025, Boeing had announced 249 orders (44% of last year’s entire sales) with Airbus slightly ahead at 291. However, in the case of the European giant this figure is just 33% of its total 2024 sales. These figures will doubtless be boosted during the week at Le Bourget, and Airbus announced a hitherto unheard of ‘zero’ sales in its May earnings call suggesting that it is holding back announcements to unveil during the show.

Interestingly, the orders announced during the first five months of 2025 are dominated by legacy full-service operators, with low-cost carriers seemingly feeling the pinch from a slowdown in travel bookings. That said, the trend towards extended range narrowbody aircraft is likely to see the A321XLR featuring heavily in the orderbook. While transatlantic travel from Europe to the US shows signs of slowing due to concerns over tariffs, visas and other US policies, the long haul travel sector continues to strengthen as airlines expand their global networks. With Chinese and Indian carriers eyeing up routes to Europe, could this result in a boom in orders for Boeing’s Dreamliner and/or Airbus’ A350?

Industry insiders are tipping Malaysia's AirAsia as potentially announcing an order for at least 100 Airbus aircraft during the show, potentially including the A220 for regional operations. Vietjet is also reportedly planning an announcement to acquire around 100 Airbus narrowbody airliners at Paris. The order is believed to relate to A321neos, adding to the 35 it has in service and a further 77 on order.

Reports in the Indian media ahead of the show suggests low-cost carrier IndiGo Airlines could be making an announcement at Paris regarding the possible acquisition of between 30 and 50 ATR72-600s. It already operates 48 of the aircraft.

Other airlines worth watching for with regard to orders include Qatar Airways (A320 Family) Riyadh Air (A350s) and Etihad Airways (A350s), Air India, and Royal Air Maroc. The latter has stated its aim to grow its fleet from 59 to 200 ahead of the 2030 World Cup in Morocco, Spain and Portugal.

Space

Le Bourget is not just an air show – it is also a space show where some of the world’s leading space agencies, satellite and launcher companies come together. However, this year will be an air of uncertainty as international partners digest the impact of US cuts to NASA – and what that might mean for joint missions and projects.

In human spaceflight, the US is intending to axe SLS, Orion after Artemis III, as well as the Lunar Gateway and reduce funding to the ISS - in a pivot to Mars. Both Orion (with Airbus providing the European Built Service module) and Lunar Gateway featured extensive international partnership – and now potentially leave other space agencies adrift.

With NASA-led Earth Observation and planetary science missions also under threat, Paris could be a key venue for space agencies to explore new international partnerships and even perhaps an opportunity to take the lead in some areas, if the US goes ahead with its plan to gut NASA’s science mission.

Yet European orbital launch capability from European soil is still yet to arrive – with Germany’s Rocket Factory Augsburg RFA One exploding on the launch pad at SaxaVord, in the Shetland Islands in August 2024 and Isar Aerospace also suffering a failure of its rocket from Norway’s Andøya spaceport in March. Could 2025 be the year in which a European-built rocket launches from Europe?

Finally, and connected to the defence theme of sovereign capability, there will also be discussions on how Europe can reduce its dependence on US space capability – whether Starlink, US launchers or military space. Attention will therefore be given to whether European can repurpose or develop military capabilities – for example in spy satellites using civil Earth Observation satellites.

Game of drones

Airbus plans to display a mock up of its Aliaca-VTOL drone at the show. (Airbus)

As the war in Ukraine has continued, the importance of loitering and one-way attack drones has grown seemingly by the day -and the Paris Air Show will be a showcase for those evolving. A well-established player in this segment is Israel’s UVision which will display what it claims is a world first at the show. This takes the form of a helicopter -launched variant of its HERO-120 loitering munition. The company has developed this in partnership with American companies Fulcrum Concepts and Mistral, to meet a requirement of the US Marine Corps. Already a HERO-120 user, the munition could be deployed from AH-1Z Viper and UH-1Y helicopters as well as the F-35C fighter, MV-22 tilt-rotor and CH-53K heavy lift helicopter as part of the service’s long-range attack munition requirement.

Also representing Israel will be Aeronautics Group Ltd, displaying its Orbiter family of UAVs including the VTOL Orbiter 4 and larger, MALE, Orbiter 5. A similar offer to the former will be exhibited by French firm Aeronefs services, whose LR2M VTOL can be assembled in as little as 10 minutes while Norway’s Rift Dynamics will display the Wasp, which it describes as a cross between a surveillance drone and FPV device. As the importance of FPV drones has grown, the US’s Neros Technologies will present its Archer solution.

Making its debut at Paris will be Walkyrie Engineering’s WAD cannister launched UAV. Able to be deployed from vertical or horizontal positions, the WAD can be deployed in a variety of applications including ISR and countering other UAVs, featuring the ability to be recovered. The company will also be showcasing JUMP, a larger, longer range, fixed wing, VTOL UAV. With the proliferation of cheap and disposable UAVs, a key issue is how to counter them, and in this vein, France’s Destinus will present the Hornet UAV, which is designed to neutralise kamikaze drones. The company will also be showcasing the HORNET 30 one-way attack drone and RUTA high speed, high-altitude vehicle. One exhibitor displaying UAV solutions will be Cobtec International with its Sunflower UAV range of patrol drones. With a patrol range of up to 1,000km, this is offered in two models with the A version guided by GPS and the B using onboard visual systems.

Another established player in the UAV space is Austria’s Scheibel, which with its growing customer base, will exhibit its S-300 rotary-wing UAV, a larger version of its popular S-100. Also growing its presence across Europe is Portugal’s Tekever, which will exhibit is AR3 and AR5 UAVs at the show. The former has a 12 hour endurance and has the option of eVTOL flight whereas the latter is a can operate beyond radio line of sight for up to 18 hours. Moving to larger companies, Airbus will display several UAV mock ups, including the Aliaca-VTOL, a vertical take-off and landing UAV for maritime or land-based surveillance missions. It combines fixed-wing flight efficiency with multirotor flexibility for take-off and landing, offering up to 3 hours of endurance. The pan-European company will also have on display a mock up of the VSR700 navalised rotary wing UAV, which can carry out roles such as anti-submarine warfare and ISR.

A particularly eye catching offer will be the Moya cargo drone produced by Brazilian company Moya Aero. A innovative feature of this drone is that it tilts its whole body forward inflight in order to carry out roles including crop spraying, surveying or general logistics. Available in pure electric or hybrid-electric mode, the company is in the process of certifying this drone, which has extensive commonality across the two variants. Similarly, the US’s PteroDynamics Inc will be displaying its ‘transwing’ autonomous eVTOL where the wings hold close to the body but upon take-off spread out during transition to horizontal flight. This allows the aircraft to occupy a smaller footprint when on the ground, with applications including public safety and automated cargo delivery.

General Aviation

In recent years France has developed a reputation for the support of innovative General Aviation (GA) aircraft, particularly in the ultralight and very light aircraft (VLA) sectors. The 2023 edition of the Paris Air Show saw Elixir Aviation exhibiting a hydrogen-powered prototype of its H55 two-seater and Airbus, Daher and Safran showed off the yet to be flown ecoPulse demonstrator. The ecoPulse, which is based on a TBM960, was a distributed hybrid-propulsion aircraft with multiple small engines distributed along the wingspan. The aircraft flew in November 2023 and the project ended in December 2024, having reportedly met its objectives. This year, Daher will be exhibiting both its TBM960 and Kodiak 100 turboprops at the show as well as bringing back ecoPulse.

Elixir Aviation has announced plans to debut the turbine-powered variant of its two-seat aircraft during the show. Powered by a Turbotech TP-R90 turboprop, the aircraft will be on display at the French DGAC’s booth.

Toulouse-based Aura Aero is understood to be displaying its Integral R, S and E aircraft in formation during the daily air display. The recently certified R is a two-seat trainer constructed of composite and wood and has already found favour with aerobatic flying schools. The S (the same as the R but with a nosewheel instead of a tailwheel) is expected to receive certification later this year with the electric-powered Integral E to follow in due course.

Belgium-based JMB Aircraft will be exhibiting the prototype of a turbine powered variant of its VL3 ultralight at the show. The basic VL3, which has just been certified by the British Microlight Aircraft Association in the UK, is now available in Europe with a variety of Rotax powerplants from 100-160hp and either fixed or retractable undercarriage, but the variant on display at Paris has the Turbotech TP-R90 turboprop up front.

Of course Paris week is all about selling aircraft, but one aeroplane in particular is being sold to raise money for a very special cause. A Nynja ultralight, built by students, is being auctioned during the show to support the Aviation Sans Frontières charity. It is hoped that the proceeds will help fund a Cessna Caravan ‘flying hospital’ designed to deliver care in remote regions.

Austria’s Diamond Aircraft has announced it will be bringing a DA-62MPP multi-mission variant of its familiar twin-engined touring aircraft but there is no word yet about whether its much promised electric eDA40 will attend. The latter flew too late to make its intended debut at the 2023 Paris Air Show and although it was exhibited statically at the AERO event in Friedrichshafen, Germany in 2024, it was notably missing from this year’s event.

Textron’s Cessna SkyCourier is slated to attend Paris for the first time, with the twin-engined combi-freighter/passenger aircraft marking its fifth anniversary in 2025 with more than 50 airframes now delivered to owners around the world.

Also part of the Textron group, Beechcraft has announced plans to debut its latest KingAir variant at the show. Based on the familiar KingAir 360, the new machine is a multi-mission demonstrator featuring extended-range fuel tanks, factory installed wing hardpoints and a large cargo door. It is targeted at aeromedical and survey operators as well as for quasi-military use. A factory installed option is an extended nose that can house sensors as well as a retractable electro-optical/infrared sensor turret.

Meanwhile, fellow Textron company Bell Helicopter is listed as bringing a Bell 407Gxi, 429, 505 JetRanger and 525 Relentless helicopters to the show. An interesting debutant in the flying display will be the Airbus RACER (Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft) high-speed helicopter demonstrator. Developed under the European Clean Sky 2 research programme, the aircraft was unveiled at the Paris Air Show in 2017 and is developed to cruise at over 210kts while using less fuel than a conventional helicopter. Featuring stub-wing mounted pusher propellers that pull power from the main engines to provide forward thrust, the aircraft first flew in April 2024 and is expected to be one of the stars of the show.

Business aviation is always represented well at Paris and among the debutants in 2025 will be US-based Otto Aviation which is promising a clean-sheet bizjet featuring laminar-flow aerodynamics. The Phantom 3500, which is a development of the diesel-powered Celera 500 research aircraft, will be powered by Williams International FJ44 engines and is notable for having no windows – these being replaced by 42in 4k monitors to show a projection of the outside world.

Interestingly, plans to develop a hydrogen-powered 19-seater called the Celera 750 have been placed on hold. Initially announced in 2022, this would have used a ZeroAvia hydrogen-fuel-cell powertrain.

While Otto will not have a full-sized aircraft on display at Le Bourget, Dassault will be using its home show to advantage with examples of the Falcon 6X and 8X business jets on static display throughout the week. The Falcon 6X will also be taking part in the daily flying display. Gulfstream will be exhibiting its G600 and G700 (with Qatar Airways bringing another G700) while Piaggio is bringing its Avanti II Evo and Pilatus will be attending with both its PC-12 and PC-24.

Urban Air Mobility

The last Paris Air Show (in 2023) featured a dedicated Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) hall with eVTOLs displayed in an urban setting. The daily airshow was also opened with a flying appearance by Volocopter’s VoloCity eVTOL with the company proudly announcing plans for the following year’s Paris Olympics. Since then, a number of high profile players in the market have ceased trading (including Volocopter) but others, including Joby Aviation, Archer and Vertical Aerospace have advanced their flight-test programmes and are targeting certification within the next 24 months.

With the metaphorical wheat sorted from the chaff, the AAM sector is now at a point where certification timelines as well as regulatory and airspace harmonisation and infrastructure/planning constraints - rather than technological challenges - are now the limiting factor in the pace of development.

One of the AAM companies exhibiting at Paris is Brazil's Eve Air Mobility, which is promising to unveil advancements to its eVTOL ahead of a promised first flight later this summer. Eve has begun ground tests and says its goal is to have five to six conforming prototypes ready to perform development and certification flights between 2025 and 2026.

Among the refinements to the design that Eve is expected to reveal during the show is a new wheeled landing gear option, a new cabin layout, modified aerodynamics for the wing design and enhancements to the lifter and pusher propeller/rotor blades. Announcements are also expected regarding the fly-by-wire four axis sidestick controllers. Boeing will also showcase its Wisk autonomous passenger aircraft with at least one example of the latest variant on display in its pavilion.

Also expect a return from China's Ehang, which will be displaying its fully autonomous EH216S eVTOL - now certificated and running passenger flights (in a very controlled manner) in China.

Sustainable aviation

While sustainability is unlikely to be as front and centre as it has been at previous trade shows it will remain a key theme of announcements over the week ahead. Airbus’ recent delays to its ZEROe hydrogen programme and public commentary by IATA Director General, Willie Walsh, about the need to revisit net zero 2050 targets due to (among other things) the scarcity of sustainable aviation fuel should lead to interesting debate and it will be interesting to hear what predictions are made for future ‘green’ initiatives.

With its Integral GA aircraft progressing, Toulouse-based start-up Aura Aviation will be providing an update on its other flagship project. The company is developing the Era hybrid-electric 19 seat regional airliner which is targeted at transport and special mission applications such as aeromedical evacuation. Notably, Aura Aviation states that the aircraft’s cabin will be constructed using recycled and biodegradable materials. With a first flight planned for next year followed by service entry in 2028, the 19 seat Era has also evolved to field a military variant termed the Intruder, which will be produced at the company’s Abu Dhabi-based subsidiary M.

Also flying the French flag for innovative aviation will be fellow start-up Volt Aero. The company will be unveiling its Cassio 330 design on 15 June. From the now well-known mock-up, it stands out with a pusher propellor, twin boom tail and forward canards. Offered in hybrid-electric configuration, the single pilot certified aircraft is offered in three sizes which can seat a number of passengers ranging from five to 12 while being offered for wider applications such as postal delivery.

As part of a lengthy European tour en-route to Norway, where it is destined to be trialled by Bristow Group, Beta Technologies' Alia CX300 is slated to attend the show in Paris. This is the electric conventional take-off and landing (eCTOL) variant of the battery-powered aircraft and can accommodate up to five passengers or 1,250lb of cargo. Beta claims the aircraft has operating costs that are a fraction of Cessna Caravan and also produces 75% fewer emissions.

From Switzerland, Smartflyer will bring its as-yet unflown SFX1 hybrid-electric aircraft to Paris. Featuring an electric motor supported by a thermal generator, it offers a range of up to 500 miles but future plans also include a hydrogen fuel cell power system

Although concerns remain about the ability to produce and store hydrogen, several participants in the show will display their hydrogen propulsion solutions. One is China’s H100 Atlas, a hydrogen powered quadcopter UAV for diverse applications including cleaning solar panels and fighting forest fires. On the homegrown side, Blue Spirit Aerosystems will be displaying their Dragonfly light aircraft, powered by 12 hydrogen fuel cell propellors. Plans are for this aircraft to enter service in 2029. With detailed design ongoing, the aircraft has a planned range of up to 375nm for its 4S model, rising to 540nm in its enhanced 6S version.

Another area with growing levels of investment and an array of new entrants in seaplanes, driven by the desire to take advantage of the ready-made infrastructure water ways provide. One exhibitor will be Japan’s Shinmaywa who produce the rescue orientated US-2. A company that is looking to deploy seaplanes against the growing threat of wildfires is France’s Positive Aviation, who have plans to convert surplus ATR-72 airliners into FF72 floatplanes, for the aerial firefighting role.

Career opportunities

From military to commercial and space to GA, the aviation and aerospace sector is struggling to attract and retain talent. (Paris Air Show/Anthony Guerra)

One of the main issues facing the industry at the moment is how to attract and retain skilled people, particularly when competing with better paid career options. Therefore, the show will play host to the ‘Careers Plane’ which will provide a forum for young people to be shown the opportunities and needs of the French aerospace industry. This part of the show will feature professionals from across 20 potential careers in aerospace ranging from electronics engineers, to machining operators and customer service professionals. Options from school to apprenticeship and university level will be on display.

As reported by TravelPulse, United Airlines announced an investment in Twelve. The startup plans to create a low-carbon alternative fuel that is projected to produce up to 90% less harmful pollution than current aviation fuel.

While the startup's fuel plant is not yet operational, the concept shows a lot of promise. The fuel will be made by capturing carbon from the air and extracting hydrogen from water and then putting the elements through an industrial process that is similar to photosynthesis.

Twelve has already secured funding to build its plant in Moses Lake, Washington, where it expects to produce 50,000 gallons of sustainable aviation fuel every year.

Nicholas Flanders, the startup's co-founder and CEO, said, ""United's Sustainable Flight Fund's investment reinforces our momentum at a pivotal moment as we move from innovation to implementation,"" per TravelPulse.

This is a great step toward reducing the harmful pollution produced by flying. According to Our World in Data, aviation is responsible for around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide pollution every year. This may not sound like a lot, but only around 11% of the world's population flies, a figure that is projected to increase as global salaries rise.

Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality?

The development of sustainable aviation fuels will reduce harmful pollution and help the industry transition to a more sustainable future and meet net-zero targets.

Looking for alternative transport options is another way to reduce the impact of aviation. Taking trains instead of short-haul flights and reducing the number of private jets in the skies can contribute to lowering the harmful pollution produced by the industry.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VX5hmzvd50rm_nOTX0bV8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MDM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/110195211d2c86f46e3a3696ff0ef40e,N,,2025-06-13 09:56:12.911010

NetJets’ customer base today is 40 to 45% larger than it was in 2019, before the pandemic.

While some providers say newcomers have left, Gallagher says NetJets has “maintained record retention.”

91.7% of Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers ranked NetJets Excellent/Very Good in last year’s survey.

The industry average for Excellent/Very Good ratings across all fractional and jet card providers was 73.3%.

The same survey shows over 95% of flyers who started flying during or since Covid continue to fly the private skies.

Post-Covid Tailwinds

In a post-pandemic era, Gallagher says new trends are powering the company.

“In the luxury travel segment overall, people are making more of an investment in experiences than in things. That certainly has been a tailwind for us,” he says.

Flight trackers and the desire for privacy are also driving the growth of its fractional ownership model.

“One of the appeals of flying NetJets as opposed to owning your own airplane is you are virtually untraceable,” Gallagher says.

It is also maintaining its position in the world of big business.

Gallagher says about 40% of Fortune 500 companies are customers.

However, its primary audience is principals of privately held companies.

NetJets Sustainability

Gallagher also addressed the sustainability issue of flying privately, which is often used as a cudgel by anti-wealth campaigners.

“Sustainability is at the forefront of our industry,” Gallagher says.

For NetJets, it offsets all of its internal and training flights.

It is also the largest buyer of sustainable aviation fuel in the private aviation sector, according to the executive.

Additionally, it offers a program that allows customers to purchase offsets for their flights.

According to CH-Aviation, NetJets has the youngest fleet among large operators.",https://cdn.privatejetcardcomparisons.com/uploads/Patrick-Gallagher-President-NetJets.png?w=1200&h=628&fit=crop,N,,2025-06-13 09:56:25.502844

More than 60 vehicles involved in airport operations are now running on biodiesel instead of fossil-based diesel. These include airfield operations and security team vehicles, fire trucks and snow clearing vehicles.

The airport has worked with biodiesel supplier YourNRG to bring about the change, which comes as its parent company, Manchester Airports Group (MAG), launches its five-year Sustainability Strategy, Creating a sustainable future for all.

The airport’s biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oils and fats which undergo a hydrogen treatment to be turned into renewable fuel which reduces carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil diesel. It also drastically lowers particulate emissions and is biodegradable, making it safer for the environment than traditional diesel.

East Midlands Airport’s managing director, Steve Griffiths, said: “We are always looking at ways to reduce our impact on the environment, with the aim of hitting Manchester Airport Group’s target of achieving net-zero operations by 2038.

“Working with YourNRG to convert our fleet of ground vehicles is a great step forward, with significant emissions reductions and other environmental benefits.”

By increasing the supply of sustainable aviation fuel for planes, the Bill can support airport expansion by cutting the climate impacts of flights, meaning more flights can take off.

The Bill will continue to make its way through Parliament and will support the £63 million of investment already announced earlier in the year to help boost SAF production, as well as £400,000 to support the testing of new green fuels, helping to get them to market quicker.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said: “We could put our head in the sand and pretend people don’t want to fly. Pretend the sector doesn’t support hundreds of thousands of jobs. That people don’t long for summer holidays and family reunions. That air freight isn’t a significant part of our trade by value. But we’d be on the wrong side of both reality and public aspiration. The truth is demand for flight is only going in one direction…

“This Bill creates a Revenue Certainty Mechanism that will boost SAF production by giving investors’ confidence to choose the UK. It does this by addressing one of the biggest barriers to investment - the lack of a clear, predictable market price for SAF.”

The findings provide crucial insights for aerospace leaders transitioning to sustainable, low-emission fuels whilst ensuring safety and reliability remain uncompromised.

Addressing Critical Industry Challenges

As the aerospace industry intensifies its focus on decarbonisation, SAFs offer substantial CO2 reductions of over 65 percent compared to traditional jet fuels. However, challenges such as seal compatibility continue to present obstacles to widespread adoption. To address these concerns, Greene Tweed conducted rigorous testing to ensure its seals perform effectively with these advanced fuel formulations.

Shawn McCloskey, Greene Tweed’s chief commercial officer, emphasised the practical significance of the research. “Sustainable aviation fuels offer a practical path to reducing emissions, particularly for long-haul flights, where batteries and hydrogen remain less feasible,” McCloskey said. “Our study ensures aerospace customers have reliable seal solutions for SAF adoption without compromising safety or performance.”

Comprehensive Testing Methodology

Greene Tweed collaborated with multiple suppliers to evaluate SAF blends and their effects on the physical properties of fluorine-based elastomers FKM and FVMQ. The study assessed performance across various SAF blends, including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), following ASTM D7566 standards.

Testing protocols simulated extreme aerospace environments, including temperatures reaching 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure conditions to ensure real-world applicability.

Key Research Findings

The study yielded several significant findings that demonstrate the viability of Greene Tweed’s seal solutions for SAF applications:

Consistent Performance was observed across FKM compounds (731, 772, 665), which maintained their effectiveness across various blends, including three SPKs, 50/50 blends with control fluid, and 20 percent SAK with 80 percent SPKs.

Material Properties testing revealed that FKM elastomers demonstrated strong compatibility with harsh SAF conditions, including fluid ageing and dry-out scenarios that commonly occur in aerospace applications.

Aromatic Content Impact emerged as a critical factor, with the research confirming that aromatic content in SAF formulations, particularly SAK blends, plays a vital role in maintaining material performance.

Advanced Testing Protocols under accelerated ageing conditions provided confirmation of long-term reliability, addressing industry concerns about component longevity.

Dr Ronald Campbell, senior technical advisor at Greene Tweed, highlighted the comprehensive nature of the research. “By analysing the effects of chemical interactions between SAF blends and advanced elastomers, we have developed a robust data set that established long-term reliability and compatibility in extreme aerospace conditions,” Campbell noted.

Supporting Industry Decarbonisation Goals

The research arrives at a critical juncture for the aviation industry, which is working towards carbon-neutral growth targets. US airlines have set ambitious goals for a 50 percent CO2 reduction by 2050, making SAFs a vital component of decarbonisation strategies.

Greene Tweed’s findings directly support these environmental objectives by ensuring component compatibility with SAF whilst maintaining the safety and operational performance standards required in aerospace applications.

Industry Engagement and Future Applications

The research results were recently highlighted in an Aviation Week webinar, where Greene Tweed detailed its comprehensive testing methodology and findings. The company’s representatives will also present these solutions at the upcoming Paris Air Show 2025, providing industry professionals with opportunities to explore practical applications of the technology.

The study represents a significant advancement in addressing one of the key technical challenges facing SAF adoption, potentially accelerating the industry’s transition to more sustainable fuel alternatives whilst maintaining the rigorous safety and performance standards essential to aerospace operations.",https://storageterminalsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ST-318214319-copy-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 08:56:46.799111

But a new report takes a big swing at the ethanol orthodoxy of American agriculture, criticizing the industry for causing economic and social imbalances across rural communities and saying that the expansion of biofuels will increase greenhouse gas emissions, despite their purported climate benefits.

The report, from the World Resources Institute, which has been critical of U.S. biofuel policy in the past, draws from 100 academic studies on biofuel impacts. It concludes that ethanol policy has been largely a failure and ought to be reconsidered, especially as the world needs more land to produce food to meet growing demand.

“Multiple studies show that U.S. biofuel policies have reshaped crop production, displacing food crops and driving up emissions from land conversion, tillage and fertilizer use,” said the report’s lead author, Haley Leslie-Bole. “Corn-based ethanol, in particular, has contributed to nutrient runoff, degraded water quality and harmed wildlife habitat. As climate pressures grow, increasing irrigation and refining for first-gen biofuels could deepen water scarcity in already drought-prone parts of the Midwest.”

The conversion of Midwestern agricultural land has been sweeping. Between 2004 and 2024, ethanol production increased by nearly 500 percent. Corn and soybeans are now grown on 92 and 86 million acres of land respectively—and roughly a third of those crops go to produce ethanol. That means about 30 million acres of land that could be used to grow food crops are instead being used to produce ethanol, despite ethanol only accounting for 6 percent of the country’s transportation fuel.

The biofuels industry—which includes refiners, corn and soy growers and the influential agriculture lobby writ large—have long insisted that corn- and soy-based biofuels provide an energy efficient alternative to fossil-based fuels. Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have agreed.

The country’s primary biofuels policy, the Renewable Fuel Standard, requires that biofuels provide a greenhouse gas reduction over fossil fuels: The law says that ethanol from new plants must deliver a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to gasoline.

In addition to greenhouse gas reductions, the industry and its allies in Congress have also continued to say that ethanol is a primary mainstay of the rural economy, benefiting communities across the Midwest.

But a growing body of research—much of which the industry has tried to debunk and deride—suggests that ethanol actually may not provide the benefits that policies require. It may, in fact, produce more greenhouse gases than the fossil fuels it was intended to replace. Recent research says that biofuel refiners also emit significant amounts of carcinogenic and dangerous substances, including hexane and formaldehyde, in greater amounts than petroleum refineries.

The new report points to research saying that increased production of biofuels from corn and soy could actually raise greenhouse gas emissions, largely from carbon emissions linked to clearing land in other countries to compensate for the use of land in the Midwest.

On top of that, corn is an especially fertilizer-hungry crop requiring large amounts of nitrogen-based fertilizer, which releases huge amounts of nitrous oxide when it interacts with the soil. American farming is by far the largest source of domestic nitrous oxide emissions already—about 50 percent. If biofuel policies lead to expanded production, emissions of this enormously powerful greenhouse gas will likely increase, too.

The new report concludes that not only will the expansion of ethanol increase greenhouse gas emissions, it has also failed to provide the social and financial benefits to Midwestern communities that lawmakers and the industry say it has. (The report defines the Midwest as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio,

South Dakota and Wisconsin.)

“The benefits from biofuels remain concentrated in the hands of a few,” Leslie-Bole said. “As subsidies flow, so may the trend of farmland consolidation, increasing inaccessibility of farmland in the Midwest and locking out emerging or low-resource farmers. This means the benefits of biofuels production are flowing to fewer people, while more are left bearing the costs.”

New policies being considered in state legislatures and Congress, including additional tax credits and support for biofuel-based aviation fuel, could expand production, potentially causing more land conversion and greenhouse gas emissions, widening the gap between the rural communities and rich agribusinesses at a time when food demand is climbing and, critics say, land should be used to grow food instead.

President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, passed by the House and currently being negotiated in the Senate, would not only extend tax credits for biofuels producers, it specifically excludes calculations of emissions from land conversion when determining what qualifies as a low-emission fuel.

The primary biofuels industry trade groups, including Growth Energy and the Renewable Fuels Association, did not respond to Inside Climate News requests for comment or interviews.

An employee with the Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel producers, not ethanol, said the report vastly overstates the carbon emissions from crop-based fuels by comparing the farmed land to natural landscapes, which no longer exist.

They also noted that the impact of soy-based fuels in 2024 was more than $42 billion, providing over 100,000 jobs.

“Ten percent of the value of every bushel of soybeans is linked to biomass-based fuel,” they said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2166100083-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:21.814853

Sustainable Aviation Fuel encompasses alternative fuels derived from biomass, waste oils, municipal solid waste, algae, or captured CO₂ which enable aircraft to operate with reduced carbon emissions compared to standard jet fuel.

Depending on both feedstock type and production techniques SAF achieves lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 80% which positions it as a fundamental element of aviation's decarbonization roadmap.

✈️ Why Airlines Are Fueling Up on SAF

The aviation industry presently generates between 2 and 3 percent of worldwide CO₂ emissions which are expected to increase when air travel returns to normal after the pandemic. A growing number of airlines have established bold climate pledges which include achieving net-zero emissions by the year 2050.

SAF delivers a critical contribution to aviation decarbonization by providing a drop-in fuel option compatible with current aircraft and fueling systems which removes the requirement for extensive retrofits or new technology deployment. The production increase enables immediate scalability.

Major airlines such as United Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa and Emirates have started integrating SAF into their operations through long-term off-take contracts with fuel producers.

📈 Market Outlook: Soaring to New Heights

Projections from the industry suggest the global SAF market will expand from USD 576.18 million in 2022 to more than USD 15.85 billion by 2030 with a CAGR above 57.5%. Key drivers include:

The European Union and United States authorities enforce regulations that require aviation fuels to decrease their carbon intensity levels.

The requirement for sustainable corporate travel is forcing airlines to implement eco-friendly travel options.

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s SAF tax credit operates as an incentive and subsidy for sustainable aviation fuels.

Technological innovations are reducing production costs while simultaneously boosting yield efficiency.

Europe leads the way in SAF adoption because of strict environmental policies and ReFuelEU mandates yet North America and Asia-Pacific focus on building significant domestic SAF production capabilities.

🌍 Global Collaboration: Policy Meets Innovation

Multiple stakeholders beyond airlines contribute to the growing momentum behind SAF. Governments and fuel producers along with airports and technology companies are building strategic partnerships to expand production output.

The Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and ICAO's CORSIA framework develop a unified SAF adoption roadmap. Both startups and large energy corporations are pioneering new production technologies such as power-to-liquid synthetic fuels and carbon capture-based synthesis methods.

🚧 Challenges on the Flight Path

Despite its promise, SAF adoption faces hurdles:

High costs: The price of SAF stands at two to five times higher than that of conventional fossil-based jet fuel at present.

Limited supply: The usage of SAF makes up under 0.1% of the total aviation fuel consumption worldwide today.

Feedstock competition: Bio-based resources face growing pressure because sectors like shipping and road transport require more demand.

Production scaling combined with better logistics systems and growing investor trust works to gradually overcome existing challenges.

🛫 The Future of Green Flight

Experts predict that Sustainable Aviation Fuel needs to make up 65% of all aviation fuel by 2050 to help achieve global net-zero objectives. The future holds significant potential with upcoming advances in advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels that promise to both lower emissions and build a resilient aviation sector prepared for future challenges.

✅ Conclusion

While the journey is far from over, the destination is clear: Travel by air can achieve sustainability while maintaining environmental protection at high altitudes.

The EU is offering generous subsidies with the hope that it will induce the use of greater volumes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be able to dramatically reduce the sector’s carbon footprint. The action is just one of the steps the EU is taking in an effort to tackle climate change in addition to greening aviation.

A Game Changer for the Aviation Sector

Under this new program, the EU has committed to subsidising the purchase of over 200 million litres of SAF. This volume represents about 15% of the current global SAF production, as calculated by the European Commission. With the airline industry producing around 1.3 billion litres of SAF last year, this initiative is expected to give a substantial boost to SAF consumption, helping the aviation sector reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.

In terms of financial support, the EU is using funds from the sale of carbon emissions permits to cover the price gap between traditional kerosene and SAF. This approach is expected to make SAF more competitive, as it currently costs several times more than conventional jet fuel.

Key Features of the EU SAF Subsidy Program

The EU’s subsidy plan offers significant financial backing to airlines looking to transition to greener fuel. Here’s how it works:

Subsidy Amounts: Airlines can receive subsidies of up to 6 euros per litre for e-fuels (synthetic fuels made from captured CO2) and 0.5 euros per litre for biofuels.

Volume of Subsidised SAF: The program supports up to 216 million litres of e-fuels or up to 2.6 billion litres of biofuels.

Carbon Emissions Permits: The EU is funding this initiative through revenues from the sale of carbon emissions permits. This is intended to offset the higher cost of SAF, which remains a major barrier to widespread adoption.

This subsidy program is a crucial step in helping airlines make SAF a viable alternative to kerosene. As airlines are pressured to meet the EU’s sustainability targets, these subsidies will ease the financial strain of transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

Challenges in Decarbonizing the Aviation Industry

The aviation sector has long been one of the hardest industries to decarbonize, primarily due to the high energy demands of air travel and the current lack of viable zero-emission aircraft. While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is seen as the most promising near-term solution, it still faces significant hurdles:

High Costs: SAF is significantly more expensive than traditional jet fuel, often costing three to five times more. This cost difference is a major obstacle to its widespread use.

Limited Supply: Currently, SAF accounts for only 0.3% of the global jet fuel supply, which highlights the sector’s reliance on fossil fuels.

Investment Gaps: Despite the potential benefits, the aviation industry has invested only a small portion of its revenue—typically between 1% and 3%—in SAF production, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group.

Given these challenges, the EU’s subsidy program is a critical intervention aimed at accelerating the adoption of SAF and reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

EU’s Ambitious Targets for SAF Adoption

The European Union has set clear targets for SAF usage at EU airports, which airlines are expected to meet in the coming years. These targets are part of the EU’s broader climate action plan:

2% SAF by 2025: By 2025, 2% of the fuel used at EU airports must come from SAF.

6% SAF by 2030: This requirement will rise to 6% by 2030, aligning with the EU’s long-term decarbonisation goals.

To ensure these targets are met, airlines are required to purchase carbon emissions permits to offset the greenhouse gases produced by their flights. These permits were previously provided to airlines for free but are now being phased out, pushing airlines to reduce their emissions more rapidly.

The Role of SAF in the EU’s Green Transition

The push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is part of the EU’s broader commitment to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability across various industries. As aviation accounts for a significant portion of global emissions, transitioning to SAF represents a major step towards achieving the EU’s ambitious climate goals, including carbon neutrality by 2050.

In addition to reducing emissions, SAF also plays a critical role in reducing the environmental impact of the aviation sector in the near term. While zero-emission aircraft are still years away from being commercially viable, SAF provides a practical solution to mitigate the sector’s impact on the climate.

The Road Ahead for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The EU’s subsidy program for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) marks a significant move towards a more sustainable future for aviation. By easing the cost burden on airlines and providing clear targets for SAF adoption, the EU is helping to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation sector. However, the road to a sustainable aviation future is long, and more efforts are needed to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.

The current subsidy program is an important economic incentive for airline companies to adopt the use of SAF, but additional investment in production facilities, infrastructure, and technology will need to be made to establish SAF as an everyday fuel source. The support of the EU will enable the airline sector to make an actual contribution to lessening its environmental footprint and preventing climate change.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__78546-1.jpeg,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:25.162615

This tender would use a double-sided auction mechanism to help scale e-SAF (sustainable aviation fuel produced from clean electricity) across Europe.

The EU has already recognised e-SAF as a key pathway to decarbonising aviation, with the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating increasing levels of e-SAF blending starting in 2030. Despite this political momentum, none of the planned e-SAF projects in Europe have reached Final Investment Decision (FID) — even though Europe hosts around 60% of the world’s planned e-SAF capacity.

To move forward, the market needs to overcome two fundamental failures:

Producers require long-term offtake contracts to secure financing and de-risk investment.

Buyers, such as fuel suppliers and airlines, need short-term flexibility to avoid locking into high initial prices as the market matures.

A market intermediary using a double-sided auction could resolve both challenges. This intermediary would operate as a government-backed commodity trader — contracting long-term with producers to provide revenue certainty, while selling short-term to buyers to maintain flexibility.

Compared to traditional flat subsidies, this model ensures greater efficiency of public funding by minimising the cost gap through competitive pricing on both sides of the market.

But time is short. With a typical lead time of four years from FID to fuel production, projects need to secure investment by the end of 2025/26 in order to deliver fuel in line with the 2030 ReFuelEU mandate.

We have examined different ways to lower global warming over the course of the series. Over the last weeks, we have summarized what practical results we can expect from the different alternatives we have to reduce global warming from Air Transport. We looked at the following alternatives:

How do the initiatives on our lineup compare

Of the five different alternative ways to lower global warming, which is the most practical and can lead to a significant reduction in the warming effect in the short term, and which alternatives are more for the long term?

Let’s first single out the CO2 reduction ones and then compare these to the warming effect from Contrails.

The first CO2-reducing one is the one that occurs regardless of initiatives to lower emissions, the industry’s typical improvement in fuel consumption over time, Alternative 2. We can conclude that this was a powerful one, with a reduction in CO2 emissions between now and 2050 of around 600 million tonnes of CO2, compared to the scenario where there was no improvement in fuel consumption.

This shall be compared to today’s yearly emissions from Air Transport, where 300 million tonnes of Jet A1 fuel were burned during 2024, resulting in 950 million tonnes of CO2. It doesn’t mean we lower these emissions to 350 million tonnes, as we have growth in civil aviation. It means we have 600 million tonnes less of Jet A1-related CO2 emissions than we would have if there were no improvement in fuel consumption from new aircraft replacing old ones.

We shall compare this to our scenario in Alternative 1. In this scenario, we assume success in producing CO2 and NOx-emission-free airliners based on various Turboprop replacement projects. These projects can replace the existing 19, 30- to 50-seat, and 70- to 100-seat turboprops currently in the market.

We assume that the 19- and 30-to-50-seat projects will result in Entry Into Service (EIS) of aircraft from 2030. The replacement of 70 to 100-seat turboprops starts in 2040 when we assume Airbus delivers its ZEROe fuel cell-based hydrogen airliner.

In total, these projects would have reduced Jet A1 consumption between now and 2050 by 7.2 million tonnes, equivalent to approximately 23 million tonnes of CO2.

Alternative 3 involves the gradual mandating of increased SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) blends in the EU, which would result in an improvement of 106 million tonnes by 2050.

Finally, we have of the CO2 emission reducing alternatives, the effects of ETS on air transport, Alternative 4. This is more difficult to quantify, as the reductions done by individual airlines are not researched and extrapolated in a convenient manner.

We had the figure of air transport contributing 50 million tonnes of CO2 in the EU and affiliated states, and research had shown a typical 7 to 10 percent reduction from an industrial sector enrolled in the EU ETS versus not. This would then mean a three to five tonne reduction in CO2 emissions from the EU ETS for air transport.

CO2 emission reduction summary

To summarize, we have from the CO2 reduction initiative the following reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050:

We shall compare the warming reduction effects of these reductions to the effect of NOx, other sources, and avoiding warming contrails in the next Corners, as this is an analysis that requires some thought and discussion.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-06-13 07:56:36.347015

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, often lauded as the aviation industry’s silver bullet for decarbonisation, carries with it more than just the promise of cleaner skies. As airports position themselves as climate leaders, SAF emerges as both a technological hope and a strategic dilemma. The deeper question lies not in whether SAF can reduce emissions but whether its deployment justifies large-scale airport expansion.

What Makes SAF So Special?

SAF replaces conventional jet fuel with a blend derived from municipal waste, biomass, or even CO2 captured directly from the atmosphere. When used, it emits CO2—just like fossil jet fuel—but this carbon originates from sources already in the carbon cycle, thus neutral in net terms if sourced and refined responsibly.

This closed-loop concept appeals to climate regulators and aviation industry stakeholders, especially as SAF can be used with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. It is already blended into jet fuel at major hubs and has successfully powered flights at 100 percent concentration during trials.

A Reality Check on Emissions

Despite its appeal, SAF is not a panacea. Its sustainability hinges on how it is produced. If fossil energy powers the production process or if land use changes release additional emissions, the lifecycle benefits are compromised. Moreover, current rules permit fuels to be labelled “sustainable” even if they reduce emissions by only 40 percent. In practice, blending limits (up to 50 percent with fossil jet fuel) result in flights achieving as little as 20 percent emission reductions.

Still, major policy frameworks are backing SAF. Mandates in the US, UK, and EU are targeting significant volumes by 2050. Ambitiously, SAF is expected to deliver up to 65 percent of aviation’s carbon reduction under industry net zero goals.

Why We Are Not Flying on 100 Percent SAF Yet

Cost remains a primary constraint. Even under optimistic scenarios, SAF production costs exceed fossil jet fuel by 190 to 500 percent. Technologies like direct air capture—while highly sustainable—are among the most expensive due to their energy intensity.

Moreover, feedstock limitations present a bottleneck. The most economical options like used cooking oil are finite. Scaling up SAF production will require shifting to more contentious sources, potentially disrupting food systems or increasing land-use emissions.

Scaling SAF Is Not About Parity, It Is About Prioritisation

A significant insight is that SAF will likely never reach cost parity with fossil fuels without sustained policy support. But that is not a flaw—it is a feature. SAF should be viewed not through the lens of cost parity, but as an ethical and environmental imperative.

Rather than delaying action until it becomes cheap, the challenge is to design aviation strategies that accept SAF’s higher cost as the price of climate responsibility. This repositions SAF not as a competitor to fossil fuels but as a cornerstone of responsible growth.

Does SAF Justify Airport Expansion?

Herein lies a paradox. SAF is often cited to support airport expansion, suggesting that increased capacity can be sustainable. However, even in best-case scenarios, SAF uptake will remain modest in the short term. Global SAF use was just 0.3 percent of aviation fuel in 2024. Realistically, it may only reach 6 percent by 2030 in the EU.

Furthermore, SAF does not address all climate impacts. Non-CO2 effects like nitrogen oxide emissions and contrail formation persist. While SAF may reduce contrail impacts by up to 44 percent, these benefits remain under study and are far from universal.

An Opportunity to Redefine Progress

Rather than a green light for unbounded airport expansion, SAF presents an opportunity to redefine what progress in aviation means. It calls for climate-aligned infrastructure, demand-side interventions, and strategic investments that support decarbonisation without defaulting to growth-based narratives.

Conclusion: A More Nuanced Flight Path

SAF is not a blank cheque for expansion, but a signal to invest in smarter, more sustainable aviation systems. Airports that align their development plans with realistic SAF deployment, lifecycle sustainability, and community impacts will lead the transition. In doing so, they position themselves not just as transport hubs but as leaders in climate-conscious infrastructure.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-36.svg,N,,2025-06-13 04:56:27.231179

Aviation is often portrayed as a high-emissions outlier in the global decarbonisation journey. Yet, beneath this complexity lies an accelerating shift—one aligning the skies with the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the heart of this transition is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a key that not only unlocks environmental progress but also delivers economic and social value.

Beyond Emissions: SAF’s Broader Sustainability Impact

SAF is widely known for its environmental advantages—reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. However, its contributions stretch far beyond climate impact. SAF is a multifaceted lever influencing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy: By diversifying energy sources within aviation, SAF fosters resilience in a fuel system historically reliant on fossil fuels.

SDG 13 – Climate Action: Its use directly reduces aviation’s emissions, strengthening the industry’s commitment to climate action.

SDG 1 and 10 – No Poverty and Reduced Inequalities: SAF production, especially when rooted in agricultural or waste-based feedstocks, supports income generation in rural economies and enhances inclusivity.

The production of SAF, particularly in developing regions, can create job opportunities and infrastructure, building local capacity and promoting equitable economic growth. This less-discussed dimension reinforces SAF’s relevance not just in terms of carbon metrics but also human development.

Why Aviation Needs a Unique Approach

While other transport sectors embrace electrification with relative ease, aviation operates under very different constraints. Aircraft demand high energy density and light-weight fuel solutions for long-haul travel—making batteries and hydrogen impractical in the near term.

A comparative glance at the feasibility of electrification across sectors reveals aviation’s limited flexibility:

This reinforces the indispensable role of SAF in aviation’s decarbonisation—providing a viable, drop-in solution that integrates seamlessly with current aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Decoding SAF’s Technical and Economic Profile

To fully appreciate SAF’s potential, it helps to compare its characteristics with conventional jet fuel:

Despite its cost premium, SAF presents a long-term value proposition. It can reduce particulate pollution and requires no modification to existing aircraft, reducing adoption friction and retrofitting costs.

The Role of Policy and Investment

For SAF to achieve scale, coordinated policies and robust financial support are essential:

Mandates: Europe’s ReFuelEU and the UK’s SAF Mandate are already setting required SAF blending targets, gradually increasing through 2050.

Incentives: The United States has introduced SAF-specific tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act to boost production economics.

Global Momentum and Strategic Investments

Worldwide, governments and aviation players are investing in SAF projects that are not only technologically promising but also strategically significant:

UAE: Collaboration between Cepsa and Etihad to accelerate local SAF research and production.

Australia: Qantas and Ampol’s 1.7 million-liter SAF import—a national milestone.

Japan: Strategic pivot by Eneos Holdings toward SAF as a primary decarbonisation tool.

Brazil: $1 billion investment by Envision Energy to produce SAF from sugarcane.

USA: United Airlines backing carbon capture startups and SAF technologies.

Spain: Cepsa’s SAF supply rollout across major national airports.

These initiatives highlight the growing consensus that SAF is not a temporary fix but a foundational element in aviation’s sustainability strategy.

Conclusion: Fueling a Broader Transformation

The true power of SAF lies not only in its carbon reduction potential but also in its alignment with broader societal goals. It is a solution that merges technological feasibility with global equity, climate ambition with economic opportunity.

The costs in terms of offsets for the three operators could vary in the range of INR 1998 to 10018 crore1 (on average INR 666 and 3334 crore per annum at USD10 and USD50 price unit) between 2025 and 2037if 5% growth rate in emissions takes place. If the operations grow and emissions increase at 8% per annum, the offset costs could range from INR 3592 to 18009 crore2 (on average INR 1197 and 6003 crore per annum at USD10 and USD50 price unit)between 2025 and 2037 for all the airlines put together.

The cost can impose a constraint on the growth of international operations for Indian carriers and aviation industry, unless suitably moderated or addressed. As the progress to reduce emissions globally is slow, the cost of mitigating global emissions from the aviation sector is anticipated to be high. To overcome these challenges and reduce the financial burden, the Indian aviation industry will have to rely on the options of offsetting the emissions in the domestic or international carbon market, and/or promoting the use of biofuels or low carbon fuels.

It is important for the stakeholders of the aviation industry to urgently evolve solutions to the impending freeze on their growing emissions (compared with 2019). Amongst the possible actions is a range of measures covering improvements in energy efficiency, fuel efficiency, and switch to alternative fuels. While many of these are already part of a Whitepaper on National Green Aviation Policy, the new interventions could include creation of a market trading facility in emissions, and increased use of low carbon sustainable aviation fuels.

Emissions reduction credits generated in other sectors of economy can be made available to the operators. The existing domestic energy related markets in India can become the starting point for the development of a domestic emissions trading system if the relevant regulations are tweaked. Further, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help the industry meet a substantial part of its fuel need if adequate policy initiatives are taken in time. SAF will require ramping up of efforts for its production and commercialization and making it available on scale to the Indian airline operators to enable them to reduce or offset their emissions in the second phase of the CORSIA (2027–2035).

The government needs to prepare a clear action plan to identify and roll out these measures with a view to prepare the industry to meet the emerging challenge sufficiently and adequately before 2025.",https://www.teriin.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-13 02:56:29.630058

Founded four years ago by CEO Ed Mason, Jet Zero Australia is dedicated to the development and operation of large-scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] projects.
Irvine said that this project uses ATJ technology supplied by LanzaJet to convert ethanol into low carbon jet fuel and renewable diesel.

Founded four years ago by CEO Ed Mason, Jet Zero Australia is dedicated to the development and operation of large-scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] projects. These projects aim to decarbonise aviation, improve sovereign fuel security and bring a new and diverse industry to regional Australia.

The idea for Jet Zero began with Mason’s previous work in equity capital markets in the mining, resources, oil and gas sectors. In this previous employment, he witnessed numerous clients – in what are traditionally non-renewable sectors – begin to ask about decarbonising their operations.

This motivated Mason to think about solutions to a hard-to-abate industry, which ended up being aviation fuel production. Beginning as a part-time operation, in the past three years the company has become a full-time business, growing from strength to strength.

Jet Zero CFO Mac Irvine joined the company from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation [CEFC], the Australian green bank, in early 2024. It was a high-profile appointment which spoke to the success and ambition of the company as a commercially-minded developer of SAF projects.

“We are looking to decarbonise the aviation sector, but at the same time, support the agricultural sector and the regional communities where these projects are most likely to be developed and built,” said Irvine. “Jet Zero started four years ago and has developed into what I personally believe is the market-leading private sector developer in the SAF space.

“We are technology agnostic and deliver our projects with a commercial mindset. This means we can procure any technology from the marketplace, but importantly we focus on proven and scaled technologies.

“This approach has led us to pursue the Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathways.”

A sustainable pipeline of projects

Currently, Jet Zero has two major projects that have been announced. The flagship project, which is currently in Front-End Engineering Design [FEED], is Project Ulysses. Irvine said that this project uses ATJ technology supplied by LanzaJet to convert ethanol into low carbon jet fuel and renewable diesel.

“Around 90 per cent of what is produced from Project Ulysses is SAF, and 10 per cent is renewable diesel. That’s just how the technology works in practice,” said Irvine. “It’s about decarbonising the aviation sector and looking to keep the fuel onshore.”

For Ulysses, Jet Zero has secured a site at the Cleveland Bay Industrial Park in Townsville, North Queensland. The project is set to produce approximately 102 million litres of SAF and 11 million litres of renewable diesel per annum.

“The project will have 1,000 jobs at peak construction and for longer-term operations, about 100 direct operational jobs as well,” said Irvine.

Irvine said that the project’s progress wouldn’t be possible without $50 million of funding – from both private and public sector – that Jet Zero has raised to date. Of this $50 million, he said that around $35 million comes from within the private sector.

“The private investment comes from our three strategic partners – Airbus, Qantas, and Idemitsu Kosan of Japan – as well as five other institutional funds,” he said.

Aside from private sector investment, the Queensland State and Commonwealth Government have jointly committed almost $15 million. Irvine said this is the biggest amount ever awarded by the Government to advance a single SAF project.

“Project Ulysses’ FEED phase saw $9 million in funding from the Commonwealth Government via the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and $5 million from the Queensland

Government,” he said. “There was also about $760,000 from the Queensland Government for its feasibility phase.”

With the first SAF estimated to be produced in 2028, Irvine said that the company is looking to close the FEED phase of Ulysses by the end of the year and begin construction shortly after.

While Ulysses is the company’s primary focus, Jet Zero and global biofuels player Apeiron Bioenergy have partnered on Project Mandala. This project will focus on sourcing waste oils and non-edible feedstocks to manufacture SAF via the HEFA pathway. The Project is nearing completion of its feasibility phase.

“We received grant funding for Mandala from the Go-Green Co-Innovation Program, which is an initiative between Enterprise Singapore and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT),” said Irvine.

Maintaining capability to ensure future quality

Irvine insists that it’s Jet Zero’s capabilities across development, engineering, operations and financing that have led them to become Australia’s leading SAF project developer.

“Our team has a really strong, broad skill set that allows us to put all of the component parts of a project together efficiently and commercially,” he said.

On top of its current team of 12, Irvine said that Jet Zero also has external partners that are working for and supporting the company on its mission. This includes Technip Energies as design and engineering contractor and Long Energy and Resources as owner’s engineer.

An equally important aspect of capability within Jet Zero is how the company plans to ensure the quality control and assurance of its products. Both outputs of the company – SAF and renewable diesel – will be tested and certified to globally recognised standards.

“We refer to this as ‘farm to wing’ – in other words, from beginning to end,” said Irvine.

To ensure these standards and specifications are met, Jet Zero has an external third-party provider working with it on its life cycle assessment [LCA].

“These certification bodies want to make sure that the fuel is produced within a sustainable supply chain,” said Irvine. “We will support the sustainability of that supply chain as well as reduce carbon emissions across that life cycle to ensure that we have a sustainable and validated product.”

Overcoming past challenges to create success

Irvine said that challenges have presented themselves across each part of the process, as trying to develop a project in a new industry regardless of location is never going to be easy. He said that overcoming these challenges in the past, present and future isn’t a solo adventure, but instead a challenge taken on by industry.

“Our commercially driven nature has really enabled us to help us break through a lot of the barriers that other projects wouldn’t have.”

Taking this attitude into the future is key for Jet Zero, and key to the company’s near term goal of completing the FEED program on Project Ulysses and targeting Final Investment Decision [FID] by the end of this year. For Mandala, Irvine said that the near term goal is closing out the feasibility study within the next three months.

“Mandala is the second most progressed project in our portfolio and allows the business to diversify across technology and feedstocks,” said Irvine.

He also said the company has unannounced projects in the pipeline that will help Jet Zero achieve their eventual goal of having a portfolio of global projects.

“We are continuing to develop those projects through feasibility and the early scoping stage in the immediate term,” Irvine said. “Long term, the goal is to have a platform of projects that are operating and producing significant volumes of SAF globally.”",https://www.manmonthly.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/New-Header-image-copy.jpg,N,,2025-06-13 00:56:27.790421

The calculations, based on European Commission data, suggest that the subsidies could trigger a significant boost to airline demand for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), given the volume equates to about 15% of global SAF production.

Global SAF output last year totaled 1.3 billion liters, according to airline industry association IATA.

The EU has earmarked revenue from the sale of 20 million carbon emissions permits to help airlines to cover the price gap between conventional kerosene and more expensive SAF on flights within Europe.

Reuters calculations showed these subsidies would cover purchases of up to 216 million liters of e-fuels - synthetic fuels made using captured CO2 emissions - or as much as 2.6 billion litres of biofuels.

The EU subsidies cover up to 6 euros per litre for e-fuels and 0.5 euros per liter for biofuels.

Aviation is among the hardest sectors to decarbonize, with zero-emission aircraft not expected this decade.

Sustainable fuels, which have net-zero emissions or lower emissions than fossil fuel kerosene, can help to reduce air travel's carbon footprint in the near term. However, SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply.

Airlines have warned that EU targets to use more SAF are therefore impossible to meet, though a Boston Consulting Group report this year found that the sector is investing only 1%-3% of revenue or budget allocation in SAF.

The EU requires 2% of fuel made available at EU airports to be SAF in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030.

Airlines must buy permits from the EU carbon market to cover their emissions from European flights. Until last year, the EU gave airlines most permits free of charge, but it is now phasing out free permits to drive faster emissions reductions.
