Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been one of the shining lights of the energy transition, with investment and regulation remaining strong in the geopolitical turmoil. SAFs have more regulatory certainty than any other energy transition technologies. The UK has emerged as a SAF leader, with a strong SAF mandate in effect since January 2025, and a revenue certainty mechanism which is expected to be in place by the end of 2026. The EU also put into force its SAF mandate (ReFuelEU Aviation), and we would expect a revenue certainty mechanism to follow. Positive signals are also coming from other countries, including Japan, with a 10% blending target proposed by 2030,[1] and India with a proposed blending target of 1% for international flights from 2027.[2]

Recently, SLR sponsored the Global SAF Summit, chairing a panel with cross-representation from feedstock suppliers, SAF developers, and airlines representing the Middle East, Europe, and North America, covering flag carriers, the low-cost model, and cargo.

What was very clear from the discussions is that even with the regulatory certainty, the industry is facing significant bottlenecks and is wrestling with how to get the risk-reward balance right across the end-to-end value chain.

Here we discuss the overarching three lessons we learned about how risk-reward can be rebalanced, bottlenecks can be broken, and SAF developers today can turn their first mover risk into a first mover advantage.

The risk-reward balance

We know from across the energy transition that the markets which can accept the most expensive solutions are those with the most price elasticity. Aviation is one of these sectors.

Air travel is a luxury. Only ~11% of the world’s population take a flight annually with less than 4% taking international flights and even fewer flying more than once a year.[3] Air cargo transports circa 33% of the value of world trade, while only transporting less than 1% of its volume.[4] It is primarily used for transporting high-value, perishable or time sensitive goods. Therefore, the cost of decarbonisation passed down to end-consumers is very palatable politically. This is why SAFs have seen more regulatory stability than anywhere else in the energy transition, and why aviation will remain a key target industry to decarbonise.

The challenge, however, is that airlines, where this price elasticity sits, are notorious for going out of business. In 2023, 17 airlines filed for bankruptcy,[5] and just last month Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy just months after emerging out of Chapter 11 after declaring bankruptcy in 2024. [6],[7]

Airlines are highly capital-intensive businesses that are laser-focused on maximising operational efficiencies, given their very tight margins (IATA’s Airline Profitability Outlook for 2025 assumed an average net profit margin of 3.7%).[8] The largest variable cost by far is fuel. Therefore, airlines themselves are as much about optimising fuel costs as about optimising capital assets: Airlines tend to change their fuel contracting every year at each airport, if possible, and have whole teams dedicated to buying and hedging fuels. Their whole system is built around not taking risk.

As a result, the current market for aviation fuels has been optimised so that airlines can always buy the fuel at the cheapest commodity price possible. The pricing is based on large fuel volumes sold at the Platts market price plus a very small differential.

The SAF industry is currently asking the market to operate drastically differently, with long-term offtake agreements of 10 - 15 years, often on a take-or-pay or cost-plus model. This is driven by their investors’ need for long-term certainty, essentially leading to airlines being asked to underpin the bankability of SAF developers’ debt.

This current risk-reward balance is clearly misaligned, especially given the two to five times cost differential between SAF and conventional fuels. This is why SAF is still struggling to take off. Finding ways to unlock project debt financing and reducing the cost of capital is key to addressing the imbalance and accelerating SAF deployment. This means lenders’ perception of ‘first of a kind’ (FOAK) SAF project risks will have to change.

One of the biggest perceived project risks is revenue uncertainty. The upcoming UK revenue certainty mechanism and similar future measures in the EU can address this, but they must be designed to support decarbonisation without crippling the aviation industry or SAF developers. Compliance has to be cheaper than paying penalties for inaction.

The FOAK nature of many SAF plants and perceived and real associated risks is a further challenge to lenders, blocking debt financing and driving up cost of capital. More work is needed to manage risk and the lender’s understanding and perception of them.

One way to tackle the real development risks typically associated with any FOAK project, is to share them more equitably across stakeholders. This could take the form of direct investments from a broader group of stakeholders, or joint cross-industry ventures, particularly involving those organisations whose business success is closely tied to the aviation industry and who face the greatest exposure if the sector fails to decarbonise.

Bottlenecks in the route to market

Driven by the clear demand signal set by the mandates, the number of new producers is growing rapidly. In the UK alone, 26 unique SAF projects have been awarded funding under the Advanced Fuels Fund Scheme since 2022.[9] The project developers are predominantly start-ups who are new to this space, but oil and gas majors and conglomerates are also represented (e.g. Equinor and Essar). Projects cover a rage of pathways, including gasification, power-to-liquids (PtL), pyrolysis, ethanol-to-jet, and methanol-to-jet. In the EU, SAF is currently dominated by HEFA SAF (produced from oils and fats, such as used cooking oils, animal fats or vegetable oils), but policy and industry plans are explicitly pushing for more diverse pathways (e.g. e-fuels sub-mandate), and therefore this picture is changing fast.

While the technologies, conversion pathways, and developers are highly diverse, the infrastructure they are relying on to get their fuel to market is constricted and often operated by only a handful of large players. Blending points, fuel terminals, pipelines, and the airport fuel infrastructure, are managed and locked down by the existing fuel industry (e.g. single suppliers or small consortia). All routes to market for new SAF currently have to pass through this bottleneck. This creates high entry barriers for SAF producers through restricted access, complex permitting, or inflated fees.

This is why the mandates have been designed to target the companies that own the bottleneck. But there also has to be further disruption to release the stranglehold and break the bottleneck. Joint ventures could allow for new entrants to develop onsite and shared fuel infrastructures to ease restrictions and capture a growing market. This will require both additional investment and a different approach to how fuel farms and other airport infrastructures are operated. Book and claim will also play an important role as it can help bypass the physical infrastructure bottlenecks by allowing SAF to be credited to end users without requiring direct delivery.

First mover advantage

As we have seen, first movers in SAF face a unique set of challenges. They must navigate infrastructure bottlenecks, operate within evolving policy frameworks, and often sit at the higher end of the cost curve. With few operational plants to serve as benchmarks, perceived technology risk remains high. This makes financing more difficult, increasing the cost of capital and likely driving up insurance premiums.

However, there are also significant first mover opportunities that go beyond building brand recognition, getting an early share of the market, and developing know-how and intellectual property. First movers can also turn their challenges into opportunities by controlling key steps in the value chain: strategic locations, feedstocks, and distribution infrastructure.

First movers in SAF have a unique opportunity to secure limited strategic locations with access to low-cost feedstocks, existing jet fuel and export infrastructure, and nearby offtakers. Since feedstock and logistics costs heavily influence the levelised cost of SAF (especially for e-SAF which depends on scarce biogenic CO₂ and affordable renewable electricity) early access to these resources is a major advantage. With infrastructure bottlenecks still a challenge, proximity to fuel infrastructure and demand centres positions early developers to scale more efficiently as the market matures.

Securing and managing the flow of feedstocks is a key opportunity on its own. Building strong relationships with feedstock suppliers through innovative contract development, joint ventures, or direct investment could secure first movers’ market position. This is where oil and gas majors can have an edge over new entrants, as they have decades of experience in managing the flow of molecules. To take advantage of this opportunity, new entrants must learn how to operate as a fuels business, not only as technology developers or plant operators. Developing the right partnerships to unlock and build the relevant know-how will be key.

As discussed in the previous section, fuels infrastructure represents a significant bottleneck restricting access to offtakers for new entrants. First movers can turn this situation into an advantage, forming joint ventures to co-develop onsite or shared infrastructure that break existing bottlenecks and provides some control of the supply chain.

The event aimed to open up new opportunities to position Phu Quoc, Vietnam's largest island, as a new aviation and tourism hub in the region.

The U.S.-Vietnam Aviation Partnership Roundtable was attended by U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Marc Knapper, together with representatives from 15 leading American corporations in aviation, technology, and financial services, including global names such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Systems, Collins Aerospace, GE Aerospace, Honeywell, United Airlines, Rapiscan Systems, Gulfstream, BNP Associates, Corgan, Gensler, Hill International, KBR, Oshkosh AeroTech, and Otis Elevator.

Their presence at the roundtable not only demonstrated the vast potential for cooperation, but also reaffirmed the international community’s confidence in the growth of Vietnam’s aviation and tourism industries.

The roundtable was regarded as one of the largest international aviation cooperation events held in Vietnam this year. It was positioned as an investment promotion platform, where businesses from both countries - particularly in the fields of aviation and hospitality - had the opportunity to meet, exchange insights, and explore new avenues for cooperation.

Within the framework of the roundtable, Sun Group introduced Sun PhuQuoc Airways – Vietnam’s first airline pursuing the “resort airline” model, fully invested and developed by the group.

True to its mission reflected in the name, Sun PhuQuoc Airways is building a hub-and-spoke network with Phu Quoc at the center, directly connecting major cities domestically and internationally.

This approach aims to provide every traveler with easier access to Phu Quoc – hailed as the world’s second most beautiful island after the Maldives.

More than an airline, Sun PhuQuoc Airways is positioned as a strategic cornerstone in Sun Group’s diversified ecosystem of experiences on the Pearl Island, encompassing luxury resorts, entertainment complexes, wellness services, shopping, gastronomy, and world-class shows.

Together, they form a seamless journey, where each flight does not simply transport passengers to a destination but ushers them into a complete holiday experience - from the sky to the ground.

In parallel with commercial aviation, Sun Group is implementing plans to upgrade Phu Quoc International Airport to ICAO Code 4E standards, expanding its scale to 1,050 hectares with more than 100 aircraft stands.

This synchronized investment - from ground infrastructure to an advanced airline fleet - demonstrates Sun Group’s long-term and methodical vision, working alongside local authorities to transform Phu Quoc into a new aviation and tourism hub for the region.

At the roundtable, U.S. corporations brought forward a range of cutting-edge solutions. Representatives from leading planning and design firms emphasized the importance of building human-centered “smart airports.”

Technology giants such as Amazon Web Services, Cisco, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Rapiscan presented solutions spanning from cloud computing and data management to advanced security screening and fuel-efficient operations.

Experts from GE Aerospace, Gulfstream, and Honeywell Aerospace further highlighted the global trend toward sustainable aviation, with a strong focus on flight safety, intelligent operations, and the application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Dang Minh Truong, chairman of Sun Group, said: “For Sun Group, aviation is not merely a means of transportation, but a strategic infrastructure to elevate the stature of a destination. We are building a comprehensive aviation ecosystem — from airport infrastructure to commercial airlines and premium services — with the vision of transforming Phu Quoc from a paradise for leisure into a new aviation and tourism hub of the region.

""The presence of leading US corporations today opens up valuable opportunities for collaboration, enabling us to learn from cutting-edge technologies while reaffirming our commitment to sustainable development and global integration.”

US Ambassador Marc Knapper remarked: “The connections forged today between American aviation leaders and Vietnamese innovators like Sun Group create the foundation for transformative collaboration. By combining cutting-edge US technology with Vietnam's dynamic market growth and visionary private sector leadership, we can accelerate progress toward making Vietnam the premier aviation destination in Southeast Asia.”

Alfanar, a diversified Saudi firm with interests in energy and engineering, has not yet published a detailed timetable or financial close date for Lighthouse Green Fuels.
“Developments such as Lighthouse Green Fuels put our region at the forefront of a growing industry which is primed for massive expansion and will deliver thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment in coming years.","The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility is proposed for the North Tees industrial cluster and would convert more than 1.5Mt of sustainably sourced biomass waste into up to 180M litres of SAF a year, according to company figures. That output is equivalent to fuelling roughly 25,000 short‑haul or 2,500 long‑haul flights annually.

Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said he secured the pledge during a visit to Riyadh last week, meeting senior Alfanar executives including vice‑chairman Sabah Al Multaq. The mayor said he would champion the scheme with the UK government as it progresses towards construction.

Alfanar’s plan envisages more than 2,000 jobs during the construction phase and about 240 permanent roles once the plant is operational. Project backers also say the facility will link to carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure being developed off the Teesside coast by the Northern Endurance Partnership, reducing lifecycle emissions. They estimate more than 750,000t of carbon dioxide could be avoided when the plant is coupled with CCS.

The Lighthouse Green Fuels facility proposal forms part of a broader effort to establish Teesside as a hub for low‑carbon aviation fuel manufacture. The Department for Transport has previously awarded almost £40M from its Advanced Fuels Fund to Alfanar and four other Teesside businesses to support SAF development in the region.

The project would represent one of the larger private investments in UK SAF production to date, but it faces the usual hurdles for industrial-scale energy projects: securing final investment decisions, planning consents, feedstock supply chains and long‑term offtake agreements with airlines or fuel distributors.

Critics of biomass‑derived sustainable fuels warn that sustainability depends on feedstock sourcing and land‑use impacts, while supporters point to the potential to decarbonise hard‑to‑electrify sectors such as aviation. Linking production to CCS can reduce emissions further, but CCS projects themselves have drawn scrutiny over cost, capacity and timing.

Local officials have promoted Teesside’s existing industrial infrastructure, port capacity and emerging CCS network as advantages for attracting low‑carbon industry. If completed, the Lighthouse plant would add to a cluster of projects seeking to position the area as a centre for energy transition and green manufacturing.

Alfanar, a diversified Saudi firm with interests in energy and engineering, has not yet published a detailed timetable or financial close date for Lighthouse Green Fuels.

Mayor Houchen said: “It is outstanding news that Alfanar has committed to delivering this project on Teesside and it’s a further example of the transformative global investments we are bringing to Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool.

“Developments such as Lighthouse Green Fuels put our region at the forefront of a growing industry which is primed for massive expansion and will deliver thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment in coming years.

Virgin Australia ordered the new aircraft last year on the back of improving load factors and financial results after emerging from receivership following the pandemic.
The aircraft will be based in Perth and employed on regional routes in Western Australia, replacing the ageing Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Network Aviation on Virgin’s behalf.
Virgin Australia Regional Airlines group executive Nick Rohrlach said the delivery of the new aircraft was a landmark day for aviation in Western Australia.","The first of eight new Embraer regional jets for Virgin Australia made a stopover in Canberra last week on its delivery flight to Perth.

Named ‘’Coral Bay’’, the aircraft completed the 26,000-kilometre ferry flight from São José dos Campos in Brazil via stops in Texas, California, Hawaii and Fiji before stopping in Canberra for a top-up for its final leg to Perth.

The E190-E2 is a substantially upgraded version of the older E-190s operated by Virgin Australia until 2018, when they were retired as part of the fleet consolidation on the Boeing 737. But the E190 offered much lower fuel burn, and was well suited to shorter and ‘’thinner’’ routes to regional centres that don’t require a 180-seat 737.

Upgrades include new-generation engines, a revised wing, and enhanced cabin features and products. The new aircraft will be fitted with 100-seat interiors, comprising 92 economy-class seats in a four-abreast configuration, and eight three-abreast business-class seats. Some of the economy-class seat rows will have ‘’Economy X’’ seats with additional legroom as a cost premium.

Virgin Australia ordered the new aircraft last year on the back of improving load factors and financial results after emerging from receivership following the pandemic.

This was followed earlier this year by the airline being relisted on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) for the first time in five years, the receipt of government approval for Qatar Airways to invest in the airline, and the resumption of international services from Sydney to Doha using Qatar Airways equipment and crews.

The aircraft will be based in Perth and employed on regional routes in Western Australia, replacing the ageing Fokker 100 aircraft operated by Network Aviation on Virgin’s behalf. Compared with the F100, the E190-E2 is much quieter, burns 30 per cent less fuel and produces 30 per cent fewer emissions.

The new aircraft are capable of flying legs up to six hours long, and are powered by new-generation Pratt & Whitney PW1900G geared turbofan engines. These are similar to the larger PW1500Gs installed on Qantas’s new and slightly larger 130-seat Airbus A220s, which are based in Canberra, and the larger-still PW1100G used by Jetstar’s Airbus A321NEO and Qantas’s new A321XLR.

While the E190-E2s’ primary role will be supporting Virgin Australia Regional Airlines’ (VARA) extensive fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) contracts across the state’s vastly dispersed mining communities, the cabin configuration will allow them the flexibility to operate regular passenger services during quieter charter periods.

VARA was formed from Virgin’s 2013 acquisition of Skywest, which had operated in the state for more than 60 years.

VARA currently operates about 250 flights a week, servicing regional centres including Albany, Broome, Busselton, Derby, Esperance, Exmouth, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Kununurra, Newman, Onslow and Port Hedland from its Perth base. These are a mix of revenue passenger and mining fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) services. In addition, VARA links Kalgoorlie with Melbourne, Broome and Kununurra with Darwin, and Port Hedland with Bali.

Virgin Australia Regional Airlines group executive Nick Rohrlach said the delivery of the new aircraft was a landmark day for aviation in Western Australia.

“The E190-E2 is a game-changer,” he said.

“It is more fuel-efficient, quieter and more comfortable than anything else operating in the state’s charter market today. It will significantly improve the travel experience for our charter clients and give us greater flexibility across VARA’s operations.

“When it enters service next month, this aircraft will fly charter routes and also support commercial services primarily within Western Australia to destinations like Darwin, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Port Hedland and Broome.

“As we build scale with the E2 fleet over time, we will be able to explore expanding its use across our national network.

“The E190-E2 is 30 per cent more fuel-efficient than our retiring Fokker 100s and has the lowest noise profile of any aircraft in its segment. It is also future-ready, certified for up to 50 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and capable of operating on 100 per cent SAF.”

In its recently released Annual Financial Report, GrainGrowers activities during the financial year resulted in a profit after tax of $7.2M, up from the FY24 result of $4.2M.

Total comprehensive income for the year included $8M in unrealised gains on the investment portfolio, up from $4.5M in FY24, alongside realised gains of $3.4M, compared with $2.6M the year before.

GrainGrowers’ expenses for the year were $7.559M, down slightly from $7.691M in FY24.

Most of these costs were employment-related expenses at $4.47M, followed by $1.48M for projects.

The financial report also referenced specific expenses for the year, notably payments to politically-aligned causes and $220,000 for National Farmers Federation membership.

The political-related expenses included $30,000 for annual membership to the Federal Labor Business Forum, which allows for GrainGrowers attendance at various Labor events, and a further payment of $2520 was made to the forum during the year for attendance to other events.

Another $11,000 was paid to the National Party to attend various similar political functions during the year.

In the financial report, the organisation commented that “these expenditures further complement GrainGrowers advocacy and policy agenda”.

Investment portfolio breakdown

Management of GrainGrowers’ investment portfolio continued to bring gains for the organisation during FY25.

Most of these gains came from a $5.238M jump in the value of investments categorised as “units in unlisted Australian Infrastructure fund” to $47.768M.

This is the organisation’s second-largest investment classification, under “units in unlisted Australian managed funds”, which also rose in FY25 from $56.92M to $58.505M.

GrainGrowers credited “proactive management and long-term asset allocation” behind the success of its investment portfolio.

“This strategic approach has effectively positioned GrainGrowers’ portfolio to navigate through financial market volatility in the year and has enabled the portfolio to gain from the financial market recovery in the final quarter of the current fiscal year,” the report said.

In the accompanying Annual Report, GrainGrowers’ chair Rhys Turton said the organisation continued a policy of disciplined financial management.

“GrainGrowers financial position remains strong and together with a disciplined spending policy, we continue to effectively represent and serve over 15,000 members nationally,” Mr Turton said.

“Our grower relations and thought leadership work ensures we provide a robust ideas ecosystem that can solve emerging and future issues while still exploring opportunities for immediate growth and innovation for the industry.

“As examples, projects and initiatives undertaken include our comprehensive and industry wide Grain Sustainability Framework and Inputs of the Future report including the active exploration of biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).”

GrainGrowers’ priorities

The Annual Report identified key areas of focus for GrainGrowers during the financial year.

GrainGrowers chief executive officer Shona Gawel said “one of the biggest issues” was the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority review of paraquat and diquat.

She said there was a “huge amount of resourcing dedicated to this critical issue”.

“Knowing we needed data to underpin our response, the grower survey we ran received over 1120 responses,” Ms Gawel said.

“In addition to the submission response, we also focused on ways to engage with the broader community.

“GrainGrowers ran a community awareness campaign with a fantastic video featuring growers across the country about how they safely and responsibly use tools like paraquat and diquat on their farms.”

Ms Gawel said the organisation had focused its efforts on six key issues for the industry to focus its resources and skillset.

“As a grower representative organisation, there is a desire at times to “be and do all things”.

“We have a committed team who take pride in being of use to our growers.

“However, GrainGrowers has found that we can create the most impact by prioritising and subsequently have focused on six key issues: carbon and climate, farm business, farm inputs, grain freight and supply chains, trade and market access and biosecurity.

“This gives us capacity when emerging issues arise.”",https://www.graincentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-11-105945.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:15.257244

Minister O'Brien said that Mr Jacobs and his team had been ""central"" to delivering growth at Dublin Airport.

The talks between the two legal teams are expected to continue over the coming days.

Mr Jacobs has led the state body which is responsible for the operation of Dublin and Cork Airports since January 2023.

There have been reports of tensions between the board of directors of the daa and Mr Jacobs.

He is understood to have been subject to two protective disclosures which have not been upheld, meaning the chief executive was exonerated.

The Department has been kept informed of developments and Mr Jacobs remains in position.

Any exit package for Mr Jacobs would also have to be approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Jack Chambers.

It is understood that the Government's position is that any settlement for Mr Jacobs would be tied to his entitlements.

The daa annual report said: ""Total remuneration in respect of Mr Jacobs for 2024 amounted to

€374,830 (2023: €347,457) which included basic salary of €284,235 (2023: €267,837) and pension contributions and other taxable benefits of €90,595 (2023: €79,620).""

The daa board is due to meet in Cork in a pre-scheduled meeting on Friday.

A spokesperson for the daa declined to comment on the negotiations regarding Mr Jacobs' future.

Airport passenger cap will stifle growth - O'Brien

Meanwhile, Minister O'Brien said retaining Dublin Airport's passenger cap will stifle its growth.

The Department of Transport will begin the process of removing the Dublin Airport passenger cap in the coming weeks.

The cap, which stands at 32 million passengers per year, was imposed in 2007 as part of the planning conditions around the development of Terminal 2.

At the time, the airport had about 23 million passengers.

Legal proceedings by airlines have effectively suspended the cap, with questions referred to the European Courts.

Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Mr O’Brien said the airport is a ""critical economic driver for the country, not just for the region, and any stifling of that growth obviously has a direct economic impact"".

""I've had a series of meetings over the course of the last number of months, particularly with our legal advisors, and I'll be coming forward to Cabinet, hopefully before the Budget, with legislative options that is in seeking approval to proceed with drafting Heads of Bill and the general scheme,"" he added.

Mr O’Brien said he was in favour of the removal of the passenger cap, which could see up to 60 million passengers pass through the airport per year, if the growth was managed in a sustainable manner.

""You have obviously got to do that on a phased basis. One is not going to jump from 36 million to 60 million in the course of one, five, ten years,"" he said.

He said a ""couple of very significant planning decisions"" have been made.

""The night flights issue has been addressed in July, which gives clarity to the airport and indeed to residents around the operation of the airport at night,"" he said.

""We're expecting, very, very shortly in the coming weeks, a positive decision on Metrolink, which is a transformative project for the airport, and indeed for the region.""

""The physical infrastructure around the airport that existed back in 2007 when this planning permission was granted and that condition was put in place, has changed greatly and will change further,"" he added.

Mr O’Brien said that there would ""unquestionably"" be an increase in greenhouse gas emissions if the passenger cap is removed, but added that the aviation sector had responsibilities to combat that potential increase.

""What also is in that [planning] application, and which is understood in the aviation sector, is the responsibilities they have to bring forward the use of alternative fuels, such as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel),"" he said.

""Airplanes are far more advanced technologically now and are more efficient in relation to fuel use.

""We have obligations on the climate side and I'm acutely aware of that as Minister with responsibility for that.

""We've seen emissions reduce over the last two years in Ireland, whilst our economy and population continues to grow. So we're making advances in many areas, and this is a balance that we will have to strike.""

Mr O’Brien said he had already met with a number of residents groups to hear and discuss their concerns.

""I have met with the residents group from St Margaret's over the summer,"" he said.

""I'll be meeting with them again. I've met with residents in Portmarnock. I know the area intimately as I've spent my whole life here.

""I also know that there are many residents here who understand we need to grow the airport, and indeed a lot of those residents do, and there are others who have concerns and I continue to engage with them, absolutely.""

'Inevitability' around cap removal

A member of the Oireachtas Transport Committee member says there has been an inevitability about the removal of the cap at Dublin Airport for some time.

Fianna Fáil TD Cathal Crowe, said aviation likes certainty and if an airline doesn't feel it is being properly accomodated it can easily move to another jurisdiction.

Legislation takes time, he said on RTÉ's Today with Claire Byrne, and will probably be passed sometime next year.

Mr Crowe said aviation has come on ""light years"" and there are more efforts underway to make aircrafts more environmentally friendly.

He added that Ireland is an island nation that needs connectivity and economic development.

Opportunity to examine airport activity regulation - O'Gorman

Green Party leader Roderic O'Gorman said if the cap at Dublin airport is changed, it could be an opportunity to examine whether passenger numbers is the right way to regulate activities at Dublin Airport.

Roderic O'Gorman said there could be an opportunity to look at emissions and noise and reward those airlines that are upgrading their fleet and using quieter and more fuel efficient aircrafts.

""We have to understand the scale of what Minister O'Brien is proposing, and we should be regulating Dublin Airport in terms of what is generated by increased passenger numbers,"" he said on RTÉ's Today with Claire Byrne.

""Focusing on the actual emission of the passenger brings a greater degree of fairness into the equation,"" he added.

More aircraft means more noise

A spokesperson for St Margaret's The Ward Residents forum says more aircraft will mean more noise and there are already outstanding issues in relation to noise from Dublin airport.

Niamh Maher said residents find it ""incredulous"" that the Minister for Transport would remove the cap without resolving these issues first.

""The problem extends past St Margaret's The Ward to everywhere a flight path crosses over,"" she said.

""If there's an increase in passenger numbers, which equals increased flights, that is going to get even worse,"" she added.",https://www.rte.ie/images/001df17c-1600.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:18.926662

“We found that information about Canada’s carbon removal sector is scattered all over the place,” Na'im Merchant, executive director of Carbon Removal Canada, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada.
Based in Toronto, Carbon Removal Canada works to accelerate the “responsible scale-up of carbon removal.” The Carbon Console was funded via a partnership with RBC.
A plurality of the current removal capacity is from rock-based carbon removal that involves mineralizing CO2, followed by ocean-, land- and air-based methods.
Canada could lead the world in carbon removal, Carbon Removal Canada said in a 2023 report, noting advantages such as its clean electricity, skilled energy workforce and fostering of companies.","A website made by non-profit Carbon Removal Canada that summarizes the state of the emerging sector and planned capacity across the country is intended to “solve a pretty critical market intelligence problem,” the organization’s head said.

Released today, the Carbon Console tracks the Canadian carbon removal industry, which captures the greenhouse gas from the environment through various means and buries it in different mediums. The non-profit suggests Canada could reap tens of billions of dollars in economic activity from the sector.

“We found that information about Canada’s carbon removal sector is scattered all over the place,” Na'im Merchant, executive director of Carbon Removal Canada, said in an interview with Sustainable Biz Canada. The console is meant to “centralize all that information in one platform in a transparent manner.”

Today, there is enough carbon removal capacity to extract 101,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, with almost 12 million tonnes planned, according to the Console. There are 78 companies in the sector operating in Canada, made up of technology providers, project developers and operators.

Policy makers can take a peek to inform policies, while the private sector can make better-informed decisions such as where to site a project, Merchant said.

Based in Toronto, Carbon Removal Canada works to accelerate the “responsible scale-up of carbon removal.”

The Carbon Console was funded via a partnership with RBC.

Where Canada’s carbon removal industry stands today

The organization collected publicly available data, made direct outreach to carbon removal industry players, and conducted its own research drawing from sources such as media reports and pitches made to local governments to create the Console.

Governments, community groups and local non-governmental organizations were highly interested in the Carbon Console so they could be better informed about the nascent sector, Merchant said.

Not all carbon removal technology is the science-fiction-like direct air capture that filters CO2 from the atmosphere. Nature-based solutions such as converting forestry and agricultural biomass into biochar, a carbon-rich solid material, are popular.

Under 50 projects are currently underway. A plurality of the current removal capacity is from rock-based carbon removal that involves mineralizing CO2, followed by ocean-, land- and air-based methods.

Merchant is “amazed at just the amount of projects that are operating or under development or planned.” The 11.9 million tonnes of planned capacity was “a big shock,” as Carbon Removal Canada expected closer to one million. It is a sign companies are building a diverse scope of projects and carbon removal is no longer a “science experiment,” he said.

The 11.9 million tonnes would represent a sliver of the 708 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted in 2024 across Canada.

One metric that is absent on the Carbon Console is the amount of investment committed into the sector. Carbon Removal Canada plans to add more data points to the website over time, Merchant said, including the dollars put toward the technology.

How Canada could lead in the sector

British Columbia is an innovation leader in the sector, Merchant noted. Companies based in the province include Carbon Engineering, Arca and Svante.

At the project level, carbon removal has high potential in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Alberta particularly stands out because many large-scale projects are planned to be sited in the province, the provincial government has extended generous policy support, and the province has “an entrepreneurial business approach,” Merchant said.

Atlantic provinces could forge ahead in ocean-based carbon removal, he added. Players housed in the region include Aeon Blue, Planetary Technologies and CarbonCure.

Canada could lead the world in carbon removal, Carbon Removal Canada said in a 2023 report, noting advantages such as its clean electricity, skilled energy workforce and fostering of companies. But Merchant warned the country risks falling behind the likes of the U.K. or the European Union because of insufficient government policies.

He laid out three recommendations for the Canadian government to stay ahead in the race:

creating market certainty for companies by helping to secure buyers and funding;

expanding the investment tax credit for all forms of carbon removal, not just direct air capture; and

more targeted research and development funding for carbon removal, such as Natural Resources Canada making a project stream for the technology.

Carbon removal, in the non-profit’s view, is an investment that can be supported using unspent money in funds, Merchant said. The industry is a “critical sector” that should be supported by the federal government, and the carbon removal credits it generates could even be an export opportunity, he added.",https://squall.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/posts/2025091204-carbon-console-800x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:23.189465

India has set indicative SAF blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, rising to 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights, equivalent to around 700 million litres of SAF demand by 2030.

Industry leaders including Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), Praj Industries, TruAlt Bioenergy and Avaada Group are already investing in production capacity and technology.

There has been some early progress. Praj Industries has commissioned a one kilolitre-per-day AtJ demo plant in Pune, while IOCL recently became the first domestic firm to secure ISCC-CORSIA certification at its Panipat refinery. Several second-generation (2G) ethanol plants by IOCL, BPCL and HPCL are also coming online, ensuring a ready feedstock base.

“We believe India has the raw materials, technological know-how and entrepreneurial spirit to build a thriving SAF ecosystem. What is required now is the collective will—commitment, collaboration and bold decision-making,” Rohit Kumar, SAFA secretary general, said in a statement.

India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP), which scaled petrol blending from 1.5 per cent in 2014 to 20 per cent by 2025, offers a blueprint for SAF rollout, the paper noted. Ethanol capacity has risen eightfold to 13.8 billion litres in under a decade, creating infrastructure, supply chains and policy experience that can be repurposed for AtJ.

India produces over 500 crore litres of ethanol annually and about 754 million tonnes of agricultural biomass, of which 228 million tonnes is surplus and available for energy use. Surplus feedstocks are concentrated in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra, making them prime zones for SAF clusters.

“India has abundant agricultural waste, low-cost renewable energy and a large domestic aviation market. With a strategic push, we can decarbonise our skies and become a regional and global SAF hub,” Vijay Nirani, SAFA senior vice president, said in a statement.

However, high production costs — currently three to five times that of conventional jet fuel — remain the key barrier. Feedstock accounts for 50-70 per cent of costs, followed by capital-intensive conversion infrastructure.

The report called for viability gap funding of Rs 150 crore per project, production-linked incentives, tax breaks, low-interest loans and carbon credit frameworks to de-risk private investment.

It also urged a national-level mapping of feedstocks, upgrades at airports and oil marketing terminals for SAF storage and blending, industry-academia skill programmes and stronger cross-ministerial coordination.

“Government incentives, a dedicated SAF consortium, and sustainable feedstock policies will be essential. With coordinated efforts, India can drive economic growth and innovation while meeting its climate goals,” stressed Jimmy Olsson, President, SAF Association.

ICF has projected that global SAF output will grow tenfold to nearly 20 million tonnes by 2030. After meeting domestic demand, the report argued that India could tap export markets with binding SAF mandates, turning aviation decarbonisation into a major economic opportunity.

“Together, government and industry can transform India’s aviation sector into a model of sustainable growth, innovation and climate leadership,” said Ajay Mathur, Mentor, SAF Association and former DG, International Solar Alliance.

If India replicates its ethanol success in SAF, the report concluded, it could not just participate in the global clean fuel transition but shape it, emerging as a key driver of innovation, investment and leadership in sustainable aviation.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-15%2Fgwynejjx%2FiStock-1202297867.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-15 11:57:39.186524

He pointed out that sugar production in India is much costlier than in Brazil.
Without ethanol, nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced closure, Gadkari noted.
“If farmers start producing fuel, electricity, aviation fuel, bitumen and hydrogen, along with food, villages will prosper,” he said.
He added that boosting irrigation by 65% and increasing milk production could address many challenges faced by farmers in Maharashtra.","Pune: Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said that ethanol production has been a lifeline for sugarcane farmers and sugar mills in Maharashtra, reported The Times of India.

Speaking at the tenth anniversary of the Naam Foundation, started by actors Nana Patekar and Makarand Anaspure for watershed management and drought relief, Gadkari said that the sugar industry was under severe strain but survived because of ethanol. He added that work is underway to produce isobutanol as an alternative to diesel, and that plans are being drawn up to create sustainable aviation fuel from biogas.

He pointed out that sugar production in India is much costlier than in Brazil. While the cost in Brazil is about Rs. 27 per kg, in Maharashtra it is around Rs. 32-33. “Brazil can sell sugar internationally at around Rs. 30, but our mills lose Rs. 2-3 per kg,” he said. Without ethanol, nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced closure, Gadkari noted.

He urged farmers to think beyond food crops. “If farmers start producing fuel, electricity, aviation fuel, bitumen and hydrogen, along with food, villages will prosper,” he said.

According to him, the use of corn for ethanol has also given farmers better prices. Rates have risen from Rs. 1,200 per quintal to Rs. 2,800 per quintal, and production has tripled in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra, where farmers take three crops a year.

On broader issues, Gadkari stressed the need for better water management to improve farming and rural life. He said disputes between states on sharing river water had created complications, but most of the 23 conflicts have now been resolved. He added that boosting irrigation by 65% and increasing milk production could address many challenges faced by farmers in Maharashtra.

Later in the day, at another programme organised by Geeta Dharma Mandal, Gadkari was honoured. While addressing the gathering, he suggested using modern tools like videos and reels to share the teachings of the Bhagavad Geeta with the youth. He said this could help them understand the meaning of life and politics. “Politics should focus more on social reforms than on power. The real problem today is not disagreement, but the absence of ideas,” he remarked.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Nitin-Gadkari-6.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 12:57:16.495408

The global logistics market size was valued at USD 288.97 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 322.40 billion in 2025 and USD 774.07 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 11.57% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

The logistics are the integrated coordination of transportation, warehousing, inventory management, and information systems to ensure the seamless movement of goods from origin to consumption. It functions as the backbone of global trade, enabling supply chain continuity across industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to e-commerce. According to the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index 2023, countries with advanced logistics infrastructure experienced 28% lower trade transaction costs than those in the bottom quartile.

MARKET DRIVERS

The logistics market growth is majorly driven by the rapid expansion of cross-border e-commerce, which demands agile, customer-centric delivery networks. Consumers in emerging and developed markets alike are increasingly purchasing goods from international platforms, necessitating efficient customs clearance, last-mile delivery, and reverse logistics. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, global cross-border e-commerce sales reached $6.3 trillion in 2023, a 9.4% increase from the previous year, with Asia-Pacific leading in outbound and inbound digital trade. This surge places immense pressure on logistics providers to offer transparent tracking, faster transit times, and localized fulfillment. Companies like DHL and FedEx have responded by expanding regional sorting hubs in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe.

The shift toward nearshoring and supply chain regionalization in response to geopolitical volatility and pandemic-era disruptions is additionally fuelling the growth of the logistics market. Multinational corporations are relocating production and distribution closer to end markets to reduce lead times and mitigate risks. This trend is particularly evident in the automotive and electronics sectors, where just-in-time manufacturing requires proximity to assembly plants. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported a 14% increase in warehouse construction starts in 2023, which is primarily for distribution centers serving reshored operations.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

The persistent shortage of qualified drivers and warehouse personnel in developed economies is restricting the growth of the logistics market. This labor deficit disrupts service reliability and inflates operational costs. According to the American Trucking Associations, the U.S. faced a shortage of approximately 80,000 truck drivers in 2023, a figure projected to exceed 100,000 by 2026 due to an aging workforce and low entry rates.

The escalating cost and volatility of energy, particularly diesel and aviation fuel, which is also hindering the growth of the logistics market. According to the International Energy Agency, global diesel prices rose by 22% between January 2022 and December 2023. For logistics firms, fuel can account for up to 30% of operating costs in road freight, as noted by the International Road Union. Airlines faced even steeper increases, with jet fuel prices up 28% over the same period, forcing cargo carriers to impose surcharges or reduce capacity. This volatility undermines pricing predictability and profit margins, especially for small and mid-sized logistics providers without hedging capabilities. Additionally, the push for decarbonization adds financial pressure, as companies must invest in alternative-fuel vehicles and infrastructure without guaranteed short-term returns, which is complicating long-term planning and investment decisions.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

The deployment of autonomous logistics technologies, including self-driving trucks, warehouse robotics, and drone deliveries, enhances efficiency and reduces dependency on human labor. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the global installation of logistics robots in warehouses increased by 35% in 2023, with over 120,000 units deployed across distribution centers in the U.S., China, and Germany. Companies like Amazon and Alibaba have integrated robotic picking and sorting systems that reduce processing time by up to 50%. These advancements are paving the way for 24/7 operations and reduced last-mile delivery costs, particularly in high-density urban corridors.

The integration of blockchain technology to enhance transparency, traceability, and trust in advanced operations is set to create new opportunities for the growth of the logistics market. By creating immutable, shared records of shipment events, blockchain reduces documentation errors, fraud, and delays in customs clearance. According to the World Economic Forum, blockchain-enabled trade platforms can reduce document processing times by up to 40% and lower transaction costs by 15–20%. Maersk and IBM’s TradeLens platform, though restructured in 2023, demonstrated that digitized bills of lading reduced port dwell times by an average of 40 hours across 300 ports.

MARKET CHALLENGES

The increasing regulatory complexity surrounding emissions, data privacy, and cross-border trade compliance is inhibiting the growth of the logistics market. Governments worldwide are imposing stricter environmental standards, such as the European Union’s Fit for 55 package, which mandates a 55% reduction in transport emissions by 2030. Simultaneously, data localization laws in countries like China and Russia require logistics firms to store shipment information within national borders, complicating global IT integration. Many international shipments faced delays due to non-compliant documentation, with the operational burden of navigating divergent regulatory regimes across jurisdictions.

The infrastructure inadequacy in key emerging markets, where port congestion, road deficiencies, and railways are hampering the growth of the logistics market. According to the World Bank’s 2023 Connecting to Compete report, the average container dwell time in ports across Sub-Saharan Africa was 11.3 days, compared to 3.2 days in East Asia. In India, despite recent investments, freight trains operate at an average speed of 24 km/h due to track congestion and aging signaling systems, as reported by the Ministry of Railways. Similarly, in Indonesia, inter-island logistics costs account for nearly 25% of retail prices, limiting market integration.

In the first week of September, the Henrique Lage Refinery (Revap), in the state of São Paulo, carried out tests for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from the co-processing of vegetable oil in a mixture with traditional petroleum streams.

SAF can directly replace conventional kerosene without the need for modifications to aircraft or fueling infrastructure.

""This makes it a practical and immediate solution to reduce emissions from the aviation sector,"" the state-owned company said in a press release.

In Rio de Janeiro, the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc) recently obtained authorization from the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) to incorporate up to 1.2% renewable feedstock into its SAF production. The refinery is expected to begin commercial production in the coming months.

Last month, Petrobras launched a bidding process to build a biojet kerosene (bioQAV) and renewable diesel unit at the Presidente Bernardes Refinery (RPBC) in São Paulo state. Contracts are expected to be announced soon for the construction of a bioQAV plant at the Boaventura energy complex in Rio de Janeiro state.

In recent months, the company has promoted bids to install solar generation plants in Boaventura, as well as in the Abreu e Lima ( RNEST ) refineries, in Pernambuco, and Paulínia (Replan), in the interior of São Paulo, and intends to launch a contracting process for Gabriel Passos (Regap).

Currently, the oil company has a pilot solar plant in Alto do Rodrigues (UFV-AR), close to the Vale do Açu Thermoelectric Plant (UTE-VLA), in Rio Grande do Norte, which will, in the future, house a green hydrogen research project .

However, the latest report from Cirium’s EmeraldSky platform reveals that, while total daily emissions saw a modest 0.1% increase, airlines achieved a significant 7.4 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency per available seat kilometer (ASK) compared to 2019.

The efficiency gains came despite the average age of aircraft increasing by 17% to 11.6 years, contradicting the common belief that a newer fleet is the only way to improve performance. Instead, airlines focused on operational refinements, including streamlining ground operations, optimizing flight routes, and more efficient network management.

According to the analysis, these improvements saved an estimated 187,000 tonnes of CO₂ daily compared to 2019 operational standards. However such gains were not enough to offset the growth in capacity, which is why total emissions still went up.

The EmeraldSky analysis suggests that new daily emissions records will become routine during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer travel season.

The authors conclude that, while the industry’s recent efficiency improvements have been faster than historical trends, continued growth will require more fundamental changes, with sustainable aviation fuel still making up less than 1% of consumption.

Andrew Doyle, Senior Director – Market Development, Cirium, stressed the importance of fleet modernisation and integrating innovative technologies to mitigate emissions.

“While geopolitical factors present significant challenges, the aviation industry’s commitment to modernising fleets is a testament to our proactive approach to sustainability,” he said.

The company said in a statement on Monday that it plans to unveil ‘the achievement’ at the Dubai Airshow later this year.

Lootah Biofuels said it has adopted a three-phase roadmap for SAF deployment. In the short term, it plans to import SAF to meet immediate market demand.

The medium-term plans are to operate a local production facility in the UAE. In the long-term, the company said in plans to localise full production to “enhance energy security, reduce imports, and create more green jobs,” it said in a statement.

The company said it has already completed engineering and feasibility studies for establishing a dedicated SAF production plant in the UAE.

Established in 2010, Lootah Biofuels was the first commercial biofuel company in the Middle East.

It is partnering with international production facilities to add this fuel to its extensive portfolio of bio-based products. The fuel is produced from Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and waste-derived fats, in accordance with ASTM D7566-24 and ICAO CORSIA standards.

The fuel produced from used cooking oil and waste-derived fats, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. The fuel can be blended with traditional Jet A-1 fuel up to 50 per cent by volume and offers cleaner combustion with very low sulfur content.

""As one of the first local suppliers of SAF, we are proud to launch SAF in the UAE market and showcase it at Dubai Airshow to local and international stakeholders and leading companies in the aviation industry,"" said Yousif Lootah, CEO of Lootah Biofuels.

Lootah added, “This initiative reflects Lootah Biofuels’ sustainable commitment to innovation, reinforces our alignment with the UAE’s sustainability vision, and brings us closer to our aspirations of collaborating with global aviation partners to accelerate decarbonization.""

The launch aligns with global aviation industry efforts to reduce carbon emissions and the UAE’s commitment to advancing aviation sector sustainability goals.

The UAE government has committed to investing heavily in sustainable aviation technologies as part of its broader Net Zero 2050 strategy. The country’s two major airlines - Emirates and Etihad - have also invested heavily to tap into the nascent global SAF market.

Emirates recently expanded its partnership with Neste for the supply of over 3 million gallons of blended SAF in 2024 and 2025, and took delivery of 3,000 metric tonnes of neat SAF from Shell Aviation at London Heathrow Airport.

Only one, Huaneng Yangpu in China, is a gas power station and that is just a demonstration project.
US President Donald Trump, for example, cut subsidies for other green technologies but expanded support for CCUS, while India is preparing CCUS subsidies.","Capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) to use or store remains one of the costliest ways to cut emissions. That means the technique – known as CCUS – has yet to scale up, still relies on taxpayer support and should only be pursued after other green solutions, key industry players told a recent conference in London.

Companies and governments that depend heavily on fossil fuel revenues have long promoted CCUS technology as a way to carry on producing and consuming fossil fuels while keeping emissions down.

But over 50 years since the first project began operating, CCUS is still barely used. According to the Global CCS Institute, just 50 facilities were running around the world in 2024, with the capacity to capture about a thousandth of global emissions.

Most of those capture CO2 from gas facilities and pump it underground to squeeze more oil from reservoirs, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR).

At this month’s Carbon Capture Global Summit 2025 – organised by Leader Associates – business representatives admitted that the technology has failed to expand on a commercial scale despite strong government support. CCUS momentum has even “plateaued a wee bit” in 2025, said Mhairidh Evans, head of CCUS research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Subsidies still needed

Julia Dubinina, a former Shell manager now developing oil and gas firm Harbour Energy’s carbon storage business, was asked if CCUS is entering its “deployment phase”. She replied that it is “too early to talk about scale”, adding “we need to be careful of not trying to fly before we can walk”. “There is still quite a lot of work to be done,” she added.

She remains cautious partly because “public funding is an absolute must for every project, and scaling is kind of limited when you need public funding for every single project,” she explained.

The industry depends on subsidies because capturing and transporting CO2 is among the most expensive climate solutions. In 2021, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists reported that while solar and wind investments usually save money, CCUS costs $50-200 per tonne of CO2 captured.

In a keynote speech at the conference, Katharina Beumelberg, sustainability chief at Heidelberg Materials – which produces cement, aggregates, concrete and asphalt – acknowledged the sector’s reliance on taxpayer support.

Praising the Norwegian government’s funding for one of the company’s CCUS projects, she said: “We need these funding processes to be able to do this pioneering work because, otherwise, from the private sector it would be unrealistic to get there”. She added: “Whatever we do in the end needs to make money.”

Beumelberg called for more taxpayer support for CCUS. Noting that three-fifths of Heidelberg’s products are used in government-funded projects, she said governments should create a market for carbon-free products, “recognising that a carbon-free product in the end does need to come with different pricing because it is carbon-free”.

Because of its high cost, most experts say CCUS should be reserved for sectors that are hard to clean up in other ways like steel, chemicals and particularly cement.

Expensive last resort

Cement-making produces 8% of global emissions, more than any country apart from the US and China, as fossil fuels are burned to heat limestone and the chemical process itself releases CO2.

But Rozemarijn Wesby, vice-president of CCUS at the world’s biggest cement company Holcim, told the conference that even in cement, the high cost of CCUS means it is only the “last piece of the puzzle”.

That’s because Holcim’s decarbonisation goal is more important than its CCUS goal, she said – and CCUS is one of the more expensive ways to cut emissions. For that reason, Holcim is first ensuring that its power is “green”, fuels are “sustainable and renewable” and emissions avoided “wherever possible”.

Evans of Wood Mackenzie echoed this, saying governments and companies should prioritise energy efficiency, then “electrifying everything that we possibly can with renewables, then fuel switching [and] substituting” before “at the last, directly abating or removing carbon dioxide”.

Wesby stressed that using CCUS only as a last step limits costs and prevents oversized “downstream” infrastructure. The CCUS infrastructure discussed at the conference included pipelines and trains to move CO2, terminals to store, compress and load it onto ships, and underground storage sites.

A Nature study published this month, however, found that the world’s CO2 storage potential is far more constrained than previously thought. Lead author Matthew Gidden of the University of Maryland argued in a post on CarbonBrief that governments should prioritise who gets access to storage space.

Carbon capture for gas plants?

Electricity is one of the easiest sectors to decarbonise because renewable power is often cheaper than fossil fuels. As of 2024, only five fossil-fuel power plants had CCUS, all of which used the CO2 for EOR. Only one, Huaneng Yangpu in China, is a gas power station and that is just a demonstration project.

Nonetheless, the UK government financially supports a CCUS project at a gas plant in England’s Northeast and is considering support for another in Wales run by power firm Uniper. Mike Lockett, Uniper’s UK head, said that Germany’s new centre right-led government had also “opened the door for gas-fired CCS”.

Supporters say such plants produce flexible and dispatchable power, unlike solar and wind. Critics argue batteries, demand management, nuclear and cross-border interconnections can provide sufficient backup.

Greg Jackson, the chief executive of Octopus, a UK-based clean energy, electric vehicle services and heat pump company, said recently that – while it’s useful for cement – subsidising CCUS for energy is misguided.

Jackson, who is also an official adviser to the UK government, told the Financial Times Weekend Festival that the technology has “been a gift to the oil and gas industry to carry on what they’re doing and carry on the fiction that somehow enormous amounts of public money should enable them to keep doing it”.

“It’s a boondoggle for oil and gas – and we would be better off in the UK just burning unabated gas, because the cheaper we make electricity, the cheaper our heat pumps and electric cars are going to be and they are the key to emissions reductions,” he said.

Risk of pipeline leaks

Building out CCUS on a large scale will involve vast CO2 pipeline networks. These come with risks: In 2020, a landslide caused a carbon pipeline to leak in the US state of Mississippi, hospitalising at least 45 people. High concentrations of CO2 can cause headaches, drowsiness, elevated heartbeat and blood pressure, and even death.

Climate Home News asked Niko Bosnjak, policy and communications lead at carbon pipeline operator Open Grid Europe (OGE), which is converting German gas pipelines to carry CO2, if similar leaks could happen in Europe.

He said he had heard about the Mississippi incident, although he didn’t “know exactly what happened”. OGE, he added, is working on a security framework and “looking at the thickness of the pipeline in a way that is supposed to provide more security”.

Despite such concerns, CCUS has continued to receive strong political backing. US President Donald Trump, for example, cut subsidies for other green technologies but expanded support for CCUS, while India is preparing CCUS subsidies.

“The need for CCS is broadly recognised at the political level,” said Shell’s CCS general manager Kelly Ripley. Oil and gas giant Shell is launching CCUS projects – especially in North America and northwest Europe – she added, and is “doing a lot of learning from this political and regulatory perspective and also hoping to bring other countries on the same journey with us”.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/Carbon-Capture-Summit-2025-QEII-Centre-London-Photographer-Simon-Callaghan-Photography-1348-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 07:56:14.285582

CONTROLLING DEMAND Many of the scenarios include a purple bar denoting demand impact or reduction – ie reducing the demand for business travel.
Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever?
“One per cent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 per cent of aviation emissions.","Most corporate travel managers are still on their first steps on their sustainability journeys. It is clear that, no matter what the messages are that are emerging from the EU or the White House, that more companies are taking those steps.

Those companies in the early stages of their sustainability journeys will quickly mature thanks to the proliferation of technology and expertise in the market today.

“There is an expectation in the uplift of the quality of sustainability data to finance-level, audited data,” says CTM’s head of sustainability Lauren Hook. “What this means is the need for accurate and timely data will become increasingly important for businesses at both ends of the sustainability maturity spectrum.”

While we have seen that companies are reacting to regulatory pressure more than anything else in their sustainability strategies, peer pressure is also important.

“We are seeing very significant pressure being applied by some of the largest companies in the world, in particular, Microsoft, AstraZeneca, Salesforce, Schneider Electric and Siemens [are] asking their suppliers to report on their emissions and set up their own forward-looking targets,” says Adam Braun, founder and CEO of Clarasight.

“We actually believe that added business pressure is more powerful than just the regulatory pressure. Often, we're hearing from companies who are saying we need to do more than just report on last year's emissions. We now need to set credible targets going forward and then have both a system of record and a system of action to be able to credibly achieve that goal.”

Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Aspen believes we will see more carbon budgets being used by corporates. Indeed, Concur is set to facilitate carbon budgets in its booking tool this quarter.

In May, Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Apsen told BTN Europe that it will be the first organisation to take advantage of the new capability, with “several corporates lined up for the initial rollout, including a mix of Fortune 500s.”

Aspen believes that carbon budgets at the team level will be the most popular. “How can an individual make that decision? If they think their trip is more important than their boss's trip in two months’ time they’re going to book it anyway,” he says. “There are also many places out there where there is only one flight a day. If your carbon budget says you now have to reduce your carbon by 10 per cent then that is useless information – you are going to take that one flight.”

He continues: “When you have budgets at a division level with 10,000 people, it is too impersonal. What does it matter that you are emitting one tonne of CO2 when the division still has thousands of tonnes to emit.” Teams are therefore the sweetspot where a budget is most meaningful and can truly change behaviour and thus impact.

Decarbonising aviation in particular will remain crucial to decarbonising business travel by 2050. The figure below shows a range of different pathways that aviation might achieve net zero by 2050. It shows scenarios outlined by IATA, ICAO, the International Council on Clean Transportation and the Air Transport Action Group.

American Express Global Business Travel’s head of sustainability, Nora Lovell Marchant, says the figures reveal that “the low-hanging fruit is basically gone” but that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), shown in green, is a major part of all these scenarios.

Operations (shown in yellow), such as using greener flight paths, and tech (in blue), like more fuel-efficient planes, make up another significant part of the emission reductions.

Carbon removal and market-based measures (light grey), such as carbon pricing in Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme, are also important in many of the scenarios. Other scenarios leave residual emissions (in dark grey) – carbon emissions that cannot be removed by other methods – that need to be offset in some other way.

CONTROLLING DEMAND

Many of the scenarios include a purple bar denoting demand impact or reduction – ie reducing the demand for business travel.

Will fewer business trips part of the solution? Our survey showed that 46 per cent of travel managers are promoting the use of virtual meeting tools instead of face-to-face travel, although few if any companies are mandating this.

Katharina Riederer, co-founder of eco.mio, says: “Obviously it's the best solution not to travel but the difficulty in our industry is that this industry exists because of travel, so reducing travel... no one really wants to push that. Also, when I do my booking, I have already decided that I have to travel and I have already got the approval.”

Nora Lovell Marchant says the pandemic showed that meetings could move to Zoom. “Now aviation traffic is growing because people know the value of business trips and putting people in front of people,” she says. “Are there some business trips that can and should be replaced with Zoom? Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever? Absolutely.”

She continues: “We need to think about how to decarbonise that... because even the most liberal non-profit organisations recognise that other types of solutions besides demand management alone will be needed in order to decarbonise aviation.”

Benjamin Park, head of travel and sustainability at Parexel, expects sustainability in business travel to become more data-driven, with increased transparency and accountability. “Emissions methodologies will evolve, and corporates will need to adopt more granular tracking and reporting,” he says.

Park also believes that employee and customer expectations will increasingly influence corporate travel programmes. “For roles requiring travel, the maturity of a company’s sustainable travel strategy may become a differentiator in talent attraction and retention,” he says.

Park adds: “While cost management remains important, we are seeing a shift toward ‘purposeful travel’ where the value of each trip is weighed against its environmental impact. This mindset helps us reduce unnecessary travel while preserving essential face-to-face patient and customer engagement.”

As Advito’s senior director of sustainability Julien Etchanchu says, in spite of delays to the full roll-out of CSRD, “at some point, we will have to travel less not just because of the environment but because at some point there will be an energy crisis.”

Could unbridled aviation growth be managed through taxes and fees that are reinvested in the industry’s pursuit of net zero? “One per cent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 per cent of aviation emissions. People want to travel. At the moment, someone travelling once every ten years is taxed in the same way as a business traveller travelling 20 times a year.

“The problem is you don’t pay for the pollution you make – that is the ultimate issue. You could imagine a frequent flyer levy where the first trip is free of tax, the second you start to increase it a bit and by trip ten you are highly taxed and ever more highly in business class. The pressure for levies will grow,” warns Etchanchu.

With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry – and wider business travel sector – is running out of time to decarbonise. While plans, policies and ideas are rife, now is the time for action.

Michael Schneider: Usually our jet fuel consumption [annually as an industry] is 300 million tonnes.
Michael Schneider: Everyone has to play its part.
Michael Schneider: I think the crux of the problem is indeed the proliferation of methodologies and calculators.
Michael Schneider: Multimodality is important and could be part of the answer but it is a very European discussion as we have a very well-developed train network.","Michael Schneider is assistant director for aviation environment at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade association for the world's airlines. It represents some 350 airlines – which account for more than 80 per cent of global air traffic – and helps formulate industry policy on critical aviation issues, including sustainability and the environment. BTN Europe's Andy Hoskins spoke to Michael Schneider in early September.

BTN Europe: IATA is committed to net zero by 2050 and you have detailed roadmaps of how the aviation industry can achieve this. But 2050 is not all that far off now – is it still achievable?

Michael Schneider: It is indeed a big challenge and it’s not so far off. If you look at the five roadmaps we have addressing different areas you might think it is very challenging and particularly if you look at SAF [Sustainable aviation fuel]. The development of SAF is absolutely critical – 65 per cent of the industry's decarbonisation will come from SAF.

What we have not seen yet is the ramping up of it [SAF production] as we would have hoped. This is due to a number of different factors – feedstock availability, the large investments that need to be made, and of course governments have to play their part too, putting in place the right environment and mechanisms to allow SAF production to scale up, and it needs to happen rapidly. We need between 5,000 and 7,000 SAF production facilities – it’s a staggering number – and a new plant can cost $1 billion so there has to be the right environment to make it happen.

But SAF is not the only contributing lever. There are technological improvements, operational improvements… every new aircraft can be between 15 and 25 per cent more fuel efficient. Then of course there are other propulsion methods – hydrogen can play a role in short-haul aviation. And then there is a remainder of CO2 emissions that we cannot reduce by deploying SAF and we need to look at CO2 removal tech.

We are still very confident that we can meet net zero 2050 conditional on those things falling into place.

BTN Europe: At 65 per cent of emission reductions, there is a heavy reliance on SAF. There are EU and UK mandates on adoption in place now, but what are the biggest challenges in driving up SAF production?

Michael Schneider: Usually our jet fuel consumption [annually as an industry] is 300 million tonnes. We will have produced 2 million tonnes [of SAF] by the end of this year, so that is not even 1 per cent of what's needed. But this will rapidly grow.

With the mandates, it’s a two-edged sword. In a way it makes those producing SAF really focus because in renewable fuel production not everything is used for SAF. Unfortunately, what we’re seeing in Europe is that compliance costs have increased. SAF has got more expensive because the mandate is on the SAF suppliers not on the airlines and they want to pass on the cost. They see an opportunity to increase the price in this way and they call it a compliance cost so we’re seeing the cost of SAF in Europe being higher than in any other part of the world. It’s concerning and it’s an effect of a mandate.

In that sense we would think maybe incentives work better and we have seen that in the US with the IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] and the subsidies that have been offered to those who produce renewable fuel, and that really works well. We see the volumes there increasing rapidly. In Europe the decision was to do it via mandate and that has had a worse effect as we can see happening now. We have stats and charts on this that show how the cost per tonne of SAF has increased since the mandate was introduced.

BTN Europe: What else can governments do? What can IATA do?

Michael Schneider: Everyone has to play its part. Airlines are willing to make an investment – it’s a large investment; SAF is an expensive commodity. The profit margins [for airlines] are razor thin. We used to say it was a cup of coffee per passenger and maybe now it’s two cups of coffee because oil prices are a bit lower. But that is still not much and it does not give much room for extra investment. New aircraft models are being introduced and fleet renewal is already happening.

It is really on governments to create the right environment and the incentives to help make those steep investments in a production plant. But as long as you can make a lot of money with conventional fuels, there is a problem. A lot of subsidies, let’s be honest, don’t go into the renewable areas – it goes into the petroleum industry and fossil fuels. We’d rather see subsidies going into something linked to renewable fuels. And then of course we need governments to make it easier to build those plants by giving planning permissions and cutting the red tape.

On the technological aspect of SAF production, there are ways for established oil companies to repurpose some of their faculties to produce SAF. It is limited in terms of adding capacity but every drop of SAF that can be produced plays its part so it’s also on the oil majors to deliver. Unfortunately over the last two years we have seen some of the major producers row back.

[Editor's note: In the same week that this interview took place, news broke that Shell has cancelled the construction of a major biofuel production plant in the Netherlands due to cost concerns]

BTN Europe: In corporate travel there is sometimes confusion and scepticism around SAF. Deals are announced by airlines for SAF that doesn’t exist or is not actually supplied to or flown by that airline...

Michael Schneider: There are many commitments from airlines and these are important signals for producers. But if you’re an airline based in Kenya you don’t have direct access to SAF. However, there is SAF in the US and maybe San Francisco airport can offer it to them even though they don’t fly there, and it can be used by another airline. So you have SAF ‘book and claim’ where you can detach the environmental attribute from the product and this environmental attribute is certified and linked to proof of sustainability. You can invest in those attributes and account for them via the [IATA] SAF Registry.

It’s a seamless system that allows producers to transfer the attributes to the airline in an immutable way via the system. The airline can then decide how to reduce its offset obligation via CORSIA and put it in front of the state.

At the moment, there are clusters of SAF [production] happening in North America and in Europe, and also starting now in Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, but there are still areas where not much is happening so the book and claim approach really helps. It gives everyone access [to SAF]. In the end it doesn’t matter who actually flies with that SAF; what’s important is that it’s not counted twice. The registry takes care of that.

BTN Europe: There are a large number of emissions calculators and methodologies in the market and these can produce very different estimates and cause confusion for corporates. What sets IATA’s CO2 Connect methodology apart from others?

Michael Schneider: I think the crux of the problem is indeed the proliferation of methodologies and calculators. That is certainly confusing for travellers. We realised early on that this is a major issue not just for passengers but for airlines too. If you’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the latest [fuel-efficient] aircraft and it’s not reflected in a model... then it is not fit for purpose and that’s disappointing for airlines. You want your investment reflected.

As a standard-setting organisation, we understood the problem early on. In 2016 we finalised a cargo emissions methodology and that was followed by the standard on the passenger side and here we needed to involve not only the airlines but other organisations too, such as the ISO [International Organization for Standardization]. But the difference here – and is what we strongly advocate for and it’s super important – is the use of primary data.

A lot of calculators out there use data that is based on modelled information that is often outdated and provides a crude look. But when looking at a given flight, the load factor is very important. You can have a very fuel-efficient aircraft but if it is half empty then the CO2 emissions per passenger are very high. So you need good load factor information and you need the fuel burn information, and you need to calculate the fuel consumption in a standardised way.

The idea is to have a global approach so that airlines know exactly what they’re measuring – block off, block on times; do I include the auxiliary power unit?; do we include non-revenue passengers? There’s so much detail so you need to have a very, very good understanding and a standardised approach. We need that primary data and it needs to be independently validated.

We have access to all that information and I think that’s our great strength. We are working with the airlines and they understand that we all need to work together to generate a good industry average but can also distinguish between different airlines. If you’ve invested in fleet or in SAF then that should be reflected in the calculation.

Ideally, you would get the same result [an emissions figure] across all methodologies but that is not the case at the moment. But we feel this one [CO2 Connect] is being developed by the airlines for the airlines, and for their customers, and that this is the right approach because it offers the great advantage of primary data and that is absolutely critical.

BTN Europe: How many member airlines participate currently?

Michael Schneider: Around 70 airlines have contributed fuel burn data and more than 150 have contributed operational data, meaning load factor information. We have a big target this year – we want to hit 100. I think it’s feasible; we have good traction now at alliance level. Given the time spent on this project until now, it’s been a very good result.

BTN Europe: What’s preventing more airlines from participating?

Michael Schneider: In general, airlines have always been reluctant to share sensitive data and this is extremely commercially sensitive data because it’s fuel burn information and it’s about load factor. These tell you exactly how well or how badly an airline is performing. It requires some consideration and persuasion... more and more airlines are ready to take that step.

I think a lot of airlines realise customers want emissions transparency. There is an expectation among people and especially among businesses. They need to understand what the impact of taking a flight is even more so on the corporate side. They have targets and they need to understand if they’re hitting those and how they can maybe reduce some of their impact from flying. Companies are becoming very selective in their choice of airline and they cannot do this unless they have the right data in front of them.

BTN Europe: IATA is pro-aviation expansion and you laud passenger growth and airline performance. How do you balance that with the urgent need decarbonise? That’s a difficult balancing act.

Michael Schneider: Absolutely right. In the big scheme of things we certainly contribute to global emissions – around 2.5 to 2.7 per cent – but if we want a licence to grow we must have concrete plans [to decarbonise]. Those plans are reflected in the roadmaps we have in place about what we think the solutions are.

But we should not lose sight of the benefits of aviation. There are 100 million jobs indirectly linked to the industry – it’s the guy who drives people to the airport or the small shop at the airport. It’s also small island states and countries that rely on tourism. It’s critical for them and it delivers huge value, but of course we must reduce our impact.

I love aviation and fully understand its impact and how in particular the younger generation might be concerned about flying, but they get value [from it] – it allows them to study abroad, to visit other places. No other sector delivers those benefits. It’s easy to say we should just stop flying but that would have such a huge impact on this world. It is a humongous task that we have in front of us but I’m still hopeful we can reach our targets and reduce emissions as planned by 2050.

BTN Europe: You alluded to it earlier, but will the cost of SAF and of sustainability efforts in general, get passed down to passengers in the form of higher fares?

Michael Schneider: Airlines have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – an effort that is expected to cost $4.7 trillion over the period 2024 from 2050. So yes, this is likely to impact airfares. However, this investment will ensure that aviation can deliver its direct contribution of 3.9 per cent of global GDP and 86.5 million jobs globally while addressing its estimated 2.5 per cent share of global carbon emissions.*

BTN Europe: Some governments are clamping down on domestic flights where rail services exist. Do you agree that makes good sense for the environment?

Michael Schneider: Multimodality is important and could be part of the answer but it is a very European discussion as we have a very well-developed train network. In the European context, there are opportunities that could be explored – for anything below 500km I think it makes sense to rely on what’s there [in terms of rail infrastructure]. We all need to work together where it makes sense.

BTN Europe: Every so often we see talk of frequent flyer taxes or, most recently, a premium flyer tax, where funds raised could be invested in sustainability initiatives. What are your thoughts on those?

Michael Schneider: The Global Solidarity Levies Task Force’s (GSLTF) proposal disregards the role of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which was agreed through the International Civil Aviation Organization and is the world’s first globally agreed mechanism to manage carbon emissions from an industrial sector – in this case international aviation.

In addition, the GSLTF has not released any assessment of the impact that such a levy would have on the economies of the very states to which it aims to funnel the funds, or the broader impact it will have on all travellers. It has also not detailed how such funds would be used. *

Robson Freitas has developed and led the BH Airport plan for the resumption of airport operations post-COVID-19, as well as being responsible for leading the group of Directors and Managers at the airport, defining the three main pillars of recovery: Health and Safety of People, Institutional and Integrated Communication and Institutional Partners. These central pillars include ensuring hygiene and health and social distances measures for passengers, users, and the airport community, in addition to participating in strategic committees involving the public sectors to comply with regulatory rules. Freitas developed the COVID guardians programme, who were responsible in monitoring and following up on the measures already implemented for COVID-19 and advising users, employees and other people on compliance with distancing, hygiene and health measures recommended by health authorities. He also developed a COVID booklet with information and guidance for the airport community regarding good hygiene and health practices and led the beginning of the publication of a monthly newsletter with passenger curve information, allowing the planning of reopening and rehiring by commercial stores. Freitas also supported the reduction of OPEX by planning the temporary closure of areas, toilets and equipment in common use and internalising some activities.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

With over three decades at Zurich Airport, Emanuel Fleuti has witnessed the evolution of sustainability from a fringe concern to a core strategic pillar. As the airport’s long-serving environmental lead, he brings continuity, context and conviction to Zurich’s decarbonisation journey. He shares more with Holly Miles.

Zurich Airport’s (ZHR) environmental strategy centres on eliminating unnecessary combustion processes across the airfield. “We have fixed ground power and pre-conditioned air for aircraft, and we have battery-powered GSE and vehicles to reduce the combustion emissions,” says Emmanuel.

One of Zurich’s boldest moves, however, dates back to the mid 1990s, when it introduced an emission-related landing fee. “Aircraft that did not have the latest engine technology had to pay more on a surcharge,” he explains. “That motivated not just the airlines, but also the engine manufacturers to redesign engines and come up with cleaner technologies.”

This was a progressive move back then, as the idea of polluter-pays pricing was not widespread in aviation at the time.

“That was probably the most important initiative we took in addition to mandating the use of our TCA and 400 hertz systems that we have, which meant in return, a restriction on the use of auxiliary power units. “

While in the beginning around 50% of airlines were paying an additional surcharge, now most aircraft meet modern standards, however the principle remains. “Even the most modern aircraft still emit, so they still have to pay a little bit.”

Driving the energy transition

Zurich has committed to a master plan for energy and infrastructure decarbonisation, focusing on both consumption and production. “First, we reduce energy use on the consumer side with appliances, infrastructure, heating and cooling demand. Then we improve production with renewable energy,” says Emmanuel. “We’re switching to geothermal ground heat with heat pumps and photovoltaic plants to produce electricity.”

As of 2025, the airport is purchasing 100% renewable electricity. On the heat side, around 20% is currently sourced from renewables, with plans for continued expansion.

Crucially, Emmanuel says the economics make sense. “The upfront initial costs are going into changing fossil energy production to geothermal or heat pumps. But over time, we’ll save energy on the operational side.”

Backing breakthrough fuels

With long-haul aircraft dominating Zurich’s traffic profile, Emmanuel is realistic about the limitations of electrification and hydrogen at his airport. Instead, Zurich Airport is taking a pioneering role in backing breakthrough technologies such as solar fuels.

“We think that sustainable aviation fuels will be key for the airport’s decarbonisation. Long-haul aircraft can only fly with drop-in fuels such as SAF.”

“We are supporting the new solar-to-liquid technology. It’s a start-up company here in Switzerland,” he says. “In the new plant, Jet A1 aviation kerosene will be produced, but also diesel for trucks and petrol for cars. We’ve gone into an offtake agreement to take some of the diesel.”

Zurich is taking a multi-pronged approach to Scope 3 emissions, from electrifying handling equipment to influencing staff travel habits.

“We are looking at ground handlers: how can we support them in their electrification process? How can we provide electric charging stations?” Emanuel says. On the staff side, Zurich offers public transport passes and encourages home working where feasible.

“Of course, not all jobs are suitable,” he acknowledges. “But if someone only commutes to work by car four days instead of five, that’s a 20% reduction.”

Electrifying the fleet

At the end of 2024, Zurich put its first electrically powered waste collection vehicle into operation. Zurich has a roadmap to reach net zero for its vehicle fleet by 2040. But it’s not always straightforward.

“We cannot accelerate this too fast because the technology has to evolve first. The main obstacle is the availability of the required vehicle types,” says Emanuel. “We’ve started with electric trucks, but snowploughs, for example, may need much longer endurance than what batteries can hold. So, we can only go as fast as suppliers can provide this technology, as it is not off-the-shelf. That’s why we’re also going into synthetic diesel to power those vehicles that cannot run on battery.”

Designing for the future

The airport is also preparing for the realities of climate change.

“Futureproofing for us is thinking ahead in longer terms, in 15 to 25 years,” says Emanuel. “It is about climate change, biodiversity and energy usage. Do we have enough sunlight? Yes, we do. Do we have enough technology to use it? No, we don’t. We need to bridge that gap.”

A pragmatic sustainability model

Zurich Airport offers a model of sustainability grounded in long-term thinking, pragmatism and measurable results.

Mit einer Verbesserung von 27,1 Prozent steht auf Platz zwei die Verbindung zwischen Belo Horizonte-Confins und Ilhéus von Azul.","Die schlechte Nachricht vorweg: Am 18. Juli 2025 hat die weltweite Passagierluftfahrt einen absoluten Rekordwert beim CO₂-Ausstoß erreicht. Mit 2523 Tonnen Kohlenstoffdioxid lag der Wert knapp über den 2520 Tonnen vom 2. August 2019. Allerdings waren dafür aktuell 103.009 Flüge verantwortlich, während es damals 99.327 waren. Sprich: Im Durchschnitt ist jeder einzelne Flug weniger klimaschädlich, aber es gibt fast vier Prozent mehr Flüge. Das zeigen Daten des Luftfahrt-Analyse-Anbieters Cirium.

Und der hat auch die Airlines unter die Lupe genommen. Er wählte als Einheit den CO₂-Ausstoß geteilt durch die angebotenen Sitzplatzkilometer (im Englischen Available Seat Kilometers, kurz ASK). Der wird berechnet, indem man die Zahl der verfügbaren Sitze mit den zurückgelegten Kilometern multipliziert.

Wizz Air lässt alle anderen Fluggesellschaften hinter sich

Das Ergebnis: Wizz Air erreichte im Jahr 2024 einen Wert von 53,9 Gramm CO₂ pro Sitzplatzkilometer - und ist damit die weltweite Nummer eins mit dem niedrigsten Wert von 100 untersuchten Fluglinien. Das erreichte der ungarische Billigflieger 222 Sitzen pro Flugzeug, einem Flottenalter von 5,1 Jahren und einer Streckenlänge von 1551 Kilometern, alles im Durchschnitt (siehe auch Tabelle).

Den globalen Platz zwei nimmt Frontier Airlines aus den USA ein mit 54,4 Gramm CO₂/ASK, Rang drei sichert sich die türkische Pegasus mit 57,1 Gramm. Auf Platz 20 in der Gesamtwertung liegt Ryanair mit 63,0 Gramm. Unter den zehn größten Airlines der Welt (gemessen nach Sitzplatzkilometer) erzielt die irische Airline damit sogar den besten Wert, gefolgt von Southwest Airlines (68,9) und Delta Air Lines (74,4).

Wichtigster Faktor: dichte Bestuhlung des Flugzeugs

Im regionalen Ranking für Westeuropa platziert sich auf Rang zwei hinter Wizz Air die portugiesische Azores Airlines (61,4). Auf Platz drei folgt die griechische Aegean (61,6).

Die Verwendung von nachhaltigem Flugkraftstoff, im Jargon SAF (die Abkürzung steht für Sustainable Aviation Fuel) genannt, hat Cirium in der Analyse noch nicht berücksichtigt. Das Analyseunternehmen verweist darauf, dass die derzeitige SAF-Produktion erst 0,53 Prozent des weltweiten Kraftstoffbedarfs abdeckt. «Die umweltfreundlichsten Fluggesellschaften sind womöglich diejenigen, die mutig genug sind, die Anzahl der Passagiere in einem Flugzeug zu überdenken», so Mike Malik von Cirium. Neben dem Faktor der dichten Bestuhlung sei das Flottenalter wichtig sowie die Flugplan- und Streckenplanung.

Ein Airbus A330-900 mit 459 Plätzen ist Spitzenreiter

Bei der Betrachtung einzelner Flugzeugmodelle von einzelnen Fluglinien ist auch ein neues Modell mit einer dichten Bestuhlung ganz vorn: der Airbus A330-900 von Cebu Pacific mit einer reinen Economy-Class-Bestuhlung mit 459 Plätzen. Es folgen mit der Boeing 787-8 von Jetstar und der Boeing 787-9 von Scoot zwei weitere neue Modelle. Dahinter platzieren sich aber auch etliche ältere Modelle wie beispielsweise der Airbus A319 von Allegiant Air. Diesen Teil der Untersuchung hat Cirium mit Daten aus der ersten Jahreshälfte 2025 durchgeführt.

Einen Punkt nennt Cirium nicht explizit, obwohl er in einer der Ranglisten eine wichtige Rolle spielt: die geringere Umweltbelastung von Turbopropantrieben gegenüber Jettriebwerken. Denn es gibt auch eine Analyse für einzelne Routen, aufgeteilt in Kurz-, Mittel- und Langstrecken. Dabei geht es um die größten Verbesserungen von 2023 auf 2024.

Austrian Airlines auf Platz eins - dank ATR 72 von Braathens

Und bei den Kurzstrecken auf Platz eins liegt die Austrian-Airlines-Route zwischen Wien und Klagenfurt. Ihr CO₂ pro Sitzplatzkilometer-Wert ist um 29,7 Prozent gesunken. Statt den eigenen Embraer E195 setzt die Lufthansa-Tochter auf der Strecke mittlerweile nämlich die ATR 72 von Braathens ein.

Mit einer Verbesserung von 27,1 Prozent steht auf Platz zwei die Verbindung zwischen Belo Horizonte-Confins und Ilhéus von Azul.

Takeaway:

(CTAS) faces a weak technical outlook amid mixed analyst views and solid fundamentals. Investors are advised to proceed with caution.

News Highlights

Recent news affecting the broader market includes developments in the fuel ethanol industry, where new sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology is boosting commercial viability. This could indirectly benefit Cintas if demand for industrial services in energy and logistics grows. Additionally, a report highlights that assets in the ETF industry across Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) have hit a record high of $1.25 trillion. While not directly tied to Cintas, this reflects increased market participation and liquidity that may influence investor sentiment.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The market is divided when it comes to Cintas. The simple average analyst rating is 3.00, while the weighted rating—factoring in historical performance—is 4.30. These scores suggest a generally neutral to optimistic view, though the current price trend is negative (-3.65%), creating a mismatch between analyst expectations and actual price movement.

Return on Assets (ROA): 4.79%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Net Income / Revenue: 55.86%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Return on Equity (ROE): 10.45%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Net Profit Margin (NPM): 17.51%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

Diluted Earnings Per Share (YoY): 19.67%, internal diagnostic score 7.33

The strong fundamentals suggest Cintas is performing well on operational and earnings metrics, but technical indicators remain bearish. Investors should watch for alignment or divergence between these two signals in the coming weeks.

Money-Flow Trends

Fund flows into Cintas show a complex picture. While overall inflow ratio is 55.90% (a positive sign), the breakdown reveals that small investors are net sellers (trend: negative). In contrast, large and extra-large investors are net buyers, with block inflow ratio at 56.65% and extra-large inflow ratio at 62.30%. This suggests institutional confidence in the stock despite retail caution.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Cintas is struggling. The technical score is 3.94, indicating a weak signal with a bearish bias. Here’s how the key indicators stack up:

Williams %R (WR) Oversold: Internal diagnostic score 3.73 — suggesting a neutral rise with mixed historical returns.

Bearish Engulfing: Internal diagnostic score 1.47 — a strong bearish signal with a 36.36% win rate.

RSI Oversold: Internal diagnostic score 6.62 — neutral with a better track record than WR.

In the last five days, the Bearish Engulfing and WR Oversold patterns appeared most frequently. These signals confirm a dominant bearish trend (2 bearish vs 0 bullish indicators). Investors should be cautious about short-term volatility and consider avoiding or hedging long positions until a clearer trend emerges.

Vietnam’s low labor costs, ongoing shifts in the global aviation supply chain, and the rise of green aviation technology, sustainable fuels, and workforce training offer strategic advantages.
""Vietnam needs to define its aviation industry and short-term development strategies, while forming aviation and logistics centers,"" he said.","At the roundtable conference “From Aspiration to Opportunity in Developing the Aviation Industry” held last week at the National Exhibition Center, Tran Hai Dang, CEO of Aviation Engineering Services Corporation (AESC), said Vietnam possesses significant advantages - strategic location, skilled technical labor, and an attractive investment climate - that position it well for deeper integration into the global aviation supply chain.

Despite this, Dang admitted Vietnam’s role in the aviation industry remains ""modest and unclear."" While a few domestic companies have started manufacturing airframe components and conducting engine testing, their output is minimal and insufficient to build a complete aviation ecosystem.

Currently, only about five Vietnamese companies are producing limited airframe parts. In engine manufacturing, only an initial testing program exists. And in vital sectors such as aviation electronics, materials, rubber, or specialized coatings, Vietnamese firms are nearly absent.

More critically, Dang pointed out that Vietnam lacks a unified national program for aircraft development. Only scattered initiatives exist, without a cohesive strategy. ""We must acknowledge that the country still doesn’t have a comprehensive plan for building a real aviation industry,"" he emphasized.

Lagging in MRO and infrastructure

In aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO), Vietnam has only two key facilities - Vietnam Airlines and AESC. Other players remain small-scale, operating without the infrastructure or credentials required for true MRO status. These were market-driven developments rather than the result of national planning.

Dang noted that Vietnam's industry continues to focus heavily on basic manufacturing, neglecting infrastructure and technology investment. Without change, Vietnam will remain stuck in low-value segments and be unable to join the global supply chain.

One stark example: Vietnam cannot yet produce a bolt worth $100 used on commercial aircraft wheels - a component that could feasibly be manufactured with a $3–4 million USD investment in facilities. “It’s not about capability - it’s about commitment,” Dang said.

Certification remains a major barrier

To participate meaningfully in global aviation, Vietnamese companies need certification from major regulatory bodies, including IATA, FAA (US), EASA (Europe), and AS9100. However, Dang cautioned that securing such credentials is costly, time-consuming, and offers uncertain returns on investment.

He proposed a collaborative ecosystem, where domestic aviation businesses pool resources, share certifications, and avoid redundant competition. ""We need a national aircraft development program with a core nucleus and a satellite network of supporting enterprises,"" he urged.

The call for an aviation industry blueprint

Uong Viet Dung, Director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, noted that Vietnam now has 14 commercial and specialized airlines operating 254 aircraft. This figure is projected to reach 400 modern planes by 2030. Vietnam’s aviation network includes 52 domestic routes and 211 international routes, fueling robust demand and creating opportunities for local manufacturing and supply.

Vietnam’s low labor costs, ongoing shifts in the global aviation supply chain, and the rise of green aviation technology, sustainable fuels, and workforce training offer strategic advantages. According to Dung, these can support Vietnam in becoming a major aviation hub in the region.

""Vietnam needs to define its aviation industry and short-term development strategies, while forming aviation and logistics centers,"" he said. ""We should aim to integrate into global OEMs like Boeing and Airbus, and one day, realize the dream of a 'Made-in-Vietnam' aircraft.""

National innovation agency calls for coordinated action

A representative from the National Innovation Center (NIC) emphasized the need for a comprehensive aerospace industry strategy, including improved coordination between government agencies and businesses, and greater investment in R&D and infrastructure.

Other proposals included:

Developing incentive policies to attract investment

Deloitte Nederland heeft over het boekjaar 2024/2025 een omzet gerealiseerd van € 1,41 miljard, een groei van 1,2 procent ten opzichte van het voorgaande boekjaar. Door strikter kostenbeheer en operationele efficiëntie kwam het operationeel resultaat ruim 15 procent hoger uit op € 202,1 miljoen, tegenover € 175,3 miljoen in 2023/2024. Het aantal medewerkers daalde tegelijk van 8.200 naar 7.700.

Dat blijkt uit het Integrated Annual Report van Deloitte Nederland. Volgens ceo Hans Honig is ervoor gekozen om ""strikt op kostenreductie te sturen"" en tegelijk te investeren in innovatie, technologie en talent. ""Zo breidden we het gebruik van ons mondiale technologie platformen voor al onze business lines uit en zetten we vol door in gebruik van AI oplossingen in onze dienstverlening."" Deloitte ziet klantvragen steeds meer verschuiven naar ""complete technologisch gedreven business transformaties"".

Examenfraude

Het interne onderzoek naar examenfraude, door Deloitte omschreven als ""het delen van antwoorden voor verplichte leeractiviteiten en de leercultuur"", is afgelopen boekjaar afgesloten met een schikking bij de PCAOB. In juni jl. werd bekend dat Deloitte de Amerikaanse toezichthouder een bedrag heeft betaald van drie miljoen dollar.

""De uitkomsten van het onderzoek naar onze leercultuur waren teleurstellend en weerspiegelen niet wie wij zijn als organisatie en de waarden die wij nastreven."" aldus Honig. ""Met het afronden van het onderzoek en de schikking kunnen we onze aandacht richten op verdere verbeteringen, het onderstreept onze inzet om het vertrouwen van onze klanten en andere stakeholders te versterken.""

Voetafdruk

Deloitte Nederland verkleinde naar eigen zeggen haar CO₂-voetafdruk met 13 procent (marktgebaseerd). Doel is om eind 2025 een volledig electrisch leasewagenpark te hebben.

Topic: Interior of the earth

Q1. Plate boundaries are theatres of both catastrophe and creation. How do they simultaneously account for the destructive forces of earthquakes and the constructive potential of volcanic landscapes? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: InsightsIAS

Why the question

To test conceptual clarity on plate tectonics, their paradoxical role in shaping the earth’s surface, and the ability to link hazards like earthquakes with constructive features like fertile soils and volcanic landforms.

Key Demand of the question

The answer must evaluate how plate boundaries embody both destruction and creation, and explain with examples how they account for the dual realities of earthquakes and volcanic landscapes.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Define plate boundaries as dynamic zones of tectonic activity that represent both risk and renewal.

Body

Plate boundaries as paradoxical theatres – explain their dual role with geological processes and settlement patterns.

Destructive forces of earthquakes – highlight mechanisms, impacts, and examples of boundary-linked seismicity.

Constructive potential of volcanic landscapes – show fertility, resources, energy, and socio-economic benefits linked to volcanism.

Conclusion

End with the duality of plate boundaries as both threats and opportunities, stressing disaster resilience and sustainable use.

Introduction

Plate boundaries are the most active zones of lithospheric interaction, where immense tectonic forces unleash catastrophic disasters yet simultaneously build fertile and resource-rich landscapes. They reveal the paradox of nature as both a destroyer and a creator of human opportunities.

Body

Plate boundaries as theatres of both catastrophe and creation

Dynamic tectonic activity: Boundaries are hotspots for mountain building, ocean trench formation, volcanism, and seismicity, combining destructive and creative processes in the same space.

Eg: The Himalayas, created by the collision of Indian and Eurasian plates, exemplify majestic uplift but also host devastating quakes like Nepal 2015.

Redistribution of resources and hazards: Magmatic activity enriches land with minerals, soils, and geothermal energy, even as seismic instability threatens long-term human settlements.

Eg: Pacific Ring of Fire, with its vast gold–copper deposits, is simultaneously the site of 90% of global earthquakes.

Continuous reshaping of landscapes: Divergent and convergent boundaries constantly create new islands, rift valleys, and trenches, but such changes often come with destructive hazards.

Eg: East African Rift Valley is splitting Africa and forming a proto-ocean, yet recurrent tremors displace local communities.

Human–environment paradox: Rich resources and fertile soils attract dense populations to these boundaries despite recurrent natural calamities.

Eg: Java island, Indonesia, sustains over 140 million people due to fertile volcanic soils but also faces eruptions like Mount Merapi in 2010.

Destructive forces of earthquakes

Sudden crustal rupture: Stress accumulation along convergent and transform boundaries results in massive quakes that cause widespread casualties and destruction.

Eg: 2015 Nepal earthquake (M 7.8) killed over 8,000 people and destroyed heritage structures like Kathmandu Durbar Square.

Megathrust subduction events: Oceanic plates diving beneath continental margins generate tsunamigenic earthquakes of unprecedented scale.

Eg: 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake (M 9.1) triggered the Indian Ocean tsunami, killing 230,000 across 14 countries.

Urban vulnerability and poor preparedness: High population density and weak construction norms at plate boundaries magnify disaster impacts.

Eg: 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake caused more than 50,000 deaths largely due to collapsed buildings in urban centres.

Cascading multi-hazards: Earthquakes often trigger landslides, liquefaction, and technological disasters, compounding the destruction.

Eg: 2011 Tōhoku earthquake (M 9.0) not only caused a tsunami but also led to the Fukushima nuclear accident.

Constructive potential of volcanic landscapes

Fertile agricultural soils: Weathering of volcanic rocks releases minerals like potassium, magnesium, and iron, supporting intensive agriculture for centuries.

Eg: Deccan Plateau black soils continue to sustain cotton and soybean cultivation, contributing significantly to India’s farm economy.

Renewable geothermal energy: Heat from magma chambers beneath volcanic zones is harnessed to produce reliable, clean, and low-carbon electricity.

Eg: Iceland generates around 25% of its power from geothermal resources, reducing fossil fuel dependence.

Mineral and ore wealth: Volcanic processes bring up valuable metals and rare earths essential for modern industries and global supply chains.

Eg: Chile’s Andean volcanic belt accounts for nearly 28% of the world’s copper production, vital for renewable technologies.

Tourism and cultural heritage: Volcanic landscapes create iconic sites that draw tourism, sustain economies, and inspire cultural identity.

Eg: Mount Fuji, Japan, a UNESCO World Heritage site, generates billions annually through religious tourism and eco-tourism.

Conclusion

Plate boundaries embody the creative–destructive duality of Earth’s geology: they devastate societies through quakes yet enrich them through fertile soils, minerals, and energy. With disaster-resilient planning and sustainable resource use, humanity can convert these risky frontiers into engines of long-term prosperity.

Topic: Geomorphic Processes

Q2. Differentiate between endogenic and exogenic processes. Illustrate their combined impact in shaping Himalayan landforms. Analyse how climate change is altering these geomorphic processes today. (15 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: InsightsIAS

Why the question

Himalayan events such as the Joshimath subsidence and South Lhonak GLOF show how internal tectonics, external erosional forces, and climate change combine to shape fragile mountain landscapes.

Key demand of the question

The question asks to differentiate between endogenic and exogenic processes, illustrate their combined role in Himalayan landform development, and analyse the impact of climate change on these geomorphic processes.

Structure of the Answer

Introduction

Start with a brief line on the Himalayas being the youngest fold mountains formed by tectonics, yet constantly reshaped by external denudational forces, now increasingly altered by climate change.

Body

Define and contrast endogenic and exogenic processes, highlighting their forces, nature, and outcomes with suitable Himalayan examples.

Show how their interaction produces distinct Himalayan landforms such as river terraces, gorges, glacial valleys, and sediment transfer to the plains.

Analyse how climate change is intensifying geomorphic processes through glacial retreat, extreme rainfall, GLOFs, and permafrost thaw, using updated recent events.

Conclusion

Conclude with a crisp futuristic note on integrating geomorphic risk mapping and climate-adaptive planning into Himalayan development policies.

Introduction

The Himalayas stand as the most vivid testimony to the interaction of internal tectonic forces and external denudational forces. This makes them not just the tallest mountains but also the most fragile, where climate change has begun to accelerate geomorphic instability.

Body

Endogenic and exogenic processes

Aspect Endogenic processes Exogenic processes 1. Driving force Operate through internal heat and tectonic dynamics, causing mountain uplift, folding and volcanism.

Eg: The 2015 Nepal earthquake uplifted land surfaces, proving ongoing tectonic collision Operate through external agents like water, wind, and ice, wearing down relief and redistributing sediments.

Eg: The 2022 Alaknanda floods eroded slopes rapidly as reported by IIT Roorkee 2. Key landforms Create large-scale features such as fold mountains, faults, and volcanic arcs, altering earth’s crust.

Eg: USGS (2023) noted Himalayan uplift of 5 mm/yr due to Indian–Eurasian plate convergence Produce erosional and depositional landforms such as gorges, terraces, moraines, dunes.

Eg: The Bhagirathi gorge was carved by river incision over thousands of years 3. Timescale Work on long geological time spans, shaping continents and ocean basins.

Eg: Himalayan orogeny has continued for ~50 million years since the Eocene Function on shorter timescales, even seasonal, reshaping landforms more visibly.

Eg: Cloudburst-induced landslides in Himachal Pradesh in 2023 reshaped valleys overnight 4. Nature of impact Primarily constructive, adding elevation, creating relief, and forming new crust.

Eg: Ongoing crustal thickening beneath Nepal Himalaya adds height Primarily destructive, wearing down elevated surfaces and transporting debris.

Eg: Brahmaputra river floods erode banks and shift channels annually (CWC 2021) 5. Methods of study Studied via seismology, geodesy, paleomagnetism, and mantle modelling.

Eg: GPS monitoring in Uttarakhand (WIHG 2022) mapped tectonic strain zones Studied via hydrology, geomorphology, satellite imagery, and climate data.

Eg: ISRO (2021) tracked Himalayan glacier retreat using remote sensing

Combined impact in shaping Himalayan landforms

Steep slopes and slope failure: Continuous tectonic uplift combined with intense erosion produces fragile, over-steepened slopes highly prone to mass wasting.

Eg: Joshimath land subsidence in 2023 demonstrated how uplift plus unregulated drainage destabilised hill slopes.

River terraces and valley incision: Uplifted blocks are cut by Himalayan rivers into stepped terraces, marking interaction of endogenics and fluvial incision.

Eg: Teesta valley terraces in Sikkim show alternating phases of uplift and incision.

Glacio-fluvial landscapes: Endogenic elevation sustains high snowlines while glaciers and rivers carve cirques, moraines, and outwash plains.

Eg: Retreating Gangotri glacier has left morainic ridges and expanding pro-glacial lakes.

Sediment flux to plains: High uplift accelerates erosion, delivering enormous sediment to the Indo-Gangetic plain, enriching soils but also causing instability.

Eg: Brahmaputra’s sediment load ~735 million tonnes annually (CWC 2021) sustains fertile Assam plains but raises flood risks.

Drainage anomalies: Structural control due to uplift forces rivers to cut through ranges, while exogenics modify flow regimes.

Eg: Indus river cutting gorges across Ladakh ranges reflects tectonic uplift modified by glacial-melt erosion.

Impact of climate change on geomorphic processes

Accelerated glacier retreat: Warming reduces glacier mass balance, enhancing moraine collapse and destabilising slopes.

Eg: IPCC AR6 (2021) warned Himalayan glaciers could lose up to 80% volume by 2100, amplifying hazards.

Extreme monsoon erosion: Intensified rainfall increases soil stripping, landslides, and river channel migration.

Eg: 2023 Himachal floods triggered hundreds of landslides, destroying roads and altering river courses.

Permafrost degradation: High-altitude warming thaws frozen ground, releasing rock and debris flows.

Eg: WIHG 2022 study linked Karakoram slope failures to permafrost thawing.

Glacial lake outburst floods: Retreating glaciers create unstable moraine-dammed lakes prone to catastrophic bursts.

Eg: South Lhonak lake GLOF in Sikkim (2023) devastated Teesta valley infrastructure.

Human-climate interaction: Infrastructure projects in fragile terrain amplify climate impacts on geomorphic stability.

Eg: Char Dham highway expansion deepened cracks and landslides during the 2021–22 monsoon season in Uttarakhand.

Conclusion

The Himalayas are shaped by the push of tectonics, the pull of erosion, and the pressure of climate change. A sustainable way forward lies in geomorphic risk mapping, climate-adaptive planning, and resilient infrastructure, balancing development with mountain stability.

Topic: Issues and challenges pertaining to the federal structure, devolution of powers

Q3. “Extending Sixth Schedule to Ladakh may set a precedent for other regions demanding special autonomy”. Do you agree? Substantiate with examples from other tribal autonomy experiments in India. (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: NIE

Why the question

The issue of Ladakh’s demand for Sixth Schedule status has revived debates on asymmetric federalism and its ripple effect on other regions. It links to ongoing questions of tribal autonomy, constitutional design, and Centre–State dynamics.

Key Demand of the question

The question asks you to critically analyse whether granting Sixth Schedule status to Ladakh could become a precedent for other regions, and to substantiate both sides using examples from other tribal autonomy experiments in India.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Start with the idea of India’s asymmetric federalism and how Sixth Schedule was crafted to protect tribal autonomy in the North-East. Mention its relevance to Ladakh.

Body

Arguments why Ladakh extension may set precedent – reference to doctrinal spillover, political bargaining, and examples from Bodoland, Tripura, Meghalaya.

Counter-arguments why precedent fears are overstated – uniqueness of Sixth Schedule, availability of alternatives like PESA/Article 371, and case studies such as Darjeeling Bill withdrawal.

Conclusion

End with a balanced note: while it may become a political reference point, extension will remain selective, contextual, and criteria-based to preserve unity in diversity.

Introduction

India’s federal system embodies asymmetrical arrangements to accommodate diversity, from the Sixth Schedule for the North-East to Article 371 special provisions for frontier states. Any extension of such status to Ladakh is bound to influence debates on autonomy in other regions.

Body

Why it may set a precedent

Doctrinal spillover under Article 244(2): Extending the Sixth Schedule to Ladakh could legitimise demands by other regions seeking legislative and judicial autonomy through Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).

Eg: The Bodoland Territorial Region (2020 Accord) expanded Sixth Schedule powers, setting a precedent for other tribal belts.

Frontier governance template: Success in Ladakh may push other sensitive border regions to claim similar cultural-ecological autonomy.

Eg: Khasi, Garo and Jaintia ADCs (Meghalaya) protect land and forests; tribal groups in Himachal and Uttarakhand may cite this precedent.

Electoral bargaining benchmark: Political parties may cite Ladakh as proof that persistent agitation yields autonomy gains, fuelling fresh movements.

Eg: Tripura’s TTAADC elections repeatedly invoke the powers enjoyed by BTC/BTR to demand enhanced status.

Judicial reinforcement of tribal rights: Supreme Court rulings have favoured stronger protection for tribal land and culture, making Sixth Schedule extension attractive elsewhere.

Eg: Samatha case (1997) and Niyamgiri judgment (2013) upheld tribal land rights and Gram Sabha consent, emboldening autonomy demands.

Financial empowerment of ADCs: Sixth Schedule recognition ensures Finance Commission grants and special Union transfers, incentivising replication.

Eg: 15th Finance Commission allocated funds directly to ADCs in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura.

Why precedent fears are overstated

Sixth Schedule’s unique design: It was crafted specifically for North-Eastern tribes with codified customary laws, not easily replicable elsewhere.

Eg: Mizoram’s Lai, Mara, Chakma ADCs evolved from entrenched tribal institutions; most other regions lack such traditions.

Alternative autonomy mechanisms: Fifth Schedule, PESA 1996, and Article 371 provisions offer tailored protections without invoking the Sixth Schedule.

Eg: Gorkhaland GTA (West Bengal) and Manipur Hill Areas Committee function outside Sixth Schedule.

Parliamentary and political gatekeeping: Any extension requires constitutional amendment and consensus, preventing mechanical replication.

Eg: The 2007 Darjeeling Sixth Schedule Bill was withdrawn due to stakeholder opposition.

Judicial scrutiny of proportionality: Courts ensure autonomy does not dilute the basic structure of federalism, limiting overextension.

Eg: S.R. Bommai (1994) upheld balanced federalism, warning against structural overreach.

Security–governance calibration: The Union tailors autonomy to specific contexts like insurgency, demography, or ecology.

Eg: Nagaland (Art 371A) and Mizoram (Art 371G) safeguard tribal customs without Sixth Schedule expansion.

Conclusion

While Ladakh’s inclusion could serve as a political precedent, constitutional design, parliamentary scrutiny, and available graded alternatives ensure that diffusion remains selective, contextual, and criteria-driven. The challenge is to balance autonomy with national cohesion, ensuring asymmetry strengthens, not fragments, Indian federalism.

Body

India–EU FTA as a test of strategic alignment

Strategic trust-building: A successful FTA signals mutual trust in sensitive areas like data flows and IP protection.

Eg: EU GDPR compliance negotiations have been linked to India’s IT sector exports.

Political signalling: Aligning with the EU showcases India’s willingness to work with liberal democracies amid global polarisation.

Eg: EU Parliament’s support for India–EU ties post-G20 Delhi Summit 2023 demonstrated political convergence.

Balancing China: The FTA offers India an alternative to China-dominated supply chains, enhancing strategic positioning.

Eg: EU shifted textile and pharma sourcing towards India after supply chain shocks during COVID-19.

Security linkages: Trade integration strengthens broader cooperation in defence, counter-terrorism, and maritime security.

Eg: India–Italy Defence Roadmap 2024–28 includes joint naval exercises in the Indo-Pacific.

Climate and sustainability convergence: EU’s emphasis on green economy standards aligns with India’s renewable and net-zero goals.

Eg: EU Green Deal and India’s National Hydrogen Mission (2021) found common ground in clean tech.

Broader implications for India’s global trade strategy

Market diversification: Expands access to high-value EU markets, reducing India’s reliance on the US and Asian partners.

Eg: EU accounted for €120 billion trade with India in 2024, growing at 15% YoY.

Standards leadership: Forces India to align with stringent EU norms in digital, environmental, and labour domains, giving global competitiveness.

Eg: Compliance with EU CBAM (2026) will reshape India’s steel and aluminium exports.

Investment boost: EU FDI can fuel India’s advanced sectors such as EVs, AI, biotech, and defence manufacturing.

Eg: Italy’s Leonardo group announced aerospace investment in India.

Rule-shaping capacity: Positions India as a rule-maker in WTO 2.0 debates on e-commerce and sustainability.

Eg: India and EU jointly submitted proposals in WTO 13th Ministerial.

Strategic autonomy reinforcement: Enhances India’s space to balance relations with US, Russia, and Global South by securing a strong European pillar.

Eg: India’s Voice of Global South Summit (2023) showcased neutrality while EU ties deepened.

Conclusion

The India–EU FTA is both a litmus test of trust with Europe and a gateway for India to shape global trade rules. Its success could redefine India’s journey from being a reactive trading nation to a proactive strategic economic power.

Q5. “Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms.” Examine the challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system. Discuss how farmer cooperatives and Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) can strengthen the value chain. (15 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: TH

Why the question

Horticulture now surpasses food grain production in India, yet post-harvest losses and weak marketing reduce farmer gains. Current policy shifts emphasise value chain development, making marketing reforms.

Key Demand of the question

The question requires you to establish the importance of marketing reforms vis-à-vis production, identify the challenges in horticultural marketing, and then highlight how farmer cooperatives and FPOs can provide systemic solutions.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Begin with India’s horticultural achievements and the paradox of high output but low farmer income due to marketing inefficiencies.

Body –

Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms: Link to farmer income stability, price discovery, and global competitiveness.

Challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system: Infrastructure gaps, fragmented value chains, regulatory hurdles, grading/quality issues, and financial constraints.

Role of cooperatives and FPOs: Aggregation for bargaining power, collective infrastructure management, direct linkages to markets and exports, branding, and access to institutional finance.

Conclusion

End with the need for a holistic horticulture policy where production, post-harvest management, and marketing move in tandem to ensure inclusive farmer prosperity.

Introduction

India is the world’s second-largest producer of fruits and vegetables, yet post-harvest losses are estimated at ₹50,000 crore annually (NITI Aayog 2023) due to weak marketing and storage. Without robust marketing reforms, production growth cannot translate into farmer income security or consumer affordability.

Body

Marketing reforms in horticulture are as crucial as production reforms

Linking surplus to demand: Production gains are futile without channels to reach markets efficiently.

Eg: National Horticulture Board data (2023) shows 25–30% losses in perishables due to marketing bottlenecks.

Price discovery and fair returns: Marketing reforms ensure transparent markets through digital platforms, reducing distress sales.

Eg: e-NAM (2016) integrated over 1,300 mandis for horticultural produce.

Stability against volatility: Reforms like contract farming and futures trading help hedge risks in price-sensitive horticultural crops.

Eg: Model APMC Act (2017) recommended direct marketing and electronic trading.

Export competitiveness: Global markets demand quality and supply consistency, which requires integrated logistics and certification systems.

Eg: India’s mango exports rose after adoption of irradiation and cold-chain compliance (APEDA report, 2022).

Reducing middlemen exploitation: Strengthening marketing reforms reduces farmer dependence on commission agents.

Eg: Swaminathan Commission (2006) emphasised linking farmers directly to consumers.

Challenges in India’s horticultural marketing system

Infrastructure deficit: Lack of packhouses, cold chains, and reefer vans increases wastage and reduces quality.

Eg: ICAR (2022) notes only 10% of perishables use cold chain facilities.

Fragmented value chains: Smallholders face high transaction costs and weak bargaining power.

Eg: Dalwai Committee on Doubling Farmers’ Income (2018) flagged market fragmentation as a key hurdle.

APMC restrictions: State-level regulations often limit farmers’ ability to sell directly outside mandis.

Eg: Punjab’s horticulture farmers face restrictions in accessing markets beyond APMC yards.

Quality and grading gaps: Lack of standardisation reduces competitiveness in both domestic and export markets.

Eg: FAO (2021) highlighted poor adoption of AGMARK standards in fruits and vegetables.

Limited access to credit and insurance: Marketing investments require credit support, which many farmers lack.

Eg: RBI Report (2023) shows only 16% of horticulture farmers accessed formal credit for marketing infrastructure.

Role of farmer cooperatives and FPOs in strengthening the value chain

Collective bargaining power: Aggregation helps farmers negotiate better prices and reduce exploitation by intermediaries.

Eg: AMUL dairy cooperative model shows how aggregation can transform farmer incomes.

Efficient post-harvest management: FPOs can manage packhouses, grading, cold storage, and logistics collectively.

Eg: Sahyadri FPC in Maharashtra runs India’s largest farmer-led grape export operation.

Market linkages and branding: Cooperatives can establish direct retail chains and export contracts.

Eg: HOPCOMS in Karnataka supplies fresh produce directly to consumers in urban areas.

Capacity building and training: FPOs provide extension services and training in quality, grading, and packaging.

Eg: SFAC-supported FPOs have trained farmers in residue-free vegetable cultivation.

Financial inclusion and investment mobilisation: Cooperatives and FPOs enable access to institutional credit and attract private partnerships.

Eg: 10,000 FPO Scheme (2020) launched by GoI to provide equity grants and credit guarantee.

Conclusion

Without marketing reforms, horticultural growth risks being a surplus trap rather than a prosperity engine. Empowered cooperatives and FPOs can bridge the missing link by integrating farmers into value chains, reducing losses, and enhancing global competitiveness, making Indian horticulture both profitable and sustainable.

Topic: Conservation, environmental pollution

Q6. What are the pollution challenges associated with India’s expanding aviation sector? How effective can sustainable aviation fuel policy be in addressing them? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: DTE

Why the question

Aviation emissions are rising sharply in India, and a national SAF policy is being framed to address both climate and pollution concerns.

Key demand of the question

The candidate must identify the pollution challenges of the aviation sector and then critically evaluate the effectiveness of SAF policy in addressing them.

Structure of the Answer

Introduction

Give a brief context on India’s aviation growth and its link to rising emissions, with reference to Net Zero 2070.

Body

Pollution challenges: Mention carbon emissions, non-CO₂ pollutants, contrails, local air quality concerns, and health impacts.

Effectiveness of SAF policy: Highlight its emission reduction potential, alignment with CORSIA, energy diversification, policy synergies, and trade/export prospects.

Conclusion

Close with a forward-looking line on SAF being a transitional but crucial pathway to green aviation leadership for India.

Introduction

Aviation, though a fast-growing sector in India, contributes disproportionately to GHG emissions and local air pollution, making it a critical area for climate policy intervention.

Body

Pollution challenges of aviation sector

Carbon emissions: Aviation is responsible for around 2-3% of India’s total CO₂ emissions and growing rapidly with passenger demand.

Eg: DGCA report 2023 shows India’s aviation emissions grew by nearly 30% over five years.

Non-CO₂ pollutants: Aircraft release NOx, SOx, and particulate matter, worsening air quality around airports.

Eg: IIT Kanpur 2022 study found elevated PM2.5 levels around Delhi airport due to aviation activity.

High climate forcing: Contrails and water vapour increase radiative forcing, amplifying aviation’s climate impact beyond CO₂.

Eg: IPCC AR6 (2021) highlights non-CO₂ impacts as nearly double the warming effect of CO₂ alone.

Rising fuel dependence: Heavy reliance on fossil-based ATF aggravates energy insecurity and locks in polluting infrastructure.

Eg: India imported 85% of crude oil in 2024 (MoPNG data).

Urban health risks: Expansion of aviation hubs adds to urban air pollution load, increasing health risks for local populations.

Eg: WHO 2023 report flagged higher respiratory illness among communities near large airports globally.

Effectiveness of sustainable aviation fuel policy

Emission reduction potential: SAF can cut 65–80% lifecycle CO₂ emissions compared to ATF if sustainably sourced.

Eg: Deloitte India 2024 report estimated 20–25 MT CO₂ reduction annually by FY40 with SAF.

Compliance with global standards: Supports India’s obligations under CORSIA (mandatory after 2027) and enhances global aviation competitiveness.

Eg: ICAO CORSIA framework requires carbon-neutral growth from 2027.

Energy diversification: SAF reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels and supports domestic ethanol and biomass value chains.

Eg: India’s 18.25 billion litre ethanol capacity (Food Ministry 2025) can partly support SAF blending.

Policy synergy: Alignment with National Biofuel Policy 2018 and incentives under schemes like Gobardhan can boost investment.

Eg: NITI Aayog 2025 consultations proposed SAF reclassification under bioenergy to access subsidies.

Export and trade potential: SAF adoption positions India as a supplier in global markets, aiding energy diplomacy and green trade.

Eg: Brazil and US already benchmarked sugarcane/corn-based SAF under CORSIA, India’s LCA study (TERI 2025) is in progress.

Conclusion

India’s aviation sector risks becoming a significant pollution hotspot, but a comprehensive SAF policy backed by strong incentives and global alignment can transform this challenge into an opportunity for green leadership by 2030.

Q7. Public life demands a higher threshold of accountability than private life. In light of criminal charges against elected representatives, critically examine this statement. How should democratic institutions uphold ethical conduct in politics? (10 M)

Difficulty Level: Medium

Reference: TH

Why the question

The case of criminal charges against elected representatives raises the issue of higher ethical accountability in politics and the role of institutions in safeguarding democratic values.

Key Demand of the question

The question asks you to critically examine why public life requires greater ethical accountability compared to private life, and to suggest how democratic institutions can uphold ethical conduct in politics.

Structure of the Answer:

Introduction

Briefly highlight why public office carries greater moral responsibility, linking it with trust and legitimacy.

Body –

Explain why public life demands higher ethical standards using ethics frameworks (duty, virtue, social contract, public trust).

Suggest how institutions like judiciary, ECI, political parties, and citizens can strengthen ethical conduct in politics through reforms and transparency.

Conclusion

End with a futuristic note on transforming democracy from legal compliance to moral governance.

Introduction

When entrusted with public office, individuals are not only decision-makers but also moral exemplars. The ethical threshold is higher in public life because lapses here affect not just personal reputation but the collective conscience and democratic trust of society.

Body

Higher threshold of accountability in public life

Deontological ethics: Leaders have a duty-bound responsibility to act rightly irrespective of consequences, as per Kantian principles.

Eg: Mahatma Gandhi’s insistence on moral leadership highlighted politics as an extension of ethics.

Virtue ethics: Citizens expect qualities like integrity, courage, and prudence in their representatives, making private–public standards inherently different.

Eg: Plato’s philosopher-king ideal illustrates that rulers must embody higher virtues.

Public trust doctrine: Holding office creates a fiduciary obligation; betrayal through criminal conduct amounts to moral harm to citizens.

Eg: Justice Krishna Iyer often stressed that public life is a “sacred trust.”

Consequentialist reasoning: The ripple effect of unethical acts in public life is far greater, influencing governance quality and societal morality.

Eg: Nirbhaya case protests (2012) showed how failures of political leadership erode faith in justice.

Social contract ethics: By entering politics, individuals tacitly agree to uphold higher standards as part of the social contract with citizens.

Eg: Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s contract theory highlights that authority rests on moral legitimacy.

Upholding ethical conduct through institutions

Institutional integrity: Election Commission, judiciary, and Parliament must operate with impartiality to safeguard probity in politics.

Eg: SC in Public Interest Foundation (2018) pressed parties to disclose candidates’ criminal backgrounds.

Ethical codes and training: Developing codes of conduct and value-based training for legislators rooted in ethics, not just legal compliance.

Eg: Nolan Committee (UK, 1995) articulated “Seven Principles of Public Life” (integrity, accountability, selflessness).

Transparency and openness: Embedding accountability through RTI and citizen charters aligns with ethical governance values like honesty and openness.

Eg: RTI exposures of MPLADS misuse (2021) demonstrated citizen-driven ethical oversight.

Role of civic virtue: Citizens and civil society must demand ethical politics to create bottom-up pressure on parties and institutions.

Eg: ADR’s electoral awareness campaigns empower voters to reject tainted candidates.

Restorative justice approaches: Ethics in politics must also encourage atonement, remorse, and correction, not only punitive justice.

Eg: Practices like truth and reconciliation commissions globally highlight ethical accountability alongside legal measures.

Conclusion

Ethics in public life is not about avoiding crime but embodying values of integrity, fairness, and justice. Only when institutions and citizens demand higher ethical standards will democracy progress from legal compliance to moral governance.

„Tai svarbus žingsnis aviacijos sektoriaus dekarbonizacijos link. Įtraukdami SAF į komercinį pasiūlymą, suteikiame oro bendrovėms ir keleiviams galimybę rinktis tvaresnes keliones bei kartu prisidėti prie Europos Sąjungos klimato tikslų įgyvendinimo. Tai reiškia, kad nuo rugsėjo vidurio iš Baltijos šalių oro uostų pakilę orlaiviai bus varomi degalais su tvarios kilmės komponentu“, – sako „ORLEN Lietuva“ Vidaus didmeninės prekybos direktorius Tomas Abromavičius.

SAF gaminamas iš atsinaujinančių ar atliekinių žaliavų, tokių kaip naudotas kepimo aliejus, pramonės bei žemės ūkio atliekos. Maišomas su tradiciniais reaktyviniais degalais, jis yra visiškai suderinamas su esamais orlaivių varikliais, todėl oro bendrovės gali jį naudoti iš karto, be papildomų technologinių pokyčių. Naudojant SAF, per visą gyvavimo ciklą CO₂ emisijas galima sumažinti iki 94 proc., palyginti su įprastais aviaciniais degalais.

Šiuo metu ORLEN importuoja SAF komponentus – dalis jų pagaminta Roterdame (Nyderlanduose), kita dalis – Singapūre. 2025 m. yra pirmieji metai, kai SAF Europoje plačiai naudojamas komerciniais tikslais, nebe vien eksperimentinėse programose. Degalais galės naudotis visos oro bendrovės, skraidančios iš Vilniaus, Rygos ir Talino oro uostų.

Pradėjusi tiekti SAF, ORLEN taip pat įgyvendina ES reglamento „ReFuelEU Aviation“ reikalavimus. Pagal jį nuo 2025 m. tvarūs aviaciniai degalai turi sudaryti mažiausiai 2 proc. visų parduodamų aviacinių degalų. Reglamentas taikomas tiems Europos Sąjungos oro uostams, kurie per ankstesnius metus aptarnavo daugiau kaip 800 tūkst. keleivių arba 100 tūkst. tonų krovinių. Ši iniciatyva padeda ruoštis ir tolesniems tikslams – iki 2030 m. SAF dalis turi siekti 6 proc., o iki 2050 m. – net 70 proc.

ORLEN grupė SAF tiekimą pradėjo dar šių metų liepą Varšuvos, Krokuvos ir Katovicų oro uostuose. Tuo pat metu grupė plečia gamybos pajėgumus – Plocko gamykloje, Lenkijoje, statomas hidrintų augalinių aliejų (HVO) įrenginys.

SAF tiekimas yra tik viena iš iniciatyvų, kuriomis ORLEN siekia mažinti aviacijos sektoriaus poveikį aplinkai. Įgyvendindama projektą „HySPARK“ (Hydrogen Solutions for euroPean Airports & Regional Kinetics), bendrovė taip pat planuoja įrengti vandenilio degalinę Varšuvos Šopeno oro uoste. Ji aprūpins vandeniliu nulinių emisijų antžemines transporto priemones, kurios šiame oro uoste bus naudojamos kaip „HySPARK“ projekto dalis.

„ORLEN Lietuva“ jau daugelį metų išlieka didžiausia mokesčių mokėtoja šalyje ir svarbi Lietuvos ekonomikos dalyvė. Nuo 2006 m. ORLEN į Mažeikių gamyklos įsigijimą ir modernizavimą investavo beveik 4,5 mlrd. eurų. Be to, bendrovė valdo svarbiausią žaliavų tiekimo uostą – Būtingės terminalą – bei Mockavos geležinkelio terminalą, užtikrinantį sklandų naftos produktų eksportą.

ORLEN grupė – tai integruota, diversifikuota energetikos bendrovė, įtraukta į prestižinius „Fortune Global 500“ ir „Platts TOP250“ sąrašus. Tai pirmoji bendrovė regione, paskelbusi apie tikslą iki 2050 metų pasiekti klimato neutralumą.

Intimiti Australia, developer of Celys—the world's first certified compostable polyester—has won the Innovate P2X 2025 grant from NSW's Decarbonisation Hub. In partnership with Macquarie University, it will transform end-of-life clothing into Sustainable Aviation Fuel, tackling Australia's low 2 per cent textile recycling rate and advancing circularity in textiles and clean energy.

Australia’s textile footprint highlights the urgency of intervention: 373,000 tonnes of new clothes are imported annually, while 200,000 tonnes of clothing still end up in landfill every year. Despite well-meaning donations, 210,000 tonnes of garments sent to charities or bins often cannot be resold or recycled, leaving the nation with a recycling rate of just 2 percent.

Through Innovate P2X funding and in collaboration with Macquarie University, Intimiti will help reshape the textile value chain by proving that end of life clothing can be reengineered into high value energy solutions. By bridging material innovation with clean energy, the company seeks to demonstrate a scalable model for true circularity where fashion waste is transformed into fuel for a decarbonised future. This breakthrough not only diverts valuable fibres from landfill and reduces microplastic pollution, but also delivers renewable fuel to the aviation sector, one of the hardest industries to decarbonise.

“This initiative is more than innovation, it’s reimagining waste as opportunity,” says Jason, Project Lead at Intimiti Australia. “By valorising waste streams, we’re creating high-impact circularity in textiles and energy industries.”

With Innovate P2X support, Intimiti aims to show that fashion waste can find a second life as clean energy, helping both people and the planet move toward a sustainable future.

Pada 20 Agustus 2025, penerbangan rute Jakarta–Bali mencatat sejarah untuk pertama kalinya di Asia Tenggara, pesawat komersial mengudara menggunakan campuran bahan bakar avtur terbarukan berbasis minyak jelantah, atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), yang diproduksi di kilang Pertamina Cilacap.

Pencapaian ini tentu patut diapresiasi karena menunjukkan bahwa inovasi teknologi energi terbarukan telah sampai pada tahap nyata, bukan sekadar wacana di atas kertas atau slogan kampanye hijau.

Namun, di balik euforia keberhasilan itu, ada pertanyaan yang jauh lebih besar dan mendesak untuk dijawab bersama: apakah minyak jelantah benar-benar akan menjadi energi rakyat yang inklusif, atau justru berubah menjadi bisnis eksklusif yang hanya menguntungkan segelintir elite migas?

Salah satu daya tarik utama dari kisah penerbangan perdana dengan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah adalah kesederhanaan simbol yang terkandung di dalamnya.

Minyak jelantah, yang sehari-hari hanya kita kenal sebagai sisa penggorengan yang berbau tengik kerap dibuang begitu saja ke selokan atau dijual murah ke pengepul ternyata dapat menjelma menjadi energi bersih yang mendorong mesin jet melintasi udara.

Simbol ini penting karena menunjukkan bahwa transisi energi bukan hanya soal teknologi canggih yang jauh dari keseharian, melainkan dapat berangkat dari ruang-ruang sederhana yang akrab dengan masyarakat kecil yang ada di dapur rumah tangga dan usaha mikro.

Dengan demikian, keberhasilan penerbangan ini sebenarnya lebih dari sekadar tonggak teknologi, ia juga sebuah ajakan untuk melihat kembali nilai strategis dari limbah yang selama ini terabaikan.

Secara teknis, keunggulan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah memang sulit dibantah. Berbagai penelitian internasional membuktikan bahwa bahan bakar ini mampu menurunkan emisi gas rumah kaca hingga 60–80 persen dibandingkan avtur fosil, dan yang lebih penting, ia dapat digunakan langsung tanpa perlu memodifikasi mesin pesawat atau infrastruktur penerbangan yang sudah ada.

Artinya, teknologi sudah siap untuk dipakai, tidak perlu menunggu terobosan baru yang mahal dan memakan waktu lama. Namun, dibalik kesiapan teknologi, pertanyaan fundamental tetap mengemuka di benak penulis siapa yang benar-benar akan menikmati manfaat dari energi baru ini? Apakah rakyat yang dapurnya menyumbangkan jelantah atau justru korporasi besar yang menguasai rantai pasok, kilang, dan pasar penerbangan?

Data Kementerian Lingkungan Hidup dan Kehutanan (KLHK) pada 2023 menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia menghasilkan lebih dari 3 juta kiloliter minyak jelantah per tahun. Angka ini menunjukkan potensi luar biasa untuk dijadikan bahan baku energi terbarukan. Tetapi kenyataannya, mayoritas minyak jelantah itu tidak masuk dalam rantai pasok resmi, melainkan bocor ke pasar gelap atau bahkan diekspor secara ilegal.

Di sinilah persoalan mendasar dapat dilihat bersama, tanpa tata kelola yang transparan dan insentif yang adil, minyak jelantah berisiko besar hanya menjadi komoditas baru yang diperebutkan kelompok-kelompok pebisnis rente, sementara rakyat sebagai penghasil limbah tetap berada di pinggir cerita. Padahal, jika dikelola dengan baik, potensi ini bisa menjadi fondasi energi rakyat yang menghubungkan transisi energi dengan keadilan sosial.

Bayangkan dengan menggunakan sebuah skema sederhana, apabila setiap tetes minyak jelantah yang disetor oleh ibu rumah tangga atau pedagang gorengan ke rantai pasok resmi akan mendapatkan poin digital atau kupon yang bisa ditukar dengan akses makanan bergizi di dapur komunitas.

Dengan demikian, pengumpulan jelantah tidak hanya menghasilkan energi bersih yang mengangkat pesawat, tetapi juga memperkuat hak atas pangan rakyat kecil. Transisi energi pun tidak lagi menjadi isu teknokratis, melainkan hadir sebagai praktik keadilan sosial yang nyata di tingkat akar rumput.

Dari Pasar Gelap hingga Risiko Greenwashing

Walaupun terlihat sederhana, perjalanan mewujudkan rantai pasok minyak jelantah yang sehat penuh tantangan. Di atas kertas, jumlah jelantah memang melimpah. Namun dalam praktik, rantai pasoknya bisa dikatakan sangat berantakan.

Minyak bekas dapur rumah tangga tersebar dalam volume kecil, cenderung sulit dikumpulkan dan lebih mudah dijual murah kepada pengepul ilegal yang kemudian mengalirkannya ke pasar gelap atau mengekspornya keluar negeri.

Pemerintah memang sudah melarang ekspor minyak jelantah sejak awal 2025, tetapi larangan semata tanpa skema insentif bagi rakyat hanya akan menciptakan pasar gelap baru yang lebih berisiko. Dengan kata lain, kebijakan yang hanya bersifat membatasi tanpa memberikan keuntungan nyata bagi masyarakat berpotensi gagal sejak awal.

Di sinilah pentingnya menetapkan harga acuan nasional serta menciptakan insentif langsung bagi rumah tangga dan UMKM. Rakyat harus mendapatkan manfaat ekonomi yang jelas dari menyerahkan minyak jelantah ke rantai pasok resmi. Jika tidak, maka tidak ada alasan rasional bagi masyarakat kecil untuk berpartisipasi, dan rantai pasok SAF akan selalu kalah dari mekanisme pasar gelap.

Selain persoalan bahan baku, ada pula tantangan biaya produksi. Fakta di lapangan menunjukkan bahwa harga SAF saat ini masih dua hingga tiga kali lipat lebih mahal dibandingkan avtur fosil. Tanpa dukungan fiskal berupa pembebasan pajak, subsidi silang hingga integrasi dengan pasar karbon, maskapai penerbangan tentu tidak akan sanggup menanggung beban biaya tersebut.

Pertanyaannya kemudian kepada siapa yang akan diuntungkan dari mekanisme insentif ini? Apakah masyarakat kecil sebagai penyetor jelantah akan ikut merasakan manfaat atau insentif hanya akan berputar di lingkaran bisnis besar migas dan maskapai? Pengalaman program biodiesel B30 memberi pelajaran penting bahwa tanpa tata kelola yang ketat, program energi terbarukan bisa dengan mudah tersandera oleh kepentingan korporasi.

Tantangan lain yang tidak kalah penting adalah risiko greenwashing. Transisi energi tidak boleh berhenti pada label “hijau” semata. Ada risiko serius jika bahan baku SAF bergeser dari limbah menuju minyak primer misalnya crude palm oil yang dalam praktiknya bisa memicu deforestasi dan konflik lahan.

ADVERTISEMENT

Lebih jauh lagi, sistem pelacakan digital yang transparan harus dibangun agar setiap tetes jelantah bisa ditelusuri asal-usulnya. Tanpa mekanisme itu, SAF akan rentan disalahgunakan sebagai alat legitimasi hijau yang sesungguhnya abu-abu.

Regulasi, Partisipasi, dan Keberanian Politik

Jika melihat praktik terbaik negara lain, kita bisa menemukan pelajaran berharga. Belanda, misalnya, melalui Bandara Schiphol, mewajibkan pencampuran SAF pada penerbangan internasional sambil memberi insentif pajak untuk produsen.

ADVERTISEMENT

Amerika Serikat bahkan lebih jauh, meluncurkan program Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge dengan target 11 miliar liter SAF pada 2030 lengkap dengan kredit pajak per galon.

Kedua contoh ini menunjukkan hal yang sama yakni keberhasilan tidak hanya bergantung pada kesiapan teknologi, tetapi juga pada konsistensi regulasi, mandat pasar yang jelas dan insentif yang tepat sasaran.

Indonesia bisa mengambil inspirasi dari sana, tetapi yang lebih penting adalah menyesuaikannya dengan konteks kearifan lokal memastikan bahwa manfaat minyak jelantah benar-benar kembali kepada rakyat, bukan hanya ke perusahaan besar yang sudah mapan.

Jika dikelola dengan berani, SAF berbasis minyak jelantah bisa menjadi lebih dari sekadar bahan bakar pesawat. Proses pengolahannya juga menghasilkan diesel terbarukan yang dapat digunakan untuk bus kota, kapal penyeberangan, dan truk logistik.

ADVERTISEMENT

Dengan demikian, minyak jelantah sebenarnya punya potensi untuk menggerakkan seluruh moda transportasi darat, laut, dan udara sekaligus membangun ekonomi sirkular yang sehat. Namun semua itu hanya mungkin jika ada partisipasi kolektif.

Tanpa rakyat sebagai aktor utama, SAF hanya akan berhenti sebagai seremoni elite: sekali terbang untuk kepentingan liputan, lalu menguap tanpa jejak dalam kehidupan sehari-hari.

Penerbangan perdana SAF dari minyak jelantah seharusnya dipahami bukan sekadar sebagai demonstrasi teknologi, melainkan sebagai ujian serius bagi tata kelola energi Indonesia.

Pertanyaannya apakah minyak jelantah akan benar-benar menjadi energi rakyat yang menyehatkan dapur dan menggerakkan transportasi rendah karbon atau ia hanya akan berubah menjadi bisnis elite yang dibungkus jargon hijau? Jawaban dari pertanyaan itu sangat bergantung pada keberanian politik kita.

ADVERTISEMENT

Apakah kita berani menata regulasi secara tegas, memberi insentif langsung kepada rakyat dan memastikan setiap tetes jelantah yang dihasilkan dapur rumah tangga kembali sebagai energi berkeadilan?

Pada akhirnya, transisi energi bukanlah soal teknologi tinggi semata, melainkan soal keberanian untuk menempatkan rakyat sebagai pemilik utama masa depan energi.","https://blue.kumparan.com/image/upload/fl_progressive,fl_lossy,f_jpg,q_auto,w_600,h_315,c_lpad,b_white/g_south,l_og_user_zprw89/co_rgb:ffffff,g_south_west,l_text:Heebo_20_bold:Konten%20dari%20Pengguna%0DRifqi%20Nuril%20Huda,x_140,y_26/01hdb519fsh4acw1j6y4qg6nq1.jpg",N,,2025-09-15 05:58:29.157012

Indonesia dengan kekayaan sumber daya nabati memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) atau bioavtur. Beberapa bahan baku (feedstock) yang potensial untuk produksi SAF seperti minyak sawit, PFAD, POME, minyak jelantah, hingga tandan kosong kelapa sawit.

PASPI Monitor (2025) dalam jurnal berjudul Pengembangan SAF Sawit untuk Langit yang Lebih Hijau mengatakan bahwa Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tetapi juga berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional dengan memanfaatkan keberlimpahan sumber daya lokal. Salah satunya adalah kelapa sawit, termasuk minyak, produk samping (by-product), dan limbah. Berikut ini ulasan mengenai potensi bahan baku SAF yang tersedia di Indonesia.

Minyak Sawit. Minyak sawit menjadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF. Secara kimiawi, asam lemak dari minyak sawit sangat mirip dengan susunan hidrokarbon pada bahan bakar fosil.

Australia’s domestic hydrogen market sits at 500,000 tonnes annually, valued at around $5 billion

Innovators are advancing tech to cut electricity use, removing one of the key barriers for green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel alternatives

Green hydrogen plays have dropped off investors’ ‘what’s hot’ lists this year, but the global demand for hydrogen still holds tonne-loads of potential. A market worth more than US$200 billion exists in heavy but hard to abate industries – and Australian innovators are finding new ways to make the numbers work.

Under the radar of many investors is an existing hydrogen market worth at least US$200 (A$306) billion globally. Most of the demand for the ~100 million tonnes consumed annually comes from essential but infamously hard to abate industries.

Australia has a 500,000-tonne-a-year hydrogen market - worth up to approximately $5 billion - which fuels the key sectors of steelmaking, fertiliser and chemical production, and refining.

While a lot of people think of all hydrogen as clean and green, the vast majority used by industry is grey or black – produced from gas or coal – and those varieties release millions of tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere each year.

Replacing fossil-fuel hydrogen with zero-emissions green hydrogen - produced using wind or solar power - could deliver some of the most immediate and bankable emissions cuts for corporations and governments scrambling to reach emissions targets.

Bankable market

For investors, the real hydrogen play is not just about futuristic cars or headline-grabbing export projects, it’s the massive and stable market for clean industrial feedstock.

More than 60 governments worldwide have adopted hydrogen strategies, and the focus, especially in Europe and Asia, is on low-emissions hydrogen. Billions of euros, yen and Korean won are being invested in R&D, subsidy programs and demonstration plants.

The climate solution green hydrogen offers may be clear, but its cost has been a major challenge. That’s because producing green hydrogen via the standard electrolysis method still requires substantial amounts of clean electricity.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) notes that low-emissions hydrogen currently plays only a marginal role, with production of less than 1 million tonnes per annum - or one per cent of the global market. But, unlocking more cost-effective green hydrogen would lead to an exponential increase in its use.

Australian innovation can shift balance

Eyeing the huge opportunities for game-changing technology, Australian innovators are advancing projects across key sectors including alumina refining and steel production; shipping, aviation and other fuels; and fertiliser production via green ammonia.

Made by combining green hydrogen with nitrogen, green ammonia offers an immediate and high-impact opportunity to decarbonise the fertiliser industry. Additionally, green ammonia can be used as a zero-carbon fuel in the shipping industry - with potential uses as an export fuel.

The green ammonia market is projected to grow from US$407 million in 2024 to US$44,299 million by 2032, an eye-popping compound average growth rate of almost 80 per cent. Australia’s neighbours and close trading partners in Asia and the Pacific dominate the global market with a share of almost 66 per cent, according to Fortune Business Insights.

Green hydrogen projects in Australia are targeting our key sectors including fertiliser production for agriculture, plus steel and fuel.

One company that’s a frontrunner in cracking this industrial-scale market is Hadean Energy, a start-up spun out of CSIRO research. Its tubular Solid Oxide Electrolyser (tSOE) technology uses up to 30 per cent less electricity than conventional proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers.

This efficiency edge, combined with the use of industrial waste heat and avoidance of rare and expensive metals, means Hadean’s system can produce hydrogen – and syngas for e-fuels – at significantly lower costs than incumbent green hydrogen technologies.

Additionally, amid the well-publicised gas price rises, grey hydrogen is becoming more expensive, shifting the viability dial towards the green alternative.

Adding to the benefits of its transformative tech, Hadean’s modular units can be made ready for easy integration at industrial sites.

The company has already successfully completed a 1,000-hour industrial trial at BlueScope Steel’s Port Kembla plant, demonstrating it can take the heat of real-world applications.

It’s also earned a spot as a Shell-backed New Energy Challenge 2025 finalist, which puts it on the radar of major energy players.

Another boost for Hadean is its support from advisory firm RFC Ambrian, which has previously helped guide Chrysos (ASX:C79) and FPR Energy from R&D projects to commercialisation.

Looking to leverage overseas interest, Hadean is collaborating with startup NGV Earth on a pilot-scale plant advancing technology to deliver sustainable aviation fuel that doesn't have the environmental baggage of what’s used today.

Further positioning Hadean’s technology for domestic and international impact, the company will soon deploy a multi-kilowatt demonstration unit as part of the Australia-UK Renewable Hydrogen Innovation Partnerships program.

This program, with high-level government support in both countries, is sharply focused on the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate industries.

It’s these existing high-emissions yet essential for modern life industries - not the cool cars and shiny new projects - that will propel us towards a decarbonised future.

By growing in these proven and large-scale markets the green hydrogen sector can set itself up for broader adoption and unlock the capital set to flow into one of the energy transition’s key growth opportunities.

At the event, he said, ""It will be tough for the farmers to survive only by cultivating pulses or grains.
Nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced liquidation had there been no ethanol, he said.
The production cost of sugar in Brazil is around Rs27 per kg, while the same in Maharashtra is around Rs32-33.
Use of corn for ethanol production, according to him, has helped give a better price to corn — up from Rs1,200 per quintal to Rs2,800 per quintal.","Pune: Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on Sunday said ethanol has ""saved sugarcane farmers and sugar factories in the state"". Gadkari was speaking at the tenth anniversary of Naam Foundation, an organisation started by actors Makarand Anaspure and Nana Patekar for watershed management and drought mitigation. At the event, he said, ""It will be tough for the farmers to survive only by cultivating pulses or grains. The sugar industry could survive because of ethanol. Now, an alternative to diesel called isobutanol will be produced. We are also planning to develop sustainable aviation fuel using biogas."" The minister also said that sugar is in surplus in the country. Nearly 90% of sugar mills in western Maharashtra would have faced liquidation had there been no ethanol, he said. The production cost of sugar in Brazil is around Rs27 per kg, while the same in Maharashtra is around Rs32-33. Brazil introduces sugar at around Rs30 per kg in the international market, making it more difficult for us to sell our stock, incurring a loss of Rs2-3 per kg. ""So, farmers will have to ensure that they become producers of not only food but also fuel, electricity, aviation, bitumen, and hydrogen. That will make villages rich,"" said Gadkari. Use of corn for ethanol production, according to him, has helped give a better price to corn — up from Rs1,200 per quintal to Rs2,800 per quintal. Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Maharashtra have benefited from the increased production, said the minister, adding that production has also gone up by three times. This yield is taken thrice a year. Commenting on other issues, Gadkari said, better water supply management is needed in the country to improve the agricultural sector and lives of farmers. ""Politics over usage of river water and river water distribution has created complications. There were around 23 disputes between states about river water distribution. The majority have been resolved,"" he assured. Gadkari also said that if Maharashtra's milk production goes up and irrigation increases by 65%, many agricultural issues will be resolved. In another programme on the same day, Gadkari was awarded by the Geeta Dharma Mandal organisation. While speaking here, he said new-age methods like videos or reels should be used to spread the message of life given by the Bhagavad Geeta. ""It will help youngsters define the real meaning of life as well as politics and its purpose. We need to redefine politics. Instead of the politics of power, it should be more centred around social reforms. The issue in today's political circles is not the difference of opinions, but the lack of opinions,"" he said.

Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.
Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.
""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said.
The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.","Canola producers are entering harvest season with significant uncertainty in the wake of China's latest tariff on Canadian canola.

China, which slapped a 75.8 per cent duty on Canadian canola seed last month, is Canada's largest canola seed importer, with seed exports making up the vast majority — $4 billion — of Canada's $4.9 billion in canola product exports to China in 2024.

This tariff on canola seed, coupled with 100 per cent tariffs on Canadian canola oil and canola meal imposed by China in March, is the cause of much concern among producers across Western Canada.

According to the Alberta Canola Producers Commission, the province is home to 14,000 canola farmers who grow the oilseed crop over 6.6 million acres of farmland, creating a lucrative industry that employs over 40,000 Albertans.

Canola market 'spiraling down'

Alberta Canola director and farmer Christine McKee said she's feeling ""a little bit of panic"" and ""a lot of frustration"" due to the new tariff.

""Just so much uncertainty,"" said McKee. ""Exporting to China is essential to the canola industry in Canada.""

""There isn't a lot farmers can do. Plans are usually set by now for what we're doing next year. We grow our crops on a rotation basis, and it's not easy to make changes.""

Part of the problem is that uncertainty around the trade situation with China has left producers worried about what they are going to grow for next year, and who they are going to sell it to.

""We need a verbal commitment of financial support in response to these politically-based tariffs,"" McKee said.

Andre Harpe, chair of the Canadian Canola Growers Association, was in Saskatoon last week to meet with Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe and federal officials about the canola crisis.

""We're not in a good situation right now,"" he said. ""We've taken a huge hit already, but we don't know how big that hit is going to be.""

Harpe, who grows canola and barley in northern Alberta, said Canada's canola industry has taken a hit since the latest tariff took effect.

""In the last few weeks, if you watched the canola market, it's basically been spiraling down,"" he said. ""We have a good crop coming, but at the same time … we do depend on these export sales, for places to move it to.""

With approximately 40,000 canola farms nationwide, canola is a major driver of the Canadian economy. The industry contributes an average of $43.7 billion to the national economy annually, and supports over 200,000 jobs across the country, according to the Canola Council of Canada.

The Lethbridge region, home to canola producers, elevators and crush facilities, is among the areas that could be significantly impacted by a hit to the canola industry.

""We have a significant amount of canola supply chain, value chain activity that happens in the Lethbridge region,"" said Trevor Lewington, CEO of Economic Development Lethbridge. ""Those tariffs are likely to slow down access to [the Chinese] market and will force us to think about either new markets, who else can we sell to, or what else can we do.""

Diversifying the market

One possible solution could be to look to the sky to diversify, said Lewington.

""There's growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel,"" he said. ""And so that's something that might not have been considered before, because of course, the focus should be growing food and supplying food to a hungry world.""

""But if that market is no longer interested in our product for food, then perhaps we can shift it to other uses, like aviation.""

As research continues into the use of canola to fuel planes, Lewington said diversification can also come in the form of increasing trade with other markets.

""China certainly is a big market. It's not the only market. We're not entirely dependent on that,"" said Lewington. ""So there is an opportunity, I think, for the canola commissions to do more marketing, to extend the reach into other markets or grow our share in the existing markets that we have.""

In 2024, Canada's total canola exports were valued at $14.5 billion. The United States is the largest customer of canola as a whole, with exports valued at $7.7 billion, followed by China, which is the largest buyer of raw canola seed.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7633730.1757878423!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/fea-canola-20250718.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-14 17:56:09.965274

“Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe”. Voici le titre d’un texte du scientifique David Ho et l’économiste Gernot Wagner que nous traduisons ici avec leur accord.

Ce texte permet de voir le changement climatique sous un autre angle, une autre perspective.

Les dégâts climatiques quotidiens devraient être davantage perçus comme une catastrophe.

Les événements ponctuels comme Deepwater Horizon laissent une impression durable, mais la combustion normale des énergies fossiles a un impact encore plus grave.

La marée noire provoquée par la plateforme Deepwater Horizon dans le golfe du Mexique il y a une douzaine d’années a été une tragédie humaine et environnementale. Elle a coûté la vie à 11 personnes, déversé des millions de barils de pétrole dans le golfe et coûté à BP Plc plus de 65 milliards de dollars en frais de nettoyage et en indemnités.

Mais si tout ce pétrole avait été vendu et utilisé, il aurait été encore plus mortel et dévastateur pour l’environnement.

C’est ce qu’a récemment affirmé le co-auteur de la newsletter d’aujourd’hui, le climatologue David Ho, dans un tweet qui a été largement partagé :

Parfois, je pense au fait que Deepwater Horizon a été une catastrophe environnementale majeure qui a coûté la vie à 11 personnes et plus de 65 milliards de dollars à BP, mais si ce pétrole avait été récupéré, vendu et utilisé, cela aurait été pire pour l’environnement, aurait tué plus de personnes et BP aurait gagné de l’argent.

— David Ho (@david_ho) 28 janvier 2022

Au début, j’étais sceptique (Gernot). Mais le calcul de base est correct, et c’est même probablement sous-estimé.

La marée noire a provoqué le déversement d’environ 200 millions de gallons de pétrole dans le golfe du Mexique. Brûler autant de gallons de pétrole et de diesel dans des moteurs à combustion aurait émis plus de 1,4 million de tonnes de CO₂, sans compter, par exemple, les émissions liées au raffinage et au transport du pétrole. Traduit en nombre moyen de vies perdues en raison du changement climatique qui en résulte, cela implique environ 325 décès au cours du siècle, liés uniquement à la hausse des températures. Cela n’inclut pas les décès dus aux particules fines générées par la combustion de ce carburant, qui pourraient représenter 350 décès prématurés supplémentaires par an.

Twitter étant Twitter, les réponses ont nécessité une réponse de David : « Je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. » Nous ne devrions pas. Il existe de nombreux autres coûts environnementaux qui ne sont pas pris en compte dans les 11 décès et les 65 milliards de dollars. L’impact dévastateur sur la faune sauvage ne peut être que partiellement reflété dans les chiffres des dommages financiers. Une partie du pétrole déversé a brûlé de manière incontrôlable, libérant à nouveau du CO₂. Le pétrole qui n’est pas brûlé mais qui finit par s’évaporer cause également de nombreux dommages environnementaux.

Hélas, il existe une grande différence entre un calcul statistique basé sur des estimations globales des dégâts et la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès, comme dans le cas de la plate-forme pétrolière Deepwater Horizon. Onze décès constituent une tragédie, tandis que 325 décès estimés statistiquement ne sont que cela, une statistique.

Il existe une autre différence, ce que l’on appelle en termes juridiques la “cause immédiate”. Cary Coglianese, professeur de droit et de sciences politiques à la Carey Law School de l’université de Pennsylvanie, décrit cela comme « une version juridique de la possibilité d’associer des visages et des noms aux décès ». Tout tribunal raisonnable conviendrait que les 11 décès survenus sur Deepwater Horizon étaient directement liés à l’explosion et à l’incendie de la plate-forme.

Grâce aux progrès rapides réalisés dans le nouveau domaine de la science de l’attribution, les décès liés au climat et autres dommages peuvent désormais être liés plus directement aux tonnes de CO₂ émises. En effet, un nombre croissant de poursuites judiciaires visent à établir un lien de causalité direct entre les dommages climatiques et les décès, mais aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients.

Il existe une autre raison, trop humaine, pour laquelle 11 décès lors d’un événement ponctuel pèsent plus lourd que 325 décès futurs. M. Coglianese, de l’université de Pennsylvanie, compare la différence entre le changement climatique et la marée noire de BP à celle entre la pandémie de Covid-19 et les attentats terroristes du 11 septembre 2001 : « Le 11 septembre a tué environ 3 000 personnes », dit-il. « Nous avons eu environ autant de décès liés au Covid rien qu’hier aux États-Unis. » Plus de 900 000 Américains sont morts du Covid au cours des deux dernières années, et bien plus de 5,5 millions dans le monde, et ce ne sont là que les décès directement attribués à la maladie. « Nous semblons devenir insensibles à cette catastrophe quotidienne », ajoute M. Coglianese.

Nous ne devons bien sûr pas devenir insensibles aux milliers de décès quotidiens liés au Covid, ni aux centaines de décès liés, selon des estimations prudentes, à la quantité de pétrole brûlée, équivalente à celle déversée lors de la marée noire de BP. Les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité.

Compléments d’informations

Vous pourriez être surpris en lisant ce texte. Vous dire “attendez, il dit qu’une marée noire c’est moins pire qu’autre chose ?”. David Ho a été attaqué sur les réseaux sociaux après avoir publié ce texte, et a tout de suite précisé le fond de sa pensée :

“je ne dis pas qu’il faut déverser du pétrole brut. Je souligne simplement l’ironie du fait que la combustion des énergies fossiles nuit beaucoup plus à l’environnement et tue beaucoup plus de personnes, mais comme il s’agit d’émissions de scope 3, les entreprises comme BP ne sont pas tenues responsables et engrangent au contraire des milliards de dollars.”

Il est prévisible que certaines personnes répondent que les énergies fossiles sont géniales. Vous savez ce qui est génial aussi ? Une planète habitable.”

Le coeur du texte est bien dans le titre : il y a des morts quotidiennes du changement climatique dans le monde sans que cela choque outre mesure. C’est un fait : les morts du changement climatique sont des morts silencieuses. Même s’il peut y en avoir 100 fois plus de morts à cause du changement climatique, cela n’aura jamais l’impact médiatique d’un crash d’avion ou d’une marée noire. Dernier exemple en date, la canicule de juin 2025 a fait environ 500 morts en France selon Santé Publique France. Avez-vous vu un seul responsable politique en parler ? Un journaliste interroger un membre du gouvernement ?

Cet article appelle à juste titre à changer d’angle, à aller plus loin dans la réflexion sur le changement climatique. The Onion (une sorte de Gorafi américain) a parfaitement compris l’ironie de la situation avec ce titre : “des millions de barils de pétrole arrivent à bon port malgré une catastrophe environnementale majeure“.

“Ouf”, on a évité la marée noire, qui aurait été une catastrophe. La réalité, c’est qu’on aurait évité une catastrophe si le pétrole avait été remis sous terre, là où il devrait rester.

Autre point important, les progrès réalisés dans le domaine de la science de l’attribution, dont nous avons dédié un article entier sur Bon Pote. Si “aucune compagnie pétrolière n’a jusqu’à présent été contrainte de payer des dommages-intérêts liés à la combustion de ses produits vendus à ses clients”, cela pourrait bientôt ne plus être le cas.

La science a permis de clarifier le lien sans équivoque entre les activités humaines et le réchauffement climatique et c’est désormais un argument clef dans les procès. La Cour Internationale de Justice a par ailleurs récemment publié un avis notamment basé sur le dernier rapport du GIEC. Grâce à cet avis, il est à prévoir que les procès vont se multiplier contre les Etats et les entreprises qui savent que leurs activités tuent et ne font rien ou pas assez pour arrêter ce phénomène.

Comme le rappelle David Ho, “les liens entre la vente et la combustion des combustibles fossiles, d’une part, et les dommages directement attribuables aux émissions qui en résultent, d’autre part, sont on ne peut plus clairs. Il est grand temps que nos lois et nos tribunaux se mettent au diapason de cette réalité“.",https://bonpote.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Deepwater_Horizon_offshore_drilling_unit_on_fire_2010.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 21:56:53.887164

Shubhangi Mathur New Delhi

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India’s largest oil refiner, is working on an expansion plan in line with the country’s growing fuel requirements. In an exclusive interaction with Shubhangi Mathur, Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney talks of the company’s growth plan and also sets the record straight on the E20 controversy. Edited excerpts.

How do you look at the controversy over ethanol-blended petrol? Do you plan to offer consumers the choice of buying non-blended petrol too? And is E20 (20 per cent ethanol blending) as efficient as petrol?

As of now, we do not have any plans to offer non-blended petrol. We will see how it pans out and take a call accordingly. There is no controversy on E20 petrol. All the equipment manufacturers, labs, and agencies have certified that there is no problem with E20. We have a good example of Brazil, where petrol with 27-32 per cent ethanol blending is being sold. The efficiency of E20 is more or less on a par with that of petrol.

India aims to become a refining hub. How would IOC contribute to that?

Given the need for India’s increasing demand for fuel, IOC started expanding brownfield refineries three-four years ago. These projects are set to increase the group’s refining capacity from 80.4 million tonnes to 98 million tonnes per annum. They are scheduled to be commissioned next year. The increased capacity will take care of a large part of the increased demand for petroleum products. In the same timeframe, other refinery projects will also come up, including the expansion of the Rajasthan and Numaligarh (Assam) refineries.

The Indian market is expanding at a moderate pace, with diesel consumption growing at 2–3% and petrol at 5–7%. The industry will also actively pursue exporting surplus petroleum products once production begins following the completion of planned refinery expansions.

Which markets do you plan to target for export?

Petroleum products will go primarily to the African subcontinent and South American continent. Certain refineries are closing in the European Union. They will need products that meet Euro VI standards. Our products meet those quality standards. So, Europe is another geography. For IOC, export accounts for 5-8 per cent of its volumes. This is going to increase.

What are the timelines involved in these expansion projects?

We are aiming to complete the expansion of the Panipat refinery by March. Those in Gujarat and Bihar (Barauni) too will see completion by next year. Much of our refinery expansion will be commissioned by 2026.

Are you planning to set up greenfield refineries?

Not at present. We are focused on executing brownfield expansion while addressing the energy transition. With the rise of electric vehicles, green hydrogen, ethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and other alternative fuels, the growth of petroleum products will be moderate. However, as the country’s leading energy provider, we may consider setting up a greenfield refinery, depending on the evolving demand-supply scenario.

Indian Oil has an upcoming greenfield refinery with Chennai Petroleum in Tamil Nadu.

We are working out the configuration, which will be more suitable for petrochemicals and less for refineries. We want to convert it into a petrochemical-oriented project. The detailed feasibility report is being prepared for the project.

Saudi Arabia is looking to increase its share in the global oil market. Are you in talks with the people there?

We are not in any kind of talks. We know some newer (Indian) refineries are in talks but we are keeping our crude oil portfolio in an open manner because we want to process as many type of crude oil as possible. We have flexibility of 10 refineries which can process almost all kinds of crude oil. That is our strength.

On IOC’s green-hydrogen plant in Panipat?

We are putting up India’s largest green hydrogen plant at Panipat, with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes per annum. It will be commissioned by December 2027 and will be utilised for mobility purposes if enough hydrogen-fuelled buses, trucks or cars are available in the market. Otherwise, we will use it in our refineries and replace the conventional grey hydrogen with green hydrogen. The cost of production will be less than $4 per kg.

IOC is also foraying into new energy such as nuclear and critical minerals.

Nuclear energy, critical minerals, and ship building are on our drawing board. It is premature to talk about these things.

What is your outlook on crude oil prices?

Prices now are $66-67 a barrel in spite of all the disturbances happening across the world. My assessment is that if these disturbances ease then prices will further come down by $5-10, reaching $55-60.

At RepAir, he leads business development, international partnerships, and commercial scaling of its electrochemical carbon capture technology.

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions – nearly a gigaton annually – and is growing faster than rail, road or shipping. This sector represents one of the most challenging to decarbonise.

As the International Energy Agency notes, reaching net-zero will require “revolutionary” designs, including alternative propulsion technologies such as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft.

However, battery electric propulsion is currently limited to very small aircraft and short ranges. Using hydrogen poses significant challenges: innovative fuel storage and delivery methods, low-cost lightweight cryogenic tanks, and redesigned airframes to accommodate them. Questions about hydrogen’s impact on contrails remain unanswered, with dedicated studies still underway.

This technological reality makes sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) critical to decarbonising aviation now. Yet here too, there’s a fundamental constraint that needs to be addressed – and urgently.

SAF from biogenic feedstocks has fundamental limits

While the EU has set ambitious SAF blending targets – 2% this year, rising to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 with a synthetic fuel sub-mandate of 1.2% by 2030 and 35% by 2050 – the industry’s current approach relies heavily on biogenic CO2 from crops, agricultural waste and other biological sources. And biogenic feedstocks have inherent limitations that make these targets mathematically impossible.

The EU’s RefuelEU regulation excludes SAFs produced from food and feed crops due to sustainability concerns. While biojet kerosene from animal fat and waste oil feedstocks are included, their growth potential is limited by supply.

More abundant feedstocks could come from agricultural residues, dedicated energy crops and municipal solid waste – but even these face constraints.

First, cultivating crops for fuel creates direct land use competition with food production or requires land conversion. Second, and more critically, biogenic sources are finite.

Meeting the EU’s 2050 SAF targets through biogenic sources alone would require between 7% and 18% of today’s EU agricultural land, depending on the feedstock. It’s both impractical and impossible at the scale needed.

Even if we maximised every available biogenic source globally, we’d fall short of the gigatons of CO2 needed for aviation fuel production by 2050.

This is where atmospheric CO2 becomes essential.

Direct Air Capture: Sustainable aviation fuel from the sky

Direct Air Capture (DAC) allows us to capture CO2 needed to produce e-SAF – synthetic fuels made by combining atmospheric CO2 with green hydrogen produced by electrolysers run on low-emissions electricity through processes like Fischer-Tropsch or methanol-to-jet conversion.

The key advantage is unlimited feedstock: the atmosphere contains all the CO2 we need. We’re not talking about offsetting here – this is about recycling; creating a circular carbon economy where aviation’s emissions become tomorrow’s fuel.

RefuelEU Aviation regulation already recognises this distinction, segregating between biogenic SAF and e-SAF from direct air capture. This is an acknowledgement that atmospheric carbon represents a fundamentally different resource with fundamentally different potential.

What makes this pathway particularly promising is also infrastructure compatibility. Airports in Rome and Paris are already preparing for e-fuel supply chains. Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives that would require complete infrastructure overhauls, e-SAF uses existing fuel systems.

That’s a massive advantage for an industry that needs solutions now, not in ten years.

Cutting the cost of carbon capture through electrochemical innovation

The cost challenge is real but not insurmountable. Traditional DAC technologies have struggled with high energy requirements – often consuming 2,500 kWh or more per tonne of CO2 captured.

But innovation is rapidly changing this equation. New electrochemical approaches can achieve up to 70% lower energy consumption compared to conventional thermal-based systems.

By eliminating the need for high-temperature processes and chemical solvents, these technologies can reduce both operational costs and capital requirements. When you factor in mass manufacturing potential using standard materials rather than exotic components, the path to cost-competitive atmospheric CO2 becomes clear.

The same innovation curve that brought battery costs down by 90% over the past decade is beginning to transform DAC.

But we need to be honest about the challenge: the entire e-SAF value chain – from DAC to hydrogen production to fuel synthesis – requires substantial energy inputs. Current e-SAF costs five to six times more than conventional jet fuel.

Building a SAF production plant takes 10 to 20 years to reach full operational scale. This is why it’s a day-one challenge. The plants we need operational in 2040 must break ground today.

Aviation’s sustainable future must include atmospheric carbon

The truth is that from a pure energy efficiency standpoint, the numbers might favour simply capturing CO2 and storing it underground.

But Europe – and other countries such as the UK, Brazil and Japan – have chosen a different path, for better or for worse: pushing the industry to innovate beyond the World War II-era Fischer-Tropsch process, to find new pathways that make recycled carbon economically viable.

For this to happen, I believe three critical developments must happen:

First: Reinforce supply-side and demand-side policies to scale up e-SAF production and offtake

Second: Tax aviation fuels according to their climate impact, acknowledging that only a minority of the world flies

Third: Position aviation as a lead market to bring nascent decarbonisation options to commercial scale. Actions from leading airlines and airports that serve as key international and domestic hubs can generate the market pull needed to catalyse the adoption of efficient operations and best-in-class technologies

E-SAF from atmospheric CO2 doesn’t compete with biogenic SAF – we need every sustainable fuel source available, but only atmospheric carbon offers the unlimited scale required for aviation’s future.

It’s time we acknowledge that aviation’s sustainable future depends on turning the sky itself into our fuel source.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jean-Philippe-Hiegel-RepAir-Carbon-opinion-piece.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 11:56:14.083662

katakabar.com - Penerapan Bioavtur atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) di Indonesia, selain digunakan sektor penerbangan juga untuk ekspansi atau pengembangan industri SAF nasional.

Indonesia dengan kekayaan sumber daya nabati memiliki potensi besar dalam pengembangan SAF atau bioavtur. Beberapa bahan baku (feedstock) yang potensial untuk produksi SAF, seperti minyak sawit, PFAD, POME, minyak jelantah, hingga tandan kosong kelapa sawit.

Jurnal PASPI Monitor (2025) berjudul Pengembangan SAF Sawit untuk Langit yang Lebih Hijau menyebutkan, Indonesia tak hanya mengimplementasikan atau menerapkan penggunaan SAF pada sektor penerbangan, tapi berperan dalam pengembangan industri SAF nasional dengan memanfaatkan keberlimpahan sumber daya lokal. Di antarsnya, yakni kelapa sawit, termasuk minyak, produk samping (by-product), dan limbah. Berikut ini ulasan mengenai potensi bahan baku SAF yang tersedia di Indonesia.

Minyak Sawit: Minyak sawit jadi salah satu bahan baku untuk produksi SAF. Secara kimiawi, asam lemak dari minyak sawit sangat mirip dengan susunan hidrokarbon pada bahan bakar fosil. Asam laurat pada minyak inti sawit dapat diubah menjadi undekana atau bioavtur (PASPI Monitor, 2020; 2025a). Dengan menggunakan teknologi hydro-processed esters and fatty acid (HEFA), asam lemak pada minyak inti sawit dapat diolah menjadi SAF.

Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan atau BPDP lewat program Grant Riset Sawit atau GRS telah fasilitasi riset inovasi pengembangan bioavtur berbasis minyak sawit (PASPI Monitor, 2025a). Di antaranya riset Reksowardojo et.al. (2022) yang menghasilkan bioavtur sawit dengan blending rate sebesar 2,4 persen (J2.4) yang dapat digunakan untuk bahan bakar pesawat. Program GRS juga melahirkan inovasi teknologi Katalis Merah Putih untuk memproduksi biofuel termasuk untuk avtur (Subagjo et.al., 2021; 2022).

Hasil riset inovasi GRS tersebut kemudian dikembangkan lebih lanjut dengan skala yang lebih besar. Pada tahun 2021, Kilang Pertamina Internasional atau KPI Cilacap berhasil memproduksi bioavtur dengan menggunakan feedstock minyak inti sawit atau refined bleached deodorized palm kernel oil atau RBDPKO dengan teknologi co-processing dan menggunakan Katalis Merah Putih (KPI, 2025). Tingkat pencampuran (blending rate) antara bioavtur tersebut dengan avtur fosil sebesar 2,4 persen atau J2.4.

Terus dilakukan uji penerbangan bioavtur J2.4 dengan menggunakan pesawat CN-235 milik PT Dirgantara Indonesia pada Oktober 2021 dan Garuda Indonesia dengan rute penerbangan Jakarta-Solo pada Oktober 2023. Hasil uji terbang tersebut menunjukkan kinerja mesin stabil tanpa perbedaan signifikan dibandingkan avtur konvensional.

Keberhasilan itu otomatis picu optimistik dalam pengembangan bioavtur/SAF di Indonesia. Pengembangan bioavtur/SAF berbasis minyak inti sawit (J2.4) di Indonesia siap untuk masuk ke tahap komersialisasi. Faktor yang mendukung kesiapan tersebut adalah ketersediaan bahan baku dan teknologi HEFA serta kapabilitas eksisting kilang produksi coprocessing milik KPI sebesar 347 juta kiloliter per tahun (KPI, 2025). Produksi bioavtur/SAF J2.4 juga telah memenuhi sertifikasi teknis untuk aplikasi pada pesawat komersial dan telah lulus uji terbang.

Minyak Jelantah dan PFAD: Selain minyak sawit, terdapat produk olahan sawit yang berpotensi menjadi bahan baku SAF di Indonesia yakni minyak jelantah (used cooking oil/UCO) dan palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD). Minyak jelantah dianggap sebagai limbah dari penggunaan minyak goreng sawit, sedangkan PFAD dianggap sebagai by-product. Dengan status tersebut, pengurangan emisi siklus hidup dari SAF berbasis minyak jelantah atau PFAD lebih signifikan dibandingkan avtur fosil sehingga menjadikan kedua feedstock tersebut termasuk dalam positive list sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel dan mendapatkan sertifikasi keberlanjutan.

Sebagai bahan bakar pesawat yang berkelanjutan, SAF harus memenuhi kriteria berkelanjutan CORSIA sehingga dapat tergolong sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel (ICOA, 2025a; DGCA, 2025). Dalam publikasi ICAO (2025b), feedstock yang memenuhi kriteria sebagai CORSIA eligible fuel jika nilai life cycle assessment (default core LCA value) rendah dan tidak terkait secara langsung dengan konversi lahan (indirect land use change/ILUC) setelah 1 Januari 2008.

Penggunaan limbah seperti minyak jelantah sebagai bahan baku SAF memberikan keuntungan karena nilai default ILUC dianggap nol sehingga dapat mengurangi emisi lebih besar dibandingkan produk primer seperti minyak nabati atau lemak hewani (IATA, 2025).

Tidak cuma itu, SAF yang diproduksi dari minyak jelantah akan menghasilkan penghematan emisi karbon (carbon intensity) yang paling rendah dibandingkan SAF berbasis feedstock lain. Kemampuan reduksi emisi karbon dari penggunaan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah relatif tinggi yakni sekitar 84 persen dibandingkan avtur fosil (ICAO, 2021; Kemenko Marves, 2024).

Pemanfaatan limbah minyak jelantah ini dukung ekonomi sirkuler sehingga nilai keberlanjutannya semakin tinggi. Hal tersebut yang melatarbelakangi upaya pemerintah untuk mengembangkan SAF berbasis minyak jelantah (UCO) di Indonesia.

Dengan potensi minyak jelantah yang berhasil dikumpulkan sebanyak tiga juta kiloliter (TNP2K, 2020; Prasetiawan, 2022) atau sekitar 3,9 juta ton per tahun pada tahun 2023 (Kemenko Marves, 2024) diharapkan mampu mendukung pengembangan SAF yang memenuhi kriteria berkelanjutan CORSIA.

Keunggulan lainnya adalah penggunaan teknologi jalur HEFA untuk mengolah minyak jelantah (maupun RBDPKO) menjadi SAF tergolong sebagai teknologi yang relatif matang, aman, dan sudah dikembangkan di Indonesia.

Selain minyak inti sawit, PFAD, dan minyak jelantah, produk sampingan (joint product) dari tanaman sawit juga masih menyimpan potensi sebagai alternatif feedstock SAF. Produk yang dimaksud adalah POME dan TKKS.

Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) dan Tandan Kosong Kelapa Sawit (TKKS): Kedua feedstock tersebut tergolong sebagai kelompok limbah yang berpotensi memenuhi kriteria CORSIA eligible fuel dan mendapatkan sertifikasi keberlanjutan. Dengan menggunakan teknologi jalur HEFA, limbah POME yang kaya senyawa organik dan fraksi lipid berpotensi untuk diolah menjadi SAF.

Dengan menggunakan jalur teknologi fischer tropsch atau alcohol-to-jet, biomassa TKKS yang mengandung selulosa, hemiselulosa, dan lignin potensial untuk dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan baku SAF pada masa mendatang (PASPI, 2025).

With the evolution of tomorrow’s aircraft gathering pace, paired with alternative fuel sources and new powerplant types, several companies are seeking to take full advantage of the opportunities that may arise.

One such company is the European start-up MAEVE, which is busy designing its 80-seat regional jet, to be called the Maeve Jet MJ500. Maeve’s vision is to make aviation sustainable for millions of travellers and to reduce more than 50 metric tons of carbon dioxide from commercial airline routes by 2040.

Maeve’s strategy is to “develop a globally competitive aircraft family compatible with existing infrastructure, setting new standards in energy efficiency and economics.”

With its hybrid electric engines and sleek design, MAEVE’s latest Maeve Jet aircraft is being lined up to revolutionise the regional airline industry. But who exactly is MAEVE Aerospace, and what role will its aircraft have in the future of regional passenger aviation?

The MAEVE Aerospace story so far

MAEVE Aerospace is a European start-up in the development of sustainable and economic aircraft designs. With offices in Delft, The Netherlands, and Munich, Germany, the company was founded in 2021 to revolutionise the regional aircraft industry.

MAEVE is supported by private investors, the Government of the Netherlands, and the European Investment Council (EIC)

The company initially began designing a 44 to 52-seat regional aircraft in 2023. Called the Maeve 01, the early design was a high-wing monoplane with all-electric propulsion, including eight electric motors placed on the leading edge of the wings.

Initially expected to enter service in 2029, the model was initially marketed as offering a range of 288 miles (or 460km) on a single charge.

MAEVE Aerospace was positioning the Maeve01 as a zero-emissions aircraft to replace older ATR42s and DHC-8s and promised that it would be possible to fully recharge the aircraft in just 35 minutes.

Then, in late 2023, with the further development of hybrid electric propulsion systems, the company revealed its plans had morphed into developing an 80-seat hybrid-electric regional aircraft.

MAEVE said its new ‘M80’ aircraft had the potential to replace both turboprops and regional jets in the short-haul commercial airline arena. Images portrayed the M80 as a high-wing aircraft with a pair of wing-mounted hybrid turboprop engines and featuring a T-tail style design.

With the switch to hybrid-electric technology with the M80, the company said that the move would push the expected entry into service of its flagship aircraft back by two years to 2031.

But in return, the new aircraft would offer almost double the capacity of its predecessor, the Maeve01, and would also offer additional capability by increasing the range of the aircraft to around 800 nautical miles (1,482 km).

According to MAEVE’s website about the M80 model, “the M80 offers the performance of a jet and the efficiency of a turboprop, a game-changing combination.

“The M80 is a clean-sheet design with a newly integrated hybrid propulsion system, resulting in a significant reduction of mission energy and fuel consumption. This makes the Maeve Jet the perfect replacement for both the regional jets and turboprops.”

“To my knowledge, there are currently no alternatives in development that are equally sustainable, cost-effective, and match the operational needs of airlines and airports,” adds Martin Nuesseler, Chief Technology Officer at Maeve Aerospace in 2023.

“If there are, I would applaud them, because we need more of these realistic solutions to become sustainable”.

The M80 transforms into the Maeve Jet MJ500

In June 2025, MAEVE issued a new statement revealing that, following advice and guidance from its partners, it had completely resigned the M80, which had now become the Maeve Jet MJ500.

The aircraft was by this stage had now become a low-wing aircraft with two aft-mounted open-rotor/stator engines with a two-propeller style design.

According to the company, the new design of the Maeve Jet features reduced cabin noise, achieved by mounting small-diameter propulsors at the rear fuselage and a low wing to compensate for weight distribution.

While hybrid designs are not entirely emission-free, MAEVE claims that its Maeve Jet will consume 40% less energy than a traditional airliner of a similar size, such as the Bombardier CRJ900.

The company added that the Maeve Jet’s clean-sheet design and engine thermal optimization when operating at high altitude are also expected to contribute towards its overall energy efficiency.

Specifications for the Maeve Jet hybrid-electric regional aircraft

According to the company’s own published figures, the Maeve Jet has a Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) of 34,000 kg (74,956 lbs) and offers a maximum payload of 9,700 kg (21,385 lbs)

Operators of the Maeve Jet will have the capability of flying sectors up to 1,450 nautical miles (2,685 km) with a load of 76 passengers in a three-class configuration, which decreases to 950 nautical miles (1,759 km) operating with 90 passengers in a two-class layout.

The Maeve Jet is being designed to cruise at a maximum speed of 0.78 Mach, although normal operations will see the aircraft travel at 0.75 Mach. The Maximum Operating Altitude of the Maeve Jet will be 37,000 ft (11,277m).

In terms of runway performance, a Maeve Jet at MTOW will have a take-off run distance of 4,921 ft (1,500 meters) and a landing field length of 1,759 km (1,400meters).

While the aircraft is marketed as an 80-seater in a mixed configuration, the aircraft can accommodate up to 100 passengers in a single-class configuration.

More details about the hybrid-electric engines

At the Farnborough Air Show in July 2024, Maeve announced a major tie-up with RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada to collaborate on the design of the powerplants for Maeve Jet’s predecessor, the M80.

“As a clean sheet design, the performance and efficiency of the M80 will be a game changer for the regional aviation market, combining advanced aerodynamics and a disruptive propulsion technology,” said Martin Nuesseler in July 2024.

“Working together with Pratt & Whitney Canada at this stage of the programme will enable us to validate and optimise the design of the aircraft and hybrid-electric propulsion system, tapping into the full potential of this promising new technology.”

“Reaching the ambitious goals of reducing emissions and making aviation more sustainable will depend on combined efforts to accelerate technology innovation and drive collaboration across our industry,” responded Anthony Rossi, vice president, global sales and marketing, Pratt & Whitney Canada.

“It’s in this spirit that we will collaborate with Maeve, leveraging our growing expertise in sustainable propulsion technologies, as well as our unrivalled experience powering the regional aviation market for four decades.”

MAEVE states in its own publicity that the newly-launched Maeve Jet will feature two hybrid-electric powerplants with ’rotor swirl recovery vanes’ and continues to develop these engines in conjunction with Pratt & Whitney Canada.

Recent developments for MAEVE Aerospace

Following the announcement with Pratt & Whitney Canada on powerplant development, MAEVE revealed in November 2024 that it had entered into an agreement with Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries-Regional Jet Aviation Group (MHIRJ), where the companies agreed to cooperate with respect to the development of the Maeve Jet.

Under the agreement, MHIRJ will provide collaborative guidance in engineering and advisory services from MHIRJ’s team of regional aviation specialists.

More recently still, in June 2025, Japan Airlines (JAL) became the first major airline to come on board with the Maeve Jet project. With MAEVE, JAL Engineering signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on the development of the Maeve Jet.

The partnership aims to “play a key role in optimising the aircraft’s specification and ensuring that it meets the economic and operational requirements essential for supporting the Japanese regional network,” said a MAEVE statement.

JAL is expected to contribute its expertise in areas such as aircraft design, operations, and the establishment of a customer support framework for the Maeve Jet program.

JAL is also to collaborate in developing a new aircraft design system focused on maintaining and enhancing the airworthiness and reliability of the Maeve Jet.

The long-term view is that the Maeve Jet, with its lower emissions, could play a key role in making regional airline operations throughout Japan cleaner and quieter.

“This partnership aligns with the JAL Group’s continuous commitment to revitalizing local communities while maintaining and expanding its network,” said a JAL statement.

“We are honoured to be working with Japan Airlines on this project, with whom we share the vision to develop solutions that can generate an early impact without relying only on decarbonised fuels and further investments in new infrastructure,” added MAEVE’s Martin Nuesseler.

Future aviation growth opens up potential for the Maeve Jet

The regional aircraft market is forecasted to grow well into the next two decades. This growth, according to MAEVE, will be driven by the need for larger aircraft passenger capacities in the 70-90 seat range, where incumbent aircraft are aging and there has not been a new aircraft in this range for many years.

Meanwhile, increasing globalisation, industrial growth, and rising volumes of air traffic are continuing to drive record levels of carbon dioxide and non-carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.

Along with its green credentials and lower operating costs than a conventional jet, MAEVE’s strategy is to access this market with a clean sheet aircraft design “that sets new standards in sustainability and economics.”

MAEVE is targeting the Maeve Jet’s first flight for late 2029, followed by an entry-into-service for late 2032 or early 2033. This will follow an integrated product development plan based on the company’s experience and certification process.

“At MAEVE, we believe efficiency is the most powerful lever for sustainable aviation. Our next-generation aircraft reduces fuel consumption and emissions by 40% using conventional fuel, and by up to 95% when operating with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).”

“The energy efficiency not only cuts environmental impact but also lowers operating costs, making SAF-powered operations economically viable for airlines and accessible for passengers,” concludes the company.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MV2-32.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 11:56:26.722737

Sustainable Flight

A New Era in Aviation

At Otto Aerospace, we’re not just building an aircraft — we’re redefining the physics of flight. Our revolutionary laminar flow design isn’t an incremental improvement; it’s a complete rethinking of aerodynamic efficiency. By minimizing drag at a level never before achieved in commercial aviation, Otto’s aircraft represents an entirely new category — one engineered for the future of sustainable air travel.

The Sustainability Revolution in Aviation

Laminar Flow

Aerospace has long been constrained by the inefficiencies of traditional aircraft design. Our full laminar flow technology is a game-changer, drastically reducing fuel burn while maintaining high performance. This isn’t just about making aviation more efficient — it’s about transforming it into a cleaner, more innovative industry.

Slashing Carbon Emissions at the Source

Reducing fuel consumption is the most effective way to reduce carbon emissions in aviation. Our aerodynamic breakthroughs deliver an unprecedented 35% reduction in drag, slashing fuel requirements by up to 60%. When combined with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Otto aircraft reduces carbon emissions by more than 90%. That means significantly lower CO₂ output per passenger-mile, setting a new benchmark for clean aviation.

The Phantom flies at 500 mph on laminar flow airfoils with similar carbon emissions to EVs at 50 mph on wheels.

Reducing Contrails for a Clearer Sky

Contrails are a byproduct of jet engines and contribute significantly to climate change by trapping heat in the atmosphere. By enabling more efficient cruising at optimized altitudes with lower fuel burn, our laminar flow aircraft eliminates contrail formation, helping to further mitigate aviation’s environmental impact.",https://ottoaerospace.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Otto-Aerospace-Web-Thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 14:56:09.254968

Sejumlah inisiatif strategis dilakukan, mulai dari pengembangan biofuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hingga hidrogen hijau yang diharapkan mampu mengurangi emisi karbon sekaligus menjaga ketahanan energi Indonesia.

“Transisi energi harus dijalankan secara serius agar Indonesia tetap tangguh menghadapi perubahan global. Pertamina fokus tidak hanya pada energi ramah lingkungan, tetapi juga andal dan terjangkau,” ungkap Pjs. SVP Sustainability Pertamina, Indira Pratyaksa dikutip Minggu (14/9/2025).

Salah satu bukti konkret adalah penerbangan uji coba bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan atau Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang dilakukan oleh Pelita Air Service pada 20 Agustus 2025. Pesawat berhasil terbang pulang-pergi Jakarta–Bali dengan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan produksi Pertamina.

“Ini bukti nyata komitmen Pertamina mendukung transportasi hijau. SAF yang kami kembangkan sudah melalui uji coba bersama mitra internasional dan terbukti mampu menurunkan emisi hingga 85 persen dibandingkan bahan bakar konvensional,” jelas Indira.

Sementara Direktur Proyek dan Operasi PT Pertamina New Renewable Energy (PNRE) Norman Ginting menambahkan bahwa sektor transportasi menjadi penyumbang 36 persen konsumsi energi nasional dan sekitar 73 persen dari total konsumsi BBM nasional. Karena itu, transformasi energi bersih di sektor ini menjadi sangat penting.

T-tail designs were common in early jet aircraft, but the C-17 Globemaster's T-tail design adds to its stability.
During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency.
Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.
The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III.","Aircraft designs serve specific purposes, and the C-17 Globemaster is no different. Let's examine its tail, for example. Basically, to make room for its rear loading operations, McDonnell Douglas built the C-17 Globemaster with a T-tail. This allowed it to transport large loads of equipment at airfields quickly with ease thanks to the clearance. Another benefit of the horizontal stabilizer positioned high on the vertical fin and the airflow is stability during mid-air drops when the open cargo doors disrupt the air stream. Keeping the elevator away from engine exhaust and turbulent airflow, it also ensures a cleaner flow over the tail surfaces, which makes it easier to fly.

T-tail designs were common in early jet aircraft, but the C-17 Globemaster's T-tail design adds to its stability. Its simplified design reduces considerations for aerodynamic interferences and offers greater short-field performance. The iconic jet was ground-breaking when it was announced in the 1980s. Its reliability, flexibility, and performance were game changers.

Multi-Mission By Design

The C-17’s exceptional capacity for both military and humanitarian missions transformed strategic airlift not only for the US Air Force but allied powers as well. Despite a handful of early design flaws and a challenging manufacturing spool up, the aircraft first went into service in 1993. The T-tail and high wing offer greater clearance at the rear for cargo loading, unloading, and airdrops.

The C-17's speed and payload for supporting forward operations, even on improvised and short fields, solidified its role as a powerful tool for projecting global power. The C-17's primary features are its high speed, ability to land on austere runways, its global range (with aerial refueling), and high reliability. Its versatility has proven highly valuable in carrying out missions beyond airlift, like humanitarian relief, aeromedical evacuation, and special operations.

Steady, predictable handling during complex flight maneuvers and expeditiously performing ground operations are crucial to the C-17’s missions. The high-wing configuration is also beneficial to the same two ends, as is the robust landing gear. McDonnell Douglas' earlier experimental aircraft, the YC-15, is the origin of the T-tail on the C-17. The prototype demonstrated short takeoff and landing (STOL) capabilities for operating in austere environments, becoming the model for the C-17.

The Best Handling At Any Altitude

The T-tail design of the C-17 offers benefits like improved stall condition management, maneuverability, and consistent elevator response under all conditions. Pitch and roll stability is optimized by the C-17 Globemaster's anhedral (downward sloping) high-wing design, especially when carrying a heavy payload. The wing aspect ratio and configuration aid in lowering lift-induced drag during flight, and performs well going “low and slow” at high angles of attack.

During typical flying conditions, the T-tail design ensures a steady elevator response, lowering induced drag and enhancing rudder efficiency. The aerodynamics of the wing minimize the effect of wingtip vortices to reduce drag and improve the big jet’s performance. Better maneuverability and spin characteristics are also improved by the T-tail design, which maintains unobstructed airflow over the rudder.

Global Airlift Without Limits

Because the elevator’s airflow is less affected in the event of a stall, recovery is considerably easier to handle. A versatile and effective military transport aircraft, the Boeing C-17 Globemaster excels at handling large, heavy cargo and ensuring a steady elevator response.

Optimized For Short Fields

The C-17 can take off and land on runways as short as 3,500 feet (1,064 meters) and only 90 feet wide (27.4 meters). The plane can make a 180-degree star turn within 80 feet while on the ground, according to Air Force Technology. It is also capable of backing itself up with reverse thrust when on the ground. The directed flow thrust reversers can be used to go up a 2% gradient slope with a fully loaded aircraft.

The T-tail is designed to perform well both at low altitude during expeditionary missions and at cruise when the C-17 is transiting between air bases. Four 40,440-lb thrust Pratt & Whitney PW2040 turbofan engines, with engine thrust reversers and speed brakes, power the big jet. Its cruise speed is between Mach 0.74 and 0.77, and the range without in-flight refuelling is 2,400 nautical miles.

Aerial refuelling provides an intercontinental non-stop range that is virtually unlimited. The Globemaster III is capable of carrying payloads up to 77 tons. The aircraft has the capacity to carry 134 passengers, 102 paratroopers, six high-dependency medical patients or 36 stretcher patients, one CH-47F Chinook helicopter, or 18 military pallets.

Inside The Globemaster III

A variety of vehicles, palletized cargo, paratroopers, airdrop loads, and aeromedical evacuees can all be transported by the C-17 thanks to its cargo compartment. Three Black Hawk helicopters, four Bushmaster vehicles, and an Abrams tank are among the items that can be loaded into the cargo bay.

The pilot, co-pilot, and two observer positions are all part of the fully integrated electronic cockpit of the C-17 Globemaster III. Four Honeywell multifunction cathode-ray tube displays, two full-capability HUDs, and cargo systems are all part of the digital avionics system.

There is also a mechanically operated backup system for the electronic flight control system, which is quadruple redundant. The Northrop Grumman large aircraft infra-red countermeasures (LAIRCM) system is equipped with 56 USAF C-17 aircraft, with 25 upgraded aircraft entering service in 2007.

Over Three Decades Of Service

Boeing was a part of the program from the beginning of the C-17 aircraft's development and manufacturing in 2006. McDonnell Douglas eventually merged with Boeing in 1997, which saw the program fall under its widened umbrella. Currently, there are 275 aircraft in the global C-17 fleet serving the USAF and allied nations, including the UK, Canada, Australia, India, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and the 12-nation Strategic Airlift Capability.

Despite Boeing's announcement that C-17 production would end in 2009 once existing orders were completed, the USAF was authorized to purchase 15 more aircraft in 2008. In July 2008, Qatar ordered two C-17s, and in February 2009, the UAE declared that it would purchase four C-17s in January 2010. Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense awarded a follow-on contract worth up to $2.26 billion to Boeing for the sustainment of the C-17 fleet.

The Indian Ministry of Defence signed a $4.1bn agreement with Boeing in June 2011 to acquire ten more C-1s. The C-17 met all the IAF's requirements during rigorous field evaluation trials held in India in June 2010. Kuwait purchased two C-17s in 2014, along with equipment and training support. The final Globemaster III left the company’s production facility in Long Beach, California, in November 2015, marking the end of the production after more than two decades.

Boeing, in partnership with Mahindra Defence Systems, opened a C-17 training centre in 2016 to serve the Indian Air Force (IAF), and signed an $8m contract to train C-17 aircrews at its international training centre (ITC) in the UK under the NATO Strategic Airlift Capability (SAC) programme. It also trains Emirati C-17 students. Royal Air Force (RAF) C-17 engineers and aircrew are trained by Boeing at the C-17 International Training Centre (ITC) in Farnborough, United Kingdom.

The C-17 Goes Green

In 2021, Boeing told its defense customers that its military aircraft can run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) up to a 50% blend with conventional fuel. There are no technical problems with Boeing defense aircraft using synthetic aviation turbine fuels. All defense aircraft manufactured by Boeing and their derivatives were covered by the study as well. So on top of the smooth, steady, efficient flying that its T-tail and high wing deliver, it can run on eco-friendly fuel too.

When compared to conventional jet fuel, unblended, or ""neat"" SAF, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 84%. It also presents the industry's biggest opportunity to cut carbon over the next 30 years across all aviation segments. At the moment, a 50/50 blend with traditional fossil fuels is the highest amount of SAF that can be used in the C-17 and other Boeing military aircraft.

Brigadier General Darren Cole, Air Mobility Command (AMC) director of Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection, commented on the SAF program:

""The C-17 continues to serve as the strategic airlift workhorse for the nation, as evidenced by its impressive performance in the recent airlift of more than 124,000 evacuees from Afghanistan in an around-the-clock operation. As the command responsible for operating the U.S. Air Force C-17 fleet, AMC looks forward to the continued partnership with our Boeing teammates as we work to keep the Globemaster fleet healthy for years to come.""

Boeing has been a pioneer in making SAF a reality and has a long track record of advancing alternative fuels. In 2010, the company collaborated with the US Air Force on an in-depth fuel study as part of their efforts to certify the C-17 Globemaster to use SAF blends. The same year, Boeing also helped make possible the supersonic flight of a US Navy F/A-18F ""Green Hornet"" on a 50/50 SAF blend.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/why-did-mcdonnell-douglas-build-the-c-17-globemaster-with-a-t-tail.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-14 01:56:08.269599

This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.","Business travel is expanding significantly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which is already well on its way to becoming a global centre for corporate mobility. MENA is establishing itself as a top corporate travel destination as companies continue to turn their attention to emerging markets. The industry is growing faster than the global average, which is paving the way for a significant shift in the travel industry in the area.

Steady Growth and Investment Surge

In 2024, the MENA corporate travel sector was expected to reach a value of $18.1 billion, with a projected 6.1% year-on-year growth in 2025. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are increasingly aware of the region’s immense potential, pouring capital into its rapidly developing infrastructure. In fact, MENA’s business travel bookings saw a significant 40% surge in early 2025 compared to the last quarter of 2024, with the months of April and May marking peak travel periods post-Ramadan.

As global business increasingly turns its attention to the Middle East, projections suggest that the broader market will reach $270.8 billion by 2030. This growth will be propelled by continued infrastructure development, digital innovation, and strengthened economic ties with Europe and Asia, creating a fertile environment for both business and leisure travel.

Key Drivers of Growth

A major contributor to MENA’s expanding business travel market is the economic momentum seen in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. These economies are projected to grow by 4.2% in 2025-2026, compared to around 1.5% in Europe. A significant portion of this growth is being driven by diversification and expansion beyond oil and gas, particularly in sectors like technology, finance, and tourism.

One of the key drivers of the corporate travel boom is the massive infrastructure projects taking place in Saudi Arabia. Projects like Neom, Qiddiya, and the Red Sea development are attracting global talent, particularly consultants, engineers, and project managers. As these initiatives continue to unfold, they are expected to further bolster the demand for business travel in the region.

The Bleisure Trend: Business Meets Leisure

A notable trend in MENA’s business travel market is the rise of “bleisure” — a blend of business and leisure travel. In fact, 25% of business travellers are now extending their trips to incorporate leisure activities, particularly younger generations who prioritise work-life balance. This shift has prompted airlines such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Etihad, and Saudia to enhance their in-flight and ground services, offering more flexible and comfortable travel options to cater to this growing segment.

In response to the increased demand for bleisure travel, regional airlines have introduced new features such as lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible dining and entertainment options. This has made it easier for business travellers to balance work commitments with relaxation and exploration during their trips.

Sustainable Growth and Innovation

As MENA’s business travel sector continues to grow, sustainability efforts are being prioritised. The region is increasingly balancing expansion with environmental responsibility, incorporating carbon dioxide (CO₂) tracking and AI-powered cost optimisation tools into corporate travel operations. Platforms like Tumodo are now offering businesses the ability to forecast spending, track emissions, and ensure eco-friendly travel routes. This has led to reductions in emissions by as much as 20%, offering a more sustainable approach to business travel.

In line with regional goals to achieve net-zero emissions, several countries within MENA — including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar — have set ambitious sustainability targets. The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel, along with the use of green-certified hotels and infrastructure, is becoming a key part of corporate travel strategies in these countries.

Tech and Infrastructure: Key to Success

Alongside sustainability efforts, the role of technology in enhancing business travel experiences cannot be overstated. MENA is seeing a rise in digital platforms that support business mobility, such as travel booking services and logistics management systems, which help streamline corporate travel operations. The region’s investment in technology is paving the way for greater efficiency, transparency, and convenience in business travel.

Simultaneously, the physical infrastructure required to meet growing demand for corporate travel is being developed at a rapid pace. Saudi Arabia, in particular, is investing heavily in airport expansions, new rail projects, and hotel developments. This has created a robust pipeline of infrastructure projects, attracting both local and international investors.

Challenges and Investment Opportunities

While MENA’s business travel sector presents significant investment opportunities, investors are being cautioned to assess potential risks carefully. The massive scale of ongoing mega-projects presents a risk of market imbalance, especially if demand growth fails to keep up with infrastructure development. Furthermore, potential regulatory shifts related to visas, taxation, and ownership laws could affect the returns on investment.

For businesses seeking to capitalise on the region’s growth, there is a clear opportunity to invest in both physical infrastructure — including hotels, event spaces, and transportation hubs — as well as digital solutions that support business travel operations. However, investors must also consider the possibility of overcapacity in one area and shortages in another if infrastructure development does not keep pace with demand.

Future Outlook: A Global Leader in Business Travel

With its combination of economic diversification, cutting-edge technology, and sustainability initiatives, MENA is solidifying its position as a global leader in the business travel industry as it continues to expand. Saudi Arabia is uniquely positioned to spearhead this change with its Vision 2030 initiative and a strong emphasis on logistics, infrastructure, and tourism.

How well the area can serve the needs of both business and leisure travellers in the years to come will depend on its capacity to strike a balance between rapid growth, environmental responsibility, and technological innovation. As of right now, MENA continues to be a vibrant and alluring travel, business, and investment destination.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MENA-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 01:56:11.747259

Conclusion: A Sustainable and More Efficient Future of Travel Air passengers anticipating long-distance trips will appreciate the service entry of the Airbus A350F for more than just its technological marvels.","Long-haul fliers wanting flights that are more economical and environmentally friendly might be interested in the latest innovation now being tested in Toulouse, France, home to the latest development of Airbus. The aerospace-friendly city in France is currently constructing the new Airbus A350F freighter, the first of its kind in the new generation of freighter aircraft. Designed and built with a focus on sustainability and operational efficiency, Toulouse officials state it might have a major impact on both cargo and passenger travel in the next decade.

Toulouse has currently become the central hub of aircraft construction in France. The A350F, a derivation of the passenger A350-1000 model, is modified to satisfy the increasing requirement for sustainable aircraft. Major sections of the fuselage from construction plants all over France and Germany are now being assembled in Toulouse. Their architectural design, set out by the government’s aviation authorities, is built around emissions and fuel efficiency on a global scale.

Sustainable Aviation in the Center of Aviation

According to company officials, the A350F is likely the only choice an airline is likely to make when upgrading its fleet. This is due to its compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 2027 CO2 emission. It is, however, designed with cutting-edge features that let it remain far more efficient than its predecessors. Beyond the Rolls-Royce Trent, the A350F offers 2a 0% reduction in consumption, while the other freighters remain unchanged. More than that, with these planes in service, it offers passengers way more options.

In addition, government reports claim that the reduction in cost due to the A350F will indirectly cater to the needs of the consumers. Citizens, especially those living close to the airports, will benefit more than those boarding the flights. The quieter features of the aircraft can reduce pollution levels. Consumers newly introduced to airplanes, who have been disturbed by loud airplanes, will appreciate this feature. It is a huge step in improving aviation.

Elevating Passenger and Cargo Experiences

Even though the A350F is designed for the features that enhance the cargo operations, the design also aids in the passenger logistics by making air freight faster and more dependable. The aircraft is equipped with the class’s largest main deck cargo doors, which afford the airline the ability to carry goods along with passenger services. Transport analysts opine that smoother cargo operations could translate to essential goods such as e-commerce parcels and time-sensitive items being delivered faster to travelers, thus assisting the travelers indirectly.

The Aircraft can carry 111 tonnes and travel 4,700 nautical miles, which is suitable for long-haul to destinations such as Tokyo, Singapore, and Europe. The more recent governmental transport reports indicate that the development and incorporation of innovative flights into the airline fleets results in more accurate schedules and fewer delays overall. This enhances the overall passenger travel experience.

More Environmentally Friendly Routes and Worldwide Communique

With the support of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program, the A350F is certified to use up to 50% of SAF and plans to reach 100% use by 2030. Aviation authorities believe this is vital for cutting the carbon footprint of aviation. Passengers of long-haul flights may enjoy some positive environmental impacts of this aircraft, especially on transcontinental flights between Europe, Asia, and North America.

The government says Toulouse’s aerospace center has become a hub for cutting-edge innovation, with projects like the A350F and other aircraft technologies helping boost the country’s green transport objectives. Officials believe the A350F’s cockpit and cabin could provide seamless improvements to the environmental and operational aspects of the flights and services offered for the served cities.

Reducing Workload and Improving Well-Being for Users

Airbus has partnered with some cargo and airlines operating the A350F to ensure the aircraft is designed for operational efficiency and versatility. These include optimal fuselage volume, floor reinforcements for heavy loads, and variable configuration loading systems that improve indirect passenger travel by flight. These examples of sustainable infrastructure, in addition to making airline travel easier, also contribute to the center of travel systems that encourage new mindsets and systems.

Based on reports from authorities, the A350 passenger family has already logged millions of flight hours and the cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and cross-compatibility in type ratings and maintenance practices lessens the cost of training for the airline and streamlines the service offered to the users of the airlines. The airline’s ability to stick to the timetable offers passengers on routes served by the A350F improved reliability and comfort, with airlines better able to maintain timetables and minimize disruptions.

Impact on Travel and Logistics in the World

Airbus A350F is a construction milestone for the airline’s modernization because of the ability to combine flexible freighter and eco-sustainability. The more advanced the fleet, the better equipped the airline will be to provide its passengers with global connectivity through safe, reliable, and eco-friendly travel in response to the global trade and e-commerce boom, coupled with heightened environmental policies.

While airlines are adopting such freighters to respond to the growing global trade, e-commerce boom, and stricter environmental policies, travelers can expect comfort alongside lesser emissions as the assembled A350F, with test flights scheduled for 2026, will be ready, thanks to airlines. The airline’s industry in Toulouse regards the A350F as an indication of the aviation streamline of the future, merging the technological advancements in travel with the benefits brought to its passengers. Authorities point out the project’s features for aviation, showing that the growing aviation demands can still be positive for the planet.

Conclusion: A Sustainable and More Efficient Future of Travel

Air passengers anticipating long-distance trips will appreciate the service entry of the Airbus A350F for more than just its technological marvels. As part of the Toulouse ICT, its construction further cements the city’s legacy in the evolution of aviation. In the near future, the combined ease of mobility, the growing need for ecosystem-preserving technology, and enhanced aviation experience will enable passengers to fly long distances in greater comfort and lower emissions.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Airbus-A350F-Takes-Flight-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 21:56:07.808621

La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar.","Queridos lectores de LT9, hoy con Marcelo Kusznierz los invitamos a conocer un grupo de cultivos que en los últimos años se están abriendo camino en nuestros campos y también en las discusiones sobre el futuro de la agricultura. Se trata de la colza (Brassica napus var. oleifera), la carinata (Brassica carinata) y la camelina (Camelina sativa). Tres especies oleaginosas que, aunque emparentadas en algunos casos y con historias distintas, comparten un denominador común: su capacidad de diversificar las rotaciones, aportar sustentabilidad y generar productos de alto valor, desde aceites alimenticios hasta biocombustibles de última generación.

La colza tiene un largo recorrido en Europa y Canadá. Allí se la conoce más por su versión mejorada: la canola, que fue seleccionada en los años 70 para reducir el ácido erúcico y los glucosinolatos, lo que permitió su uso masivo en alimentación humana.

En los últimos 10 años las materias primas más utilizadas en la producción de biodiésel fueron los aceites vegetales, entre los cuales se destacan el de palma, el de soja y el de canola. Los países que producen biodiésel principalmente a partir de aceite de soja son Estados Unidos, Argentina, Brasil y algunos de la UE.

El aceite de canola, como insumo para su elaboración, se encuentra muy difundido en la UE, mientras que el de palma es muy utilizado en Colombia, Indonesia y el resto del sudeste asiático.

En la actualidad aproximadamente el 20% de la producción mundial de aceite de canola, así como el 19 % del de aceite de soja y el 18% del de aceite de palma se destinó a la producción de biodiésel, marcando la importancia de la plantación de colza a nivel global para los biocombustibles.

En Argentina, la colza comenzó a sembrarse tímidamente en los años 90 y tuvo un fuerte impulso en la última década, especialmente en la región pampeana, como alternativa de invierno frente al trigo.

La carinata, por su parte, es menos conocida. Se trata de una especie originaria de Etiopía, emparentada con la colza pero adaptada a climas más cálidos y secos. En nuestro país se la está probando en varias provincias con muy buenos resultados, sobre todo porque presenta tolerancia a altas temperaturas y genera un aceite ideal para la producción de biocombustibles de aviación (SAF: Sustainable Aviation Fuel), un sector con gran potencial de crecimiento.

Los combustibles sostenibles para aviación se definen como combustibles derivados de materias primas biológicas o no fósiles, que pueden sustituir o complementar a los combustibles para aviación derivados del petróleo, reduciendo las emisiones de GEI a lo largo del ciclo de vida del producto.

Según la AIE (Agencia Internacional de la Energía), mezclar biocombustibles sostenibles para la aviación de bajo contenido de carbono con combustible fósil para aviones será esencial para alcanzar el objetivo de descarbonización. Esto se refleja en su Escenario de Desarrollo Sostenible, donde se prevé que en 2030 los biocombustibles suplirán alrededor del 10 % de la demanda de combustible de aviación y, en 2040, cerca del 20 %. Asimismo, la IRENA (2020), en su “Transforming Energy Scenario”, estima que en 2050 el consumo de biojet llegará a los 100.000.000 m3, siendo los biocombustibles la única opción disponible para reducir significativamente las emisiones de dicho sector.

La camelina, finalmente, es una vieja conocida de la agricultura europea. Hay registros de su cultivo desde hace más de 3.000 años en zonas como Escandinavia y el Mediterráneo. Durante mucho tiempo quedó relegada, pero en la última década resurgió por sus notables ventajas: ciclo corto, rusticidad, bajo requerimiento de insumos y un aceite rico en ácidos grasos omega-3. Al igual que carinata tiene como destino principal el biocombustible.

Tanto la camelina como la carinata son materias primas utilizables para la producción de SAF, de acuerdo al proceso productivo de este combustible podemos detallar su correspondiente porcentaje de mezcla, procesos tecnológicos aprobados a través de la norma ASTM para la fabricación, su año de aprobación, las posibles materias primas por utilizar y el volumen máximo de mezcla con combustibles fósiles.

Aspectos agronómicos

Colza

Ciclo: 120 a 150 días.

Siembra: otoño, compitiendo directamente con trigo.

Requerimientos: necesita suelos bien drenados y buena fertilización nitrogenada y sulfatada.

Ventajas: excelente antecesor para soja de segunda, alta producción de biomasa que mejora la estructura del suelo.

Rindes: en Argentina varían entre 1.5 y 3 toneladas por hectárea, con picos superiores en condiciones óptimas.

Carinata

Ciclo: similar a la colza, aunque con mayor rusticidad.

Siembra: otoño-invierno, con adaptabilidad a ambientes más marginales.

Requerimientos: menos exigente que la colza en agua y fertilidad.

Ventajas: tolera altas temperaturas y sequía, genera un aceite con gran estabilidad oxidativa.

Rindes: entre 1 y 2.5 toneladas por hectárea en experiencias locales.

Camelina

Ciclo: muy corto, 85 a 100 días.

Siembra: puede implantarse a fines de invierno o principios de primavera.

Requerimientos: se adapta a suelos pobres y ambientes semiáridos.

Ventajas: bajo costo de implantación, rusticidad, posibilidad de entrar en nichos de rotación poco aprovechados.

Rindes: de 800 a 1.800 kg/ha, aunque con gran variabilidad.

Más allá de los mercados, estos cultivos aportan beneficios en el sistema que me parecen indispensables para una agricultura que piensa en un todo:

Diversifican las rotaciones y reducen la presión de malezas resistentes.

Son aliados frente a la huella de carbono: fijan CO₂ y, al destinarse a biocombustibles, reducen las emisiones netas del transporte.

Generan un uso más eficiente de la tierra, al ocupar ventanas de barbecho invernal.

En países como Canadá y Alemania, la colza ya forma parte estable del esquema agrícola. En Argentina, aunque todavía son cultivos de nicho, representan una oportunidad para productores que buscan diversificación y nuevas fuentes de ingreso.

Uno de los grandes retos para que colza, carinata y camelina despeguen en Argentina es la articulación de la cadena de valor. Se necesitan más acopios que reciban estas oleaginosas, más industrias dispuestas a procesarlas y, sobre todo, reglas claras de fomento a los biocombustibles avanzados.

En este sentido las Cámaras de Biocombustibles de Argentina están haciendo enormes esfuerzos para lograr un nuevo marco normativo, una nueva ley que potencie la producción de “combustibles del futuro” como pudo lograr nuestro principal socio comercial del Mercosur, Brasil, con potencialidades muy similares a las locales.

En la provincia de Santa Fe, por ejemplo, existen proyectos piloto con estos tres cultivos vinculados a universidades y empresas que trabajan en bioenergía. Estos ensayos muestran que hay potencial, pero que sin políticas activas y mercados garantizados es difícil que el productor se arriesgue a cambiar parte de su esquema productivo.

La agricultura global se enfrenta a un doble desafío: producir más alimentos y energía, y hacerlo con menos impacto ambiental. En ese contexto, cultivos como colza, carinata y camelina pueden convertirse en piezas clave. No reemplazarán a la soja ni al maíz, pero sí pueden ser complementos estratégicos.

En un mundo que avanza hacia la descarbonización, la demanda de biocombustibles de aviación crecerá de manera exponencial, y allí Argentina tiene la chance de posicionarse. Lo mismo con la camelina, cuyo aceite puede conquistar mercados premium de alimentos y cosmética.

Queridos lectores, la agricultura es movimiento constante, y quienes estamos en el sector sabemos que el futuro se construye sumando alternativas. La colza, la carinata y la camelina nos recuerdan que no todo termina en trigo, soja o maíz, y que existen caminos nuevos por explorar. Son cultivos con historia, con presente y, sobre todo, con un futuro prometedor si logramos integrarlos en nuestros sistemas productivos.

La pregunta que queda abierta es: ¿seremos capaces, como país, de darles el espacio y el impulso que necesitan?",https://www.lt9.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/camelina_corza_carinata.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 20:56:26.841238

Namely, the model delivered the highest satisfaction scores of any jet within the American Airlines fleet.
For starters, the Boeing 777X seems to be a far more natural replacement for the older-generation Boeing 777s already in the American Airlines fleet.","The Airbus A350 has long been identified as one of the widebody jets most likely to have an impact on airline fleet development for decades to come. The model, built in an industry-leading manner from unique composite materials, is capable of delivering a combination of range and capacity simply unmatched by any other model on the market today.

It is with these factors in mind that most major international carriers have worked the Airbus A350 into their long-term fleet development plans. Even long-time holdouts, such as Chicago-based United Airlines, have eventually shifted their mindset towards operating the twin-engine aircraft. American Airlines, however, has been a noteworthy exception.

We analyze the principal factors driving American's decision not to operate the Airbus A350, stemming primarily from the fact that other aircraft meet the jet's needs better. American Airlines had an Airbus A350 order in the past, but an interesting set of factors pushed the carrier to cancel this commitment. There are currently no plans to acquire A350 jets in the future, and the airline views its future exclusively in the hands of the manufacturer, Boeing, when it comes to widebody fleet development.

A Brief Overview Of The A350's Role In The Market

We view the Airbus A350 as the long-haul workhorse of choice for most major airlines, as it pairs an impressive range with lower trip and per-seat costs. An aircraft largely built from carbon-fiber composites and powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, the aircraft burns significantly less fuel than most previous-generation widebody jets, helping carriers hit their margin targets while also lowering emissions output with a relatively large aircraft.

The Airbus A350-900 serves long-and-thin routes while the larger Airbus A350-1000 targets large trunk markets in need of additional seats. This gives airlines a capable two-sized aircraft family that offers shared training and maintenance capabilities. We also see the aircraft's elevated level of passenger comfort through providing cabin pressurization and humidity improvement, as a key catalyst supporting the aircraft's generation of premium yields. From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A350 slots between the Boeing 787 and the larger Boeing 777/777X family, allowing airlines to find a right-sized aircraft that suits their capacity needs at a particular moment in time.

The aircraft also has an ultra-long range variant, one which is currently used exclusively by Singapore Airlines, that helps airlines link far-flung destinations which would have otherwise required stopovers. This helps support network differentiation and premium schedule capacity growth. The upcoming Airbus A350F extends the platform into the cargo market, helping replace older-generation freighters facing environmental restrictions. With sustainable aviation fuel compatibility and continued tweaks to its performance capabilities in the works, we see the A350 as a credible long-haul backbone that can be used by carriers to balance the needs of hub-to-hub and point-to-point missions. Lessors see the aircraft as an incredibly valuable asset for roughly the same reasons.

An A350 Order Inherited From US Airways

US Airways first committed to purchasing the Airbus A350 in 2005, penning an order for 20 aircraft in order to support an anticipated long-haul network expansion that would begin following its emergence from a restructuring process. Airbus redesigned the A350 program as the clean-sheet Airbus A350XWB, and US Airways actually elected to expand the deal to 22 Airbus A350 XWBs between 2007 and 2008. This included a Trent XWB engine selection with Rolls-Royce. In 2013, American Airlines merged with US Airways, transferring the order to the newly united carrier, according to reports from Reuters.

Initially, American Airlines planned the first deliveries of its A350 models between 2017 and 2018, with management electing twice to defer the schedule in order to manage capital spending and better preserve network flexibility with an international demand picture increasingly softening. In July 2016, American Airlines pushed the Airbus A350 stream to late 2018 through 2022, with deferrals averaging 26 months. The airline was looking for capital expense relief of around $500 million in 2017, which grew to $700 million in 2018.

Starting in April 2017, American Airlines began to move its first deliveries even further back to 2020, effectively turning this year-old commitment into essentially a perpetually unactivated option that the airline continued to avoid actually exercising. During this period, American Airlines was introducing Boeing 787s into its fleet, as well as refreshing its legacy widebody jets. The Airbus A350 was still a credible pathway for the airline's long-term fleet development, but it was becoming increasingly deprioritized.

Pulling The Plug In 2018

On April 6, 2018, American Airlines elected to terminate its order for 22 Airbus A350-900 jets, instead placing a new order for 47 Boeing 787s, including 22 787-8s, which arrived starting in 2020 and 25 787–9 models, which began arriving in 2023, according to Boeing. An additional 28 options were also secured by the carrier. We see this move as a calculated play taken by American Airlines to simplify its overall fleet strategy, including the shrinkage of the number of widebody types that American would be operating. The carrier quickly moved to retire the Boeing 767-300, the Airbus A330-300, and the aging Boeing 777-200ER, all in an attempt to simplify the carrier's fleet and reduce operating costs.

The American Airlines management team highlighted the Boeing 787's fuel-burning and maintenance advantages over the aircraft it was replacing, and that the aircraft's range was an ideal fit for American's network. We see another factor as a crucial element of American's decision-making process here. Namely, the model delivered the highest satisfaction scores of any jet within the American Airlines fleet. From a financial perspective, this decision was already locked in as a replacement order, which helped the airline limit capital expenses, after several rounds of Airbus A350 deferrals shifted cash towards where it was needed most.

American Airlines publicly thanked both manufacturers for aggressively marketing its jets, including the Airbus A330neo. However, the management team ultimately settled on the Dreamliner as the model that optimized operational and economic benefits while also establishing a growing Boeing 787 subfleet. This fleet standardization choice was, in our eyes, no technical indictment of the Airbus A350 as a model but rather a move that helped the airline better align its strategic and financial priorities.

What Is The Longer-Term Picture?

While we see American's decision in 2018 to cancel its original purchase of the Airbus A350 as driven by the need to reprioritize medium-term cash flows, we do believe that there were multiple long-term reasons why the decision was beneficial for the airline. For starters, the simplification of the airline's fleet offered a number of benefits which management was keen to realize. Specifically, operating fewer widebody jets allowed the airline to train employees on fewer different types of jets, keep fewer spare parts in store, and easily swap jets in its network. Expanding the airline's Boeing 787 fleet also delivered a number of scale-based benefits, with a small A350 subfleet mostly being a large cost burden on the airline.

A second factor we see as important in this decision is not just short-term cash flow reallocation but also long-term balance sheet discipline. The 2016–2017 deferrals of these orders demonstrated the airline's interest in lowering capital expenses, but in doing so, it also preserved the airline's long-term financial flexibility. The decision to focus on just one manufacturer and retire older, expensive aircraft helped the airline rebalance its assets and liabilities.

Beyond this, we do see the Boeing 787 as the ideal fit for American's transpacific and transatlantic networks, where the vast majority of long-haul revenue is generated. The aircraft is liked by customers, and it provides the optimal combination of range and risk that American Airlines was looking for. Through this introduction, the carrier also avoided the risks associated with introducing a new type of aircraft to its increasingly complex fleet.

Could This Have Been A Mistake?

While we do believe that the Airbus A350 would have been a weaker choice for American's broader network expansion plans, we see some benefits which could have eventually been realized had American Airlines elected to push forward with A350 fleet development. The aircraft is the most efficient large widebody in service today, with the Boeing 777X still sitting at least a year away.

The A350's exceptional reputation for passenger comfort could have been very useful for American today. The carrier is broadly lagging behind United and Delta in terms of premium network capacity and reputation for passenger comfort.

The jet itself is also exceptionally suited to certain kinds of high-density ultra-long-haul routes, which would be more effectively served by an A350 than the Boeing 787. The airline still lags its competitors in many ultra-long-haul markets.

Could American Order The A350 In The Future?

Just because American Airlines canceled its A350 orders in the past does not mean it could not order the jet again in the future. However, this seems relatively unlikely.

For starters, the Boeing 777X seems to be a far more natural replacement for the older-generation Boeing 777s already in the American Airlines fleet. The carrier also has a strong relationship with manufacturer Boeing, which it clearly is not thinking about changing.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bpeing-787-at-mia.jpeg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-13 16:56:13.164989

The sector is expanding faster than the global average — reaching $18.1 billion in 2024 and projected to grow 6.1 percent year on year in 2025, according to a report by UAE-based travel platform Tumodo. Investors, airlines, and hospitality giants are already taking note of the region’s transformative potential.

MENA’s business travel bookings surged 40 percent in early 2025 compared with late 2024, with April and May marking the busiest months post-Ramadan.

The broader market is expected to hit $270.8 billion by 2030, fueled by infrastructure development, digital innovation, and deepening economic ties with Europe and Asia.

“The impressive 50 percent year-on-year growth we’ve seen this year signals a shift from recovery to reinvention,” said Stan Klyuy, chief commercial officer of Tumodo, in the report, noting that average airfares are down by 12 percent and hotel bookings up by 2 percent.

Rita Raad, senior principal of strategy and transformation of the public sector at FTI Consulting, explained in an interview with Arab News: “The 40 percent surge in business travel bookings to MENA in the first half of 2025 reflects a powerful mix of regional momentum and shifting global priorities.”

She added: “Much of this growth is driven by the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), where the economy is projected to grow 4.2 percent in 2025-26 compared to about 1.5 percent in Europe, fueled by 3.7 percent non-oil sector expansion and diversification efforts.”

Oil and gas, technology, and finance remain the biggest corporate travel drivers, according to Raad, while Saudi Arabia’s giga-projects continue to draw waves of consultants, engineers, and operators.

Hassan Malik, tourism and sport consulting leader and partner at Deloitte Middle East, told Arab News that the region is indeed “witnessing a remarkable rebound and reinvention in corporate travel.”

A key catalyst of business travel growth, according to Malik, is “the influx of mega-projects and infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, like Qiddiya, Neom, and the Red Sea project, drawing global business and investment interest.”

Meshal Al-Faras, head of Middle East, Africa and Central Asia at Janus Henderson, told Arab News: “We are seeing a sustained shift in how international companies and investors view this region, and Saudi Arabia is a clear driver of that momentum.”

He added: “The objectives of Vision 2030 are being implemented at scale across infrastructure, logistics, finance and tourism. That level of clarity and execution attracts interest from global organizations that want to grow in a stable and high-potential market.”

Travel trends

According to Tumodo’s report, Saudi Arabia led as the top destination for users of the platform, accounting for 20 percent of all travel, followed by the UK at 15 percent, and France and India each at 10 percent.

Regional airlines Emirates, Turkish Airlines, and Qatar Airways dominated preferences, while India emerged as the most affordable route and the UK as the premium choice.

Regarding the trend for bleisure — trips that blend business with leisure — Raad noted: “The concept of bleisure continues to shape corporate mobility in MENA, with 25 percent of business travelers now extending their stays for leisure, especially among younger generations prioritizing work-life balance.”

She mentioned that airlines such as Qatar Airways, Etihad, Emirates, and Saudia were responding by enhancing their in-flight and ground services to cater to bleisure travelers.

These upgrades included features such as fully lie-flat seats, priority lounge access, and flexible entertainment and dining options, enabling passengers to work comfortably and relax during flights and transit.

Malik said that bleisure has now become mainstream, with many travelers extending work trips for personal time or combining them with relaxation. He noted that business travelers are increasingly staying longer to explore local destinations.

“Airlines are responding by introducing premium economy offerings, enhanced Wi-Fi, and flexible stopover packages, and Emirates and Etihad also now routinely promote wellness and sightseeing add-ons,” added Malik.

Al-Faras commented that the idea of business travel being limited to boardrooms no longer reflects how people operate, adding that executives want both flexibility and quality when they travel.

He added: “In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, we are seeing that expectation being met with strong investment in premium hospitality, high service standards, and facilities that allow people to work and relax in the same setting.”

Sustainability and tech

On sustainability efforts, Raad explained that MENA’s business travel sector is increasingly balancing growth with sustainability by embedding CO2 tracking and AI-driven cost optimization into corporate travel operations.

“Platforms like Tumodo now let companies forecast spending, measure emissions, and enforce eco-friendly routing — optimizing for shorter flights, sustainable hotels, and consolidated itineraries — and delivering emissions reductions of up to 20 percent,” she added.

Malik added that sustainability is becoming central to corporate travel strategy in MENA, noting that national targets in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar all aim for net-zero emissions in the coming decades through Vision 2030 and national energy strategies. He emphasized that “sustainability is increasingly core to corporate travel strategy in MENA.”

Malik noted that businesses are aligning procurement, travel, and logistics with green standards, prioritizing local suppliers and offset schemes via platforms like MENA’s Global Carbon Council, the region’s first voluntary carbon offsetting program.

Investor takeaways

Looking at investment opportunities, Al-Faras stated: “I believe the $270 billion projection is realistic as this growth is supported by what we are seeing across the GCC.”

He added that there is strong demand for physical infrastructure — ranging from airports and rail to hotels and event spaces — as well as for digital platforms that support business travel and mobility. Al-Faras noted that Saudi Arabia has developed a pipeline of projects in these areas and has shown “a clear willingness to partner with private capital.”

Raad cautioned that investors needed to carefully assess risks, as the massive scale of ongoing mega-developments could disrupt market balance if demand growth slowed.

She also highlighted potential regulatory shifts in visas, ownership, and taxation that might impact investment returns, along with increasing environmental, social, and governance pressures.

Companies are increasingly demanding low-carbon travel, which would require the timely adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and green-certified infrastructure.

Malik concluded: “Risks are very real, too. The biggest challenge will be timing and coordination. If infrastructure growth — number of flights, hotel rooms, venue capacity — doesn’t align across the board, there’s a risk of overcapacity in one area and bottlenecks in another.”

He added: “Regulatory complexity across countries and cities may slow seamless integration. Delivering not just on time, but to international quality standards, will be crucial to sustaining momentum.”

As MENA’s business travel sector surges, the region’s blend of innovation, sustainability, and economic diversification cements its status as a global leader — with no signs of slowing down.",,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:12.200137

The facility will transform forest byproducts, such as sustainably sourced wood waste and thinnings, into low-carbon fuels like renewable naphtha and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Governor Greg Abbott announced the project in 2022 with an initial $1.7 billion investment, which is expected to create over 140 permanent jobs. USA BioEnergy has secured more than 1,600 acres in Bon Wier for the refinery, aiming to turn an idle property into a clean energy hub by 2025.

The refinery has entered a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines for up to 680 million gallons of SAF. The facility plans to produce between 34 million and 65 million gallons of renewable fuels annually, contingent on the final design. USA BioEnergy confirmed the implementation of Honeywell’s Experion PKS control system at the Bon Wier plant, with Johnson Matthey also joining as a technology collaborator.

""By utilizing forest thinnings for bioenergy production with carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our integration with technology providers like Honeywell will help us create a fully integrated, alternative fuels solution,"" said Nick Andrews, CEO of USA BioEnergy.

The project is benefiting from approximately $150 million in state, county, and federal credits and tax incentives. Local support includes organizations such as the Texas Forest Country Partnership, Texas Forestry Association, and the City of Newton.

""This advanced-fuels facility development milestone underscores USA BioEnergy’s commitment to the future of aviation and energy security,"" Andrews said in a February statement. ""We also appreciate the opportunity to create good-paying jobs in Newton County, Texas, which has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the state. We are proud this project is a win-win-win for the area, the industry, and our business objectives.""

Once operational, the plant is expected to employ roughly 200 people full-time, alongside several hundred construction jobs during the build-out phase. The facility will also provide a new market for East Texas forestry byproducts, abundant in Newton and surrounding counties.

Despite the land purchase and new technology partnerships, construction has not yet begun. USA BioEnergy says engineering and design work is ongoing, with construction expected to take about two years once it starts. Full operations are projected for 2028 or 2029.

Lebih dari sekadar proyek energi, Green Hydrogen Ulubelu tetap menghadirkan peluang kerja, meningkatkan keterampilan masyarakat, dan membuka jalan bagi ekosistem ekonomi baru yang ramah lingkungan.

Pertamina kini optimis, keberhasilan transisi energi dapat tercapai dengan melibatkan masyarakat sebagai bagian dari perubahan.

Direktur Utama PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy Tbk, Julfi Hadi menekankan Pilot Project Green Hydrogen (Hidrogen Hijau) ini merupakan langkah strategis PGE menuju beyond electricity.

“Proyek ini menjadi bagian penting dari upaya PGE membangun ekosistem green hydrogen secara end-to-end, mulai dari produksi, distribusi, hingga pemanfaatannya untuk mendukung transisi menuju industri rendah karbon,"" jelas Julfi.

""Fasilitas ini tidak hanya sebagai pusat inovasi, tetapi juga model yang bisa direplikasi di wilayah kerja panas bumi lainnya, sekaligus membuka peluang percepatan off-grid solution untuk transportasi dan industri rendah karbon. Ke depan, peta jalan pengembangan PGE juga mencakup hilirisasi green ammonia dan green methanol sebagai solusi energi masa depan,” tambahnya.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi di Indonesia, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Seluruh komitmen tersebut dinyatakan sejalan dengan penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi Pertamina.

Pertamina Catat Produksi Migas Tembus 1 Juta BOEPD, Pendapatan Tembus Rp672 Triliun

PT Pertamina (Persero) berhasil menjaga kinerja operasional dan mencatat performa keuangan positif sepanjang semester pertama 2025 atau Januari hingga Juli tahun ini.

Langkah strategis Pertamina ini, dinilai sejalan dengan target pemerintah melalui Asta Cita untuk mewujudkan swasembada energi dan mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi nasional.

Direktur Utama Pertamina, Simon Aloysius Mantiri mengungkapkan capaian tersebut dalam Rapat Dengar Pendapat (RDP) bersama Komisi VI DPR RI di Jakarta, Kamis 11 September 2025.

“Pertamina mencatat beberapa capaian, di antaranya temuan cadangan migas baru sebesar 724 juta barrel setara minyak (MMBOE) di wilayah kerja Rokan,” ujarnya dalam rilis resmi yang dikutip, Jumat 12 September 2025.

Produksi Migas Stabil, Temuan Cadangan Baru

Lebih lanjut, Pertamina hingga Juli 2025, mengungkapkan bahwa pihaknya mampu menjaga produksi migas (minyak dan gas) tetap di atas 1 juta barrel setara minyak per hari (BOEPD). Selain itu, penemuan cadangan migas baru ini bakal memperkuat ketahanan energi jangka panjang di dalam negeri.

Simon mengatakan, paruh pertama tahun ini menjadi momentum penting karena Pertamina berhasil menjalankan sejumlah program strategis, mulai dari produksi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pertama di Asia Tenggara dengan kapasitas 9.000 barrel per hari, hingga pengoperasian PLTP (Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Panas Bumi) Lumut Balai berkapasitas 800 GWh (Gigawatt-hour) dan revitalisasi tangki Arun berkapasitas 127.200 meter kubik yang ditargetkan rampung pada akhir 2025.

“Pertamina SAF merupakan bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan yang dihasilkan melalui teknologi co-processing antara Kerosene (minyak tanah) dan Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah. Ekosistem bisnis UCO SAF bukan hanya mendukung swasembada energi nasional namun juga mampu mendorong perekonomian mikro dan ekonomi sirkuler,” terang Simon.

Proyek Energi dan Produk Hijau

Pertamina juga memperluas langkahnya melalui proyek Palawan di Filipina dengan kapasitas 285 MW (MegaWatt) serta meluncurkan Pertamax Green 95 di 160 SPBU dengan volume penjualan mencapai 4,83 ribu KL (Kiloliter) hingga Juli 2025.

Langkah ini menunjukkan keseriusan Pertamina sebagai perusahaan milik negara dalam mempercepat transisi energi, memperkuat ketahanan energi, sekaligus mendukung implementasi energi bersih.

Kinerja Keuangan Pertamina

Meski menghadapi tekanan dari penurunan harga minyak mentah, solar, hingga kurs dolar AS (Amerika Serikat) dibandingkan periode 2024, Pertamina tetap mampu menjaga kinerja keuangan.

Hingga Juli 2025, perusahaan energi pelat merah ini membukukan pendapatan USD40,9 miliar atau sekitar Rp672 triliun dengan EBITDA USD6,2 miliar atau sebesar Rp102,8 triliun.

Headline Takeaway:

(CTAS) faces a mixed outlook as weak technicals suggest caution, but strong fundamentals and positive money flows offer a counterbalance.

News Highlights

May 29, 2025: A new report on the fuel ethanol market highlights opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel technology, potentially benefiting sectors with green innovation ties. While not directly related to Cintas, it underscores broader industry tailwinds in sustainability.

May 31, 2025: A series of reports on aid looting in Gaza and geopolitical tensions in the region raise concerns over global supply chains and humanitarian efforts. These developments may indirectly impact logistics and supply-demand dynamics across industries, including Cintas' service areas.

May 28, 2025: A new Pentagon policy tightens oversight on the procurement of non-commercial products. This could influence procurement decisions in industries with strong government ties. While Cintas is not a defense contractor, its corporate services may see ripple effects in the logistics and safety sectors.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

The recent analyst activity for Cintas is limited but tells a story. The simple average rating is 3.00, while the weighted rating (adjusted for performance history) stands at 4.30. This suggests a slightly more optimistic outlook when accounting for the track record of the analysts involved. The lone analyst, Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital, has an 80% historical winning rate but has rated the stock as Neutral recently.

However, the current price trend is negative (-3.65%), which is at odds with the generally optimistic weighted analyst expectations. This divergence could signal market uncertainty or underperformance in the near term.

Looking at the fundamentals, Cintas scores well in several key areas:

Net income-to-revenue ratio: 16.13%, with a model score of 7.54 (internal diagnostic score). This is a strong indicator of profitability.

Basic earnings per share (YoY growth rate): 19.35%, scoring 7.54.

ROA (Return on Assets): 4.79%, with a score of 7.54.

ROE (Return on Equity): 10.45%, scoring 7.54.

These fundamentals suggest a company that is growing and efficiently using its assets, even if the stock price is currently falling.

Money-Flow Trends

Despite the weak technical outlook, money-flow patterns show positive momentum. The overall inflow ratio is 55.90%, indicating substantial institutional and large-cap investor interest. The Extra-large inflow ratio is 62.30%, which is a strong signal from big-money players. This suggests that while the retail sentiment might be cautious, institutional investors are showing confidence.

The fund flow score is 7.91 (internal diagnostic score), labeled as good, and the overall trend is positive, even as the Small and Medium trends are negative. This points to a mixed retail investor sentiment, while the larger market participants are leaning bullish.

Key Technical Signals

The technical analysis for Cintas is bearish. The stock has 0 bullish indicators and 2 bearish indicators, with 1 neutral indicator. The overall technical score is 3.94 (internal diagnostic score), and the trend is summarized as weak, with a suggestion to avoid the stock.

Key technical indicators:

WR Oversold: Score of 3.73 (internal diagnostic score), indicating a neutral to slightly bullish signal historically, but not strong enough to override the bearish trend.

Bearish Engulfing: Score of 1.47 (internal diagnostic score), a strong bearish signal with a historical average return of -0.23% and a win rate of 36.36%.

RSI Oversold: Score of 6.62 (internal diagnostic score), suggesting moderate potential for a rebound, but not enough to tilt the overall trend.

Recent chart patterns show that WR Oversold was active on multiple dates (September 10, 9, 5, 8), and Bearish Engulfing appeared on September 5. This indicates a recent bearish consolidation phase. The key insight from the technicals is that the direction is unclear and bearish signals are dominant.

Conclusion

Cintas presents a mixed outlook. While the fundamentals are strong and money flows remain positive, the technical indicators are bearish, with no clear reversal signals. Given the internal diagnostic score of 3.94 (technical) and 7.54 (fundamental), the stock is a candidate for cautious observers but not for immediate buyers.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd30b25e4bc001.png,N,,2025-09-13 17:56:37.982358

Petrobras produz combustível de aviação com óleo vegetal

Ainda nesta semana, a Petrobras havia anunciado que, pela primeira vez em sua história, produziu combustível de aviação com óleo vegetal, também conhecido como SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ou combustível sustentável de aviação).

Durante o teste na refinaria Henrique Lage (Revap), em São José dos Campos (SP), foi realizada a mistura a partir do processo tradicional de produção do querosene de aviação (QAV).

O SAF pode substituir diretamente o querosene convencional sem necessidade de alterações nas aeronaves ou na infraestrutura de abastecimento, uma medida prática para reduzir as emissões do setor aéreo.

O teor de óleo vegetal no produto atingiu o patamar de até 1,2%, um marco fundamental na produção de combustíveis mais sustentáveis para a aviação.

Além da Revap, a refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, obteve a autorização da Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF.

Veralto (VLTO) has seen a recent price rise of 2.67%, but analysts and technical indicators suggest a period of mixed signals and technical neutrality. The stock is currently caught in a tug-of-war between modest optimism and caution.

News Highlights

Recent news has largely stayed away from

, but global developments in the fuel ethanol industry and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have kept the broader market on edge. Here are two key developments:

New Ethanol-to-SAF Technology: A May 29 report from ResearchAndMarkets highlighted advancements in ethanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology. This could eventually benefit energy and biofuel firms, though Veralto itself isn’t directly mentioned.

Gaza Humanitarian Crisis: Reports of looted medical supplies in Gaza (May 31) have heightened global tensions, potentially affecting commodity and energy markets. While Veralto isn’t directly involved, such instability can indirectly impact investor sentiment.

Analyst Views & Fundamentals

Veralto has only one active analyst on the scene: Bobby Zolper of Raymond James, who has issued a ""Neutral"" rating in the past 20 days. This single voice doesn't provide a broad consensus, but it does highlight that expectations remain balanced for now.

Average rating: 3.00 (simple mean)

Weighted rating: 2.08 (performance-weighted)

Rating consistency: Analyst views are limited and show no strong dispersion, but the single rating is not bullish or bearish.

Price trend vs. ratings: The stock has risen 2.67%, but analyst expectations remain neutral. This suggests a mismatch between the current price action and broader expectations.

Key Fundamentals

The internal diagnostic scores (0-10) help highlight key financial metrics:

ROE (Return on Equity): 8.34 % → Score: 7.0 (moderate performance)

ROA (Return on Assets): 3.10 % → Score: 6.2 (room for improvement)

Net Profit Margin (Net income / Revenue): 41.42 % → Score: 4.1 (solid but not exceptional)

Total Profit Growth (YoY): 10.38 % → Score: 9.4 (strong positive momentum)

Net Profit Attributable to Parent Company Shareholders Growth (YoY): 15.50 % → Score: 7.5 (positive but less explosive)

Basic EPS Growth (YoY): 14.65 % → Score: 3.4 (modest gain with weak weighting in the model)

Veralto’s overall fundamental score is 7.04, suggesting a generally sound company, but with mixed signals in growth and profitability categories.

Money-Flow Trends

The big-money picture for Veralto is negative. All major inflow categories (Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-Large) show negative trends, with the overall inflow ratio at 47.38%. This means that capital is generally moving out of the stock, especially among institutional and larger retail players.

Small retail inflow ratio: 49.66%

Large institutional inflow ratio: 49.62%

Block inflow ratio: 46.96%

This suggests that while retail investors are still cautiously optimistic, larger players are scaling back or exiting the stock.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Veralto remains in a state of neutrality with no strong bullish or bearish signals. Here are the key insights:

Williams %R Overbought Signal: Internal score: 6.57 (suggesting limited strength)

Williams %R Oversold Signal: Internal score: 6.03 (mild bearish but not dominant)

Bearish Engulfing Signal: Internal score: 6.28 (cautionary signal, but not overpowering)

Recent Chart Patterns

Marubozu White (2025-09-11) – a strong bullish candle

WR Oversold (2025-09-03, 2025-09-02, 2025-08-29) – multiple bearish signals

WR Overbought & Bearish Engulfing (2025-08-28) – mixed signals

These patterns indicate a volatile and indecisive market — with long and short positions in a relatively balanced state. Traders are advised to watch closely for a breakout, as the current technical neutrality is unlikely to last forever.

Conclusion

With a technical score of 6.29 and a fundamental score of 7.04, Veralto is in a moderately watchful position. The recent price rise of 2.67% has yet to be matched by strong analyst consensus or strong technical momentum. While the company shows solid underlying fundamentals, the market remains cautious.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd380f2c538001.png,N,,2025-09-13 13:56:17.683983

Speaking to Turkish news agency Anadolu, Sargin said Boeing is “proud and pleased” that its partnership with Türkiye spans more than 80 years.

She stressed that Türkiye is not only a priority growth market but also a critical source of industrial, engineering, and technological capabilities.

Under the Boeing Türkiye National Aviation Plan launched in 2017, the partnership deepened in four key areas: industry, technology, regional services, and advanced capability development.

Turkish suppliers and global platforms

“Our supplier network in Türkiye covers over 20 companies in Ankara, Istanbul, Izmir, Bursa, Kayseri, and Eskisehir,” Sargin said.

“Turkish suppliers provide components for all current Boeing commercial aircraft in production, from the 737 to the 787, as well as for defense platforms such as the Chinook and P-8.”

Through Boeing’s Supplier Development Program, Turkish companies receive support to meet international certification standards, Sargin said, adding that the effort will boost Türkiye’s aviation exports “with a multiplier effect.”

Boeing has also invested in training and capacity building. The Newton Flight Academy, launched in Istanbul with FIRST Scandinavia and the Science Heroes Association, offers STEM-based aviation education to students aged 13–16.

The facility is equipped with full-motion simulators to inspire youth in aviation and space. The Boeing Engineering and Technology Center at Istanbul Technopark, opened in 2018, employs about 100 engineers. “This center not only contributes to global product development but also strengthens Türkiye’s capacity for future aviation leadership,” Sargin said.

Sustainability and future of aviation

Sargin said Boeing is committed to helping global customers and stakeholders meet sustainability targets, in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

She outlined five strategies: fleet renewal, advanced technology, renewable energy and sustainable fuels, operational efficiency, and market-based measures. Boeing’s latest models—including the 787 Dreamliner, 777X, and 737 MAX—deliver 20% to 30% greater fuel efficiency than the aircraft they replace, she said.

Sargin described sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as “the most effective solution over the next 30 years,” capable of cutting life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel.

Boeing is also investing in future technologies such as green hydrogen and electric flight.

Wisk, Boeing’s joint venture, has conducted over 1,750 test flights with a fully autonomous, all-electric air taxi since 2010. Boeing is also collaborating with NASA and GE Aerospace on a 1-megawatt hybrid-electric flight system.

Türkiye’s role in sustainable aviation

Sargin welcomed the sustainable aviation fuel mandate introduced by Türkiye’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation.

“For our country, this decision is an important step toward reducing emissions and aligns with global net-zero targets,” she said.

She emphasized Türkiye’s strategic position, noting its world-class airline and one of the world’s largest airports, and said Boeing is analyzing feedstock potential through the Türkiye Sustainable Aviation Platform (TSAA).

“We are evaluating the domestic biomass potential that can be derived from Türkiye’s agricultural sector,” she said.

Marking Boeing’s 80th anniversary in Türkiye, Sargin recalled that ties began in 1945 with the delivery of the first DC-3 aircraft.

“Today, Türkiye is not only a valued customer but also a critical part of our global supply chain, a hub of advanced engineering, and an important partner in shaping the future of sustainable aviation,” she said.

“From expanding our supplier network to investing in young talent, and from joint work on sustainable fuel platforms to next-generation technologies, we believe Türkiye will play an important role not only regionally but also globally in shaping the future of aviation.”",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2025/9/13/boeing-marks-80-years-in-turkiye-with-2b-in-procurement-focus-on-sustainability-3206848.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 06:56:24.059489

Durante o teste na Revap, foi misturado óleo vegetal ao processo tradicional de produção do querosene de aviação (QAV). O teor de óleo vegetal no produto atingiu o patamar de até 1,2%, um marco fundamental na produção de combustíveis mais sustentáveis para a aviação.

A Petrobras prevê que a produção comercial de SAF deve ter início “nos próximos meses”.

De acordo com o gerente geral da Revap, Alexandre Coelho Cavalcanti, a operação na Revap é “uma abordagem de menor investimento para a produção de combustíveis com conteúdo renovável, pois utiliza os ativos existentes”, avalia.

A consolidação da rota tecnológica de produção de SAF por coprocessamento é especialmente relevante para o mercado, considerando as futuras exigências do setor.

A partir de 2027, as companhias aéreas no Brasil deverão começar a usar, obrigatoriamente, esse tipo de combustível, com base na Lei do Combustível do Futuro e da fase obrigatória do CORSIA, que é o programa da Organização da Aviação Civil Internacional (OACI) para redução e compensação de emissões de CO2 provenientes dos voos internacionais.

Transição energética justa

Segundo o diretor de Processos Industriais e Produtos da Petrobras, William França, o avanço representa um marco tecnológico para a Petrobras e um passo importante para o Brasil no cenário global de combate às mudanças climáticas.

“A iniciativa demonstra o compromisso da Petrobras com a inovação e a sustentabilidade, preparando-se para atender às demandas futuras de um setor aéreo mais sustentável”, disse o diretor.

Recentemente, a Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, obteve a autorização da Agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF. A previsão é que, a partir dos próximos meses, a refinaria inicie a produção para comercializar.

Port Lotniczy Katowice w Pyrzowicach przechodzi prawdziwą transformację. Trwa największy w historii portu program rozwoju infrastruktury, którego realizacja zaplanowana jest aż do 2032 roku. Inwestycja ta umocni pozycję Katowice Airport jako ważnego węzła logistycznego w Europie, co przełoży się na rozwój gospodarczy regionu i kraju.

Co to jest multimodalny węzeł przeładunkowy i dlaczego jest tak ważny?

Sercem programu rozwojowego jest budowa multimodalnego węzła przeładunkowego towarów i paliw, który powstaje w oparciu o infrastrukturę kolejową. Nowy terminal cargo i zaplecze paliwowe budowane są w południowo-wschodniej części lotniska, na terenie dawnej bazy paliwowej, która została zrekultywowana w 2019 roku.

Kluczowym elementem inwestycji jest bocznica kolejowa, która połączy teren portu z linią kolejową nr 182 (Zawiercie–Tarnowskie Góry), aktualnie rewitalizowaną przez PKP PLK. Powstanie również specjalne torowisko przeładunkowe, składające się z trzech torów odstawczych o długości około 300 metrów każdy.

Dzięki temu możliwy będzie przeładunek towarów i paliw bezpośrednio między pociągami, cysternami a infrastrukturą lotniskową, co znacząco zwiększy efektywność transportową i logistyczną portu.

India is creating a plan through 2050 in response to the tightening of international regulations on aviation emissions, primarily through the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). For international flights, this plan calls for blending targets of 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030.

India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy. It aims to become a global supplier of green aviation fuels, in addition to meeting domestic blending targets, by leveraging its extensive bio-energy capacity and alliances with companies such as ISMA, Deloitte, and TERI. High manufacturing costs, classification difficulties, and feedstock sustainability remain significant challenges that require resolution.

Why Does India Need a National SAF Policy?

One of the industries contributing to greenhouse gas emissions at the quickest rate of growth is aviation. India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy, and it has become essential as India’s aviation sector grows. In addition to adhering to international regulations, this program aims to improve energy security and establish India as a player in the global green fuels market.

Global Compliance: SAF blending is crucial as India must adhere to CORSIA regulations after 2027.

Net-Zero Goal: India’s aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 is supported by a SAF policy, as aviation is a significant source of emissions.

Energy Independence: National energy security is strengthened by lowering dependency on imported jet fuel.

Export Potential: India can be positioned as a future center for SAF exports with a well-designed policy.

Industry Alignment: Coordinates efforts across several ministries, including Finance, Renewable Energy, Civil Aviation, and Petroleum.

What Are the Challenges in Scaling SAF Production?

India is developing a new sustainable aviation fuel policy, and its adoption is hampered by infrastructure, legislative deficiencies, and expense, despite its potential. Scaling is challenging due to high costs and classification obstacles, and securing a sustainable supply of feedstock is another urgent concern. India will require more research funding, improved incentives, and robust policy assistance to fulfill future demand.

High Costs: Synthetic SAF can cost up to seven times as much as regular jet fuel, and SAF is three times more expensive.

Classification Problems: Because SAF is still classified as a fossil fuel, it is not eligible for bioenergy subsidies such as the Gobardhan plan.

Feedstock Dependency: Diversification is necessary to prevent conflicts between food and fuel due to the current reliance on sugarcane, molasses, and bagasse.

Infrastructure Readiness: Networks for distribution, mixing, and storage must be upgraded quickly.

Global Competition: India is still establishing standards for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), while countries such as the US and Brazil already have them.

Côte d’Ivoire, one of Africa’s fastest-growing economies (projected 6.5 percent GDP growth in 2025), stands to benefit from enhanced exports

The A330neo offers a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions and is certified to operate with 50 percent SAF, aligning with EU environmental regulations and global decarbonisation goals.

Coincides with AfCFTA and SAATM initiatives, emphasising the need for infrastructure upgrades, customs modernisation, and regulatory harmonisation to unlock West Africa’s air cargo potential.

West Africa’s ambitions to emerge as a global trade and logistics hub took a decisive step forward this week with the delivery of Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first Airbus A330-900neo. The widebody aircraft, the first of two on order, was officially handed over in Toulouse on 4 September 2025, marking the Ivorian flag carrier’s entry into long-haul operations. For a region long dependent on foreign carriers and transshipment hubs, the addition of this next-generation aircraft signals a calculated strategy to strengthen direct trade links between Abidjan and major markets in Europe, the Middle East, and eventually North America.

The development comes at a pivotal moment for Africa’s aviation sector, which has defied broader global cargo headwinds. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), African airlines recorded a 10.8 percent year-on-year increase in cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs) in the first half of 2025, significantly outpacing the global average of 4.6 percent. Côte d’Ivoire’s own economic trajectory, with GDP growth projected at 6.5 percent in 2025 by the World Bank, makes this investment more than a fleet upgrade; it represents a long-term bet on West Africa’s capacity to compete in global logistics.

From regional carrier to global competitor

Air Côte d’Ivoire has operated primarily as a regional airline, serving 22 destinations across West and Central Africa. Until now, the carrier relied on narrowbody aircraft, limiting its ability to directly serve high-value export markets. The addition of the A330neo changes this equation, providing up to 20 tonnes of bellyhold cargo capacity per flight.

This expansion is strategically significant for the region’s exporters. Côte d’Ivoire remains the world’s largest cocoa producer, and agriculture continues to dominate trade flows, with cocoa, cashews, and coffee forming a significant share of airfreight volumes. Access to widebody capacity enables faster transit times for perishables, pharmaceuticals, and electronics, reducing dependency on European or Middle Eastern hubs that often add costs and delays to shipments.

For many African carriers, this kind of fleet renewal is more than a prestige move; it is about asserting control over trade corridors. By deploying widebodies from Abidjan, Air Côte d’Ivoire can position itself as a hub carrier, competing with regional giants like Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways.

Soft power and ESG strategy

The delivery flight carried five tonnes of humanitarian aid, including school supplies and health materials, to Abidjan. Coordinated by the Airbus Foundation and supported by Aviation Sans Frontières, this mission underlines Air Côte d’Ivoire’s emphasis on corporate social responsibility. Goods were distributed through NGOs LifeShine and La Bienfaisance to support education and health initiatives in Côte d’Ivoire’s capital.

While symbolic, these actions contribute to the airline’s ESG (environmental, social, and governance) narrative. As global shippers increasingly evaluate partners on sustainability and social responsibility, African carriers adopting ESG-focused strategies can strengthen international partnerships and attract cargo volumes from multinational clients seeking ethically aligned service providers.

A new trade and cargo hub for West Africa

The Gulf of Guinea region is emerging as a focal point for trade flows between Africa, Europe, and Asia. Abidjan’s geographical positioning offers natural advantages, enabling shorter flight times to Europe compared with southern African hubs and providing access to underserved markets in West and Central Africa.

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s A330neo deliveries come as part of a broader strategy to integrate the country more deeply into global supply chains. Côte d’Ivoire already accounts for nearly 40percent of global cocoa production, with annual cocoa exports exceeding $5 billion, according to the International Cocoa Organization. Diversification into high-value exports—pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, and electronics—requires the type of reliable cold-chain and time-sensitive logistics capacity that widebody aircraft can provide.

Data from WorldACD shows that African air cargo volumes surpassed 2.4 million tonnes in 2024, with growth concentrated on Africa–Europe lanes. Yet over 70percent of this freight was uplifted by non-African carriers. By building capacity and a hub model in Abidjan, Air Côte d’Ivoire could capture a greater share of these volumes, reducing reliance on foreign operators and increasing regional value retention.

Aircraft efficiency and regulatory compliance

The A330neo represents a leap in efficiency, offering a 25percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared with previous-generation aircraft. It is certified to operate with up to 50percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligning with Airbus’ ambition to achieve 100percent SAF compatibility across its fleet by 2030.

Such investments are increasingly critical for African carriers. Europe’s environmental policies, including the EU’s Fit for 55 package and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), place growing pressure on operators to demonstrate emissions reductions. For carriers like Air Côte d’Ivoire, fleet renewal is not only a competitive decision but also a regulatory one, ensuring continued access to lucrative European markets.

Ground infrastructure: A bottleneck to watch

While aircraft investments attract headlines, the success of this strategy will depend heavily on airport and logistics infrastructure. Félix Houphouët-Boigny International Airport, Abidjan’s main gateway, is undergoing phased modernisation, but industry insiders highlight the need for accelerated investment in cold-chain facilities, customs automation, and bonded warehousing to fully capitalise on new widebody capacity.

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), now operational, aims to boost intra-African trade by 52percent by 2030, according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa. Yet achieving this potential requires regulatory harmonisation, improved airport cargo-handling standards, and full implementation of the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM). Without these policy measures, even the most modern aircraft could be underutilised.

West Africa’s strategic positioning

The decision to expand internationally mirrors strategies seen in East Africa, where Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways have built globally competitive networks. However, West Africa remains relatively underdeveloped in terms of hub infrastructure. Abidjan’s rise could rebalance Africa’s air cargo map, creating new routing options for global shippers and reducing overreliance on Gulf and European transshipment points.

Africa’s economic growth trajectory supports this vision. According to the African Development Bank, West Africa is expected to post 4.1percent GDP growth in 2025, driven by agriculture, mining, and energy exports. Airlines that can bridge the gap between regional production centres and global markets will play a pivotal role in shaping trade patterns over the next decade.

Policy takeaways for stakeholders

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s A330neo delivery carries several strategic implications for industry and policymakers:

Diversification of Cargo Hubs: Building Abidjan as a hub can decongest overutilised gateways like Addis Ababa and Nairobi, spreading regional traffic more evenly.

Sustainability as Market Access: Fleet modernisation and SAF adoption will increasingly determine African carriers’ access to international markets, especially in the EU.

Infrastructure Development as a Priority: Aircraft orders must be matched with investments in airport cargo terminals, cold-chain systems, and customs digitalisation.

AfCFTA and SAATM Synergies: Greater regulatory coordination could unlock the full potential of regional air connectivity, encouraging intra-African trade growth.

From ambition to execution

The delivery of Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first A330neo is a landmark moment for Côte d’Ivoire’s aviation strategy, symbolising both ambition and opportunity. Yet its success will depend on coordinated policy action, infrastructure development, and strategic partnerships. If fully realised, Abidjan’s evolution into a competitive cargo hub could provide exporters with direct access to high-value markets, strengthen regional trade resilience, and enhance Africa’s bargaining power in the global logistics sector.

For air cargo professionals, this signals a broader shift; African carriers are no longer passive participants in international trade corridors but are positioning themselves as architects of new supply chain networks. The coming years will reveal whether this delivery marks the beginning of a transformative decade for West African aviation—or a missed opportunity in the face of persistent structural challenges.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Air-Cote-dIvoires-A330neo-image-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 06:56:42.997229

January 6 defendants

On his first day in office, Trump issued a mass pardon for approximately 1,500 people connected to the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Notable recipients included:

Oath Keepers and Proud Boys leaders: Commuted sentences for extremist group leaders like Stewart Rhodes, Joseph Biggs, Ethan Nordean, and other key figures involved in the riot.

Violent rioters: Pardoned dozens of individuals with records of violent offenses on January 6, including assault with a dangerous weapon against law enforcement.

Individuals with prior felonies: Some recipients of the January 6 pardons had prior serious convictions, including drug trafficking and manslaughter.

Esto significa que su producción está oficialmente habilitada para el suministro de biocombustibles en este sector estratégico.

La certificación representa un paso decisivo en el camino hacia la descarbonización de la aviación, ya que el biocombustible producido a partir de aceite de palma constituye una alternativa renovable frente a los combustibles fósiles tradicionales.

Según explicó Óscar Cifuentes, gerente general de Gremca, esta norma “permite, a través del incremento en la productividad, contar con materia prima certificada. En Colombia somos los primeros en lograrlo y, a nivel mundial, somos pioneros como empresa palmicultora. Este logro nos ubica en una posición de liderazgo, articulándonos con la Federación y con diversas entidades del sector para que la cadena productiva siga este ejemplo y avance hacia la certificación”.

Cifuentes también resaltó que el proceso no se limita únicamente al cultivo. “Es necesario certificar el aceite, el proceso de refinación y la producción de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel). De este modo garantizamos, en primer lugar, la seguridad alimentaria, ya que una parte significativa del aceite de palma continúa destinada a la industria alimentaria.

El objetivo compartido es consolidar un ecosistema en el que la palma de aceite no solo tenga un papel en la industria alimentaria, sino que también sea un insumo estratégico en la transición hacia energías limpias.

¿Cómo es el proceso para convertir el aceite de palma en biocombustible?

Respecto al proceso de transformación del aceite de palma en biocombustible, Cifuentes explicó que todo inicia en las plantaciones, donde se cosecha la fruta de palma. Esta se traslada a una planta extractora, en la cual se obtiene el aceite crudo de palma. A partir de allí, una cantidad específica del aceite certificado se destina a la producción de SAF. Posteriormente, el aceite es enviado a una refinería, donde se somete a procesos de blanqueo y desodorización para dejarlo en condiciones adecuadas para la siguiente etapa. Finalmente, en la planta productora de SAF, el aceite pasa por un tratamiento con catalizadores que transforman su estructura molecular, convirtiéndolo en un combustible apto para motores de aviación.

Este proceso, aunque técnico y complejo, responde a estándares de calidad internacional que buscan garantizar la seguridad, la eficiencia y la sostenibilidad del combustible resultante.",https://www.valoraanalitik.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gremca.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 11:56:17.894082

Abstract

The most viable way to decarbonize aviation in the near term is through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), most of which is currently produced via the deoxygenation of fats, oils, and greases (FOG) followed by a separate isomerization step. Multifunctional zeolite-supported catalysts offer several advantages over existing formulations, such as enabling the use of waste FOG streams, performing their deoxygenation via decarboxylation/decarbonylation (deCOx), and effecting the synthesis of SAF in one-pot. Previous work has shown that while supported Ni-Cu catalysts can afford excellent results in the conversion of waste FOG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via deCOx, zeolitic materials represent promising supports in formulations employed for the synthesis of SAF. In this contribution, catalysts involving different zeolitic supports and the same Ni-Cu active phase were prepared, characterized, and tested in the conversion of brown grease to SAF to identify the carrier affording the best results. A Ni-Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the highest conversion and yield of SAF-like hydrocarbons relative to formulations supported on ZSM-22, SAPO-11, or SAPO-34 (these catalysts being referred to herein as NCZSM-5, NCZSM-22, NCSAPO-11, and NCSAPO-34).

Graphical Abstract

1. Introduction

The demand for aviation fuel is expected to more than double by 2050 and triple by 2070 [1], which is of concern since aviation already accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions [2]. Given that the electrification of aircraft is in its infancy, the most promising way to decarbonize aviation in the near to medium term is through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can be produced from several feedstocks via different technologies [3]. However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported that >80% of SAF is produced via the hydroprocessing of esters and fatty acids (HEFA) [4]. Processes utilizing fats, oils, and greases (FOG) as feedstocks—such as HEFA—are expected to remain the primary way to produce SAF for the foreseeable future given the maturity and widespread use of this technology [5].

Current HEFA processes are mostly based on the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) reaction, which displays several shortcomings. Indeed, HDO-based HEFA requires large amounts and high pressures of hydrogen, which are typically only available at centralized facilities where this gas is produced from natural gas via steam reforming. In addition, HDO-based HEFA typically employs sulfided catalysts, which risk contaminating the product with sulfur [6,7], deactivate in the presence of water (a product of HDO) [7,8], are not regenerated online [9], and require FOG feedstocks low in impurities like phosphorus, metals, and free fatty acids (FFAs) [10]. Finally, SAF production via HDO-based HEFA involves separate deoxygenation and isomerization steps that result mainly in normal and branched alkanes but not in other SAF components, namely, cycloalkanes and aromatics. (Jet fuel—a mixture of C8–C16 hydrocarbons—comprises ~20 vol.% n-alkanes, ~33 vol.% iso-alkanes, ~27 vol.% cycloalkanes, and ~20 vol.% aromatics. These hydrocarbon families, respectively, confer jet fuel a high energy density, good cold flow properties, low freezing point, and seal-swelling properties [11]). This leads to SAF production facilities having separate units to (1) pre-treat the feedstock to remove impurities; (2) hydroprocess the pre-treated feedstock to yield n-alkanes; (3) isomerize the n-alkanes to iso-alkanes; and (4) separate the SAF from other fuel fractions via distillation, all of which adds complexity and cost.

Converting FOG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarbonylation/decarboxylation (deCOx) can avoid the drawbacks of HDO-based HEFA since deCOx reactions require smaller amounts and lower pressures of hydrogen and deCOx catalysts are typically supported metals that can be simple (non-sulfided), inexpensive (non-precious), and robust (resistant to deactivation). Moreover, these formulations can be regenerated online and upgrade waste FOG streams rich in impurities and/or composed mainly of FFAs such as brown grease (BG) [12]—i.e., FOG collected from wastewater streams—all of which is currently incinerated or landfilled [13,14]. Another advantage of deCOx formulations is that they can involve zeolitic materials as the support of multifunctional catalysts capable of performing deoxygenation and isomerization (but also cyclization and aromatization) reactions in “one-pot” [15]. Therefore, deCOx-based technology has the potential to convert currently unutilized waste FOG streams to a product mixture containing all families of hydrocarbons comprising aviation fuel and to do so in less steps or units, which can reduce both complexity and cost.

Previous work has shown that supported metal catalysts comprising Ni and Cu in a 4:1 proportion (by weight), can afford excellent results in the conversion of BG to fuel-like hydrocarbons via deCOx [12,16]. In addition, several zeolitic materials have been studied as supports for Ni-based catalysts used in the synthesis of SAF from oleaginous biomass, promising results being obtained using SAPO-11 [17], SAPO-34 [18], ZSM-5 [19,20], and ZSM-22 [21]. However, the literature lacks systematic studies in which the nature of the active phase and the reaction conditions employed are fixed and the zeolitic support is varied to identify the carrier(s) leading to the best results in the conversion of FOG to SAF. A notable exception is the work of Wang et al., who upgraded vegetable oil over Ni-based catalysts supported on SAPO-11, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, or β-zeolites and observed quantitative conversion, high isomerization activity, and decreased cracking over 8 wt.% Ni/SAPO-11, which was found to be the most promising among all catalysts studied [17]. The present contribution aimed to further address the aforementioned gap in the literature by supporting Ni and Cu in a 4:1 proportion (by weight) on several zeolitic materials and testing the resulting catalysts in the conversion of BG to SAF-like hydrocarbons via deCOx. The characterization of both fresh and spent catalysts was also undertaken to rationalize trends and elucidate structure–activity relationships.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Catalyst Synthesis and Fresh Catalyst Characterization

A series of catalysts involving 12 wt.% Ni-3 wt.% Cu as the supported metals and different zeolitic materials—namely, SAPO-11, SAPO-34, ZSM-5, and ZSM-22—as the carrier were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation employing the materials and methods described in Section 3.1. The synthesized catalysts were analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to experimentally determine their metal loadings. The results of these tests, which are summarized in Table A1 within Appendix A, show that the experimental loadings obtained are close to the nominal loadings targeted.

The textural properties of the bare supports employed and of the catalysts synthesized were determined by means of N2-physisorption, the results of these measurements being included in Table 1. The data in Table 1 clearly show that the textural properties of the bare zeolitic supports vary widely. For instance, surface area, which follows the trend ZSM-22 < SAPO-11 < ZSM-5 < SAPO-34, ranges from 59.6 to 525.7 m2/g. Unsurprisingly, the surface area of the supported metal catalysts is lower than that of the bare supports, since metal deposition causes some degree of pore filling.

The X-ray diffractograms of the catalysts synthesized are included in Figure A1 within Appendix A. The diffraction peaks so denoted are attributed to NiO, peaks at 37.3°, 43.3°, and 62.9°, respectively, representing its (111), (200), and (220) planes [22]. The fact that no peaks associated with Cu species were observed can be attributed to the lower Cu loading and/or to Cu species being highly dispersed, which is in agreement with previous reports on NCSAPO-11 [15]. The Scherrer equation was applied to the diffraction peak at 43.3° to determine the average NiO particle size, which afforded the values included in Table 1. The average NiO particle size ranges from 21.9 to 28.4 nm and it follows the trend NCZSM-22 < NCSAPO-11 ≈ NCSZM-5 < NCSAPO-34. Notably, the latter trend is the same as that observed for the surface area of the bare supports, which is at odds with the fact that carriers with a higher surface area would be expected to stabilize supported metals in the form of smaller particles and suggests the presence of amorphous and/or sub-nanometric Ni species not detected by means of XRD. Additional information regarding metal dispersion was acquired through H2 pulse chemisorption measurements, which resulted in the data included in Table 2. The trend observed for H2 uptake and metal-specific surface area—namely, NCSAPO-34 < NCSAPO-11 < NCSZM-5 < NCZSM-22—is also indicative of the metal dispersion trend followed by these catalysts.

More detailed information regarding the elemental composition and chemical environment of the surface of the catalysts surveyed was acquired via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, which were performed after reducing the catalysts using the conditions and approach described in Section 3.2. Table 3 summarizes the results of these analyses in terms of the surface concentration and oxidation state of the supported metals, while Table A2 and Table A3 in Appendix A provide more detailed information vis-à-vis the elemental surface composition and the supported metal species of the catalysts as determined via XPS. Full scans as well as Ni and Cu 2p regions of X-ray photoelectron spectra are included in Figure A2, Figure A3 and Figure A4 within Appendix A. The XPS analysis of NCSAPO-11 and NCZSM-5 clearly showed that the entirety of Ni is present in the metallic state in these two catalysts. Similarly, the low intensity of the Ni 2p3/2 satellite peak in the spectra of NCSAPO-34 and NCZSM-22 suggests that Ni is mostly reduced in these two formulations. However, the inhomogeneous character of these two samples precludes the neutralization of charging effects, which cause peak broadening and the appearance of a supplemental peak in the spectra of NCZSM-22 and NCSAPO-34, respectively, and make it impossible to accurately determine Ni0 concentration.

The most salient feature of the data in Table 3 is the surface concentration of the metals, which follows the trend NCSAPO-34 > NCZSM-22 >> NCSAPO-11 > NCZSM-5. However, the surface concentration of Cu0 shows a slightly different trend—namely, NCZSM-22 > NCSAPO-34 > NCZSM-5 > NCSAPO-11—which confirms that the reducibility of the surface metals varies across these catalysts. Indeed, the trend observed vis-à-vis the fraction that Cu0 represents of the total surface metal is NCSZM-5 > NCSZM-22 > NCSAPO-34 > NCSAPO-11. Admittedly, it is difficult to relate particle size information estimated from XRD, metal-specific surface area results from H2 pulse chemisorption, and surface concentration data on the supported metals derived from XPS. This can be attributed to the heterogeneity of Ni and Cu species expected to result from the deposition of these metals via impregnation on the zeolitic materials employed, since Ni and Cu can be expected to be present not only as nanoparticles but also as amorphous clusters and/or sub-nanometric species at different locations of the carriers. For instance, the fact that the Cu2O signal is observed at much higher binding energy than usual—see Table A3 and Figure A4 in Appendix A—may suggest an ionic Cu species exchanged on zeolitic Brønsted acid sites. Nevertheless, the results above provide valuable insights regarding the size of metal nanoparticles, metal-specific surface area, as well as the surface concentration and oxidation state of the supported metals.

The acidity of the catalysts used in this study was assessed by means of ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) given the importance of surface acidity to several reactions and phenomena of interest, including isomerization and cracking as well as coke-induced deactivation. In terms of total acidity, the catalysts followed the trend NCSAPO-34 > NCSAPO-11 > NCZSM-5 > NCZSM-22 (see Table 2), which is in overall agreement with previously reported acidity trends for the bare supports [23,24]. In contrast with previous reports focused on the bare supports, most acidity was found to be associated with weakly acidic sites (from which ammonia desorbs below 250 °C) albeit a smaller number of sites of medium acidity (from which ammonia desorbs between 250 and 400 °C) were also found to be present (see Figure 1). The fact that strongly acidic sites (displaying higher NH3 desorption temperatures) were not observed can be attributed to the fact that these sites would represent the main adsorption and anchor sites for metal precursors and particles, respectively. Thus, any strongly acidic sites—along with most sites of medium acidity—would be occupied during catalyst synthesis, leaving only weakly acidic sites and the relatively small number of sites of medium acidity observed.

2.2. BG Conversion to SAF

The BG sample used in this study was analyzed via gas chromatography (GC) and found to be composed entirely of C18 and C16 FFAs as shown in Table A4 in Appendix B. This feed was upgraded over the catalysts synthesized using the equipment and methods described in Section 3.3, the experimental approach employed used for the GC analysis of both the feed and the reaction products being described in Section 3.4. The results of these upgrading experiments and analyses are summarized in Table 4. Saliently, both BG conversion and the fraction of aviation fuel-range alkanes (C8–C16 hydrocarbons) in the reaction products follow the trend NCSAPO-11 < NCSAPO-34 < NCZSM-5 ≈ NCZSM-22, which suggests that 12 wt.% Ni-3 wt.% Cu catalysts supported on the socony mobil zeolites tested afford better results that the corresponding formulations involving the silicoaluminophospate zeotypes essayed. Parenthetically, the inferior conversion of NCSAPO-11 is likely not due to its relatively low concentration of surface Ni0 and Cu0 (see Table 3), which represent the active sites for the deCOx reactions. Indeed, NCZSM-5 affords quantitative conversion despite displaying a slightly lower concentration of Ni0 than NCSAPO-11 and the second lowest concentration of Cu0 of all catalysts tested. Similarly, differences in conversion cannot be assigned to the surface Ni0/Cu0 concentrations of these catalysts, since the ratios for NCSAPO-11 and NCZSM-5 are 10.5 and 3.0, respectively. Instead, differences in conversion can be attributed—at least in part—to the propensity of these formulations towards fouling and coking (see Section 2.3). ZSM-supported catalysts also afford better results than SAPO-supported formulations in terms of the selectivity to the hydrocarbon families comprising aviation fuel, since the catalyst supported on SAPO-11 and SAPO-34 displayed almost identical selectivity of ~88.5% n-alkanes, ~7.5% iso-alkanes, ~2.5% cycloalkanes, and ~1.5% aromatics. In contrast, the catalysts supported on ZSM-5 and ZSM-22 showed lower selectivity to n-alkanes and higher selectivity to the other hydrocarbon families comprising aviation fuel. Among these, NCZSM-5 afforded the highest selectivity to iso-alkanes and cycloalkanes, as well as a yield of aromatics within the 8–25% specified for aviation fuel [25].

To elucidate the fate of the oxygen atoms in the BG feed, the gas stream produced during the upgrading of BG over NCZSM-5 was analyzed with a refinery gas analyzer (RGA) and found to contain 0.45% CO and 0.26% CO2 as the only oxygen-bearing compounds, which is unsurprising since deoxygenation proceeds via deCOx. The other compounds detected by the RGA were hydrogen (the reaction atmosphere) and C1–C6 hydrocarbons resulting from COx methanation and/or the cracking of alkyl chains, which is consistent with previous reports [26].

Figure 2 shows the carbon number distribution of the product mixtures resulting from upgrading experiments. Irrespective of the catalyst support employed, most hydrocarbon products were found to be within the C8–C16 range characteristic of aviation fuel (with the remainder being ≥C17 hydrocarbons). However, SAPO-supported catalysts show noticeable differences in terms of the carbon number of the reaction products relative to those obtained over ZSM-supported formulations. Indeed, NCSAPO-11 and NCSAPO-34 yield a considerable and comparable amount of C15 and C11 hydrocarbons, these two carbon numbers representing the most abundant among the products obtained over these catalysts. In contrast, NCZSM-5 and NCZSM-22 afford much lower amounts of C15, since lighter (≤C13) hydrocarbons are favored among which C10 hydrocarbons are the most abundant.

These results cannot be readily explained by the relative acidity of the supports favoring cracking reactions—since ZSM-supported catalysts have a total acidity that is either slightly (NCZSM-5) or much lower (NCZSM-22) than SAPO-supported formulations—albeit this can be attributed to the fact that most of the acid sites in these supports are either weakly or moderately acidic (see Figure 1) with a relatively low activity towards C-C cleavage [27,28]. Instead, these results can be rationalized by invoking the metal-specific surface area of ZSM-supported catalysts, which is much higher than that of their SAPO-supported counterparts (see Table 2). Indeed, it can be argued that a higher concentration of surface metal sites would increase the metal-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of C–C bonds, which in turn would favor the formation of lighter—at the expense of heavier—hydrocarbons. The relatively low concentration of surface Ni0 within NCSAPO-11 can only partially explain the lower cracking activity of this catalyst, since NCZSM-5 displays a slightly lower concentration of surface Ni0 (see Table 4). In addition to the aforementioned heterogeneity of Ni and Cu species, the lack of a consistent trend in this regard can also be attributed to the relative distribution of these metals on the catalyst surface, since C–C hydrogenolysis reactions require contiguous Ni atoms to be catalyzed [29] and Cu can disrupt Ni adjacency [30], curbing cracking reactions through both geometric and electronic effects [12,30,31,32]. However, the ability of Cu to disrupt Ni adjacency and cracking reactions appears to be limited in these catalysts, since NCSAPO-11 displays a lower cracking activity than NCZSM-5 despite having a much higher surface Ni0/Cu0 concentration ratio (10.5 vs. 3.0).

Given that the results in Table 4 preclude the identification of NCSZM-5 or NCZSM-22 as the most active catalyst (since both formulations afforded quantitative conversion), upgrading experiments were performed in which the amount of BG employed was doubled relative to that specified in Section 3.3. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table A5 in Appendix B. Surprisingly, both catalysts displayed quantitative BG conversion and practically identical selectivity to C8–C16 hydrocarbons under these conditions. An additional effort was made to identify the most active formulation between NCSZM-5 or NCZSM-22 by halving the amount of catalyst relative to the amount used in the experiments that afforded the data in Table A5. However, conversion remained quantitative, which suggests that testing these catalysts in a fixed-bed reactor, which would allow for additional variables (such as space velocity and time on stream) to be investigated—represents a better approach to enable this comparison. Previous reports on the upgrading of BG over supported Ni-Cu catalysts indicate that fixed-bed reactor experiments are also the best was to study catalyst stability and recyclability [12]; however, those experiments fall outside of the scope of this work and will be the focus of a future contribution.

2.3. Spent Catalyst Characterization

In an effort to rationalize the results of BG upgrading to SAF, the spent catalysts were analyzed by means of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Indeed, TGA offers a way to determine the amount of type of the carbonaceous deposits that accumulate on the catalyst surface in the course of the reaction, which can in turn serve as a gauge for the catalyst deactivation caused by fouling and coking. Parenthetically, coking and fouling represent the main deactivation mechanism for supported Ni-Cu catalysts used for the conversion of oleaginous biomass to fuel-like hydrocarbons, since metal loss due to leaching or even the formation of volatile carbonyls has been found to be negligible [12,15]. The results of these TGA measurements are summarized in Figure 3. Saliently, the spent NCSAPO-11 catalyst displayed the most significant weight loss (~18%), which suggests that fouling and coking could explain (at least in part) the fact that it shows the lowest BG conversion among all catalysts tested. NCSAPO-11 is unique in the sense that it represents the only spent formulation displaying considerable weight losses below 400 °C—which can be assigned to the removal of residual solvent, reactants, products as well as soft coke—as well as weight losses above the same temperature that can be attributed to the combustion of hard coke or graphitic carbon [33]. Indeed, spent NCSAPO-34 displays the vast majority of its weight loss below 400 °C, whereas spent NCZSM-5 and NCZSM-22 undergo most of their weight loss above this temperature.

In short, it can be argued that coking and fouling can only be invoked to explain catalytic activity when the catalyst displays both a relatively low surface area and a high propensity for coking as is the case for NCSAPO-11. All other formulations display a moderate degree of coking (like NCZSM-22), a relatively high surface area (like NCSAPO-34), or both (as is the case for NCZSM-5). The analysis by means of TGA of the catalysts spent in the experiments resulting in the data within Table A5 seems to corroborate this conclusion, since the weight loss spent NCZSM-22 and NCZSM-5 displayed, respectively, remained unchanged and increased only slightly (see Figure A5 in Appendix B) with no impact on conversion. Lastly, it should be noted that the TGA results can only be partially explained invoking acidity. Indeed, the least acidic catalysts—namely, NCZSM-22—displays the lowest degree of fouling and coking as would be expected. However, the extent of coking and fouling observed for the other catalysts does not show a linear relationship with acidity, which suggests that other variables (like the concentration and relative distribution of Ni and Cu on the catalyst surface) are at play.

2.4. Catalyst Recycling Studies

The recyclability of the catalyst that afforded the most promising results—i.e., NCZSM-5 (see Section 2.2)—was assessed by testing this catalyst in five sequential BG upgrading reactions. Between reactions, the spent catalyst was regenerated through a procedure comprising a calcination step under static air (to remove carbonaceous deposits from the spent catalyst surface) and a reduction step identical to the one used before the first upgrading reaction (to re-reduce the supported metals oxidized during the calcination step). The results of these experiments are summarized in Figure 4.

Notably, BG conversion remained quantitative across all reaction cycles. Interestingly, the selectivity to C8–C16 hydrocarbons was 100% in cycles 1 and 2, dropped to 86.5 and 82.7% in cycles 3–4 (due to the formation of oxygenates and C19 hydrocarbons) and increased to 98% in cycle 5 (since much less oxygenates and no C19 hydrocarbons were produced in this last cycle). Parenthetically, the oxygenates detected in some products mixtures were aldehydes, alcohols, ethers, and ketones, which are produced in small amounts via the incomplete deoxygenation of FFAs in BG and through condensation reactions involving oxygenated intermediates. Finally, Figure 4 also shows how the selectivity to the different hydrocarbon families comprising jet fuel (n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cyclo-alkanes, and aromatics) varied significantly across cycles.

To rationalize these results, the post-mortem of the NCZSM-5 catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments was performed focusing on Ni-specific metal active sites and on surface acid sites associated with the zeolitic support. H2 pulse chemisorption results showed that the metal-specific surface area of the catalyst dropped from 1.414 m2/g in the fresh catalyst to 0.004 m2/g in the catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments, which clearly indicates a loss of metal sites likely due to metal sintering and coking. Similarly, NH3-TPD measurements indicate that the total acidity of the catalyst dropped from 1.44 mmol NH3/g on the fresh catalyst to 0.59 mmol NH3/g on the catalyst recovered at the end of the recycling experiments, which is indicative of a loss of acid sites attributable to the accumulation of recalcitrant coke deposits.

The results of recycling studies and of the post-mortem catalyst characterization suggests that metal sites within NCZSM-5 have a very high intrinsic activity, since conversion remained quantitative despite the loss of most metal sites. Moreover, changes in the amount of metal active sites and surface acid sites are in line with the changes in selectivity observed during the recycling studies, since structural changes are bound to affect the performance of the catalyst in cracking, isomerization, cyclization, and aromatization reactions. In short, although these studies show the recycling stability of the catalyst in terms of conversion, the results also show variance in terms of selectivity, clearly indicating the direction of future work. However, the latter falls outside of the scope of the present contribution and will be the focus of future studies.

3. Materials and Methods

3.1. Catalyst Synthesis

Catalysts were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation—using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA) and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as metal precursors and SAPO-11 (6% SiO2, 48% Al2O3; ACS MATERIAL, Pasadena, CA, USA), SAPO-34 (~0.5 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; ACS MATERIAL), ZSM-5 (30 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; Zeolyst, Kansas City, KS, USA), or ZSM-22 (65–80 SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio; ACS MATERIAL) as the support—targeting a Ni loading of 12 wt.% and a Cu loading of 3.0 wt.%. After drying under vacuum overnight at 60 °C, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 3 h in static air.

3.2. Fresh Catalyst Characterization

The fresh catalysts prepared were characterized using previously described equipment and methods for ICP [34], N2 physisorption [35], XRD [32], NH3 TPD [36], H2 pulse chemisorption [36], and XPS [15,32,37]. Briefly, ICP was performed using a Varian 720-ES analyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), while XRD was carried out on a Phillips X’Pert diffractometer (Philips Analytical, Almelo, The Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation at 0.02° step size. NH3 TPD and H2 pulse chemisorption experiments were performed on an Autochem II analyzer (Micromeritics, Norcross, GA, USA) outfitted with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a Thermostar mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer, Aßlar, Germany). For each experiment, 250 mg of catalyst was loaded into a U-tube quartz reactor connected to the instrument and heated by a clamshell oven. Prior to analysis, the catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 1 h under 10% H2/Ar. For NH3 TPD, after cooling the reduced catalyst to 30 °C, the sample was exposed to a flow (100 sccm) of 1% NH3/N2 for an hour before purging with a flow (100 sccm) of Ar for another hour to remove physisorbed NH3. The sample was then heated to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min while NH3 desorption was monitored using the mass spectrometer signal at m/z = 16. For H2 pulse chemisorption, after reduction the reactor was purged with Ar at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to 45 °C. Pulses of 0.025mL (STP) H2 were then introduced to the reactor in 3 min intervals using Ar (50 sccm) as carrier gas, the TCD being employed to monitor H2 breakthrough. Pulses were continued until the amount of breakthrough H2 detected via TCD became constant. For XPS analyses, catalysts were reduced under a flow of H2 at 350 °C for 3 h in a pre-treatment chamber connected to the instrument and allowing the transfer of pre-treated samples into the XPS analysis chamber without exposure to air. XPS was performed using a PHI 5000 Versaprobe—Physical Electronics (Chanhassen, MN, USA)–apparatus using a monochromatic Al Kα1 X-Ray source with energy of 1486.6 eV, accelerating voltage of 15 kV, power of 50 W, and spot size diameter of 200 μm. Spectra were processed using the CasaXPS software package (version 2.3.25PR1.0).

3.3. Catalyst Testing for BG Conversion to SAF

Catalyst testing was conducted in a 100 mL stainless steel reactor—Autoclave Engineers (Erie, PA, USA)—operated in semi-batch mode. After placing 0.5 g of the formulation to be tested in the reactor, closing the latter, and purging the system with Argon, the catalyst was reduced at 350 °C for 3 h under 100 psi and a flow (60 sscm) of 10% H2 in N2. Subsequently, the reactor was allowed to cool down to room temperature and the system was purged with Argon. Then, a solution comprising 1.8 g of BG—which was produced by “Greasezilla™” a product of Downey Ridge Environmental Company (Lansing, WV, USA) and has the composition in Table A4 within Appendix B—dissolved in 22.75 g of dodecane (99+% Sigma Aldrich) was introduced to the reactor through a port in the reactor head using a needle connected to a syringe containing the feed. After sealing the reactor, Argon was replaced with H2, which was used to pressurize the system to 580 psi and establish a flow of 60 sccm using a backpressure regulator and a mass flow controller, respectively. The reaction mixture was then heated to 375 °C and kept at said temperature for 3 h under constant mechanical stirring (1000 rpm). All experiments were performed in duplicate to ascertain both reproducibility and the statistical significance of the results.

3.4. Analysis of BG and Its Catalytic Upgrading Products

The identity and quantity of all compounds comprising the BG feed employed and the liquid products stemming from its catalytic upgrading were determined via dual detection GC using instrumentation and methods described in detail in a previous contribution [38]. Briefly, analyses were performed using an Agilent 7890A GC (Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with both MS and flame ionization detectors. The inlet was operated in split mode (split ratio 25:1; split flow 50 mL/min) using an initial temperature of 100 °C. The inlet temperature was increased immediately upon injection (at a rate of 8 °C/min) to a final temperature of 320 °C, which was maintained for the duration of the analysis. The initial oven temperature (45 °C) was increased upon injection first to 325 °C (at a rate of 4 °C/min) and then to 400 °C (at a rate of 10 °C/min). This temperature was then maintained for 12.5 min, making the total run time 90 min. An Agilent J&W DB-5HT column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.1 μm) rated to 450 °C was employed along with a constant He flow of 2 mL/min. Quantification was performed using cyclohexanone as internal standard. Agilent Chemstation and Separation Systems Inc. (Gulf Breeze, FL, USA). SimDis Expert 9 software were used to perform chromatographic programming and to process the chromatographic data acquired. Solvents (i.e., chloroform and dodecane) were quenched and subtracted prior to data processing. A representative chromatogram—corresponding to the liquid products stemming from the upgrading of BG over NCZSM-5—is provided in Appendix C as Figure A6. In addition, a table including the retention time (RT) of each peak in this chromatogram along with its corresponding compound name, compound carbon number (CN), and percent area under the curve (% AUC) is provided in the same appendix as Table A6.

3.5. Spent Catalyst Characterization

Spent catalysts were subjected to TGA using a Discovery Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer—TA Instruments (New Castle, DE, USA)—after being dried in a vacuum at 60 °C overnight to remove water. Dried spent catalysts held in a platinum TGA pan were heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under a flow (50 sccm) of air.

3.6. Catalyst Recycling Studies

Recycling studies were performed using NCZSM-5, the most promising formulation identified in catalyst testing runs. After each upgrading reaction, the spent catalyst was recovered via filtration, rinsed with chloroform, dried at 60 °C overnight in a vacuum oven, and calcined under static air at 450 °C for 5 h using a muffle furnace to remove carbonaceous deposits (see Figure 3). The calcined catalyst was then subjected to the same catalyst testing procedure described in Section 3.3, adjusting the amount of feed employed to keep the catalyst–feed ratio constant for five reaction cycles.

4. Conclusions

In this study, catalysts comprising Ni and Cu supported on various zeolitic carriers were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated for the conversion of BG to SAF. Among the tested formulations, a 12.8% Ni-3.2% Cu/ZSM-5 (NCZSM-5) catalyst exhibited the highest BG conversion and selectivity to SAF-like hydrocarbons. Specifically, the NCZSM-5 catalyst achieved a BG conversion of 99.9% and a jet fuel yield of 87.3%. Moreover, NCZSM-5 afforded SAF-range products containing n-alkanes, iso-alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics, all integral components of aviation fuel. The results obtained compare favorably to those recently reported by Ritmun. Indeed, this author also found that a 12.5% Ni-2.5% Cu/ZSM-5 catalyst displayed the best results among a series of Ni-Cu formulations supported on various zeolites—including SAPO-11 and ZSM-5—in the conversion of palm oil to SAF [39]. A notable difference is that while palm oil is an edible feedstock composed almost entirely of triglycerides, BG is a waste stream that is typically incinerated or landfilled and is 100% FFAs. The latter is significant, as current HEFA technology typically avoids feedstocks with FFA levels exceeding 25% [40]. This highlights the potential of BG as a viable and underutilized resource for SAF production.

Additionally, this study addressed a gap in the literature by systematically varying the zeolitic support while using the same active phase and reaction conditions in the conversion of BG to SAF. The findings demonstrate that ZSM-5 offers superior performance relative to other supports tested, including SAPO-11, SAPO-34, and ZSM-22. This contrasts with the results of Wang et al., who found that SAPO-11 led to the best results when they upgraded vegetable oil over Ni-based catalysts supported on SAPO-11, ZSM-5, ZSM-22, ZSM-23, or β-zeolites [17].

Overall, the results presented herein provide valuable insights into catalyst design for SAF production from FOG. Particularly, they underscore the role of zeolitic supports in optimizing performance and suggest that the latter may be dependent on the nature of the active phase and/or the feedstock employed.

While passenger demand rebounded swiftly in 2022 and 2023, structural challenges—ranging from decarbonization mandates to shifting consumer expectations—have created a complex landscape for profitability. As airlines grapple with these headwinds, the role of organizations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in shaping recovery strategies has become critical. This analysis explores the interplay between these structural challenges and the industry's path to sustainable profitability.

Structural Challenges: A New Era of Constraints

The most pressing structural challenge facing airlines is decarbonization. The aviation sector accounts for approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, and regulatory pressures to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 are intensifyingIATA - Airlines[ 1 ]. To meet this goal, airlines must invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), electric propulsion technologies, and operational efficiencies. However, these transitions come at a cost. SAF, for instance, remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel, creating a financial burden for carriers already strained by high debt levels from pandemic-era losses.

Evolving passenger expectations further complicate the equation. Post-pandemic travelers now prioritize health and safety protocols, digital convenience, and personalized services. Airlines must modernize IT systems, enhance contactless experiences, and invest in staff training to meet these demands—all while managing razor-thin profit margins. Additionally, the rise of low-cost carriers and ancillary revenue models has forced traditional airlines to rethink pricing strategies, often at the expense of long-term profitability.

Recovery Dynamics: IATA's Role in Shaping the Path Forward

Amid these challenges, IATA has emerged as a pivotal actor in guiding the industry. The organization's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, for example, provides a standardized framework for tracking and certifying SAF usage, enabling global compliance with environmental regulationsIATA - Airlines[ 1 ]. By streamlining this process, IATA aims to reduce administrative costs for airlines and accelerate the adoption of greener fuels.

Similarly, the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) program has reinforced operational resilience. Enhanced safety protocols not only rebuild passenger confidence but also mitigate the risk of costly disruptions—a critical factor in an industry where delays and cancellations can erode profitability. IATA's advocacy for harmonized global standards has also reduced fragmentation in regulatory requirements, allowing airlines to allocate resources more efficiently.

However, the road to recovery remains uneven. While major carriers in North America and Europe have shown stronger financial resilience due to robust domestic markets, airlines in Asia and Africa continue to lag. Currency fluctuations, geopolitical tensions, and underdeveloped infrastructure in emerging markets further strain their ability to compete.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risks and Opportunities

For investors, the airline sector presents a paradox: long-term growth potential is tempered by near-term volatility. The push for decarbonization, while essential, requires capital-intensive investments that could weigh on short-term earnings. Conversely, airlines that successfully integrate sustainability into their business models—such as those leveraging IATA's frameworks—may gain a competitive edge.

A key risk lies in the misalignment between regulatory timelines and technological readiness. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set ambitious carbon offset targets, but the scalability of current SAF production remains uncertain. Airlines that overcommit to unproven technologies risk stranded assets.

On the flip side, opportunities exist in ancillary revenue streams and digital transformation. Airlines that innovate in areas like dynamic pricing, loyalty programs, and in-flight connectivity could unlock new profit centers. The integration of artificial intelligence for demand forecasting and route optimization also offers a pathway to cost efficiency.

Conclusion

The post-pandemic airline industry is at a crossroads. Structural challenges like decarbonization and evolving passenger expectations demand strategic reinvention, while IATA's initiatives provide a roadmap for navigating these complexities. For investors, the key lies in identifying carriers that balance regulatory compliance with operational agility. As the sector transitions toward sustainability, profitability will depend not just on filling seats, but on redefining what it means to fly in the 21st century.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757703912846.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-12 23:56:23.933886

The aircraft, nicknamed “People’s Balus”, carries a special livery marking Papua New Guinea’s 50th Independence Anniversary.

Delivery is part of Air Niugini’s fleet modernisation plan, which includes eight A220-100s on direct order and three A220-300s leased.

The A220 family delivers up to 25 percent lower fuel burn than previous-generation aircraft and can operate with up to 50 percent SAF today.

Airbus has secured over 940 A220 orders globally, with more than 440 delivered and flying to 480 destinations.

Air Niugini, the national carrier of Papua New Guinea, has taken delivery of its first A220-300 aircraft, on lease from Azorra. The airline becomes the 25th global operator of the A220, which is now flying with carriers on five continents.

The aircraft, dubbed “People’s Balus”, departed the Airbus Final Assembly Line in Mirabel for a delivery flight to Port Moresby, with scheduled stops in Vancouver, Honolulu and Fiji. The delivery represents a significant milestone in Air Niugini’s fleet modernisation programme, with eight A220-100s on direct order with Airbus and three A220-300s being leased from Azorra.

The aircraft’s special livery marks the 50th Anniversary of the Independence of Papua New Guinea. The intricate design was brought to life by a dedicated Airbus team of 120 painters who worked to apply 11 distinct colours using a special airbrushing technique.

This delivery highlights the A220’s strong position in its segment, combining the longest range (6,700 km) with the lowest fuel consumption in its class – 25 percent less than previous-generation aircraft.

The jet, leased from Azorra, departed Airbus’s Mirabel final assembly line on 11 September for a delivery flight to Port Moresby, with stops in Vancouver, Honolulu and Fiji.

Dubbed “People’s Balus”, the aircraft carries a special livery celebrating the 50th anniversary of Papua New Guinea’s independence. Airbus says 120 painters spent weeks applying 11 colours using an intricate airbrushing technique.

“This is more than just the arrival of a new aircraft—it is the dawn of a new era for Air Niugini and Papua New Guinea,” says Air Niugini’s Officer in Charge(OIC) and Acting Chief Operating Officer, Captain Samiu Taufa. “The A220 represents our commitment to safety, reliability, and service excellence, while proudly carrying our flag into the future.”

The first of 11 Airbus A220s for Air Niugini

The aircraft is the first of 11 A220s destined for the airline: eight A220-100s are on direct order with Airbus, while three A220-300s are being leased from Azorra. The A220s will replace Air Niugini’s ageing Fokker 100s and 70s, which have long formed the backbone of its domestic and regional network.

Configured with 138 seats, Air Niugini’s A220-300 combines the type’s hallmark spacious cabin with the range and performance needed to serve both short-haul domestic sectors and longer regional routes. Airbus highlights that the aircraft’s fuel burn and carbon emissions per seat are around 25% lower than the previous generation it replaces.

Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines power the A220, while the airframe itself incorporates 40% advanced materials and optimised aerodynamics to reduce drag. The type can already fly on a 50% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a roadmap to full 100% SAF capability before 2030.

The 25th operator of the Airbus A220

Founded in 1973, Air Niugini operates a mixed fleet of around 20 aircraft, including Fokker regional jets, Boeing 737s, 767s and Dash 8 turboprops.

The airline serves over 25 domestic destinations across Papua New Guinea’s mountainous terrain and remote islands, as well as international services to Australia, Asia and the Pacific. Its Port Moresby hub is the primary gateway for the country, and the A220 is expected to bring new levels of efficiency and comfort to these markets.

With this milestone, Air Niugini becomes the 25th global operator of the A220, which has now amassed more than 940 orders and over 440 deliveries. For Papua New Guinea’s flag carrier, it represents both a modernisation leap and a strong symbol of national pride.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Air-Niugini-first-Airbus-A220.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 21:56:09.732296

Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab is contributing decades of airline operating experience to help Green Taxi optimize its electric taxiing system at airports for regional aircraft, though the vision extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline.
“Our Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what we can control today while we innovate future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development,” said Sangita Sharma, director of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab.
We had a clue this was coming back in August after meeting David Valaer at the Pris show.

Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab is contributing decades of airline operating experience to help Green Taxi optimize its electric taxiing system at airports for regional aircraft, though the vision extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline.

David Valaer, Founder and CEO of Green Taxi Aerospace, said, “This collaboration is about taking action today to show meaningful progress in aviation sustainability with technology that makes operations cleaner and more efficient.”

The Zero Engine Taxi™ benefits include the potential of saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel as a result of more efficient taxing processes that, in turn, contribute to cost savings.

“Our Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what we can control today while we innovate future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development,” said Sangita Sharma, director of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab.

Delta is committed to a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, and with around 90% of Delta’s carbon emissions coming from jet fuel, the global airline is focusing its efforts under three pillars: ‘What we Fly, How we Fly, and The Fuel We Use.’

Notes:

This partnership is a first in the US. We had a clue this was coming back in August after meeting David Valaer at the Pris show. We followed up with him for a conversation.

Airlines, being the competitive bunch they are, will not allow any competitor to have even a smidgen of advantage. Expect others to follow Delta’s lead.

This etaxi solution will likely find traction among regional jets first, so the Big Three are likely to be the first movers. Or the two others following Delta’s first move.

Regional jets spend a lot more time on a taxiway than bigger aircraft. They are likely to show the highest benefit.

Success among the US regionals is also likely to be copied elsewhere.

One last point: US regional airlines are desperate for a solution to their operational costs. They can’t get new fuel-efficient aircraft because of the myopic Scope Clause. But they can tweak their current fleets to extract better economics. Green Taxi is a step in that direction.

According to the department, Gina will engage with Japanese officials on international collaboration, demand stimulation, and supply chain development between South Africa and Japan.

The Ministerial Meetings will be held in collaboration with Expo 2025 Osaka, an event that brings together people and innovations from around the world to address global issues and showcase Japan's technological capabilities in achieving a hydrogen-powered society.

“The engagements will serve as a bedrock to create institutional foundations for market-based hydrogen trading and price discovery, an essential step towards legitimising hydrogen as a tradable energy asset,” the statement read.

Japan is committed to ensuring that its supply chains are secure, transparent and interconnected on a global scale.

The department said Japan also aims to establish global markets that will substantiate its investments in hydrogen production, transportation and utilisation technologies.

In advancing the sustainable fuels agenda, Japan's primary objective is to ensure the widespread implementation of sustainable fuels, particularly in industries that are challenging to regulate, such as aviation and shipping.

“The country has expressed commitment to expediting the global adoption of biofuels, e-fuels, and e-methane as part of its Initiative for Sustainable Fuels and Mobility with Brazil. In addition, Japan aims to diversify the global energy supply ahead of COP30.”

From 16 to 18 September, the Deputy Minister will engage in discussions with representatives from the Japanese government, academic institutions, and commercial entities, including Toyota, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, as well as the universities of Kyoto and Osaka.

The discussions will focus on science, technology and innovation-related matters, such as nanotechnology, carbon recycling, astronomy and space science technologies.

Green industrialisation

Speaking ahead of the mission, Gina said the Ministerial Meeting on Sustainable Fuels holds considerable significance for South Africa, as the government aims to expedite the diversification of its energy portfolio to foster sustainable and inclusive growth.

“For example, to reduce the carbon intensity within the aviation sector, South Africa aims to learn from Japan's advancements in sustainable aviation fuel. Accordingly, strengthening cooperation with Japanese research institutions and enterprises specialising in sustainable aviation fuels and renewable energy sources will be essential,” said the Deputy Minister.

Gina stated that the insights gained from the mission will be instrumental in developing a robust infrastructure for renewable hydrogen and sustainable fuels in South Africa, with the potential to transform key sectors of the economy.

These include the transformation of the energy and mining sector to decarbonisation operations and power generation.

Advancing the transportation and aviation sectors through the promotion of environmentally sustainable fuels and hydrogen-powered mobility will accelerate South Africa's transition to cleaner fuels, thereby reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.

In addition, South Africa's manufacturing sector supports the expansion of new industries in hydrogen storage, fuel cells and electrolysers, while the agricultural sector supports the production of low-carbon fertilisers and strengthens the food supply chain.

""These initiatives have the potential to promote green industrialisation, create jobs in energy-intensive industries, and enhance the resilience of transport and logistics networks, thereby supporting South Africa's broader social and economic development objectives,” said Gina.

The department said Japan remains a strategic ally for South Africa in scientific research, development and innovation since formalising a scientific and technological cooperation agreement in 2003.

“In future, the country aims to leverage Japan's expertise in vehicle manufacturing, electronics and the commercialisation of research to enhance collaborative initiatives in industrial development and technological innovation,” said the department. – SAnews.gov.za",https://www.sanews.gov.za/sites/default/files/2012/images/news_story_template/202509/gina5.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:56:32.311077

In adding marine vessels to the RFS, which already covers land-based vehicles and aviation, the bill would seek to put marine fuel applications on an equal footing with other fuel uses.
Moreover, Ms. Metcalf testified on Wednesday, the industry is also actively supporting international regulations on maritime shipping.","The global maritime sector underpins international trade, transporting over 80 percent of the world’s goods. Marine shipping is highly efficient, but the sector is still responsible for 3 percent of all global GHG emissions and ships burn approximately 300 million tons of fossil fuels every year. Although the energy intensity of shipping has fallen in the last two decades, the volume of shipping has increased by a greater amount, so energy use for shipping has increased by five percent since 2008.

The most used fuels in maritime shipping today are marine gas oil and heavy fuel oil – a fuel that results in significant particulate matter and smog in port communities. LNG is a small but rapidly growing fuel for shipping; biofuels account for less than one percent of fuel used for shipping.

Decarbonization of maritime vessels presents unique challenges. Vessels need access to fuels at ports, with resulting infrastructure requirements for the fuel supply, and fuels must have sufficient energy intensity to carry the vessels great distances. That energy intensity can also create safety challenges during storage. While vessels that are used in fixed trade patterns can be designed to use the fuels available at the specific ports at which they trade, chartered vessels must be able to refuel at any port.

Marine engines are also typically designed for a specific fuel type. The vessel size and tonnage requirements affect the engine choices and power needs, which dictate the fuels and propulsion system options. These needs, and therefore fuel options, vary widely across vessel types, from containerships, to tankers, to dry bulk carriers, to passenger vessels, to tug/barge units.

RFS for Ocean Going Vessels

On Wednesday, the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee explored this issue of maritime shipping during a legislative hearing in which the committee examined S. 881, the Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act, among other Clean Air Act legislation. S. 881 has been introduced by Senator Pete Ricketts, (R-NE) and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). The Committee called two witnesses to speak on this piece of legislation:

Kathy Metcalf, President Emeritus of the Chamber of Shipping of America

Nikita Pavlenko, Program Director, Fuels and Aviation, The International Council on Clean Transportation

The Renewable Fuel Standards program currently excludes ocean-going vessels; this bill would allow renewable fuels used in ocean-going vessels to generate and retain renewable identification numbers (RINs). RINs create revenues for vessel operators and help to narrow the price gap between renewable fuels and conventional fuels. In adding marine vessels to the RFS, which already covers land-based vehicles and aviation, the bill would seek to put marine fuel applications on an equal footing with other fuel uses.

However, as Mr. Pavlenko pointed out in his testimony, as an opt-in provision that doesn’t fully reduce the price gap between biofuels and conventional fuels, it is unlikely that the bill would materially expand the use of biofuels in marine shipping. A similar provision in 2014 amended the RFS to include jet fuel but has not materially affected sustainable aviation fuel production; a decade later, SAF blending in the aviation sector remains below 1%.

Moreover, the expansion of the RFS could have deleterious consequences if it resulted in the EPA proposed higher volume targets for the RFS, which could result in land use changes as a result of the increased demand for soybean and palm oil cropland. Particularly when land is being converted to biofuel production cropland is currently functioning as a major carbon sick, e.g. when rainforests and forest land are converted to cropland, this can result in significant net increases in carbon emissions despite the lower direct emissions profile of the biofuel.

The maritime industry is actively engaged in efforts to develop alternatives to diesel fuel, with research and development ongoing for a variety of fuels including ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, LNG, LPG, biofuels, and battery-electric hybrid. Moreover, Ms. Metcalf testified on Wednesday, the industry is also actively supporting international regulations on maritime shipping. While the Chamber of Shipping of America testified support for Mr. Ricketts’ bill, they “support that bill as only one piece of an overall strategy to address decarbonization of marine transportation”. Much more important than any potential U.S. regulation is the international framework that has been set forth by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

IMO Standards

The U.S. is one of 108 members in the IMO, and vessels engaged in international trade must comply with international requirements, regardless of whether the U.S. decides to adopt them. In April of this year, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved a Net Zero Framework that includes a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions. If approved by the full IMO, the standards will go into effect in 2027 and become mandatory for large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage.

The framework seeks to achieve net zero maritime GHG emissions by the year 2050 through prices on emissions above set tiers that become more stringent over time. While non-compliance with those tiers will result in penalties, shipowners will be able to purchase credits from over-complying vessels, creating a revenue stream to support low-emission vessels.

Shippers are largely supportive of the proposal. For instance Maersk, which operates in almost 130 countries, has urged the IMO to adopt them, calling the proposals ambitious, proportional, and enforceable measures.

On the other hand, the U.S. is actively opposing the adoption of the IMO standards. On August 12, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy jointly released a statement that described the IMO proposal as “Global Carbon Tax”. In the statement they threatened countries for supporting the regulations, saying “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail.” According to Reuters, the State Department is now actively approaching countries and threatening retaliation for support. For instance, the Netherlands was told it could face tariffs or other consequences if it supported the framework, according to a spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management.

Adoption of the IMO Net Zero Framework will require approval by a two-thirds majority of parties at their next meeting in October. There is also a 16-month period after approval in which one-third or more of the parties to the MARPOL Convention, or parties representing not less than 50% of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant fleet, can bring an objection. (Currently, the top five flag states are Liberia, Panama, Marshall Islands, Hong Kong, and Singapore – together they represent more than 50% of the world’s gross tonnage.) In April, 80% of voters approved the measure in the Subcommittee, with “no” votes primarily coming from oil-producing nations. It is unclear whether the pressure campaign from the U.S. will change the positions of the countries that previously supported and imperil adoption of the framework.

Biofuels and Soybean Markets

Unlike the Net Zero Framework from the IMO, Senator Ricketts’ RFS expansion bill is not primarily about addressing climate change. Underlying the pressure to expand the use of biofuels is the nation’s changed trading relationship with China under President Trump, and the implications that has for soybeans. By this point in last year’s soybean growing season, the U.S. had booked approximately 13 billion tons of soybean exports to China, whereas this year Chinese importers have yet to buy any soybean crops. China’s 23% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports have added approximately $2 per bushel to the cost of American soybeans, which has resulted in Brazilian soybeans being cheaper even during America’s peak growing season.

Soybean growers hope to expand the market for soybeans by expanding their use in fuel, in order to make up for the reduction in demand for American soybeans from China. However expanding the global market for soybeans could have profoundly negative consequences for global GHG emissions. Currently, the global supply of soybeans is expanding most in locations at high risk for deforestation, including Brazil, which has expanded production of soybeans by 35 percent over the past five years.",https://enotrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Maritime-Fuel-1030x579.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:56:36.559184

THE Federal government has revealed plans to commence the decarbonisation of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.

The Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo said the challenges posed by climate change demanded decisive, concerted action by stakeholders to embrace decarbonisation. He suggested exploring group electrification of aprons and terminals, sustainable aviation fuel, SAF, corridors and waste-to-energy projects to reduce emission in airport operations.

The minister, who disclosed this at a stakeholders engagement on carbon emissions management at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, NAIA, in Abuja yesterday.

Represented by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Dr. Ibrahim Kana, at the event organised by the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, FAAN, Keyamo said:

“The global aviation community stands at a crossroads. On one hand, we are drivers of economic growth, connectivity, and national development.

‘’On the other, we are duty bound to address our environmental impact with utmost seriousness. The challenge of climate change is not a distant theoretical concern; it is a present and pressing reality that demands decisive, concerted action.

‘’For Nigeria, a nation poised for exponential growth in air travel and trade, embedding sustainability into the very core of our aviation infrastructure is not an option, it is an imperative for long term, resilient prosperity”

Also speaking, the Managing Director of FAAN, Mrs Olubunmi Kuku, said climate change posed a threat to global aviation industry, with potential negative ripple effects on business and livelihoods, if not properly managed.

Kuku, who was represented by the Director of Human Resource and Administration, Dr. Luqman Eniola, said FAAN was committed to decarbonising its operations through implementation of strategic measures.

On the essence of the stakeholder engagement, she said: “This forum is expected to help FAAN understand emission management measures, so we can integrate them into our carbon management plan for the airport, where it is necessary.”

She hinted that the FAAN ACA Team and the Carbon Emission Reduction Committee, CERC, carried out mapping in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Enugu and Port Harcourt, noting that electricity consumption accounted for about 90 per cent of the total emissions for Lagos airport from 2017 to 2023.

Kuku said implementation of emission reduction measures for the Lagos airport has commenced, adding that more actions would be considered in the reconstruction and expansion of the airport’s terminal buildings.

“The Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, is also important to us and this is why we are hosting this event today to ensure that we hear from you, and we will journey together.

‘’As they say, ‘never walk alone’! We want to walk with you, and we need you to walk with us in our determination of net-zero emissions target in our airport operations,’’ Kuku said.",https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-50.png,N,,2025-09-12 19:57:08.184606

Fleet Modernization

The addition of these A320neo aircraft to WK’s fleet symbolizes the leisure carrier’s ambitious fleet modernization plans. It is indeed aimed at growing a fresh, more efficient, and environmentally friendly operating fleet.

Aviation Source News reports that three of the five aircraft will replace Edelweiss’s oldest Airbus A320s. Three aircraft with registrations HB-IHX, HB-IHY, and HB-IHZ have been in service with WK for 26 years.

These older aircraft will be replaced with newer, fuel-efficient A320neo models. The other two A320neos enable WK to expand its fleet. The expansion will allow the airline to increase capacity on its expanding route network. WK flies to various leisure destinations both within and beyond Europe.

Airbus A320neo Aircraft

The A320neo will benefit WK. It is known for cutting-edge technology, featuring Pratt & Whitney engines that deliver superior fuel efficiency and reduced noise levels. Enhanced aerodynamics, including wingtip sharklets, minimize drag, enabling longer ranges and more economical operations.

These next-generation aircraft will also allow WK to operate efficiently at airports with shorter runways or in high-temperature regions, ensuring operational stability.

""Global ammonia production is a little under 200 million tonnes annually - if you were to use ammonia in shipping, you could basically double that market between now and 2050,"" said panellist Stephen Jackson, CEO of Ammonia Europe, who stressed that Ammonia Europe sees the maritime sector as the ""main...lead market"" for green ammonia demand.
""We are predominantly targeting the maritime sector and pushing hard for the adoption of the IMO framework,"" continued Jackson, adding that for the ""new value chains"" the issue is ""demand, demand, demand.""
That could in turn help bolster the case for shipping firms to adopt ammonia as a marine fuel.

Speakers were discussing the outlook for the sector at the DARE2X ""What Can Brussels Do For Green Ammonia: European Industry, Policy and Regulations"" conference in the Belgian capital on Thursday.

""Global ammonia production is a little under 200 million tonnes annually - if you were to use ammonia in shipping, you could basically double that market between now and 2050,"" said panellist Stephen Jackson, CEO of Ammonia Europe, who stressed that Ammonia Europe sees the maritime sector as the ""main...lead market"" for green ammonia demand.

It is ""feasible"" that as much as ""900 million tons of ammonia"" could potentially be ""needed by 2050,"" said Topsoe's Rob Stevens, Secretary and President Emeritus at the Ammonia Energy Association (AEA), citing high-case AEA projections which identified the key demand growth areas as shipping, fertiliser, and for ammonia as a hydrogen carrier.

The problem facing green ammonia is ""developing the new end uses and ensuring that the fuel is available and available at cost for the new demand markets,"" stated Jackson.

""We are predominantly targeting the maritime sector and pushing hard for the adoption of the IMO framework,"" continued Jackson, adding that for the ""new value chains"" the issue is ""demand, demand, demand.""

""We need those demand signals, and we need the price of clean fuels to come down,"" said Jackson.

Regulatory risk

Asked whether the US government's recent threats against the IMO's net zero framework — seen by many as vital to making green ammonia viable as a marine fuel — might undercut projected maritime demand for green ammonia, panellists noted that an agreement could still be reached, without Washington's cooperation.

""We share similar concerns about the US trying to torpedo the whole agreement,"" said Jackson, but he stressed that in the maritime industry ""the US maybe doesn't weigh quite as much as it does in other sectors, and we do have good chances of getting [the IMO legislation] through.""

Similarly, Stevens said that the AEA is working with the IMO and emphasised the organisation's international structure, and suggested that shippers might come to use different fuels in different jurisdictions.

Ammonia and methanol

Participants at the conference highlighted ammonia's growing role in shipping, and panellists suggested that ammonia might be able to overtake its main rival as a green fuel, methanol, in the coming years.

There are five operational ammonia-fuelled ships and 69 firm orders, including 29 ammonia carriers and 28 bulk carriers, AEA data stated. And there are a further 415 ships on order which comprise 154 ammonia dual-fuel vessels and 261ammonia-ready, the presentation continued, also noting successful bunkering tests at Rotterdam, Singapore and Pilbara.

Citing legislation and the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector, Stevens predicted that ""aviation, in my opinion, is going to out-compete shipping for biogenic carbon,"" supplies of which may be limited. That could in turn help bolster the case for shipping firms to adopt ammonia as a marine fuel.

Engine specialists Everllence — formerly MAN-ES — predicted ammonia will be the ""most prominent fuel"" for shipping by 2050.

Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has announced that the blending of isobutanol with diesel will soon be scaled up. Gadkari made the announcement while speaking at The India Sugar & Bio-Energy Conference 2025 and stated that work has already started on it reports the Economic Times.

Gadkari also confirmed that ethanol blending with petrol has now touched the 20% mark. He added that the government is working on increasing the ethanol blend for sustainable aviation fuel as part of its wider strategy to strengthen India's renewable energy sector.

The minister explained that ethanol blending programmes have directly impacted crop prices. Corn farmers, for example, have earned more than ₹42,000 crore under the current initiative. Surplus crops, such as corn, are increasingly being channelled into the energy sector, helping to secure steady incomes for farming communities.

He further said India is producing surpluses of rice, wheat, sugar, and corn. Converting these into biofuels has significantly raised farm earnings across states. Ethanol production, he pointed out, has also relieved the sugar industry from delays in payments to cane farmers, ensuring smoother financial flows.

Gadkari addressed concerns raised over the ethanol-blended petrol programme mandating 20% ethanol in petrol, stressing that fears about engine damage and warranty lapses were unfounded. All government testing agencies, he noted, have confirmed that no technical issues exist in implementing E20 fuel across the country.

Gadkari recalled that several petitions had been filed against the E20 mandate, questioning its legality and safety standards. He highlighted that the Supreme Court recently dismissed those petitions, removing major obstacles to implementation. This cleared the way for nationwide adoption of E20 petrol without legal uncertainty.

Gadkari underlined that ethanol blending is improving incomes for corn farmers while strengthening India's energy security profile. This direct link between agriculture and energy, he said, represents a core element of the government's strategy to support farmers and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Impact of Isobutanol-Diesel Blending on Vehicles Aspect Details Fuel Properties Isobutanol has higher energy content and lower water absorption than ethanol, making it more compatible with diesel engines already in use across India. Emission Impact Blending isobutanol with diesel reduces smoke, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide. Small blending levels require no major engine modifications, easing adoption. Driver Experience Performance differences are minimal at lower blends. Vehicles run smoothly with little to no effect on mileage or engine behaviour. Sources
