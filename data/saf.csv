France-based Waga Energy on Sept. 29 released financial results for its fiscal half year, the six months ended June 30, reporting a 7% increase in total revenue, which was driven by a 39% increase in renewable natural gas (RNG) production revenues.

The company’s portfolio of landfill gas-to-RNG projects injected 326 gigawatt hours (GWh), or 1.1 million MMBtu, of RNG across France, Spain, Canada and the U.S., a 28% increase when compared to same period of 2024. That volume of RNG production avoided an estimated 80,500 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions by displacing fossil natural gas in energy grids.

Bringing down the costs of SAF via strategies including public and private investment, market measures, and cost sharing is crucial for building widespread support for its deployment. This piece explores both the challenges and opportunities for bringing down the cost of SAF.

Although SAF can be made from many different materials and conversion processes, all of them are currently costlier than fossil jet fuel. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency estimated that the average production cost of SAF in 2024 ranged from €1,461 per tonne (for biofuels) to €7,695 per tonne (for e-fuels). We calculate that this is a cost premium of 2.1–10.6x compared with fossil jet fuel by converting fossil jet production costs from the International Energy Agency, reported in U.S. dollars per liter, into equivalent units. While e-fuel costs should come down when they arrive on the market around 2030, they are expected to remain far above the current price of fossil jet fuel.

The cost of SAF is primarily driven by the cost of its feedstock. For example, virgin vegetable oil is more expensive than the kerosene it is displacing. Making waste-based SAF with high cellulosic content is expensive due to inefficient supply chains for sourcing raw material and the enzymes needed to break down feedstocks into “drop-in” fuel. E-fuels, meanwhile, require high quantities of renewable electricity to produce renewable hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen produced via electrolysis using 100% renewable electricity) and extract diluted carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Risk of investment

It takes up to 5 years for SAF projects to reach final investment decision—a critical stage during project development that indicates whether projects are ready to move forward to construction—and many projects fail before this is achieved. Earlier this year, consulting group BCG found that fewer than 30% of SAF projects globally have reached final investment decision. Often projects come apart due to technology “valleys of death” during the transition between the demonstration and commercialization stages. This can be the result of poor project financing, mismanagement, or unforeseen technical barriers. SAF projects require significant funding and investor backing, particularly when constructing first-of-a-kind (FOAK) facilities. If funding support fluctuates (as it has with the recently revised 45Z tax credits in the United States), if producers cannot secure long-term offtake agreements, or if governments and other investors do not provide sufficient loan support, SAF projects may fail before final investment decision.

Fulcrum BioEnergy, which broke ground on a plant in Reno, Nevada, in 2016 and filed for bankruptcy in 2024, serves as a cautionary tale for FAOK facility deployment. The project failed in part because plant managers did not prepare for technical challenges similar to those that arose during a previous high-profile gasification project, the project failed to meet overly optimistic production deadlines, and representatives overstated progress that cost them the trust of investors. An expert retrospective assessment of this case suggests that greater transparency, improved risk management, and the use of third-party assessments could help future FOAK projects move from the development to commercialization stage.

From a financial perspective, investing in “advanced” SAF pathways requires a combination of “technology push” and “market pull” to overcome the “valleys of death” and reach commercialization. As of now, regions such as the United Kingdom and European Union have put SAF mandates in place with penalties for non-compliance; these are examples of a market pull. However, airlines have criticized the high cost of SAF purchases and called on regulators in these regions to review the timeline and trajectory of mandates amidst rising prices. Additionally, rather than being part of the technology push, the fossil fuel industry appears slow to act.

Market mechanisms

The United Kingdom has offered more than £200 million in upfront grant funding to second-generation SAF projects via its Advanced Fuels Fund, a form of technology push. This is paired with its SAF mandate and revenue certainty mechanism, which will take effect by the end of 2026; both act as a “market pull.” The revenue certainty mechanism allows SAF producers to enter into a 15-year contract with a counterparty to set a fixed guaranteed strike price (GSP) on fuel production. When the market price of SAF falls below the GSP, producers are reimbursed by the UK government for all financial losses below that price. When the market price is higher than the GSP, producers must return any profits above that price. We illustrate this cost sharing relationship in Figure 1 (below).

The UK revenue certainty mechanism is funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers that covers the cost of SAF payments and administrative overhead for the counterparty. This is a promising example of a policy that can be efficient, provide longer-term investor certainty, and be paid for in-sector. Other proposed funding mechanisms such as a double-sided auction can help minimize the costs of operating the scheme by introducing an auction on both supply (SAF producer) and demand (SAF offtakers).

Airlines and individuals downstream of the fossil fuel supply chain can also share in the costs of supporting aviation sector decarbonization. Airlines can enter into offtake agreements with SAF producers to meet company-level sustainability goals or partner with businesses to procure voluntary SAF via Scope 3 certificates. When these emissions reductions are properly tracked and accounted for in registries, they can be an effective way for customers to mitigate the costs of SAF procurement at any location around the world.

Regarding individual consumers, a 2022 ICCT study found that a levy rising from $0 per flight on a passenger’s first flight of the year to $177 on their twentieth flight could be used to generate $121 billion in annual revenue that could be used to pay for developing the SAF market. This would also help shift the burden from infrequent flyers to frequent flyers who are typically located in high-income countries.

While airlines and the private sector have taken small steps by engaging in offtake agreements and voluntary SAF purchases, successfully bringing SAF to market will require participation from all parties with penalties if any delay action. As I explored above, governments can ensure the largest financial contributions come from fossil jet fuel suppliers while designing cost-sharing mechanisms to offset these added costs. This follows the “polluter pays principle” where parties most responsible for pollution are the ones tasked with cleaning it up.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ID-404-SAF-cost-blog.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 19:57:01.918476

In onze berekeningen variëren deze niet-CO2-effecten tussen 2 en 4 keer het CO2-effect op de opwarming van de aarde.

De voordelen van SAF in termen van CO2-reductie zijn duidelijk, maar de klimaateffecten van de niet-CO2-emissies, zoals stikstofoxiden, waterdamp en roet, zijn veel moeilijker te berekenen en worden momenteel niet meegenomen in regelgeving zoals CORSIA en de EU-richtlijn voor hernieuwbare energie. In een wetenschappelijk rapport gepubliceerd in Nature (Open Science) berekenen onderzoekers Luc Boerboom, Arvind Gangoli Rao, Volker Grewe en Feijia Yin van de Technische Universiteit Delft een realistischer klimaateffect van vliegen op SAF door zowel de CO2- als de niet-CO2-klimaateffecten te meten. Hun conclusie: hoewel het gebruik van SAF beter is voor het milieu dan fossiele kerosine, is SAF niet klimaatneutraal.

Duurzame vliegtuigbrandstof (SAF) wordt beschouwd als een duurzamer alternatief voor fossiele kerosine. De brandstof kan worden gemaakt van restproducten, zoals gebruikte bakolie of landbouwafval, of in synthetische vorm uit waterstof en CO2 die uit de lucht wordt gehaald. Het gebruik van SAF wordt gestimuleerd door overheden en regelgevende instanties. Luchtvaartmaatschappijen worden aangemoedigd om SAF te gebruiken om hun CO2-compensatieverplichting te verminderen via het Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). De EU heeft luchtvaartmaatschappijen verplicht om in 2025 gemiddeld 2% SAF toe te voegen in Europa, oplopend tot 70% in 2050. Maar hoewel de voordelen van SAF voor de CO2-reductie duidelijk zijn, is er veel minder bekend over de klimaatimpact van niet-CO2-emissies tijdens het vliegen op SAF. CORSIA en de EU-richtlijn hernieuwbare energie houden geen rekening met de klimaatimpact van niet-CO2-emissies tijdens de vlucht, zoals stikstofoxiden (NOx), waterdamp (H2O) en roet.

Onderzoekers Luc Boerboom, Arvind Gangoli Rao, Volker Grewe en Feijia Yin van de faculteit Lucht- en Ruimtevaarttechniek van de Technische Universiteit Delft vullen die kenniskloof op. In hun wetenschappelijke rapport, gepubliceerd in Nature Open Science op 30 augustus 2025, evalueren zij de totale effecten van SAF op de opwarming van de aarde aan de hand van een uitgebreide levenscyclusanalyse, waarin zowel de klimaateffecten van de CO2-uitstoot tijdens de levenscyclus als de niet-CO2-uitstoot tijdens de vlucht zijn meegenomen.

Universitair hoofddocent Climate Effects of Aviation, dr. Feijia Yin: “Het beoordelen van de werkelijke klimaatimpact van vliegtuigtechnologie is complex. Over het algemeen is het klimaateffect van niet-CO2-emissies sterk afhankelijk van ruimte en tijd. Bijvoorbeeld: de uitstoot van NOx op vlieghoogte leidt tot een positieve stralingsforcering (opwarmend effect) omdat deze de ozonproductie versterkt. Waterdamp heeft op grote hoogte een aanzienlijk broeikasgaseffect omdat het langer in de atmosfeer blijft. Bovendien kan waterdamp die condenseert op deeltjesemissies (bijvoorbeeld roet) en bevriest tot een contrail, leiden tot een aanzienlijke opwarming van de aarde (positieve forcering), vooral 's nachts. In onze berekeningen variëren deze niet-CO2-effecten tussen 2 en 4 keer het CO2-effect op de opwarming van de aarde. Deze variatie wordt veroorzaakt door de grote onzekerheid van niet-CO2-klimaateffecten.”

De onderzoekers hebben de klimaatimpact van NOx, H2O en contrails veroorzaakt door wereldwijde vluchten in 2019 voor SAF gekwantificeerd. De totale CO2e-waarden voor de levenscyclus variëren van ongeveer 150 tot 250 g/MJ, rekening houdend met verschillende brandstofalternatieven. Uit de analyse blijkt dat de maximale vermindering van de CO2e-uitstoot bij gebruik van SAF minder dan 50% bedraagt in vergelijking met conventionele vliegtuigbrandstof, voornamelijk als gevolg van de NOx- en contraileffecten tijdens de vlucht.",https://filelist.tudelft.nl/_processed_/4/1/csm_contrails_485f6f1f70.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 00:56:50.952049

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel, also known as alternative jet fuel, is a drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel. This means it can use existing fuel distribution infrastructure and power aircraft engines without modifications. Sustainable aviation fuel helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and can be made from different types of renewable sources such as biomass, organic waste or clean synthetic feed stocks using various production methods. The fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel and transported by rail, pipelines, vessels or trucks.

What will the programmatic environmental impact statement analyze?

The programmatic environmental impact statement is a planning document that takes a broad look at the potential significant adverse environmental impacts of producing and distributing sustainable aviation fuel as well as measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Projects can use this information and will also need their own individual environmental reviews.

Scoping

Scoping is the first step in developing the environmental review. We are asking for input from industry, local and state agencies, Tribes, the public and interested parties regarding what we should study. Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced, blended and distributed through a variety of ways, our scoping process will help determine which types of fuel production pathways and distribution infrastructure to evaluate. Our goal is to develop a useful, timely resource for developers, Tribes, agencies, and communities. Getting feedback is critical in determining where to focus our analysis.

The U.S. must implement new policies to kick-start production of bio-based jet fuel, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research.

​A new paper offers a policy road map for expanding U.S. production of sustainable aviation fuel — a move researchers say could cut climate pollution while offering a lifeline to ethanol producers buffeted by tariffs and the rise of electric vehicles.

The working paper, published Monday by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research, outlines how the U.S. could meet the Biden-era goal of producing 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by 2030. The least costly, lowest-emissions option would be to eliminate all biofuel mandates and subsidies — and replace them with a carbon tax of $15 per ton of emissions and a tax credit of $4.41 per gallon of SAF, according to the paper.

That unlikely scenario serves as a “nice benchmark” for a slew of other possibilities, said Harvard University political economy professor James Stock, one of the paper’s co-authors.

“There are various, maybe more politically viable, policies that could be done,” said Stock, who served on the president’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration. Those include creating a sustainable aviation fuel tax, modifying the renewable fuels standard to encourage SAF production, and implementing a national aviation fuel emissions intensity standard.",https://governorsbiofuelscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-biofuels.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 21:56:14.913304

Even the most powerful aircraft carriers have a critical weakness: their aircraft. A Nimitz-class ship can sail for decades on nuclear power, but its fighters burn thousands of gallons of fuel every hour.

Tankers and replenishment ships keep the air wing flying, yet they are slow, exposed and vulnerable. Disrupt that chain, and the carrier’s entire strike capability falters.

Now the US Navy is testing a technology that could make those ships almost entirely self-sufficient — by drawing jet fuel straight from the surrounding sea.

US Navy and Sea Dragon Energy develop ‘Project Genesis’ seawater-to-jet fuel system

San Diego-based Sea Dragon Energy Inc. (SDEI) has been contracted by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to demonstrate how seawater can be transformed into JP-5 jet fuel.

On 21 August 2025, ONR awarded the company a $9.5 million contract for the second-phase demonstration of its Seawater to Jet Fuel programme. That follows an earlier $19.2 million ONR contract in 2024, which funded development of a pilot “Seawater to Jet Fuel Demonstration Unit”.

Sea Dragon calls the initiative Project Genesis — a self-contained, ship-mounted system designed to extract carbon dioxide and hydrogen from seawater, then recombine them into hydrocarbons using Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, a century-old industrial process.

“It’s a major step towards truly sustainable aviation fuel for both government and commercial use,” said John Kohut, Sea Dragon’s chairman and CEO.

Texas congressman John Carter, who represents the company’s home district, described the work as “a lasting contribution to our warfighters and to the commercial sector”.

Sea Dragon’s research and development team in California aims to deliver a deployable demonstration system by 2027 — one that could operate aboard aircraft carriers or offshore platforms.

How the US Navy plans to turn seawater into JP-5 jet fuel

Seawater contains both dissolved carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the basic ingredients of hydrocarbons. The process begins by extracting these gases using electrolysis and advanced membranes.

The US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) holds patents for an electrolytic cation exchange module (E-CEM) that can simultaneously capture both elements. These gases are then fed into a Fischer–Tropsch reactor, where carbon and hydrogen atoms are assembled into JP-5-grade fuel.

In 2014, NRL scientists used this method to power a scale model aircraft entirely with fuel synthesised from seawater, proving the chemistry could work. The challenge since then has been scaling production to levels that could sustain an aircraft carrier’s operations.

Early estimates suggest that, with around 200 megawatts of nuclear power, a carrier could theoretically produce up to 82,000 gallons of jet fuel per day, enough to keep multiple aircraft continuously airborne.

Advanced catalysts and AI research boost seawater fuel efficiency

The biggest technical barrier is catalysis, making the conversion process efficient and cost-effective.

Researchers at the University of Rochester and the University of Pittsburgh, supported by ONR, are developing zeolite-based bimetallic catalysts that avoid rare metals and can be tuned to produce precisely the right hydrocarbon chain lengths for jet fuel.

“Our goal is to tune hydrocarbon selectivity so we produce exactly what we need — jet fuel, not methane,” explained Professor Marc Porosoff, assistant professor of chemical engineering at Rochester. Machine-learning models are now being used to predict catalyst performance, potentially cutting years off laboratory testing.

Sea Dragon has also partnered with Emerging Fuels Technology (EFT) to integrate a pilot-scale conversion module capable of producing aviation-grade e-fuel that meets ASTM and DoD specifications.

Strategic impact: seawater-to-fuel technology could make US carriers self-sufficient

Producing jet fuel at sea could remove one of the US Navy’s most significant operational constraints. Carriers rely on long, predictable supply chains that are increasingly vulnerable to precision-strike threats.

If a carrier could synthesise its own fuel using onboard nuclear power, it would be able to operate for months or even years without resupply, effectively becoming a self-contained energy ecosystem.

Strategists say such a capability would revolutionise naval logistics. Instead of defending slow-moving fuel convoys, fleets could operate independently, drastically reducing risk in contested environments like the South China Sea or Arctic.

Technical challenges and energy limits of seawater jet fuel production

Still, the challenges are formidable. The process is energy-intensive, demanding massive electrical input and careful heat management. Materials must withstand corrosion, salt fouling and vibration in a shipboard environment.

Scaling up from laboratory reactors to a 100,000-gallon-per-day system means overcoming efficiency losses, waste-heat dissipation and reactor lifespan issues. Integration with carrier systems, fuel storage, and safety certification will all require extensive testing.

Even with nuclear energy as the power source, the economics of producing fuel at sea are uncertain. Analysts caution that Project Genesis may serve initially as a strategic resilience tool, not a wholesale replacement for tanker fleets.

Civil aviation and shipping could benefit from seawater-derived fuel

If the technology can be refined, it could also benefit civil aviation and shipping, two of the world’s hardest-to-decarbonise sectors. Synthetic fuel derived from seawater and renewable power could provide a closed-carbon-cycle alternative to fossil jet fuel.

Sea Dragon highlights fuel security, predictable costs and lower carbon impact as key advantages. In theory, any port or offshore facility with access to seawater and clean electricity could generate its own fuel, making the ocean a limitless energy resource.

By 2027, Sea Dragon hopes to demonstrate a working shipboard unit capable of producing JP-5 fuel continuously from seawater. If successful, it would mark one of the most radical advances in naval logistics since the introduction of nuclear propulsion.

For now, the idea remains a hybrid of science and ambition — but one that could, in time, let naval aviators take off knowing the ocean below can refuel them when they return.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FA-18-hornet-landing-on-USS-George-Bush.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 14:56:32.916712

Eliminate blame The only way to eliminate blame from your culture is for the leadership to adopt a mindset and practice of 100% responsibility.
Without a responsible mindset, blame takes center stage, and accountability becomes something to avoid.
Quick action checklist Leaders can start strengthening accountability this quarter by: Defining responsibility (ownership) vs. accountability (measurement).
The question is: Are your leaders driving accountability or waiting for an accountability crisis to arise?","We have an accountability crisis. A 2025 Culture Partners study found that 80% of employees say feedback only happens when something goes wrong, and most confuse accountability with blame. No wonder leaders struggle. Accountability has become synonymous with punishment and “being held accountable.” However, perhaps the single issue isn’t accountability, but rather a multifaceted issue of clarity, mindset and training.

Here’s a snapshot of the four stages of accountability breakdown, along with practical ways leaders can move from avoidance to alignment, where coaching replaces criticism and clarity replaces confusion.

The four phases of accountability breakdown

Phase 1: Avoidance

Leaders postpone the tough talk. Fear, lack of skill or hoping the problem disappears only makes tension build.

Phase 2: The conversation

Eventually, the leader has the talk. To their surprise, it goes smoother than expected. Relief sets in, even pride.

Phase 3: Temporary improvement The employee makes short-term changes. The leader breathes a sigh of relief, believing the storm has passed.

Phase 4: Regression Old habits creep back in. The same issues resurface. Resentment builds. The leader wonders, “Should I try again?” Document? Escalate to HR?

Distinguish responsibility and accountability

In working with hundreds of clients over 20 years, I have noticed several recurring patterns. The terms “responsibility” and “accountability” are used interchangeably. What I can say with certainty is that responsibility and accountability are distinct, yet both are necessary.

Responsibility is about ownership. It’s of the heart.

Accountability is about measurement. It’s of the head.

Here’s another important distinction: Accountability requires a witness, which is another person, for example, a leader, who confirms the measurements. You can’t be accountable without a witness. There is no such thing as “personal accountability.” There is, however, personal responsibility, which is about taking ownership. When people take ownership, they actually want measurement, and they want a coach, mentor or witness to confirm their success.

A common problem in corporations is the lack of responsibility in applying. Accountability (measurement) without personal responsibility creates mere compliance. I can’t say this enough: Change the corporate language to differentiate between responsibility and accountability, and you’ll find every single leak.

Pro tip: When the head and heart work together, accountability feels like alignment, not punishment.

Eliminate blame

The only way to eliminate blame from your culture is for the leadership to adopt a mindset and practice of 100% responsibility. A blaming mindset from any leader, especially at the top, cannot produce responsible or accountable employees. Without a responsible mindset, blame takes center stage, and accountability becomes something to avoid. An important skill is learning how to identify irresponsible language, allowing you to eliminate blame. Besides name-calling and gossip, here are some common yet less recognized examples.

Common phrases that undermine accountability:

“That’s not my job.”

“I assumed you knew…”

“They dropped the ball.”

“I didn’t have time.”

“It’s above my pay grade.”

“No one told me.”

“We’ve always done it this way.”

Some leaders may justify these statements by saying, “Well, it’s the truth.” That’s how you know there’s a responsibility problem and not an accountability problem.

Pro tip: In any area where you see recurring conflict, you’ll find an absence of responsibility and an abundance of blame.

Clarity comes before accountability

According to Gallup, only 45% of employees are aware of what’s expected of them. Without clarity, accountability is impossible. Most employees answer “no” to the question: I know what my boss expects from me at work.

Culture Partners reports that 85% of employees aren’t sure what their organizations are trying to achieve, and one-third say priorities change frequently. Confusion is the enemy of accountability.

Pro tip: In accountable cultures, employees feel free to ask for clarification about tasks and priorities.

Teach managers how to coach

The Talent Strategy Group reports that coaching conversations aren’t happening because managers lack skills and often, the right mindset. When managers view performance issues as “catch and punish” instead of “coach and support,” accountability feels unsafe.

Pro tip: Accountability grows when managers view performance conversations as opportunities to coach, rather than confront.

Quick action checklist

Leaders can start strengthening accountability this quarter by:

Defining responsibility (ownership) vs. accountability (measurement).

Auditing culture for blame-language.

Training managers to coach, not catch.

Building a culture of accountability doesn’t happen overnight, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. Accountability without blame is a competitive advantage. The question is: Are your leaders driving accountability or waiting for an accountability crisis to arise?

Taking public comments We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel.","We are embarking on a new statewide study to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts surrounding the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel—including measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Our broad statewide studies, also called programmatic environmental impact statements, are required by state law. In June, we released three studies evaluating utility-scale onshore wind and solar energy projects, and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.

As part of the scoping process, we are seeking input from interested parties, including the public, regarding the range of actions and impacts we should study.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

To help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to power aircraft engines. The fuel is derived from low-carbon sources such as biomass, organic waste and clean synthetic feedstocks using a wide range of production methods and technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.

Scoping our study to be impactful and efficient

While these fuel projects are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the state economy, they can still have negative environmental impacts that need to be considered—including ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate those impacts.

Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from a variety of renewable resources and transported using various distribution methods, our study will not be able to evaluate every possible option. This means your input is critical. It will help us determine where to focus our analysis to develop the most useful, timely report that will support the future development of sustainable aviation fuel projects in Washington.

The study will evaluate the potential impacts on natural and built resources at a broad level. Developers and agencies can use the findings to help avoid and reduce impacts through siting and design choices. It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.

Taking public comments

We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel. In October, we will hold two virtual meetings where interested parties can make public comments:

Tuesday, Oct. 21 virtual meeting starting at 1 p.m.

Register on Zoom

Wednesday, Oct. 22 virtual meeting starting at 9 a.m.

Register on Zoom

All the comments we receive will be valued equally. They help us determine our approach to the programmatic impact statement, or study. Comments addressing specific pathways, impacts or issues are the most useful. We have prepared a fact sheet about providing effective public comments.

It is working to integrate sustainability within championships, but its 2024 sustainability report shows a 9% absolute emissions increase.

The FIA also reports a decrease in carbon intensity by 7% year-on-year alongside an increase in activities, revenue and headcount.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the FIA, says: “Five years into the FIA’s ambitious strategy, it is clear there is more to do.

“As we look to the future, I am confident the FIA will continue to play a leading role in facing the challenges ahead, which are significant.”

Willem Groenewald is the FIA’s Secretary General for Automobile Mobility and Sustainability.

He leads the FIA’s mobility and sustainability mission, working with 245 Member Clubs in 149 countries to advance its objectives across sport and mobility.

Willem spoke to Sustainability Magazine about the FIA’s 2024 Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion report.

What are some of the highlights from this report?

We were pleased to see a 45% increase in uptake for our Environmental Accreditation Programme, which provides our member clubs, championships, promoters, teams, suppliers, circuits and with a clear framework against which to accredit their activities. The scheme has three levels on a star-rated basis, ranging from basic to best practice, and is designed to support our entire ecosystem across sport and mobility, encouraging a gradual progression through the levels. This was our strongest yearly growth to date, showing real momentum.

We also invested for the first time in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which reduced our footprint by an estimated 388 tCO₂e in 2024 and about 8% of freight-related emissions when compared with 2023. SAF can cut lifecycle GHGs by up to 80% vs conventional jet fuel, and we have committed to further increase our investment in SAF in 2025.

Another highlight was the launch of our Sustainable Fuel Certification Programme. From 2026, Formula 1 will mandate sustainable fuel made from Advanced Sustainable Components. To ensure compliance, we launched a scheme with Zemo Partnership which verifies each fuel’s origin, composition and greenhouse gas performance. The Programme aims to go beyond sport, laying the foundation for broader adoption of these fuels across everyday mobility. Future partnerships with fuel providers will support this transition, helping to reduce transport emissions at scale.

How have you found the split of the sustainability and D&I function?

We have sharpened our focus for the respective functions while keeping the two areas connected where it matters. Under the new structure, sustainability is within my remit while D&I reports to Alessandra Malhamé, Senior HR Director at the FIA. This allows us to build out our capabilities in these functions and align them with other areas of the FIA, most notably our member clubs.

Sustainability and D&I are embedded in FIA governance through our Sustainability & D&I Committee and specialist Commissions, allowing us to drive deep technical progress on climate and environmental management, while ensuring our inclusion programmes generate positive impact inside and outside of the FIA.

What progress are you most proud of?

The growth of our Environmental Accreditations Programme shows that organisations across sport and mobility are moving from intention to implementation, raising the bar across the ecosystem. We have 190 organisations signed up and will keep evolving and expanding the programme.

We were also really proud to be recognised by the British Standards Institution (BSI) as an example of how sports governance can integrate structured climate transition planning.

We are the first to acknowledge that there is more to do and that we have an important role in driving further action in bettering sustainable practices across the industries we operate in.

What’s working and what will you focus on next?

While absolute emissions increased overall in 2024, a year of strong activity growth, carbon intensity, which is defined as each tCO₂e emitted for each € of general revenue, fell ~7% against revenue, showing that our efficiency measures are working. With 99% of our footprint in Scope 3 - the hardest emissions to abate across all industries - our early use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel helped limit the increase and underlines the potential of these biofuels to reduce future impacts. We will continue to push stricter travel policies, event optimisation and stronger sustainable procurement. We are targeting Net Zero by 2040 and remain committed to halving absolute emissions by 2030 against a 2022 baseline.

What goes into creating this report?

As for any organisation, it is a very comprehensive process and in recent years we have made a concerted effort to ensure our data is collected consistently, accurately and in line with recognised standards. This has formed part of the wider transformation of processes and internal controls within the FIA.

We report to GRI Standards (2024 period). We have calculated our carbon footprint since 2019 in line with the GHG Protocol, covering all three scopes across our headquarters, events, championships and financed supplier activities. In 2024 we ensured our footprint was reviewed under ISO 14064-3 by Global Climate Initiatives. We track energy, water, waste, supplier screening and a detailed Scope 1–3 inventory (including business travel, freight and purchased goods). We also restated prior years to reflect updated emission factors and a new 2022 baseline for accuracy.

We will continue to expand data collection and research, building a stronger evidence base to guide our strategy and track our impact effectively.

How is this data used to assess and continue making progress?

In short, to drive action and continuously push for better outcomes across sustainability and D&I.

The data feeds into our ISO 14001 standard to set targets, run audits and course-correct (e.g., travel policies, remote ops, office solar, procurement criteria). It will also underpin our strategy refresh, now that we are almost five years into the plan set out in 2020.

Insights from our data can shape grants and other resource allocation for our member clubs and wider set of stakeholders.

We are more focused than ever on measurable outcomes, collaborative partnerships and continuous learning as we look ahead to the next chapter. Our vision is to help build a more sustainable, impactful and inclusive motor sport and mobility landscape for all.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c5328664cdda26c09106cfbe08ee6633:b7271c333a3233831a7ef410bb443fd5/willem-groenewald-fia-secretary-general-for-automobile-mobility-and-sustainability.png.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:57:03.763520

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives this week urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize rules that prioritize domestic feedstocks and protect U.S. farmers and renewable fuel producers from foreign competition.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers called on the agency to move forward with its proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and to maintain record-high biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes set out earlier this year. They said the policy changes would strengthen American energy security and bolster farm economies across the Midwest.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks,” the members wrote. “The Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.”

The Import RIN reduction, proposed by the EPA in June, would cut in half the RIN credits available for imported renewable fuels or fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Lawmakers argue the move would help level the playing field for American producers facing competition from foreign sources such as Brazilian tallow and used cooking oil imported from China.

The letter also noted that soybean oil plays a key role in the U.S. biofuel industry — though it represents only 20% of the soybean by weight, it accounts for more than half the crop’s market value. About half of that oil is used to make biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“The EPA’s own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal,” the senators wrote. “It will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities.”

Joining Young in signing the letter were Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran of Kansas, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Rounds of South Dakota, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, among others.

Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives also endorsed the letter, including Indiana’s Jim Baird (IN-04), Erin Houchin (IN-09), Mark Messmer (IN-08), and Rudy Yakym (IN-02).

The senators said finalizing the rule would fulfill the intent of Congress under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritize domestic production and job growth in rural communities.

We’re talking about green methanol, and how would it be possible?
Just combine green hydrogen with carbon captured from sustainable biomass, and then we’ll have methanol with a neutral carbon footprint (the famous green methanol).
This partnership plans to produce 300,000 tons of green methanol per year from 2028 (some experts are even saying goodbye to hydrogen, as in this case).","Hydrogen has been talked about for some time now as an alternative for the global energy transition we are currently experiencing. In fact, it is highly sought after. However, in the midst of this race for hydrogen, a somewhat surprising alternative has emerged that has even greater potential than previously imagined and that we can start using right now – yes, until now we have not been able to imagine how this has been hidden for so long…

It looks like the race for green hydrogen already has a protagonist

Countries like Germany, Japan and South Korea have been ahead of the game when it comes to hydrogen for generating green energy for quite some time now. The business is so serious that they have already established partnerships to import this fuel. On the other hand, regions like the Middle East, South America and Oceania are preparing to export it on a large scale. It is worth noting that Australia, in particular, is a strong candidate in this race.

Why? Well, to understand, we need to look at the Australian state of Tasmania. The reason is its 100% renewable energy profile and strategic geography, which has been considered one of the best places in the world for producing green hydrogen. The north of this state has been the site of several projects and investments in this niche for some time now. However, many of them ended up failing due to technical and infrastructure challenges.

But it seems that this scenario is about to change, since the company ABEL Energy has put a project on the table with a different approach. How so? Well, instead of just exporting hydrogen, why can’t we transform it into something denser, more versatile and with greater immediate global demand? It seems that the secret lies there…

From hydrogen to green methanol

Ok, so what would this hydrogen transformation be? We’re talking about green methanol, and how would it be possible? Just combine green hydrogen with carbon captured from sustainable biomass, and then we’ll have methanol with a neutral carbon footprint (the famous green methanol). This material can be used as:

Clean marine fuel;

Feedstock for green chemicals;

And even the basis for sustainable aviation fuel.

It was from there that ABEL Energy partnered with Worley for the Bell Bay Powerfuels project. This partnership plans to produce 300,000 tons of green methanol per year from 2028 (some experts are even saying goodbye to hydrogen, as in this case). But for all this to happen, the initiative has already received A$330 million in public incentives, which has attracted international interest and is close to being acquired by Zen Energy, a company backed by economist Ross Garnaut.

Why is all this happening now?

Before we talk about the moment itself, we need to better understand the place where all this is happening. This is because Tasmania itself offers unique conditions, such as:

Almost entirely renewable energy matrix;

Access to a deep-water port;

Geographical location close to major Asian markets;

And a political and industrial ecosystem committed to the energy transition.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Depositphotos_13850583_L.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:56:13.993472

It also came above the S&P 500’s return of 3.6% in the same time frame.

Other industry players, such as Rocket Lab USA, Inc. RKLB and Curtiss-Wright Corp. CW, have also delivered a similar stellar performance in the past month. Shares of RKLB and CW have risen 17.6% and 11.1%, respectively, in the said period.

With RYCEY’s strong outperformance, some investors may be eager to buy the stock right away. However, before making this decision, it is essential to verify whether the company’s fundamentals can sustain long-term growth or if the recent rise is merely temporary. Understanding RYCEY’s growth potential and related risks is essential for making a well-informed investment choice.

What Pushed Up RYCEY Stock?

RYCEY’s latest robust performance on the bourses seems to have been influenced by the following developments:

In September 2025, Rolls-Royce, together with Landmark and ASCO, commissioned a 10-megawatt gas engine power plant with a carbon capture system in the East Midlands region of the United Kingdom. In the same month, Lithuanian energy supplier Ignitis Group chose Rolls-Royce to provide large-scale battery storage systems from its mtu EnergyPack brand. The order includes systems with a total storage capacity of 582 megawatt hours and an output of 291 megawatts. These developments should bolster RYCEY’s position as a technology company contributing to sustainable energy.

Additionally, the company introduced the mtu 12V2000Z engine with 2222 horsepower and launched the mtu NautIQ Bridge system for yachts between 30 and 40 metres in length. It also presented a new flexible exhaust aftertreatment system for its mtu 4000 series engines and a fuel-efficient POD drive. These additions are expected to strengthen Rolls-Royce’s position in the marine market and support future growth.

Growth Prospects for RYCEY Stock

Looking ahead, Rolls-Royce seems well-placed to maintain its growth in the coming years, supported by strong demand across its key business areas, which include Civil Aerospace, Defence and Power Systems.

In the Civil Aerospace segment, the company continues to benefit from higher global air travel and the need for fuel-efficient aircraft. Its Trent XWB, Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 engines power major aircraft such as the Airbus A350, Boeing 787 and Airbus A330. The recent improvements made by Rolls-Royce to extend engine life by 30% are expected to increase its aftermarket revenues and support long-term cash generation. With an order backlog of more than 2,000 widebody engines (as of July 2025), Rolls-Royce has good visibility for future growth.

Its Defence business is also expected to perform well as global defense spending increases. Rolls-Royce engines, including the EJ200 for the Eurofighter Typhoon and the AE series for transport aircraft, continue to see strong demand.

In September 2025, Rolls-Royce strengthened its partnership with Avio Aero and IHI to develop the next-generation fighter engine under the Global Combat Air Programme. This initiative reinforces Rolls-Royce’s commitment to advancing future combat air propulsion technology.

In the Power Systems division, Rolls-Royce is expanding in clean energy and energy storage. Its focus on hydrogen-powered engines, sustainable aviation fuel and small modular reactors supports the global shift toward cleaner energy. The selection of its small modular reactor technology by Great British Nuclear and the large battery storage orders (in June 2025) show the growing strength of this segment.

Overall, steady orders, ongoing innovation and a strong presence across several growing industries are likely to help Rolls-Royce maintain its positive momentum and achieve sustainable growth in the long term.

Let’s check below how the company is expected to perform in the near term.

A much more concrete prospect than the sixty-eight slogan about flowers in cannons, provided that Brussels clarifies some rules for farmers and industry. In fact, the Commission is about to define what is meant by 'intermediate crop' in the Renewable Energy Directive, a fundamental step to allow Italian farmers too to intercept the rich biofuel business, a 120 billion market destined to double in the next 10 years. ""Europe is about to take a crucial decision that could open up new markets for Italian farmers, while helping to drastically reduce emissions from aviation. Without a broad definition, we believe that European farmers will be excluded from this opportunity. Gabriele Burato is the head in Italy of Corteva Agriscience, the agrochemical giant born from the merger between Dow and DuPont with a turnover of more than 14 billion that together with the other three biggies in the sector (Bayer, Basf and Syngenta) controls the majority of the world market for crop protection products, seeds, plant protection products and fertilisers. In Italy it has two plants and two research centres concentrated in the north and is now preparing to invest in the new frontier of biofuels. Thus, sunflowers grown in Italy are also a candidate to provide part of the fuel for the next flights.

""These days,"" Burato explains, ""the aviation industry is busy finding cost-competitive sources of sustainable aviation fuel (Saf), due to new European regulations that require companies to include at least 2 per cent Saf in fuel blends, with a target of 70 per cent by 2050. Biofuels derived from agriculture could be part of the solution. Crops such as the sunflower contain a high percentage of oil in their seeds and are a perfect raw material for the production of biofuels'.

While Italy, also with the latest revision of the NRP, is accelerating on the latest generation of agri-voltaics that does not involve soil consumption and adds to the agro-energy mix dominated by biomethane, at a global level there has long been a debate on the contrast between energy and food uses of agricultural raw materials. In Europe, says Burato, 'the role of farmers in the production of sustainable energy is often overlooked, because having a limited amount of fertile land at their disposal they have to give priority to food and feed production, as is also the case in Italy. However, with innovative solutions and the right regulatory support, biofuels can also become a key element for the future of sustainable energy in Europe, with agriculture playing a leading role. Farming to produce biofuels will be increasingly profitable'.

Normally, the crops associated with biofuel production are rape, maize and soya. Alongside these, Corteva wants to bet on sunflower in Italy. On the convenience of the bet Burato has no doubts: 'First of all, in terms of cost, growing dedicated crops such as sunflowers between harvests is cheaper than producing fossil fuels, or synthetic aviation fuels. The advantage of using oil crops is that there is already a value chain for all the components of the seeds that are used, and in Europe there are already activities such as crushing plants, storage, and refineries, operational and with the capacity to convert the oil into aviation fuel'.",https://i2.res.24o.it/images2010/S24/Documenti/2025/10/01/Immagini/Ritagli/Sunflower_DSC_0847-U76567444862pOC-1440x752@IlSole24Ore-Web.JPG?r=1170x507,N,,2025-10-06 11:56:27.144443

The certification ensures full traceability of sustainable aviation fuel throughout the supply chain. According to Weston Aviation, the company maintains a management system designed to guarantee traceability of sustainable material and accurate application of the mass balance approach.

All biomass and waste-based fuels supplied comply with ISCC sustainability criteria, including land use restrictions, biodiversity protection, greenhouse gas emissions reduction and respect for human and labor rights. Internal procedures include regular audits, staff training and data verification processes.

“As the ISCC auditor for Weston Aviation, it was great to see the team’s clear commitment to sustainability and transparency,” said Jack Boyle, head of operations at EnviroSense International. “Their proactive approach to compliance and traceability really highlights their dedication to driving progress in the use of sustainable aviation fuel.”

Since January 1, all jet fuel across the UK and Union airports within Ireland contains a minimum blend of two percent SAF calculated on a mass balance basis. Weston Aviation requires ISCC certification to trade PoCs, which are provided by ISCC certified suppliers detailing the SAF blend supplied and which operators require for reclaiming under offset schemes.

Ruth Tootill, aviation fuel manager at Weston Aviation, explained how the certification maintains chain of custody. “The benefit for Weston Aviation becoming ISCC certified is so that we do not break the chain of custody, so that where our ISCC certified supplier provides a PoC for SAF, we offer traceability by passing our own PoC on to our customers,” said Tootill. “It also demonstrates our commitment to our customers and suppliers to support the progress of sustainability in aviation fuels.”",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/processed-A47D1A22-FD61-41C1-A6B5-0E2E8A6D7451.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 11:56:58.896501

Singapore Airlines offers the longest current commercial passenger flight. It travels from Singapore to New York and takes 18 hours and 40 minutes. Mercifully, they don’t offer economy seats — it’s premium economy or business only! During the flight, the plane emits about 2.7 tons of CO2 per passenger, or about the same as driving a standard gasoline-fueled car from San Francisco to Boston and back.

Batteries and hydrogen potentially could dramatically reduce CO2 emissions from aviation, but their weight and/or volume make them infeasible at present. Current batteries are 50 times heavier than jet fuel per unit of energy, and they take up 20 times as much space. Compressed hydrogen takes up 6 times as much space as jet fuel. The fuel in a typical long-haul jet (including the Singapore-NYC plane) comprises up to 40% of its weight on takeoff. This leaves little capacity for batteries or hydrogen.

The low energy density of batteries and hydrogen implies that near-term decarbonization of long-haul jets relies on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAFs are liquid aviation fuels derived from feedstocks such as waste oils and fats, crops such as corn, soy, and sugarcane, cellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, or captured CO2. SAFs are chemically very similar to fossil jet fuel. They are currently approved to be mixed with conventional jet fuel at levels up to 50%, making them compatible with existing aircraft and requiring no modifications to current fueling infrastructure.

A Grand Challenge

In 2011, the US Federal Aviation Administration set a goal for US airlines to use one billion gallons of SAF annually by 2018. Actual SAF production fell far short of this target; in 2018 only 1.8 million gallons were produced.

In 2021, the US Federal government launched the SAF Grand Challenge, which set a target of 3 billion gallons annual production by 2030, which would result in SAF comprising about 12% of US jet fuel consumption in that year. At the beginning of 2024, US annual production capacity for SAF was approximately 30.66 million gallons, representing just 0.1% of the current US jet fuel supply. In late 2024, two additional plants came online, generating a significant increase in capacity to about 450 million gallons per year.

What would it take to reach the SAF Grand Challenge goal?

In an NBER working paper out today, Mengying Wu, Kristen McCormack, Will Scott, Jingran Zhang, Jim Stock, and I answer that question.

In the paper, we develop a detailed model of the road and air transportation fuel sectors, including the 12 most common biofuel-feedstock combinations. We use this model to evaluate six alternative policy scenarios designed to achieve the 3 billion gallon SAF target and discuss the estimated emissions reductions, cost effectiveness, fuel-feedstock mix, and cost incidence of each policy.

Two SAF production technologies are currently operational in the US, both based on biofuels: (i) hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) using vegetable oils and waste fats, and (ii) alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) using ethanol made from corn or some other bio feedstock. The three most common road transportation biofuels are ethanol, biodiesel and renewable diesel. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are produced from the same feedstocks as HEFA SAF.

Because currently available SAFs are predominantly biofuels, SAF policy will interact with the tangled web of existing policies that promote biofuels for surface transportation. In the United States, these policies include the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which mandates blending biofuels into the surface transportation fuel supply, federal tax credits (45Z), state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS), and state tax credits. These policies provide subsidies for producers and consumers of biofuels. Depending on the policy, the cost of these subsidies fall on drivers, surface freight shippers, or taxpayers (illustrated below).

Any proposed SAF policy must be developed and assessed in the context of existing biofuel policies. The mix of policies in place help determine the total quantity, as well as the composition by technology and feedstock, of biofuel produced and consumed for surface and aviation fuel.

We have five main findings

First, current policies are insufficient to achieve the SAF production target. Using SAF generates credits in the RFS and LCFS programs, but the value of these credits is insufficient to bring much SAF into the market. In our model, only 60 million gallons of SAF are produced in 2030 under current policy, and a large amount of biodiesel feedstock that could be used for SAF is converted instead to less-expensive renewable diesel, which is used to replace petroleum diesel to satisfy the California LCFS.

In short, the current US policy mix incentivizes the use of biofuels for surface transportation over aviation (as illustrated below).

Second, we find that three alternative policy options to reach the target would all result in similar total emissions and overall economic costs. But they differ in who would bear those costs. The three are:

a regulatory change to the RFS that creates a SAF requirement, but does not obligate petroleum jet fuel producers to buy renewable fuel credits (we call this Nested D2)

a regulatory change to the RFS that creates a SAF requirement and obligates petroleum jet fuel producers to buy renewable fuel credits (we call this D2 with Aviation Obligation)

a clean aviation standard in addition to current policy (we call this Aviation Intensity Standard)

The average cost of reducing carbon emissions with any of these three policies is around $470 per ton of CO2, which is more than twice the social cost of carbon. These three policy tools would result in slightly higher average economic costs and lower total emissions than the current policy mix (see figure below).

Our cost estimate is based on current models of greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels. These models adjust for the fact that increasing demand for biofuels induces more land to be converted into farmland, which can release large amounts of carbon stored in plants and soil. However, there’s ongoing debate about whether these adjustments are large enough. Such emissions are especially high when forests are cleared in places like Brazil for soybeans or Indonesia for palm oil. Accounting for emissions from higher induced land use would move the dots in the above figure up and to the left.

Our third finding is that replacing all current federal and state biofuel policies with a $15 per metric ton carbon tax on fossil transportation fuels and a $4.41 per gallon SAF tax credit could reduce emissions, reach the 3 billion gallon target, and substantially reduce total policy costs, all relative to the current policy mix. Almost all reductions are a result of reduced demand for fuels.

Fourth, additional policy costs of reaching the target are disproportionately borne by California, which experiences gasoline and diesel price increases of 30-40 cents per gallon under the three policies mentioned above. This occurs because increased demand for SAF outside of California, encouraged by state tax incentives that currently exist in Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Washington, increases competition for bio-based diesel feedstocks and therefore makes compliance with California’s LCFS more expensive.

Finally, it follows from the first two findings that adding policies to achieve the target is more costly than current policy. The static costs reported in this paper, however, do not account for any technological innovation induced by a durable SAF policy that would spur investment; costs arguably could be driven down further by extensive federal R&D support for advanced low-carbon SAFs, such as SAF produced from captured CO2, which has low carbon emissions if produced using clean electricity.

Conclusion

Open up an in-flight magazine or read press releases from airlines and you will see an industry that is conscious of the high greenhouse gas emissions from flying. Many companies, including Singapore Airlines, have experimented with adding SAF to their fuel supply. Such voluntary initiatives could potentially support some SAF, but volumes would likely remain small, in large part because SAFs are significantly more expensive than fossil jet fuel and somewhat more expensive than biofuels for surface transportation. For SAF to expand, it will need long-term policy support. Our findings show that such policies would mostly divert biofuels from surface transportation to aviation at somewhat higher cost.

Considering potential innovation is important, particularly because many SAF technologies are still relatively nascent. In surface transportation, recent research indicates that learning-by-doing that drives down costs has been substantial for ethanol but not for bio-based diesel. If using biofuel SAFs can accelerate the technological transition to deep decarbonization (e.g., batteries, hydrogen, or SAF from captured CO2), and if the induced land-use change effects of biofuels are not too large, then incentivizing biofuel SAFs could perhaps be justified.

The project aims to explore synergies between traditional chemical processes and emerging technologies that work to convert waste into circular chemicals. There will also be a specific focus on the possible conversion of waste into chemicals in a more sustainable way.

Direct conversion can help to transform complex waste streams into valuable C2+ chemical compounds, like ethylene and propylene, through gasification. They are essential building blocks for products like contact-sensitive plastics, detergents, paints, and textiles. Additionally, users could see a reduction in emissions while receiving a cost-effective alternative to fossil-based feedstocks.

“Our collaboration with ETH Zurich scientists represents a significant step toward realising a circular and net-zero chemical industry,” said Charlie Tan, CEO of GIC. “By leveraging cutting-edge research and industry expertise, we aim to explore scalable solutions that address both environmental and economic challenges.”

Researchers at ETH Zurich will complete environmental and techno-economic assessments of the direct conversion process. The findings will help assess the viability of a proof-of-concept, while also identifying conditions for any future pilot-scale efforts.​ The collaboration will explore processing heterogeneous waste materials and integrating new feedstocks into existing chemical value chains.

“The chemical industry must shift from fossil-based inputs to renewable and circular carbon sources. Through our collaboration with GIC on Direct Conversion, we’re exploring how to transform waste into essential chemicals—an important step toward operating within planetary boundaries,” said Professor André Bardow, Chair of Energy and Process Systems Engineering at ETH Zurich.

Richard Haldimann, Chief Strategy & Technology Officer at Clariant and Chairman of the GIC Executive Committee, added, “This partnership shows how science and industry together can drive real progress toward a circular future.

Late last week analytics platform MSCI Carbon Markets announced that the Architecture for REDD+ Transactions (ART) registry this week confirmed that Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways canceled a batch of credits from the Guyana Jurisdictional REDD+ Project (ART102,) currently the only program that satisfies both the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Emission Unit Criteria and carries a corresponding adjustment from its host government. Those two features make the credits uniquely eligible under CORSIA.

At a Q2 2025 auction run by the International Air Transport Association, the credits sold for about $22.25 per metric ton of CO2e, with bids for the next quarterly auction still underway.

With the first verified retirements now on record, CORSIA’s once-theoretical framework is becoming a functioning marketplace that could redefine how airlines account for their climate footprints.

MSCI focused on CORSIA

According to MSCI’s 2025 CORSIA Outlook, global demand for eligible credits could reach 500 million to 1.3 billion tonnes between 2027 and 2035, with prices potentially climbing from $26 to as high as $124 per tonne as supply tightens.

The inaugural Contrails Analysis Report also urges business aviation to modify flight plans to minimise contrails and airlines to publish similar studies.

The report claims 1% of contrails accounted for 48% of the global warming impact arising from 2,987 on demand private charter flights worldwide. The results highlight how a small number of high-impact contrails disproportionately contribute to climate effects and how remedial action could lead to significant improvements.

Defined as long, thin cloud formations forming behind high altitude aircraft, contrails are responsible for 1-2% of global warming. They can cause as much global warming each year as all the CO2 emitted by flights between 1945 and 2018, according to recent (and separate) research from the University of Cambridge Aviation Impact Accelerator. Both organisations want to highlight the CO2 and non-CO2 impact of business aviation on climate change while encouraging commercial airlines to publish their own contrail analysis reports.

Long-lasting or ‘big-hit’ contrails can have an outsized warming impact, trapping and absorbing heat that otherwise would radiate back into space. Research from the European Commission indicates that contrails and non-CO₂ emissions are responsible for about twice as much warming as the CO2 emitted by aviation.

‘Avoid contrail formation’

One misconception is that private jets fly above contrail regions but this report proves this isn’t always the case, warned Toby Edwards, co-CEO at Victor. “We want our private jet clients to have the option to avoid contrail formation by choosing progressive operators that are proactively making small adjustments to their flight paths to avoid contrail-forming regions, thereby lowering their environmental impact,” he said.

Operators who are working on contrail avoidance using, already available, smart flight management software would be recommended to clients. “Such an offering would be a natural extension to our existing product, which includes aircraft estimate fuel-burn data and Neste sustainable aviation fuel [SAF],” said Edwards.

The results of this research support an earlier study conducted by 4AIR. This was also said to show the concentration of a majority of the contrail impact emerging from a small minority of flights, highlighting the opportunity to cut climate impact substantially by addressing just a fraction of flights.

4AIR, who used the open-source Contrail Cirrus Prediction model from Contrails.org and hindcast weather data plus ADSB data within a flight, shines the spotlight on the non-CO2 impact of Victor’s charter flights and highlights the alarming impact of contrails by the growing commercial airline sector, reinforcing calls to accelerate the deployment of known mitigation techniques that could quickly reduce these effects.

‘Very large opportunity’

Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR said the challenge of minimising the impact of contrails was not confined to business aviation. “Avoiding atmospheric regions likely to create big hit contrails represents a very large opportunity to reduce the impact from aviation,” he said. “But effectively mitigating these regions will require pro-active flight planning by operators as well as coordination with Air Traffic Control.”

It is critical to raise awareness of both the impact and opportunity of non-CO2 impacts and encourage operators to understand their contrail footprint, as aviation sector prepared to meet its climate goals, he added.

“By publishing this data voluntarily, Victor and 4AIR are calling on all airlines to increase transparency, improve flight-path planning and work with Air Traffic Control to reduce contrail-forming flights,” according to Victor and 4AIR. “This inaugural report represents a step toward greater accountability in aviation and will be published annually.” Read the full report here.",https://www.corporatejetinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CJI-Contrail-Anon-Jet-Shutterstock-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:57:17.782524

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.
And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.
“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.
The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.","U.S. government support of sustainable aviation fuel has waned, shifting the impetus for increasing its production to the states. But progress continues.

“It’s a pivot,” says Keith Sawyer, Avfuel manager of alternative fuels. “The focus had been typically on the federal government; now investors are including what may or may not be offered by states in their calculations, in their rates of return on investment in facilities.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) that became law with President Donald Trump’s signature on July 4 amended the existing 45Z clean fuel production credit (CFPC) to benefit biofuel producers instead of blenders and extended it for two years through 2029. Added to the tax code during the Biden administration through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CFPC was set to expire in 2027.

The continuation of the tax credit is cause for some optimism that ongoing development of SAF capacity is supported—given that one of Trump’s early actions after becoming president in January was to pause funding disbursements under the IRA, which was considered a major achievement of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.

Trump’s executive order was slowed by legal challenges, but the OBBB approved by the Republican majority in Congress contains a section that rescinds unobligated balances of the FAA’s Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant program, also established under the IRA.

The Biden administration had announced $291 million in FAST grants in August 2024, primarily for 22 projects “that produce, transport, blend or store sustainable aviation fuel.” The largest single grant—$50 million—went to Martinez Renewables LLC, a 50/50 joint venture of Marathon Petroleum and SAF producer Neste, to fund the conversion of a Marathon facility in Martinez, California, for renewable fuels production.

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.

Under the OBBB, the CFPC has been modified; the value of the credit for production of “neat” or pure, unblended SAF declines from $1.75-per-gallon to $1-per-gallon after 2025, aligning it with the credit for renewable diesel. And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada. Sugar cane, soybeans, tallow, used oils and greases sourced outside of North America won’t qualify.

“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.

The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Also welcoming the new 45Z credit as one of the OBBB’s “America First” energy provisions was Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, a coalition that joins Airbus, Airlines for America, Delta Air Lines, and NBAA representing the aviation industry with agriculture groups and energy companies ExxonMobil and BP.

SAF is now moving into mainstream adoption, driven by international mandates such as ReFuelEU in Europe, the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, and airline emissions targets. With policies tightening and carbon credit markets maturing, SAF is positioned to become one of the fastest-growing areas in renewable energy. For producers like XCF, this transition represents a significant opportunity to secure offtake agreements and build durable revenue streams.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""XCF is excited to share our vision for scaling sustainable aviation fuel worldwide and building one of the most important new markets in renewable energy.

,,2025-10-06 11:44:18+00:00,The Salata Institute,A policy playbook to meet sustainable aviation fuel targets - The Salata Institute,Not Available,,,,,https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/a-policy-playbook-to-meet-sustainable-aviation-fuel-targets/,"The only near-term option is to replace a slice of today’s petroleum-based jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a cleaner drop-in product that planes can already use.
The paper finds that the U.S. target is attainable with current technology, but not with current policy.
Under current policy, surface fuel wins most of the incentives and the limited supply of oils and fats.
Because these levers change fuel prices, fuel choices, and government spending in different ways, the money flows add up differently.
A second option is a national “clean aviation” standard that steadily lowers the carbon intensity of jet fuel, making jet fuel suppliers meet a target.","Aviation is one of the hardest parts of the economy to decarbonize. New planes that run on hydrogen or batteries are being tested, but technical hurdles and slow fleet turnover mean these solutions are years away.

The only near-term option is to replace a slice of today’s petroleum-based jet fuel with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a cleaner drop-in product that planes can already use. SAF is made mostly from biological sources (like waste vegetable oils, tallow, or crops). Over its lifecycle, it reduces emissions – unlike burning a fossil fuel, which releases carbon that had been locked underground for millions of years.

A new paper circulated on October 6 by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) uses, for the first time, a detailed economic model of the U.S. road- and jet-fuel markets to test real policy choices. The authors, led by a team at Harvard, calculate how overlapping state and federal incentives stack up. They lay out the trade-offs in designing SAF policy, consider interactions with markets for the biofuels used in surface transportation, and offer clear guidance for policymakers trying to cut aviation emissions.

The challenge is immense. The Department of Energy has set a goal of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030. As of early 2024, domestic SAF production capacity was roughly 31 million gallons – about 1% of the target and just 0.1% of the U.S. jet-fuel market.

The paper finds that the U.S. target is attainable with current technology, but not with current policy. Under today’s mix of policies (the Renewable Fuel Standard, state low-carbon fuel standards, the new Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (45Z), and state SAF tax credits), the economists’ model projects only a small bump in SAF production by 2030.

Because most SAF comes from the same feedstocks as the biofuels used in ground transportation, the two compete for both raw materials and policy subsidies. Under current policy, surface fuel wins most of the incentives and the limited supply of oils and fats. For example, an increasing share of feedstock that could be used for SAF is converted instead to less-expensive renewable diesel to satisfy California’s low-carbon fuel standards.

The question is whether those surface uses can pivot towards jets. The paper argues yes: It would cost more, but not a lot more. It would require policy changes, but there are multiple ways to achieve the pivot.

Pathways to the 2030 target

Different rules move different levers, shifting the bill among motorists, taxpayers, and air passengers. Because these levers change fuel prices, fuel choices, and government spending in different ways, the money flows add up differently. So does the average cost per ton of CO₂ abated.

One path the authors model is to update the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, a Congressional mandate that biofuels be blended into road fuels sold throughout the country, so jet fuel has its own target and isn’t just competing with surface biofuels.

A second option is a national “clean aviation” standard that steadily lowers the carbon intensity of jet fuel, making jet fuel suppliers meet a target. The European Union is going down this path this as part of its net-zero goals.

These paths cost about the same as current policy but yield a 40-46% increase in emissions reductions.

A third option – creating a new federal SAF tax credit on top of current rules – also boosts SAF by stimulating supply, but is more expensive. This cuts emissions about 22% more than current policy, but at about 25% higher average cost per ton of CO₂ avoided.

Aiming higher

Emissions cuts would be about 110% larger than under today’s policy mix, at about the same cost, if policymakers did two things at once: Create a SAF-only category within the Renewable Fuel Standard and expand the Standard so the country must use more low-carbon fuel in total, not just reshuffle it from trucks to planes. But this would raise pressure on limited agricultural land and drive up crop prices, and thus food prices nationally and globally.

The analysis does not count future innovations that could make SAF cheaper over time. Whether bio-based SAF or e-fuels (“power-to-liquids”) become cheaper is still an open question.

Yet under all scenarios, the analysis shows that if policymakers align incentives so aviation and trucking are not competing for the same fuels, the U.S. can scale SAF much faster and cut more emissions this decade, at a cost not much higher than the country is paying for its current biofuels.",https://salatainstitute.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_365895620_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 10:56:08.379915

Now known as Par Hawaii East, the facility is the site of Hawaii’s first SAF project.
However, the state’s carbon reduction mandate requires the utilities to provide 100% renewable energy by 2045, according to Wright.
“The renewable fuel we’re making is going to help the utilities hit their mandated renewable energy goals.
After the technology was proved out, Par Pacific moved forward with the technology, installing it in their new system.","More than 2,400 miles from the mainland U.S., energy company Par Pacific Holdings Inc. serves as Hawaii’s lone refinery. In 2023, the company decided to add sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel to their product portfolio, creating a unit focused on developing renewable fuels projects. This unit developed the Hawaii Renewables Project at the Par Hawaii East refinery near Kapolei, Hawaii. Currently, the refinery’s capacity stand at 94,000 barrels per day (b/d) of conventional fuel. In 2023, the company committed to converting one of its units into a hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process. When operation begins, the renewables unit will produce 4,000 b/d, or 60 MMgy, of renewable diesel and SAF.

Par Pacific made its debut in the Hawaiian market in 2013 with the purchase of a refinery formerly owned by Tesoro. Now known as Par Hawaii East, the facility is the site of Hawaii’s first SAF project.

Refining Resilience

The grit and determination of Par Pacific’s leadership led to its current market position, according to Jon Goldsmith, senior vice president of renewables with Par Pacific. When the then-startup company first entered the Hawaiian market, it was a case of David and Goliath, with Par competing against one of the world’s largest energy companies—Chevron. Tesoro was shuttering a 50-year-old refinery in Kapolei, a city on Hawaii’s Oahu Island. “We invested capital, we restarted the plant, and we were able to maintain all these critical jobs and on-island energy production,” he tells Biomass Magazine. “And Hawaii has limited high-quality manufacturing and industrial sector jobs.”

In 2016, Chevron sold its refinery to Island Energy Services. A few years later, the refinery was shuttered and Par Hawaii acquired most of the assets. Through strategic acquisitions of refineries from fuel suppliers, after seven years, Par Pacific emerged as the state’s only refiner. Not only playing a key role as a fuel supplier for the electrical grid, shipping and air transport, Par Hawaii also provides high-paying jobs in a market with few job options. Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii, has lived in the state for eight years. Par Hawaii takes its role as one of few high-paying industrial employers very seriously. The refinery employs about 300 people, paying new workers $40 per hour.

“It’s not for everybody, but for people who are looking for a good career path, this is really a great option for them,” Wright says. “The renewable fuels project helps solidify our future and make sure that we stay relevant as a state pursues its clean energy goals.”

In-House Development

In 2019, the refinery invested in a distillate hydrogen treater, which removes sulfur from diesel and helps refiners hit the regulation specification of 15 parts per million. The unit ran for a couple years before the company observed the growth of the renewable fuels industry, and Par Pacific decided to explore converting the unit to a dedicated HEFA renewable fuels plant. In 2022, the company partnered with Hawaiian Airlines to explore SAF production. After a year of exploring the technical demands of the project with technology provider Topsoe, and as well as economic potential for SAF and renewable diesel production, Par Pacific committed to pressing forward on the project in 2023.

Goldsmith emphasizes the impressive capabilities of Par Hawaii’s experienced engineers, who allowed the company to develop, design and execute the project without hiring an engineering, procurement and construction contractor. Par Pacific’s new mission statement, “Humbly serving communities,” has been evidenced in the company’s engagement with the surrounding community, Goldsmith explains.

This in-house approach allowed Par Pacific to develop the 60 MMgy HEFA unit for less than $100 million dollars, a cost of around $1.50 per gallon. “If you look at other projects that have been announced, that’s relatively cheap and the reason for that is we have the refinery with a lot of existing infrastructure that we were able to utilize,” Wright says.

Combining Forces

Par Pacific recently announced the formation of Hawaii Renewables LLC, a joint venture company with Alohi Renewable Energy LLC (a partnership between Mitsubishi Corp. and ENEOS Corp., two of Japan’s largest energy and trading companies), where Par Pacific would contribute and operate the renewable fuel production assets in Hawaii.

The partnership will combine Par Pacific’s advantaged West Coast and Hawaii asset base and operational capabilities with improved market access via Mitsubishi’s terminal in Long Beach, California. Both ENEOS and Mitsubishi will enhance the business by leveraging their global integrated businesses and providing their technical, trading and feedstock origination capabilities across Asia-Pacific and North America.

“We are thrilled to be combining forces with Mitsubishi and ENEOS,” Goldsmith says. “We have been collaborating for well over a year and have had the opportunity to shape the partnership in a way that will bring value to all parties.”

Markets & Mandates

Hawaii is a unique market for renewable fuels, Wright explains. The state’s electrical grid primarily relies on diesel or fuel oil for power generation, with around 65% of the state’s energy derived from these sources. However, the state’s carbon reduction mandate requires the utilities to provide 100% renewable energy by 2045, according to Wright. “Liquid fuels will always be a part of the mix here,” he explains. “The renewable fuel we’re making is going to help the utilities hit their mandated renewable energy goals. But the great thing about our project is that we can sell the diesel to the utilities, and the sustainable aviation fuel we can sell to the airlines. The diesel can also go to the marine market shipping. So, we really hit a lot of different sectors of the economy with our project.”

The state must meet certain benchmarks progressing toward the ultimate goal of 100% renewable energy: 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2040. Hawaii’s liquid fuel demand stands at about 100,000 b/d, meaning that Par Hawaii’s renewable fuel unit will not overwhelm the market. Goldsmith explains that the max SAF volume is around 2,400 b/d, around 5% of the approximately 50,000 b/d jet fuel market. “The project scale is right-sized for the Hawaii market,” he says.

The infrastructure acquired and developed over the years enables the company to send products to market in a cost-efficient manner. Par Hawaii owns a 20-mile pipeline that runs from the refinery’s jet fuel storage to Honolulu Airport. Once production starts, the refinery can blend SAF with its conventional jet fuel and ship it down the pipeline, directly to the airport. “We’re very closely integrated with the airport and the jet fuel infrastructure in a way that a lot of other facilities aren’t,” Wright says.

Feedstock Flexibility

The unit is able to handle a wide range of feedstocks, including beef tallow, used cooking oil and more. To maximize economic benefits, Par Hawaii has installed an innovative, and first-of-its-kind pretreatment technology developed by Lutros LLC.

Par Pacific helped finance Lutros’ pilot plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee. After the technology was proved out, Par Pacific moved forward with the technology, installing it in their new system. Wright explains that since the facility will utilize diverse feedstocks, pretreatment helps ensure that the oils are free of any contaminants that could poison the catalyst. The company recognized the importance of onsite pretreatment, rather than purchasing treated feedstock.

Collocating the renewable fuels unit alongside a refinery benefits the process in a number of ways. The presence of preexisting hydrogen infrastructure is one such benefit, according to Wright. Par Hawaii East used to process a lot of Alaskan crude oil, which has a high sulfur content. Due to that, the refinery added hydrogen to reach required fuel specifications. Currently, the refinery uses a “sweeter” crude slate with less sulfur, meaning that the hydrogen plants were underutilized.

The hydrogen is produced via a process similar to steam methane reforming but substituting propane for methane, the unit separates the carbon and hydrogen, allowing the hydrogen to be used in the SAF production. “The renewable fuels unit will actually, in the first stage of the unit, make a lot of renewable propane from the renewable feedstock,” Wright says. “And so, we’re able to feed that to the hydrogen unit and produce renewable hydrogen that then gets used to make the renewable fuel. We don’t make enough renewable propane to say … we’re using all green hydrogen, but we come pretty close.”

Currently, fuel production requires importing all feedstock by ship, both from the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Jones Act requires cargo travelling from one U.S. port to another to be transported by a U.S.-built ship, flying a U.S. flag and crewed by Americans. Par Hawaii charters one of these ships under a long-term lease, which transports feedstock and products from Par Pacific’s refinery in Tacoma, Washington, out to Hawaii. Wright highlights that many HEFA plants use imported feedstock of some type, whether that be used cooking oil from Asia or canola oil from Canada.

A Second Life

Par Hawaii is already seeking solutions for its feedstock access challenges, exploring Hawaii-based feedstocks with Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private conservation company. The group tests the viability of growing various crops on fallow agricultural land across the state. One such crop is camelina, a promising HEFA feedstock.

Camelina has potential to not only serve as a feedstock for the oils needed for SAF, but also provide animal feed at an affordable price to livestock farmers within the state, explains Chris Bennett, vice president of sustainable energy solutions with Pono Pacific. The crop’s short growth cycle—80 to 100 days—could allow it to serve as a cover crop, rotating with food production during Hawaii’s long growing season. “If we’re successful, and we’re able to activate fallow lands, that actually means more land is in production,” Bennett says.

Pono completed pilot tests of several camelina varieties and identified the best strain for the region. The next step is to expand the project to 100-acre plots, with the five-year plan being to reach 50,000 acres. The ultimate goal is not to fully provide Par Hawaii’s feedstock, as there isn’t acreage available in the state to grow camelina at that scale, but Pono Pacific plans to provide 10% to 20% of the refinery’s feedstock if the project’s scale-up is successful.

“I think this is such a great project that shows that an oil refinery and a 25-year [old] land conservation company can find common ground and work together in a way that potentially could be very positive for the state of Hawaii,” Bennett says.

Hawaii’s unique, high-demand market offers a wide range of opportunities for renewable fuel producers. Renewable diesel demand originating from the cruise ship industry, marine fuel, electric grid and more, along with the state’s large, aviation fuel-reliant tourist industry and the state’s net-zero carbon emissions goals creates a perfect storm for renewable fuel demand. Although the logistics of feedstock supply and lack of a strong tax credit framework for renewable fuels constitute a challenge, they are not impossible to overcome. “I think it’s a great story that this refinery had a second life and now we’re making a big investment in it, and solidifying its future,” Wright adds. “As you can imagine, our people are really excited about it. It’s something new we get to learn how to do.”

As one of the world’s largest economies and a regional leader, Indonesia could help shape the global climate agenda – while also showcasing the progress it is making on its own decarbonization pathway.

BloombergNEF’s Indonesia Transition Factbook aims to support policy, business and investment professionals by making available key data about the country’s energy transition, as well as the trends, challenges and opportunities that are shaping it.

Indonesia’s net-zero transformation presents a $3.8 trillion opportunity through 2050.

The country still relies heavily on fossil fuels for power generation, but it is also starting to accelerate its clean power deployment on the back of a new, renewables-rich power development plan and rapidly expanding solar and battery supply chains. Indonesia is already the world’s second-largest producer of geothermal power and is aiming for the top spot.

In the transport sector, electric vehicles are quickly gaining traction on Indonesian roads. EVs reached a 14% share of passenger vehicle sales from January to August 2025, and many foreign automakers are setting up EV production facilities in the country. Meanwhile, state-owned airlines have started commercial flights with sustainable aviation fuel made by the national oil and gas company, Pertamina.

Indonesia is one of the world’s top sources of energy transition metals, such as nickel, cobalt, bauxite and copper. In the coming years and decades, Indonesia’s supply of these materials will be essential if the world is to meet its climate goals. On the sustainable finance front, the volume of sustainable and sustainability-linked debt issued in Indonesia grew 12-fold to $6.3 billion in 2024 from $0.5 billion in 2015, indicating an increasingly lively market.

With one of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems in the world, Indonesia can also lead the way in sustaining biodiversity. The archipelago’s vast potential for providing nature-based solutions puts it at the heart of the growing global trade of carbon credits, a financial instrument that could be key to saving these diverse ecosystems.",https://assets.bbhub.io/image/v1/convert?type=auto&url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.bbhub.io%2Fprofessional%2Fsites%2F44%2FAutomated-Manufacturing-Facility-new.png,N,,2025-10-05 23:56:23.874782

O Ministério da Agricultura e Pecuária recebeu, pela primeira vez em 165 anos, a visita de um presidente da Petrobras. Magda Chambriard e o ministro Carlos Fávaro discutiram a integração entre o agronegócio e o setor energético.

Na ocasião, a Petrobras apresentou três frentes de atuação no agro: originação de matérias-primas, polos de venda e comercialização direta com grandes consumidores.

A estatal também destacou o crescimento da demanda por diesel nas regiões do Centro-Oeste e MATOPIBA, que abrange o Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí e a Bahia, impulsionado pela expansão agrícola.

Segundo Magda Chambriard, o futuro do Brasil passa pela união entre o petróleo e o agro.

Entre os temas abordados, estão o fortalecimento da infraestrutura logística, o avanço dos biocombustíveis – como etanol de milho, biodiesel, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) e o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) — e parcerias com cooperativas e centros de pesquisa para desenvolver fertilizantes mais eficientes.

Para o ministro Carlos Fávaro, o encontro aproxima de forma concreta os dois setores:

Driven by rising fuel costs and sustainability goals, airlines are rediscovering the value of propeller-driven efficiency on short routes. Models like the De Havilland Dash 8, ATR 42, and the upcoming Deutsche Aircraft D328eco are proving that slower can sometimes mean smarter. With jets offering little advantage on 200–300-mile hops, turboprops burn far less fuel, operate from shorter runways, and cost less to maintain — a powerful equation in today’s tight-margin market.

From the US to Europe and Asia, regional carriers are returning to turboprops to connect smaller cities and remote regions. In North America, airlines like Porter and WestJet Encore use Dash 8s to serve rural hubs. Across island nations like Indonesia and the Philippines, they remain essential lifelines. The next generation, led by Germany’s D328eco, combines speed, range, and green technology — even capable of flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel.

Once dismissed as outdated, turboprops are now being reimagined as the backbone of regional mobility — efficient, versatile, and ready for the era of low-emission flying. #fblifestyle"".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/558087021_122250711842064089_5844283536119857744_n.jpg?stp=c216.0.648.648a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&efg=eyJlZmdfdGFnIjoiRkVFRC5iZXN0X2ltYWdlX3VybGdlbi5DMyJ9&_nc_ohc=HdBGVbh7BdYQ7kNvwEJF3fg&_nc_oc=Adl7YRCG8U56Wfp5k-Un7bSOs8udh9tpvwrnMZU7igskhfPsV2mDihGxKNMsTbC_TCw&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=8Zqc2zsI-lPiRz6io4GESA&oh=00_AfdFE4OEcPkPG3A4irmdMk-FekHJBKbVGtGYlERyBxvELw&oe=68E90804,N,,2025-10-06 00:56:23.989930

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuel producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, that turns cattle fat, called tallow, into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuel market. It has collected more than $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofues since 2022, according to filings.

Farmers urged to be grain-safe this fall

Working around grain bins comes with risk, from farmers falling to drowning in grain: Experts have five tips to help avoid grain-related accidents this harvest.

However, interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025, according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel.

However, government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, which many consider the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law.

“Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed more than a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally cleared land in the Amazon.

In 2022, Darling Ingredients chief executive officer Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found that one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meat packers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been co-operating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 sq. miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama.

Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle were moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner, Antonio Lucena Barros, still owes more than $3 million in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer, Calebe Rocha, said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer, Vinicius Segatto, said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to expand their pastures because of its economic value — less than three per cent of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a byproduct of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to expand their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.",https://static.producer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02161144/190830_web1_2012-10-23T120000Z_974771627_GM1E8AN10Q101_RTRMADP_3_BRAZIL-SOY-CATTLE.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 22:56:12.507873

“This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5% (101,809ha) to 5.1% (210,000ha) annually,” he said.
He expressed hope that the government would approve RM280mil in funding for oil palm replanting programmes specifically for independent smallholders.","KUALA LUMPUR: The palm oil industry has called for more targeted incentives and policy support under Budget 2026 to enhance export competitiveness, boost yields and productivity, and strengthen sustainability, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB).

Its director-general, Datuk Dr Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir, said the government should intensify trade promotion and branding initiatives to position Malaysian palm oil as a sustainable, climate-smart commodity.

“Stronger branding reinforces Malaysia’s commitment to sustainability standards such as Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and the National Traceability System, which improves transparency and accountability.

“This credibility helps counter negative campaigns in key export markets and assures buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious consumer demand,” he told Bernama.

He said the industry is also seeking fiscal incentives for downstream products, including oleochemicals, specialty fats, bioenergy, and sustainable aviation fuel, describing them as key levers to future-proof the sector against regulatory pressures, shifting consumer preferences, and global sustainability requirements.

“We urge more strategic support for logistics efficiency, including incentives for greener and lower-cost export solutions, to address both immediate cost pressures and long-term market positioning, ensuring that Malaysia’s palm oil industry remains resilient and future-ready,” he added.

Raising yield and productivity

Ahmad Parveez said a 100% reinvestment allowance for oil palm replanting should be encouraged to accelerate replanting by both private and government agencies.

“This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5% (101,809ha) to 5.1% (210,000ha) annually,” he said.

He expressed hope that the government would approve RM280mil in funding for oil palm replanting programmes specifically for independent smallholders.

“Recognising the urgent need to rejuvenate ageing plantations, the government remains committed to supporting independent smallholders and will continue to fast-track the replanting programme under the 13th Malaysia Plan.

“This includes improving delivery mechanisms, facilitating access to financial assistance, and strengthening outreach and engagement with smallholder communities,” he said.

He noted that the introduction of a RM100mil soft loan scheme for small and medium oil palm estates was timely to rejuvenate ageing and unproductive trees, which currently contribute to declining yields and reduced competitiveness.

“Similar to Smallholder Oil Palm Replanting Programme, this scheme would allow smallholders to undertake replanting without heavy financial strain, thereby accelerating rejuvenation across a wider segment of the industry.

“In the medium to long term, this initiative will boost national crude palm oil production through higher-yielding palm varieties and better farm management practices,” he noted.

Promoting a sustainable future

Ahmad Parveez proposed imposing a 3% export duty on refined, bleached and deodorised palm stearin to discourage excessive exports and ensure sufficient supply for the domestic oleochemical sector.

He said maintaining an adequate domestic supply of raw materials would sustain production and competitiveness while indirectly supporting the palm-based oleochemical industry.

“By strengthening downstream industries, we create a more sustainable and resilient palm oil future, adding higher value locally and safeguarding long-term competitiveness,” he said.

He also suggested imposing a 10% to 20% export duty on waste oils, including used cooking oil and palm oil mill effluent.

This would promote local utilisation and value addition by securing sufficient feedstock for biodiesel, renewable fuels, and oleochemical production.

“Additionally, duties would help reinforce compliance with sustainability and certification standards such as MSPO and International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, which are crucial for both domestic use and export credibility.

“In the longer term, this measure would accelerate Malaysia’s transition towards a circular, greener palm oil industry and strengthen its global competitiveness as a responsible and future-ready commodity.”

Overcoming external challenges

Ahmad Parveez added that the Budget 2026 could play a pivotal role in helping the palm oil sector overcome external challenges while fostering growth, productivity and resilience.

He said replanting programmes for smallholders and small and medium enterprise plantations should be expanded, with an emphasis on high-yielding and disease-resistant planting materials.

“The focus should also be on strengthening sustainability compliance through universal MSPO adoption and robust traceability systems.

“Compliance with global environmental, social and governance standards is vital to safeguard Malaysia’s position in international markets.

“Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency,” he added.",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/10/06/3556304.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 20:56:19.644707

AIS chief executive Somchai Lertsutiwong said the company plans to address climate change through efficient management of its business operations and supply chain.

Mr Somchai said the potential of digital technology and collaboration from several sectors are the keys to driving the country towards a sustainable future.

He said AIS's digital green initiative includes greener products and services, a greener supply chain and customers, a greener corporation and greener business growth.

GREEN NETWORK

The company upgraded equipment at its cellular network base stations nationwide and integrated them with clean energy, alongside conventional energy supplies.

For example, AIS recently installed solar energy systems at more than 13,000 cellular network base stations and buildings.

Mr Somchai said the move was crucial in remote areas, where 100% alternative energy is required to support communication services.

One of AIS's green initiatives is called ""Green Energy, Green Network for Thais"", delivering solar power-generated electricity to communities and installing solar-powered cellular base stations to create digital networks for communities.

AIS, Gulf Development, and the Highland Research and Development Institute (HRDI) teamed up for the project last year, seeking to improve the quality of life for Thais in highland areas.

Two pilot projects are running in the Ban Dok Mai Sod community and Moko Poke community in Tak province's Tha Song Yang district.

Mr Somchai said the goal is to reduce inequality, improve quality of life and foster sustainable economic growth within these communities.

The trio continued their partnership with the commencement of a second year of the project in June 2025.

Another project took place in Ban Doi Wiang in Chiang Mai's Chai Prakan district, where Gulf joined forces with AIS and satellite operator Thaicom to install solar panels at the Mae Fah Luang Community Learning Center.

The clean energy generated supports internet and satellite connectivity, enabling children and youth to access new knowledge and educational opportunities.

The AIS network also enhances digital access and communication for the entire community.

Furthermore, the project supported the construction of a solar-powered coffee processing facility and provided coffee milling equipment, allowing locals to add value to their produce and develop a community-owned coffee brand.

Mr Somchai said AIS leverages artificial intelligence to manage energy consumption at its base stations.

Regarding waste management, AIS focuses on reducing and recycling waste from its operations under its ""Zero E-Waste to Landfill"" goal -- meaning no electronic waste ends up in landfills.

The company also encouraged the public to properly manage e-waste, he said.

HUB OF E-WASTE

Saichon Submakudom, head of corporate communication and public affairs at AIS, said sustainability and environmental stewardship are at the heart of its operations, particularly in the area of e-waste management.

""We are committed to becoming Thailand's hub of e-waste,"" Ms Saichon said.

AIS, together with more than 250 public and private sector partners, has been raising awareness about the impact of e-waste and providing convenient disposal channels that ensure proper recycling, she said.

Since 2020, AIS's collaboration with Central Group on an e-waste project has expanded to include more than 42 e-waste drop-off points nationwide.

Every piece of e-waste deposited with AIS is handled through its partnership with Waste Management Siam (WMS), a member of Dowa Group.

According to AIS, the amount of e-waste increases every year globally. In 2024, 62 million tonnes of e-waste was generated and estimates suggest the quantity will increase to 74 million tonnes by 2030 and 110 tonnes by 2050.

Of the 62 million tonnes of e-waste produced in 2024, only 22% of it was managed properly, according to the company.

Some 439,495 tonnes of e-waste was generated in Thailand in 2024 and only 10% of it was handled properly, noted AIS.

Thailand ranks third in Southeast Asia for greatest quantity of e-waste produced.

FLY FOR FREE

AIS recently partnered with Central and Japan Airlines (JAL) to launch the ""Film Your E-Waste Drop & Fly to Japan for Free!"" campaign.

The campaign invites AIS customers, as well as eco-conscious shoppers using Central outlets, to unleash their creativity by producing short videos that inspire friends to dispose of e-waste correctly.

The winners are awarded an exclusive trip to Japan via JAL, featuring an all-inclusive dining, travelling and shopping experience. The campaign runs from now until Nov 30.

The trip includes a collaboration between AIS and Central to explore Japan's comprehensive e-waste management and recycling ecosystem at a Dowa company in Japan.

Dowa possesses a wealth of expertise in e-waste management and recycling, and is a global leader in e-waste solutions.

Achara Wisuttiwongrat, head of corporate marketing, communication and sustainability at Central, said the company set a target to reduce landfill waste by at least 30% by 2030, and achieve zero landfill waste by 2050 through its ""Love The Earth – Zero Waste Now"" project.

Takafumi Sawada, regional manager of Thailand, Indochina, and the South Asian subcontinent at JAL, said the airline is deeply committed to its environmental and social responsibilities.

He said the airline set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from used cooking oil during flights.

JAL plans to increase the proportion of SAF it uses to 10% by 2030, while modernising its fleet with new, energy-efficient aircraft.

The airline is following the ""Reduce, Reuse, Recycle + Redesign"" principle by eliminating single-use plastics and introducing biodegradable food containers to reduce its environmental impact, said Mr Sawada.

SHIFTING GEARS

Yoshihiro Okada, president of WMS, said Dowa Group has been involved in mining and metal smelting for more than 140 years.

""We shifted our business direction to address the depletion of natural resources by turning e-waste into a valuable source of raw materials for precious metal extraction,"" he said.

In Thailand, Mr Okada said Dowa believes ""e-waste is not waste, but a valuable resource"".

Through its collaboration with AIS, the e-waste collected is sent to ESBEC, a subsidiary of WMS, for dismantling.

Most of the recyclable materials are processed domestically, while non-recyclable components such as mobile phone batteries are safely disposed of using energy recovery incineration.

For complex yet highly valuable components, such as printed circuit boards containing multiple precious metals, these are exported to Dowa's facilities in Japan for advanced recycling processes.

Mr Okada said as a global leader in resource extraction and circular utilisation, Dowa is committed to reintegrating these recovered metals back into industrial processes -- helping to build a more sustainable future for both society and the environment.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/10/06/5806160_700.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 20:56:34.998147

Sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediately viable option for reducing aviation emissions while existing aircraft continue operating.
Its involvement in sustainable aviation fuel development reflects a strategic bet that the sector offers genuine development potential rather than just environmental benefits.","Africa’s aviation industry could soon be producing its own sustainable fuel rather than relying entirely on imported jet fuel, following a new partnership between the African Development Bank (AfDB) and a major Japanese engineering company. The collaboration, announced Friday, aims to develop production capacity for sustainable aviation fuel across the continent while advancing climate goals and reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports.

The AfDB and JGC Corporation signed a Letter of Intent on August 21 in Yokohama during the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9), establishing a framework for cooperation on green aviation projects. The timing reflects growing global momentum toward cleaner aviation fuels as airlines and governments seek ways to reduce the sector’s substantial carbon footprint.

Under the agreement, both organizations will share technical information, conduct demand assessments and feasibility studies, and explore opportunities to co finance sustainable aviation fuel projects across Africa. For the AfDB, the partnership fits within its broader sustainable transport and energy transition strategy, which increasingly targets sectors with high emissions and significant economic impact.

“Adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” said Solomon Quaynor, the bank’s Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization. “Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time.”

His emphasis on competitiveness highlights an economic dimension beyond environmental benefits. Airlines operating in Africa currently purchase conventional jet fuel at prices determined by global oil markets and supply chain logistics that favor established aviation hubs. Developing domestic sustainable aviation fuel production could eventually provide cost advantages while creating new industries and employment opportunities.

JGC Corporation, founded in 1928 and headquartered in Yokohama, brings substantial engineering expertise to the partnership. The company has expanded beyond traditional plant engineering into renewable energy and sustainable fuels in recent years, positioning itself to help African countries adapt technologies that have been tested in other markets to local conditions and feedstock availability.

“We are proud to collaborate with the African Development Bank in advancing Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa,” said Shoji Yamada, JGC’s President. “By leveraging our experience in plant engineering and sustainable energy, we aim to contribute to Africa’s decarbonization efforts while fostering local economic growth and innovation.”

The company’s role will include conducting demand assessments that determine how much sustainable aviation fuel African airlines and airports could realistically consume, performing technical feasibility studies to identify promising production locations and technologies, and exploring how Japanese sustainable aviation fuel systems might need modification to work effectively in African contexts.

The AfDB, meanwhile, will coordinate with public sector aviation stakeholders including national airlines, airport authorities, and transportation ministries. The bank plans to identify potential project pipelines, develop financing options that could make projects viable for private investors, and promote partnerships around sustainable aviation initiatives throughout its 41 African member countries.

Sustainable aviation fuel represents a category of jet fuel derived from renewable sources rather than petroleum. Common feedstocks include plant oils, agricultural waste materials, municipal solid waste, and even carbon captured from industrial processes. When produced and used properly, these fuels can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel, according to industry assessments.

The fuel isn’t entirely new. Airlines globally have been testing and using sustainable aviation fuel in limited quantities for years, often blending small percentages with conventional fuel. What’s changing is the scale of production and adoption as governments implement climate policies and airlines respond to pressure from customers and investors to reduce emissions.

For Africa, entering the sustainable aviation fuel market presents both opportunities and challenges. The continent has abundant agricultural resources and waste streams that could serve as feedstock for fuel production. Many African countries also have significant solar energy potential that could power production facilities, creating genuinely low carbon fuel production chains.

However, building sustainable aviation fuel production capacity requires substantial upfront investment in specialized facilities and supply chain infrastructure. The technology, while proven, remains more expensive than conventional refining in most contexts. And African countries would need to develop regulatory frameworks governing fuel quality standards, sustainability certifications, and integration with existing aviation fuel supply systems.

The partnership announcement comes as global aviation confronts its climate impact. The sector accounts for roughly 2 to 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, a share that’s been growing as air travel expands faster than efficiency improvements can offset. Unlike some industries where electrification offers a clear pathway to decarbonization, aviation faces significant technical hurdles in moving away from liquid fuels, particularly for long haul flights.

Sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the most immediately viable option for reducing aviation emissions while existing aircraft continue operating. The fuel works in current engines without modification, unlike hydrogen or battery electric propulsion systems that would require entirely new aircraft designs.

For African nations, the economic calculus around sustainable aviation fuel development includes multiple factors beyond direct production costs. Countries currently spend significant foreign exchange importing jet fuel. Domestic production could improve trade balances while creating skilled manufacturing jobs. The agricultural and waste management sectors might find new revenue streams by supplying feedstock to fuel producers.

There’s also a competitive dimension. If sustainable aviation fuel production scales up in other regions while Africa remains dependent on imports, African airlines could face cost disadvantages as carbon pricing mechanisms and sustainability requirements proliferate. Developing domestic capacity now could position the continent advantageously for future market conditions.

The AfDB has been actively financing infrastructure and industrial projects across Africa, operating as the continent’s premier development finance institution with support for initiatives in 54 regional member states. Its involvement in sustainable aviation fuel development reflects a strategic bet that the sector offers genuine development potential rather than just environmental benefits.

Whether this partnership generates significant on the ground projects remains to be seen. Memoranda of understanding and letters of intent are common in development finance, sometimes leading to substantial initiatives but other times failing to advance beyond preliminary studies. Success will likely depend on identifying specific countries with favorable conditions for initial projects, securing adequate financing, and navigating regulatory complexities.

What’s clear is that both organizations see opportunity in Africa’s potential role in the emerging sustainable aviation fuel industry. As Quaynor suggested, the partnership could “unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector.” Whether that optimistic vision materializes will depend on execution in the months and years ahead, but the framework for collaboration is now established.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-10-05 18:56:12.329894

The African Development Bank (AfDB) and Japan’s JGC Corporation have signed a Letter of Intent to collaborate on developing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects across Africa — a move that could help accelerate the continent’s transition toward greener air transport.

The agreement was signed on the sidelines of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) held in Yokohama last month, by Solomon Quaynor, AfDB Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, and Shoji Yamada, Representative Director and President of JGC Corporation.

SAF refers to jet fuel produced from renewable resources such as plant oils, waste materials, or captured carbon, which can significantly reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

The Letter of Intent establishes a framework for joint promotion, knowledge exchange, and co-financing opportunities in the development of SAF and other green aviation initiatives on the continent.

As part of the agreement, the AfDB will facilitate coordination with public-sector aviation stakeholders, identify potential project pipelines, and explore financing mechanisms — including feasibility study support and debt or equity financing.

Meanwhile, JGC Corporation will conduct demand and technical feasibility studies, assess deployment opportunities based on local infrastructure and resources, and help transfer Japanese clean-energy technology to African markets.

The initiative aligns with the AfDB’s sustainable transport, mobility, and energy transition strategy, aimed at decarbonizing key sectors of Africa’s economy while supporting industrial growth and innovation.

Quaynor said the partnership represents an important step toward reducing emissions and enhancing competitiveness in Africa’s aviation sector.

“Adopting sustainable aviation fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” he said.

“Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time. This partnership with JGC will help unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector.”

Countries use a wide variety of financial management systems and processes, which are not standardized and seldom share information across platforms.

To address these issues, the World Bank is rolling out FundsChain.

This proprietary platform uses blockchain technology to track every dollar on a secure, immutable digital ledger that can be accessed by all project stakeholders.

By offering broader access to up-to-date transaction records, FundsChain is greatly enhancing efficiency, transparency, and accountability.

As the first multilateral development institution to implement blockchain for project oversight, the World Bank is leading the way in future-ready financial management.

Impact on financial management and communities

The use of FundsChain to track project funds is part of a broader effort to make World Bank Group (WBG) operations more efficient and streamlined, ultimately better serving clients and communities.

“FundsChain is a one-stop shop for financial reporting and transparent tracking. It quickly shows payments, contracts, and expenses, notifying suppliers the moment payments are ready, empowering teams to make timely, informed decisions and streamline project management,” said Lovella Tolentino-Morada, finance management specialist at the Metro Manila Development Authority.

The Philippines was one of the early adopters of FundsChain, which was rolled out to the Metro Manila Flood Management Project, a USD 500 million initiative funded by the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

The project aims to reduce Manila’s vulnerability to floods by upgrading water infrastructure.

In Bangladesh, FundsChain is being used in the Bangladesh Resilience, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood Improvement Project.

This initiative targets 3,200 villages to help women launch entrepreneurial ventures, cover pregnancy-related expenses, improve sanitation, and provide wider support for the community.

Since the project worth USD 600 million began in 2021, it has helped lift more than 115,000 people out of poverty.

“We are implementing FundsChain in 350 villages as a pilot. We are also implementing our Loan Management System (LMS) in all 3,200 villages of the project, providing laptops, and women leaders have been trained to use it.

When FundsChain is linked with the LMS, they will be able to use it directly, and every village organization will become part of the process and can track funds transparently,” explained Mahbubul Alam, director of the project at the Social Development Foundation, an autonomous organization under the Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of Finance.

Alam underscored that FundsChain is also benefiting his finance management team by simplifying transaction records and digitalizing all project-related information, something especially important in a project with many suppliers and beneficiaries.

FundsChain is a one-stop shop for financial reporting and transparent tracking.

It quickly shows payments, contracts, and expenses, notifying suppliers the moment payments are ready, empowering teams to make timely, informed decisions and streamline project management.

How does FundsChain work?

FundsChain integrates technologies such as cryptography, distributed ledgers, and the internet to provide a secure and immutable platform for all types of transactions.

It uses Hyperledger Besu, a blockchain solution which allows transactions to be stored by all parties involved in a project and recorded permanently.

This enables development partners to track funds throughout the lifecycle of a project, and to prepare comprehensive project execution reports, allowing for robust data analysis.

The platform has already been recognized internationally.

In 2025, it received the Most Exciting Public Sector Innovation Project award from the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications and was featured in Citi’s Global Perspective and Solutions report for its role in modernizing financial systems and enabling new financial instruments.

FundsChain has been successfully tested in 13 projects across 10 countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Comoros Islands, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Moldova, Mozambique, and the Philippines.

It will now be scaled up and extended to approximately 250 projects in developing countries by the end of this fiscal year, in June 2026.

As FundsChain continues to expand across more projects and countries, it is important to ensure that development financing is fast and transparent, to deliver the best outcomes for people and the planet.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FundsChain-village.webp,N,,2025-10-05 17:56:15.893777

Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing a demographic transition of global proportion.

By 2050, the region’s population is set to grow from 1.5 billion in 2024 to 2.5 billion, with more than 600 million people joining the working-age population.

By then, one in three individuals aged 15-34 globally will be African.

This provides an enormous opportunity for the continent to reap the demographic dividend of higher economic growth propelled by an expanding population.

That is, however, only if this expanding population can find productive employment opportunities. Jobs are the pathway to prosperity.

And yet, this is the crux: while Sub-Saharan Africa needs to create 15 million jobs each year to keep up, its economies create far fewer and are often poorly remunerated.

Today, many youths are idle, nor in education, employment, or training (NEET).

Adolescent girls specifically are too often dropping out of school due to early marriage or childbearing. There is real urgency.

World Bank Group President Ajay Banga has called for building “a ladder of opportunity” for young people in developing countries, where each rung represents a step towards better jobs and greater empowerment.

This is an appealing people-focused framework to think through what it takes to boost job opportunities at scale and quickly.

It recognizes that the path to inclusive growth in Africa lies in the generation of higher-quality jobs, with higher labour earnings being the main driver of poverty reduction.

Solving this challenge in Africa requires a multi-pronged strategy, from increased wage employment in today’s often small formal private sector to increased productivity in self-employment and micro-enterprises in Africa’s vast informal sector.

Managed migration programs can also enhance productive labour mobility within countries and internationally, including towards fast-aging economies.

Onto the ladder and up…

For young people to climb the ladder of opportunity, they must first get on it.

Extreme poverty and food insecurity often prevent this initial step.

Across Africa, social protection programs have proven effective in helping the poor onto the ladder by ensuring that food is on the table, children can access education and health services – key for building a strong workforce for tomorrow – and households can invest in productive assets like livestock or street vending.

Social protection also offers a safety net to those who fall off the ladder in the face of shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic or increasingly severe and frequent climate events.

Over the past two decades, Africa has pioneered “productive” social protection programs, starting with the flagship Ethiopia Productive Safety Net.

These initiatives now go beyond income support, incorporating public works employment that promote climate mitigation and resilience, engaging beneficiaries in entrepreneurship and life skills training, opening bank accounts, and promoting group savings schemes in addition to income support.

Programs like Senegal’s urban Yokk Koom Koom program, Ghana’s Productive Safety Net Program, and Zambia’s Supporting Women’s Livelihoods program, have significantly boosted household revenues and savings.

These programs are particularly successful among women who often self-select as the entrepreneurial dynamo in the household.

Youth employment programs are expanding to support African Youth in finding meaningful work. For example, Kenya’s Youth Employment and Opportunities program (KYEOP) has helped 155,000 young people launch 86,000 businesses, create 125,000 jobs, and increase incomes by 50 percent.

Building on this success, Kenya’s new National Youth Opportunities Towards Advancement (NYOTA) aims to reach 800,000 youth, addressing 35 percent of inactive, unemployed, or low paid young people aged 18-29.

Benin’s Azôli program (which means “path to employment”) similarly supports youth with job training, placement services, and entrepreneurship support.

These programs demonstrate that scaling such efforts can significantly impact youth employment, creating pathways to economic inclusion and resilience.

…and scaling the ladder

For the ladder of opportunity to support millions of aspiring workers, governments need to invest in robust systems.

Digital social registries of poor and vulnerable households, underpinned by identification systems, are the platform for targeting support to those most in need.

Digital government-to-person (G2P) payment systems can be used to transfer income support or start-up grants to beneficiaries and serve as an entry to access finance.

Labor market systems are critical to allow programs to scale. Senegal is building a system of informal apprenticeships with a formal validation of acquired competencies, delivering credentials to youth trained by informal businesses.

Benin’s national employment agency plays a key role in matching young job seekers to employment opportunities in the expanding private sector such as textiles in the Glo-Djigbé Industrial Zone.

Realizing Africa’s demographic dividend by 2050 requires dynamic private sector development to create productive jobs.

For the private sector to invest and create jobs, reforms need to be prioritized to enhance the business environment, boost market access, attract investment, and improve trade as well as sector and firm performance.

At the same time, education and skills development systems must prepare the workforce for the demands of a growing formal private sector.

While some of these reforms will take time to deliver results, scaling youth employment programs can deliver immediate results, helping millions onto the ladder of opportunity.

The urgency is real, but so is the opportunity.

With the right investments and partnerships, Africa’s youth can climb the ladder of opportunity—and drive the continent toward a brighter future.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unlocking-jobs-for-todays-african-youth.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 16:56:13.774218

The author is director of research at the Institute of Innovative and High-Quality Development (Hong Kong).","Hong Kong’s 2025 Policy Address lays out an ambitious green agenda to drive economic revitalization and sustainability hand in hand, embracing cleaner energy, modern transport, waste reduction, and nature-based tourism as engines for growth. It aligns with broader strategies — from the Northern Metropolis innovation hub to expansion of the headquarters economy — ensuring Hong Kong’s prosperity ties to environmental leadership.

Hong Kong is upgrading its infrastructure to improve efficiency and cut emissions. Building retrofits (better insulation, smart systems, on-site renewables) and district cooling projects will sharply reduce energy use in older commercial buildings. These measures also create new jobs — architects, engineers and green-product makers — bolstering the economy. The plans tie into the Northern Metropolis development strategy.

To power these advances, the city is expanding its clean energy infrastructure. A landmark commitment is the construction of an electric-vehicle battery recycling facility — the city’s first large-scale plant — which will start operation in the first half of 2026. Retired EV batteries will be broken down into “black mass” for reuse in new batteries, creating a circular supply chain. This not only reduces waste but also supplies materials to the Chinese mainland and the broader region, reinforcing Hong Kong’s role in a regional green economy. Fast charging for EVs is also being accelerated — a HK$300 million ($38.5 million) incentive program will add about 3,000 fast chargers by 2028, and bus depots will open chargers to public use. Together, these steps lower barriers for drivers to switch to EVs and cut transport emissions.

At the same time, the city is fostering innovation. The government continues funding emerging clean technologies through grants and partnerships. This includes the new HK$3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, and an upcoming HK$1 billion artificial intelligence research institute, illustrating how the green and tech agendas reinforce each other.

Transportation is a major emission source, so Hong Kong is pushing aggressively to electrify vehicles. In addition to expanding charging networks, the government will support market development of battery-swapping technologies and automated swapping stations. In fact, taxi and bus operators are already deploying EV fleets under government programs.

Hong Kong’s leadership is tying sustainable development to economic revitalization, headquarters attraction, and regional integration. The overall tone is one of confidence: By blending ambition with realism, the city aims to become a model “green finance and innovation hub” for Asia

Hong Kong is advancing toward a “zero landfill” future, with the Waste Blueprint 2035 targeting adequate waste-to-resource capacity by the mid-2030s; I-Park1 will progressively begin operation by end-2025, with I-Park2 funding sought next year, and a paper-pulping facility to begin trial operation by the end of 2025.

Hydrogen energy is a centerpiece of Hong Kong’s decarbonization strategy. The city has already launched 28 hydrogen trial projects — from zero-emission buses and street scrubbers to a public hydrogen refueling station in the New Territories — under the Hydrogen Strategy announced last year. These pilots, in collaboration with Guangdong province, aim to make fuel-cell vehicles practical and prepare the way for industrial use. In 2025, authorities will set safety and quality standards for hydrogen fuel and extend refilling stations to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. A notable goal is developing a Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor — a cross-border network of production plants and pipelines linking Hong Kong with mainland facilities, which will enable Hong Kong to tap cheaper large-scale hydrogen from neighboring cities, while providing outlets for local innovations.

Alongside hydrogen, Hong Kong is pursuing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for air transport and a specified target SAF consumption ratio by 2030 for flights departing Hong Kong. This means large volumes of biofuels or synthetic kerosene will replace traditional jet fuel. To support this, the city will partner with mainland SAF producers to build local SAF plants and a blending terminal, creating a Greater Bay Area hub for green aviation fuel. This positions Hong Kong air travel on a low-carbon path.

HK as a green finance hub

Hong Kong’s financial sector is a core pillar of this green strategy. The city has already cemented itself as Asia’s leading sustainable finance hub. To guide markets, Hong Kong has developed a local green taxonomy, released in 2024, aligned with the mainland’s, the European Union’s, and global standards. This common framework helps investors identify bona fide “green” projects and avoid “greenwashing”. Regulators are also building carbon-market infrastructure. For instance, the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd’s “Core Climate” carbon exchange is set to trial cross-boundary trading with Guangdong province pilot markets. Such links allow companies in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area to trade carbon credits seamlessly, broadening the market and depth of financing for clean projects. Together, these steps strengthen the city’s specialty as the gateway for green capital — attracting international issuers and funding while circulating private investment into local green jobs.

Hong Kong’s green push extends well beyond its borders, embracing the Greater Bay Area. The strategy explicitly builds on regional synergies. A centerpiece is the Beautiful Bay Area initiative — Hong Kong will co-lead efforts with Guangdong to clean up and protect coastal waters and ecosystems. It has pledged coordinated action on nearshore pollution control, shoreline restoration and ecosystem monitoring.

Energy and industrial cooperation also figure prominently. The planned Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor is a joint effort: Guangdong’s large hydrogen-production facilities will link to Hong Kong’s end users, creating economies of scale. In aviation and shipping, Hong Kong aims to be the regional green-fuel trading hub, exporting SAF and promoting clean marine fuels throughout the bay. Financially, Hong Kong is deepening carbon and bond market integration. The upcoming Hong Kong-Shenzhen Stock Connect extensions and carbon-trading pilot programs will let businesses tap the combined Greater Bay Area capital pool for climate projects. Even in waste, the new EV battery recycling plant in Hong Kong will feed raw materials into mainland factories, and vice versa. In short, the policy envisions Hong Kong’s climate efforts as fully embedded in the Greater Bay Area ecosystem.

Hong Kong’s status as an international port and tourist destination is being leveraged for sustainability. Maritime services will go green: A new government Bunkering Incentive Scheme and budgetary tax breaks encourage early adoption of zero-carbon fuels like green methanol and liquefied natural gas. The 2025-26 Budget explicitly offers tax incentives for ships bunkering green methanol, to cut costs and make Hong Kong a leader in sustainable shipping. Marine Department action plans will build green fuel terminals and safety protocols. These moves will attract eco-conscious shipping lines and spur local investment (fuel logistics, vessel refits) — reinforcing Hong Kong’s competitiveness as a maritime hub while reducing pollutants in its harbor.

On land, nature and tourism are being integrated under an “Ecology + Tourism” banner. The Four Peaks project will upgrade trails and facilities on Hong Kong’s mountains, adding things like treetop adventure parks, open-air cultural museums, and campsite renewals, all built to blend into the landscape. Meanwhile, rural attractions are being linked into immersive eco-tours: A network of cycling and hiking routes will connect traditional villages, ancestral halls, farms and cultural sites, providing rural communities with new income while encouraging city dwellers to appreciate conservation. The 2025 Policy Address sets out clear timelines. Hong Kong’s leadership is tying sustainable development to economic revitalization, headquarters attraction, and regional integration. The overall tone is one of confidence: By blending ambition with realism, the city aims to become a model “green finance and innovation hub” for Asia.

The proposed legislation aims to establish a comprehensive legal and institutional framework that supports artists, filmmakers, musicians, designers, and other creative professionals, addressing long-standing challenges that have hindered the sector’s growth.

Bill to Create Fund and Institutional Support

The Creative Economy Support Bill, sponsored by Senator Eddy Oketch, proposes the establishment of a Creatives Fund that will provide grants and financial assistance to individuals and organisations in the creative industries. The Fund will be financed through parliamentary appropriations and other sources approved by the Cabinet Secretary responsible for the creative economy.

The Bill also introduces a credit guarantee scheme designed to facilitate easier access to financing for creatives from banks and financial institutions. Many artists and creative entrepreneurs in Kenya struggle to obtain loans due to the informal nature of their work and the lack of collateral. The proposed guarantee scheme aims to bridge that gap by offering risk coverage to lenders who support creative ventures.

Another key feature of the Bill is the creation of a Creative Industry Guild, which will serve as a professional body to represent the interests of creatives, promote ethical standards, and protect intellectual property rights. The Guild is expected to unify a sector that has long been fragmented, with artists operating in isolation and often without legal or institutional protection.

Empowering Youth and Building Capacity

The Bill places strong emphasis on youth empowerment, recognising that a large proportion of Kenya’s creative workforce comprises young people. It proposes targeted initiatives to provide training, mentorship, and access to infrastructure such as creative hubs and studios. These measures are intended to enhance creative skills, promote innovation, and position Kenya as a regional leader in the creative economy.

In addition, the Bill outlines programmes for capacity building and incubation to help creatives turn their talents into sustainable businesses. It also calls for improved digital infrastructure and support for creative exports, ensuring that Kenyan content can reach international markets and attract global audiences.

What the Bill Aims to Address

Kenya’s creative economy has faced multiple challenges for years, including limited access to financing, a lack of structured policy support, weak intellectual property protection, and poor market access. Many creatives work informally and earn unstable incomes, while others lose revenue due to piracy and unfair contractual arrangements.

The Creative Economy Support Bill aims to address these systemic problems by formalising the sector and establishing a clear regulatory framework. It aims to ensure that creatives are recognised as contributors to national development, with access to funding, training, and legal protection. By addressing these gaps, the Bill also supports the government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda, which prioritises job creation and inclusive economic growth.

Debate Over “Money Bill” Status

The Bill’s introduction in the National Assembly has sparked debate over whether it qualifies as a Money Bill under Article 114 of the Constitution. While the drafters have stated that it does not, some legislators have questioned this classification because it involves the establishment of public funds. The Speaker of the National Assembly has since directed the Finance and National Planning Committee to review and advise on the matter before debate proceeds.

Significance for Kenya’s Creative Sector

If enacted, the Bill would mark a turning point for Kenya’s creative economy, which contributes significantly to employment and cultural identity but remains underfunded and undervalued. The sector includes a wide range of industries, from film and fashion to gaming, visual arts, publishing, advertising, and music.

By providing legal recognition and structured financial support, the proposed law is expected to boost investor confidence, improve working conditions for creatives, and position Kenya as a continental hub for creative innovation.

Public Participation

The Creative Economy Support Bill will now undergo committee scrutiny, public participation, and several readings before it can be passed into law. Stakeholders from across the arts and entertainment industry are closely watching its progress, with many expressing optimism that the legislation will finally bring long-awaited reforms.

If implemented effectively, the Bill could unlock Kenya’s creative potential, empower thousands of young artists, and transform the sector into a major driver of economic growth and cultural export.",https://newstrends.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-10-02-at-14.38.24-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 14:56:58.292292

In Yokohama, Japan, the Bank signed a Letter of Intent with JGC Corporation, a leading Japanese engineering company, to advance the production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on the continent. The agreement was concluded on the sidelines of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) in August.

Under the framework, AfDB Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, Solomon Quaynor, and JGC President, Shoji Yamada, agreed to collaborate on feasibility studies, technology transfer and potential co-financing of SAF projects across Africa. The Bank will coordinate with public sector aviation stakeholders, identify project pipelines and explore financing, while JGC will focus on technical assessments, demand studies and deployment of Japanese engineering solutions.

Quaynor described SAF as “a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions” and stressed that the initiative could make Africa a pacesetter in green aviation. Yamada added that JGC’s involvement would leverage its expertise in plant engineering and sustainable energy to support Africa’s decarbonisation while stimulating economic growth.

In a separate deal, the AfDB Group signed a $144.7 million financing agreement with Niger to expand electricity access and strengthen economic resilience. The pact, signed in Abidjan between AfDB President Sidi Ould Tah and Nigerien Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine, will provide budgetary support through the Bank’s concessional lending arm, the African Development Fund.

The funds will finance Phase 1 of Niger’s Energy Sector Governance and Competitiveness Support Programme (PAGSEC), which aims to raise electricity access from 22.5 percent to 30 percent by 2026, increase manufacturing’s contribution to GDP, and deliver 240 MW of new solar capacity by 2030.

The programme also targets structural reforms, including stronger fiscal management, domestic arrears clearance, and policies to stimulate private-sector investment. It prioritises social inclusion, with tailored interventions for women, youth, and Niger’s more than 500,000 internally displaced people affected by insecurity in the Sahel.

“This agreement is part of our strong cooperation with the African Development Bank Group,” Prime Minister Zeine said, noting that the support would boost Niger’s competitiveness and resilience.

Ould Tah assured that the Bank would remain a strong partner to its member states in “their pursuit of harmonious development and shared prosperity.”

The eVTOL developer finally held its much-anticipated live flight demonstration at the Osaka Expo. (When I visited back in May, they weren't even present at the Advanced Air Mobility Pavilion yet!). aThe wait was worth it for those lucky enough to witness it in person.

Want to know more about the Expo itself?

I've put together a two-part series with my general impressions and some practical informations about the Expo, its best pavilions, and even some tips about where to stay and eat in Osaka!

But Joby wasn't done yet. The company also announced plans to expand its UAE operations to include Ras Al Khaimah, the emirate about an hour's drive north of Dubai (this project is done in cooperation with Skyports, an eVTOL infrastructure company which was also featured in one episode of the podcast).

While less famous than Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah is trying to develop its tourism industry.

Spanish eVTOL maker Crisalion faces uncertainty

The reality check continues for the eVTOL industry.

On September 30, Spanish developer Crisalion reached a judicial deadline to refinance, though it remains unclear whether the company secured fresh capital in time or not and what comes next.

In the last few weeks, several media outlets reported that the company was facing a liquidity crisis and that it was falling behind in salary payments. The era of exuberance for the eVTOL industry is certainly over!

Commercial flight operations from the new airport are expected to commence in December, following the aerodrome licence granted by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30.

The project is being executed in multiple stages by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd, with the Adani Group holding a 74% stake, and the remaining 26% owned by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) of Maharashtra.

“The second airport of Maha Mumbai — Navi Mumbai International Airport — is going to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8,” said CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal, speaking to PTI after a media briefing.

Singhal added that the Prime Minister is expected to land at the new airport around 2:40 pm and spend nearly two hours at the site.

“The Prime Minister will first visit the terminal building, take a round of the premises, and then address the audience,” he said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has assigned the airport the code ‘NMI’.

Domestic airlines, including the Air India Group, IndiGo, and Akasa Air, have already announced plans to shift part of their flight operations to the new facility.

Spread over 1,160 hectares, the airport will eventually house four terminals with a total passenger capacity of 90 million per year and cargo handling capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes, positioning it among Asia’s largest aviation hubs.

“To begin with, we have completed Terminal One, with a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo capacity, and one runway,” Singhal said.

Currently, Mumbai International Airport handles around 55 million passengers annually.

Once NMIA is fully operational, the two airports together are projected to serve nearly 150 million passengers a year.

“So, once this airport is fully completed, these two airports together will cater to almost 150 million passengers per annum, making the region a major aviation hub globally,” Singhal added.

While ₹19,647 crore has been spent on the first phase, the total project cost is expected to reach ₹1 lakh crore upon completion of all four terminals.

NMIA will also be India’s first airport to be seamlessly connected by expressways, highways, metro lines, suburban rail, and water taxi services.

“This is also a green airport as it has the storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel,” Singhal noted, adding that the complex will feature an Automated Passenger People Mover system linking all four terminals internally.",https://www.indiablooms.com/storage/assets/n/2025/1759664034191686283.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 09:56:22.687605

A Lei do Combustível do Futuro, sancionada pelo governo federal em outubro do ano passado, estabelece que as companhias aéreas devem começar a operar com SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) a partir de 2027. As metas incluem uma redução gradual das emissões de gases de efeito estufa, começando com 1% até 2027 e alcançando 10% até 2037, com o objetivo principal de descarbonizar as operações.

A visão otimista foi compartilhada pelos participantes do painel “O desafio de conciliar crescimento e sustentabilidade na modernização de portos e aeroportos”, apresentado no Fórum Norte Export, em Belém (PA), no último dia 25.

“O SAF traz oportunidades muito boas para o desenvolvimento econômico do país, especialmente para as regiões que vão abrigar as plantas produtoras do combustível. Até porque não faz sentido pegar o SAF produzido em Guarulhos para colocar em caminhões e trazer até Belém. Então é mandatório você ter as contratações do SAF próximas à sua matriz de consumo”, avaliou Arthur Thiago Costa, Diretor Administrativo, Financeiro e Comercial da NOA Airports, concessionária do aeroporto de Belém.

Thairyne Oliveira, secretária-executiva adjunta do Ministério dos Portos e Aeroportos, explicou que a pasta trabalha em diversas frentes para regulamentar o SAF, entre elas, a viabilização da certificação de qualidade do produto, pesquisa e desenvolvimento e políticas de incentivo e financiamento.

Em agosto do ano passado, o governo lançou um edital para financiar investimentos em plantas de SAF. Foram disponibilizados R$ 6 bilhões em recursos do Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) e da Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (Finep), divididos em R$ 3 bi para cada. O intuito foi selecionar planos de negócios voltados à implantação de biorrefinarias no país.

“Nessa linha de crédito tem algumas contrapartidas previstas que englobam as políticas de ESG, como mais mulheres na liderança das companhias aéreas, por exemplo. É o que a gente (governo) pode fazer. É incentivar que o setor, ao pegar um recurso mais barato do que no mercado subsidiado, se comprometa também com a sociedade”, pontuou Thairyne.

Among the participating teams include the Peace Academy, CTIDO Academy, Usa Youth Academy, Black Eagle Academy, Satino and Young Boys.

However, the Black Eagle was compelled to drop out of the league midway, due to some controversies related to the ages of the participants.

The Satino Academy Coach, Abdulbast Siraji who teaches the Under-11 and Under-9 teams, said they have learned a lot during the league, especially the issue of taking seriously the ages of children who take part in the competitions.

The Young Boys Academy Coach, Jackson Tunda whose team emerged victorious stated that their mission was not just to win the trophy but to experience performance improvement among players.

“But cheating is rampant among many teams comprising young players, it therefore calls for proper awareness raising training on grassroots regarding the rules, regulations and requirements of youth leagues,” stated Tunda.

Commenting on the league, the Chairperson of the Arumeru District Football Association (ADFA), Siza Masaka who graced the final match said the youth soccer events are the current trend globally.

“But it goes further than that here in Tanzania, where we use youth soccer leagues to identify, cultivate and produce future international players,” said Masaka.

According to the ADFA chairperson, it was high time all districts, and regions started grooming young sports personalities right from the grassroots.

“Even the Tanzania Football Federation (TFF) recognizes youthful football events and we support the Young Boys Academy for the initiative of running annual leagues for the youth,” added Masaka.

Le SAF, en tant que substitut prometteur aux carburants fossiles traditionnels, pourrait bien être la clé d’une aviation plus respectueuse de notre planète.

Le SAF : un carburant révolutionnaire

Le SAF, ou carburant d’aviation durable, est un produit issu principalement de déchets organiques. Il se compose d’huiles de cuisson usagées et de graisses animales, transformées par un procédé appelé HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). À ce mélange, s’ajoute environ 10 % de kérosène aromatique synthétique provenant de sucres végétaux. Ce carburant innovant est conçu pour être compatible avec les moteurs et infrastructures existants, ce qui facilite son intégration dans l’industrie. Virgin Atlantic met en avant l’importance du SAF pour atteindre l’objectif de zéro émission nette de carbone d’ici 2050. Cette transition vers des énergies renouvelables est cruciale, et le SAF se présente comme un élément central de cette transformation.

Les traînées de condensation : un défi majeur

Le vol de Virgin Atlantic a servi aussi à explorer un autre aspect environnemental crucial : les traînées de condensation. Ces traînées, bien visibles derrière les avions, jouent un rôle important dans le réchauffement climatique. Selon certaines études, elles seraient responsables de 57 % de l'impact climatique de l'aviation entre 2000 et 2018, dépassant les émissions de CO2 des carburants. Le Rocky Mountain Institute, avec ses partenaires, travaille à réduire cet impact. Les données recueillies lors de ce vol sont partagées avec l'industrie aéronautique pour développer des stratégies et des technologies visant à atténuer les effets de ces traînées.

Despite global economic instability and intensifying competition, Tunisia’s textile and clothing industry has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, securing its place as one of the European Union’s key apparel suppliers.

The sector comprises approximately 1,880 companies, with a striking 90% dedicated exclusively to exports. Foreign investment plays a significant role in this ecosystem—45% of these firms operate as joint ventures with international partners. As a cornerstone of the Tunisian economy, the textile and clothing industry accounts for around 20% of national exports and provides employment for about 176,000 workers, representing over 30% of the country’s manufacturing labor force.

In a recent statement on Mosaïque FM, Haythem Bouajila, President of the Tunisian Federation of Textile and Clothing, revealed that the industry’s exports have surpassed six billion Tunisian dinars. This performance, he noted, remains consistent with previous years, where annual exports ranged from 9 to 9.6 billion dinars, despite adverse global conditions and the rising competitiveness of regional players like Egypt, which is investing heavily in the denim and jeans market.

Bouajila emphasized that Tunisian textile products are moving upmarket, focusing on quality and innovation. This strategic pivot towards higher-end offerings has helped domestic producers withstand price-based competition from other countries where prices are falling but margins are shrinking.

Official trade statistics underscore this progress. Between 2019 and 2023, Tunisia’s textile exports to the EU rose significantly—from €1.966 billion in 2019 to €2.280 billion in 2022, and €2.358 billion in 2023—even as the EU’s overall textile imports fell by 16.22%.

In 2023 alone:

Clothing exports grew by 6.8%, totaling TND 8.18 billion

Textile exports increased by 3.07%

The total sector exports rose by 5.61%, reaching nearly TND 9.7 billion

The sectoral trade balance improved by 12.5 percentage points

Tunisia now ranks as the 10th largest supplier of clothing to the EU, ahead of major global producers such as the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, and Egypt. This is a significant achievement, positioning the country as a key player in the European fashion and apparel supply chain.

However, the sector faces persistent structural challenges. Skilled labor shortages, logistical inefficiencies, rampant smuggling, and the expanding parallel market continue to place pressure on domestic manufacturers.

To further solidify its international competitiveness, Tunisia has launched an ambitious sustainability roadmap. By 2030, the country aims to:

Recycle 90% of wastewater used in textile production

Reduce the sector’s carbon footprint by 30%

These eco-friendly initiatives not only align with global sustainability trends but also enhance Tunisia’s appeal to environmentally conscious European partners and brands.

The new airport will serve as Mumbai’s second international gateway, easing the heavy congestion at the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), which handles over 55 million passengers annually.

PM Modi’s Visit and Agenda

According to CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal, the Prime Minister will arrive at the NMIA site around 2:40 PM and spend nearly two hours inspecting the facilities. His visit will include a walkthrough of the newly built terminal, an overview of key airport systems, and a public address highlighting India’s infrastructure growth and aviation progress.

Senior officials from the Adani Group, CIDCO, and DGCA are expected to be present during the ceremony.

India’s New Mega Aviation Hub

The Navi Mumbai International Airport has been developed by Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited (NMIAL) — a joint venture between the Adani Group (74%) and CIDCO (26%).

The first phase alone has been built at a cost of ₹19,647 crore, while the total four-phase project will reach nearly ₹1 lakh crore.

The airport received its aerodrome licence from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30, clearing it for official operations. Commercial flights are expected to begin by December 2025.

Capacity and Infrastructure Highlights

Spread over 1,160 hectares, the Navi Mumbai airport is designed to handle up to 90 million passengers per year and 3.25 million metric tonnes of cargo once fully completed.

The first phase includes Terminal 1 and a single operational runway, capable of serving 20 million passengers annually.

Once all terminals are operational, both Mumbai airports — CSMIA and NMIA — will together handle approximately 150 million passengers per year, placing Mumbai among the top 10 aviation hubs globally.

Strategic Connectivity Advantage

The airport’s location in Panvel makes it a central point connecting major industrial and logistics zones in Maharashtra. It is:

14 km from Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT)

22 km from MIDC Taloja Industrial Area

32 km from Thane

40 km from Bhiwandi

The project is also set to be India’s first airport with multimodal connectivity, featuring links to:

Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL)

Suburban railway network

Desde 2016, o Grupo Boticário adotou o polietileno verde — plástico vegetal obtido da planta da cana — em suas embalagens.
Parceira do Boticário com o EcoÁlcool, a Raízen tem investido na produção de biocombustíveis derivados da cana, como o E2G (etanol de segunda geração).
Contudo, segundo especialistas, o país tem condições de ampliar sua participação e liderar as exportações globais de biocombustíveis de baixo carbono e intermediários derivados da cana-de-açúcar.
Ou seja, a cana pode sim de alguma maneira ser considerada o novo petróleo verde"", conclui Alves.","""Hoje já produzimos etanol e, a partir do CO2 gerado na fermentação para a sua produção, podemos obter o metanol verde, que serve de matéria-prima para moléculas que dão origem a plásticos, fibras têxteis, embalagens e borrachas sintéticas, produtos que ainda dependem do petróleo"", explica Lopes.

Mas o potencial não para aí. Subprodutos da própria usina, como a vinhaça e o CO2, quando combinados a processos que geram hidrogênio e oxigênio, abrem caminho para novos combustíveis e insumos estratégicos.

O hidrogênio renovável, por exemplo, pode ser usado em células a combustível — dispositivos que geram eletricidade a partir de reações químicas, sem poluir — ou servir de base para a amônia verde, essencial na produção de fertilizantes e vista como o futuro combustível para o transporte marítimo.

""Diferentemente do petróleo, que é um recurso finito e concentrado em poucos países, a cana é renovável, distribuída e já conta com uma cadeia produtiva consolidada no Brasil"" diz Thiago Lopes. ""Por isso, com os avanços tecnológicos, a cana deixa de ser apenas fonte de etanol e açúcar, tornando-se a base de uma nova indústria química verde, capaz de sustentar em escala setores hoje totalmente dependentes do petróleo"", completa.

Empresas já apostam na cana

Algumas empresas brasileiras já têm apostado na cana-de-açúcar como uma alternativa mais sustentável de matéria-prima. Desde 2016, o Grupo Boticário adotou o polietileno verde — plástico vegetal obtido da planta da cana — em suas embalagens.

""O plástico vegetal usado nas embalagens é fabricado por empresas que produzem polietileno a partir do etanol de cana (soluções bio-based), como a Braskem"", explica Gustavo Dieamant, diretor executivo de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento do Grupo Boticário. Hoje, há mais de 2 mil produtos no portfólio da empresa que utilizam plástico verde.

O grupo passou também a aproveitar resíduos da cana (como o bagaço) como matéria-prima para o EcoÁlcool, usado na produção de perfumes. ""Somente com isso, a partir de 2021, deixamos de emitir mais de 127 mil toneladas de gases de efeito estufa. Para dimensionar o impacto, essa redução é equivalente à captura de carbono realizada por uma área de plantio de eucaliptos do tamanho de 4.700 campos de futebol"", destaca Dieamant.

Parceira do Boticário com o EcoÁlcool, a Raízen tem investido na produção de biocombustíveis derivados da cana, como o E2G (etanol de segunda geração). Diferentemente do E1G (etanol de primeira geração), que utiliza a sacarose extraída do caldo da cana, o E2G aproveita o que antes seria descartado, tornando-se uma opção mais sustentável, com menor pegada de carbono e sem a necessidade de ampliar a área de plantio.

Em 2024, a Raízen inaugurou uma nova unidade de E2G, no Parque de Bioenergia Bonfim, em Guariba (SP). Com uma pegada de carbono 80% menor que a gasolina comum brasileira e 30% menor que o E1G, o etanol de segunda geração produzido pela empresa representa uma inovação tecnológica significativa no setor de bioenergia, pois aumenta em 50% a produção sem precisar de um hectare a mais de cana.

Biocombustíveis

Entre os diversos setores que podem se beneficiar da adoção da cana-de-açúcar como matéria-prima renovável, o de transportes se destaca como um dos mais promissores.

Atualmente, além do E2G, usinas brasileiras de cana já produzem o etanol combustível (hidratado e anidro), a bioeletricidade a partir da queima de bagaço e palha e o biogás e biometano a partir de vinhaça.

Mas a versatilidade da cana vêm sendo estudada para produção de outros biocombustíveis, como o Hidrogenio verde, que pode ser empregado em ônibus, caminhões e navios; o Metanol verde, voltado para veículos pesados; e o SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), biocombustível destinado à aviação.

Brasil na frente

O Brasil é o segundo maior produtor mundial de etanol, atrás apenas dos Estados Unidos, que fabrica o combustível a partir do milho.

Contudo, segundo especialistas, o país tem condições de ampliar sua participação e liderar as exportações globais de biocombustíveis de baixo carbono e intermediários derivados da cana-de-açúcar.

A combinação entre escala agrícola, experiência industrial, certificações e baixo carbono posicional — com potencial de captura do CO2 gerado na fermentação — pode representar uma importante vantagem comparativa.

""Enquanto o milho, nos Estados Unidos, rende de 4 a 5 mil litros de etanol por hectare, a cana brasileira produz, em média, 7 mil litros por hectare, podendo ultrapassar os 10 mil litros com a integração do etanol de segunda geração"", afirma Alexandre Alves, agrônomo e chefe-geral da Embrapa Agroenergia.

Segundo ele, em termos de mitigação, entre 2003 — ano do lançamento dos carros flex — e março de 2025, o uso do etanol em substituição à gasolina evitou que mais de 730 milhões de toneladas de CO2 fossem lançadas na atmosfera. Para alcançar efeito semelhante na natureza, seria necessário cultivar cerca de 5,1 bilhões de árvores ao longo dos próximos 20 anos.

""Outro diferencial que pode colocar o Brasil na liderança da produção de biocombustíveis é o fato de que os processos de colheita e de processamento industrial da cana já estão bastante consolidados, permitindo o aproveitamento quase integral da biomassa: caldo para etanol; bagaço e palha para eletricidade e E2G; vinhaça e torta para biogás; e CO2 da fermentação para e-fuels"", aponta o chefe-geral da Embrapa Agroenergia.

Além disso, o país dispõe de uma infraestrutura consolidada — agrícola, industrial e logística — e de um sistema de governança robusto, com certificações como o RenovaBio, que mede a intensidade de carbono da produção.

O país também conta com uma vantagem territorial. ""Estudos mostram que o Brasil possui uma extensa área de pastagens degradadas que pode ser aproveitada, permitindo ampliar diversas vezes a produção de etanol, sem causar impacto ambiental significativo"", ressalta Thiago Lopes, professor da USP.

Mas é preciso investimento para acelerar o estabelecimento da cana como fonte energética.

Alexandre Alves, da Embrapa Agroenergia, defende, como próximos passos, o fortalecimento do RenovaBio, o estabelecimento de marcos regulatórios para captura, uso e armazenamento de carbono aplicados às usinas de etanol, além do incentivo à produção de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) e fomento à produção de biometano e hidrogênio a partir da biomassa e do etanol.

Também são indispensáveis investimentos em infraestrutura e logística voltados à exportação de energéticos renováveis derivados da cana. E, para consolidar o Brasil como fornecedor confiável de energia limpa, é fundamental avançar em certificações reconhecidas internacionalmente.

""O Brasil já cultiva mais de 8 milhões de hectares de cana, mas tem potencial para expandir sobre pastagens de baixa produtividade, sem pressionar os biomas sensíveis. Ou seja, a cana pode sim de alguma maneira ser considerada o novo petróleo verde"", conclui Alves.",https://conteudo.imguol.com.br/c/noticias/bb/2025/07/18/cana-de-acucar-colhida-por-usina-em-alagoas-estado-que-mais-produz-no-nordeste-1752888976662_v2_615x300.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 06:56:48.689624

Signed at the institution’s headquarters in Abidjan, the agreement provides budgetary support from the African Development Fund, the Bank Group’s concessional financing window.

It enables the Niger government to implement Phase 1 of the transformative Energy Sector Governance and Competitiveness Support Program (PAGSEC).

“It is with great pleasure that we have just formalized this agreement, which is very important for Niger,” said the Prime Minister. “The agreement is part of our strong cooperation with the African Development Bank Group.”

The support from the African Development Fund will increase national electricity access from 22.5 percent to 30 percent by 2026, while boosting the manufacturing sector’s contribution to GDP from 2.5 percent to 3.8 percent.

A key component of the project focuses on developing renewable energy capacity, with plans for 240 MW of solar power by 2030, including 50 MW by December 2026.

Prime Minister Zeine, who is also Niger’s Minister of Economy and Finance and serves as Governor of the Bank Group for his country, said the Bank’s support came at an important time, and the process has now led to the establishment of the program which aims to support the country’s economic competitiveness.

“It will also cushion Niger against multiple shocks through improved access to energy, promotion of the private sector, consolidation of the fiscal framework, and better consideration of vulnerable groups within public policies,” Premier Zaine added.

Beyond the energy sector, the program will strengthen public financial management systems while enhancing tax revenue mobilization and control systems.

It will further support the clearance of domestic arrears, enhance public-private partnerships dialogue, and promote the adoption of an industrial and trade policy to bolster Niger’s private sector.

“I can assure you that the African Development Bank Group will remain, as it has always been, a strong supporter of all our regional member states in their pursuit of harmonious development and shared prosperity,” said Dr Ould Tah.

“I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Bank’s teams for their hard work and also to thank the Board of Directors for its support for our efforts.”

Social inclusion

This high-impact program prioritizes social inclusion, and specialized support for internally displaced persons, women, and young persons.

With more than 507,000 internally displaced people due to security challenges in the Sahel region, PAGSEC has outlined a social and economic inclusion program to cushion vulnerable communities.

It will also establish high-level coordination mechanisms and update national energy policies to create a favorable environment for private-sector participation in mini-grid developments crucial for rural electrification.

With this program, Niger is set to capitalize on its vast renewable energy potential while building governance systems that support inclusive and sustainable development.

Durch die eigentümliche Form wollen die Ingenieure der Phantom 3500 ein lange bekanntes Problem der Luftfahrt gelöst haben. Laut Hersteller soll das Modell den Kerosinverbrauch um 60 Prozent reduzieren. Beim Betrieb mit Sustainable Aviation Fuel rechnet das Unternehmen mit 92 Prozent weniger CO2-Ausstoß. Dies könnte laut dem ""Wallstreet Journal"" den Privatjet-Markt revolutionieren

Günstiger als Business-Class: Flughöhe und laminare Strömung machen Privat-Jet effizient

Das Flugzeug soll mit vier Passagieren an Bord 3200 nautische Meilen zurücklegen können, das ist vergleichbar mit dem Airbus A320 und entspricht über 5900 Kilometern. Die Reiseflughöhe ist dabei deutlich größer als bei bisherigen Verkehrsflugzeugen. Die Phantom 3500 soll bis auf 51.000 Fuß oder 15,5 Kilometer steigen. Doch das eigentlich innovative an dem Konzept ist die Form des Rumpfes.

Denn um das Flugzeug herum entsteht ein Effekt, der den Luftwiderstand dramatisch reduziert: laminare Strömung. Dabei fließt die Luft in einzelnen Ebenen um den Rumpf, ohne dass sich Verwirbelungen bilden, die das Flugzeug bremsen. Dieser Effekt ist lange bekannt, doch bisher nahmen Experten an, dass eine ineffiziente und turbulente Strömung bei Flugzeugen ab bestimmten Geschwindigkeiten unvermeidbar ist – wie bei einem Wasserstrahl, der zuerst durchsichtig ist und weiß wird, sobald der Hahn voll aufgedreht ist.

Doch Otto Aerospace gibt an, dass die Phantom 3500 selbst bei 950 Kilometern pro Stunde mit laminarer Strömung fließt.

Privatjet-Riese will 300 Flugzeuge bestellen

Flexjet, einer der größten Anbieter von gemieteten Privatjets, hat sich mit dieser Großbestellung stark zum Phantom 3500 positioniert. Laut einer Pressemitteilung von Otto Aerospace zeigte sich Flexjet-CEO begeistert von dem Flugzeug und seinem modernen Ansatz. Unterstützt von einer Kapitalerhöhung in Höhe von 800 Millionen US-Dollar plant das Unternehmen, den Jet schrittweise in seine Flotte zu integrieren. Der Einsatz des Phantom 3500 könnte den Standard im privaten Flugzeugmarkt neu definieren.

Auch die fensterlose Innenkabine mit 360-Grad-Panoramabildschirmen und einer komfortablen Höhe von 195 Centimetern machten die Phantom 3500 zu einem vielversprechenden Projekt, das den gesamten Markt verändern könnte.

Phantom 3500 soll ab 2030 fliegen

Laut ""Wall Street Journal"" soll der erste Testflug des Phantom 3500 im Jahr 2027 stattfinden, mit anschließenden Auslieferungen ab 2030. Die regulatorische Zulassung sieht keine Hindernisse vor, da Fenster laut der amerikanischen Flugaufsichtsbehörde FAA für Zertifizierungen nicht verpflichtend sind. Es soll aber Fenster an Notausgängen geben. Außerdem hat das Startup mit der Celera 500L bereits ein ähnliches Design mit Propellerantrieb in die Luft gebracht.

Privatjet günstiger als Business-Class: Das gibt es bereits heute

In Deutschland gibt es bereits Anbieter, die das Fliegen mit Privatjet zu vergleichbaren Preisen anbieten wie ein Business-Class-Ticket. Wer semi-privat fliegt, kann die Annehmlichkeiten wie weniger Wartezeit und exklusiven Zugang zum Rollfeld ohne Massenabfertigung bei der Sicherheitskontrolle genießen - nimmt aber auch mehr CO₂-Emissionen in Kauf.

Indes versuchen Fluggesellschaften mit, neuen Kabinen-Designs für zahlungskräftige Kunden attraktiv zu bleiben – dies sei auch wichtig für den Klimaschutz.

More optimistic calculations estimate that total production in 2022 could reach 450 million liters. Both scenarios put the SAF industry on the brink of an exponential increase in capacity and production towards an identified tipping point of 30 billion liters by 2030, with the right supportive policies.

The airlines commit to achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and see SAF as a key contributor. Current estimates expect SAF to account for 65% of the mitigation needed for this, requiring a production capacity of 450 billion liters per year by 2050.

Having agreed a Long Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) on climate at the 41st Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in October 2022, governments now share the same goal for the decarbonisation of aviation and the interest in the success of SAF.

“There was at least triple the amount of SAF on the market in 2022 than there was in 2021. And airlines used every drop, even at very high prices! If more were available, it would have been purchased. That makes it clear that this is a supply problem and that market forces alone are insufficient to solve it. Governments, now sharing the same net-zero target for 2050, must implement comprehensive production incentives for SAF. It's what they did to successfully transition economies to renewable sources of electricity. And it is what aviation needs to decarbonise”, said Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.

To date, more than 450,000 commercial flights have been operated with SAF, and the increasing number of airlines signing purchase agreements with producers sends a clear signal to the markets that SAF is needed in greater quantities and, in the future, As of 2022, around 40 purchase agreements have been signed. been announced.

Incentive-based policies

Until we have commercialized options for alternative energy sources such as hydrogen, all SAF supply for aviation will be derived from biofuel refineries. These refineries produce renewable biodiesel and biogas, as well as SAF, and their refining capacity is expected to grow by more than 400% by 2025 compared to 2022. The challenge for aviation is to secure its supply of SAF from this capacity.

“É um orgulho ter sido o ministro que recebeu, pela primeira vez em 165 anos do Ministério da Agricultura, a presidente da Petrobras. Esse encontro aproxima de forma concreta o agro e o setor de energia. É a relevância que o agro se tornou no Brasil, como ele é estratégico. E o inverso, a gente entende o agro pode, deve e vai ser importante para a Petrobras”, destacou o ministro da Carlos Fávaro.

Na ocasião, foi apresentado que a empresa se aproxima do agronegócio em três frentes distintas: originação de matérias-primas, polos de venda e venda direta para grandes consumidores.

A presidente da Petrobras evidenciou que a estratégia da estatal para os próximos anos passa pela integração entre os principais setores da economia brasileira. “O futuro do Brasil é um futuro em que o agronegócio e o setor petrolífero caminham juntos. São dois dos principais motores da nossa economia e precisam se complementar”, afirmou Magda Chambriard.

A empresa tem buscado a ampliação no Centro Oeste e MATOPIBA, regiões que tem vocação natural para a produção agrícola com disponibilidade de terras agriculturáveis e clima favorável â produção agrícola. A demanda do agronegócio nestas regiões mais que dobrou sua demanda de diesel nos últimos anos.

Também foi ressaltado que há oportunidades para expansão do transporte dutoviário e ferroviário, além de possibilidades de escoamento de produção e incremento na produção de biocombustíveis, como etanol de milho e biodiesel.

Com iniciativas existentes em produtos renováveis como óleos vegetais, gorduras animais, a Petrobras se aproximou do agronegócio para a originação de matérias-primas para a produção de Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) que consiste em um biocombustível avançado, produzido a partir de óleos vegetais (como soja, palma) ou gorduras animais, tratados com hidrogênio e do Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) que consiste em um combustível sustentável de aviação, feito de matérias-primas renováveis como óleos vegetais, gorduras animais, resíduos agrícolas ou até lixo urbano.

O ministro Fávaro ressaltou que esta integração abrirá novas perspectivas para o Brasil. “Estamos abrindo uma série de oportunidades em um novo caminho que o mundo está trilhando: a produção de energia renovável, verde e limpa, que nasce da terra”, afirmou.

Ainda, foi exposto que existem acordos formados entre o Mapa, a Petrobras e a Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa) para parcerias com cooperativas para ofertas produtos e assistência técnica aos consumidores finais. Além disso, produzem juntamente com a Embrapa e com Centro de Pesquisas Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello (Cenpes) fertilizantes de eficiência aumentada para o uso de matérias primas alternativas.

A parceria entre o Mapa e a estatal no MATOPIBA iniciou em março deste ano, após reuniões técnicas em que foram identificadas oportunidades de atuação e ocorreu a articulação de uma operação de visita na região junto a associações e produtores rurais com o objetivo de ampliar ainda mais a atuação da Petrobras na região.

Segundo a presidente Magda Chambriard, a Petrobras reconhece a importância dessas iniciativas. “Não estamos aqui para destruir nenhuma política pública. Pelo contrário, entendemos que esses investimentos foram necessários para valorizar o que temos de melhor: o petróleo e o agro”, reforçou.

Brian Duncan, a grain and livestock farmer near Polo in Ogle County and IFB president, discussed the many issues facing agriculture during an interview at the Illinois State Fair’s Ag Day.

What are the top concerns IFB is focusing on?

Duncan: I think the thing we talk about that’s kind of overarches everything right now is farm income. We’re very concerned as we continue to read the economic reports coming out of the University of Illinois.

Every farm’s got a little bit of a different economic story but, in general, this year, last year, next year, an awful lot of our members are going to be upside down.

We know the cattle industry is on a roll, and good for them, they deserve it because they had a rough ride before this.

The hog industry, which I’m a part of, is seeing some daylight, but has a big hole to backfill, and row crops, I’m hoping we can find a bottom pretty soon. But farm income is a real concern.

We are grateful for the passage of the ag provisions, that were contained in the budget bill. Those have the potential to be beneficial. We’re grateful of the tax provisions. Those are beneficial.

Is trade an ongoing concern?

Duncan: We are hoping for some significant wins here as trade has become cloudy. Our trade relationships are cloudy. We’re seeing a lot of frameworks announced and that’s good.

That provides a discussion for further deals, but I keep looking to read specific amounts of Illinois commodities or ethanol that are going to be moving into some of these countries, and it just appears we need to get some meat on the bones on some of these deals.

I try to look at things as challenges and opportunities, and a lot of challenges you can turn into an opportunity with the right work, the right connections and the right communication, and that’s what we’re trying to do as an organization.

There are also some trade wins. I met with the Office of Public Liaison at the White House. I talked about easy wins, low-hanging fruit, such as year-round E15, whole milk back in public schools. There are things here.

The “Make America Healthy Again” report creates some interesting challenges and opportunities. Challenges to our science that we rely on, that we want to make sure we’re using sound science, but maybe opportunities for good farm-raised protein to once again be talked about in a positive light.

Our pork or beef, our poultry products, our dairy products, planning their place in schools and in people’s diets. So, again, rising up and meeting the significant needs of farm income.

On the state level, we’re still working hard with stakeholders on getting estate tax relief. That is a battle we are not going to give up on.

We know property taxes have become an increasing concern for our members, and we are not taking that issue lightly either.

Then it’s always watching on both the state and the federal side burdensome regulations that directly impact farm income. It is a full plate.

Fortunately we’ve got a great team at Illinois Farm Bureau, and fortunately we’ve got great members that we rely on to help carry the message to the representatives, to their congressmen.

What are some of the things you’d like to see in the mini farm bill?

Duncan: Security for an interstate commerce. It goes beyond Proposition 12. If that is a not fixed it is a precedent that is dangerous for all of agriculture to allow one state to regulate how Illinois farmers grow their products. It’s a bad precedent.

I hope there’s an opportunity to perhaps discuss some of the Environmental Quality Incentives Program dollars. Some of that funding that was maybe not appropriated that we had farmers counting on.

Again, anything that we can do to talk about incentivizing biofuels, the trade title, there’s a ton yet to discuss. Those are a few of the biggies.

Year after year, there’s talk on Capitol Hill about year-round E15, sustainable aviation fuel and other renewable fuel issues, but no concrete action is taken by Congress. So, what can be done?

Duncan: We went the tax credits to be right, and we think the extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is a good step.

And the next-generation biofuels, I think, has a positive story to tell. It takes time to build out infrastructure and we want to make sure the demand is there.

I had U.K. Consul General Richard Hyde at my farm and asked him about the opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel for planes coming from Europe and from the U.K. He says, “We’re all in.”

So, they have to refuel somewhere, right? And we know there’s biofuel producers in this state that are making commitments to produce both renewable fuels from both corn and soybeans and that’s a positive.

We want to make sure that the tax credits and the infrastructure remains something that we can rely on, because something that’s here today and gone tomorrow makes people very hesitant to invest the kind of dollars that are needed.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/fhRE4GFPEm1RxzUKPfgigL02MYo=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/VNOHSJYTYFHZJB3PVTXVWRBDCQ.JPG,N,,2025-10-04 20:56:09.260469

To be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8, NMIA spans 1,160 hectares and will feature four terminals—one of which is complete and scheduled to begin operations in December.

“NMIA can be compared with Heathrow Airport in London, which covers 1,227 hectares and has five terminals. Once fully operational, NMIA will handle 90 million passengers annually, transforming Mahamumbai into a major aviation hub,” said Vijay Singhal, Vice Chairman and Managing Director (VC & MD) of CIDCO.

PM Modi is expected to arrive at NMIA at 2:40 p.m., inspect the terminal building, and address a public gathering. After the inauguration, the airport will be handed over to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) for 45 days of security checks. Subsequently, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) will conduct detailed inspections to ensure compliance with national aviation safety standards. Following these procedures, both domestic and international flight operations will commence by December.

“This airport’s commissioning involves extensive security and regulatory checks. The October 8 ceremony marks the formal inauguration, but flight operations—domestic and international—will start by December,” explained Singhal.

Highlighting NMIA’s superior accessibility, Singhal added, “This is the country’s first international airport offering multi-modal connectivity—with road access from both eastern and western sides, a proposed metro corridor, and an upcoming water taxi service.”

Strategically located, NMIA will also strengthen connectivity to Pune, Nashik, and the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). “Being centrally positioned, the airport will provide international connectivity to Pune, PMR, Nashik, and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). It is not just an airport but a transformative infrastructure project that will accelerate regional growth,” he emphasized.

The new-age Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), once fully completed, will feature an underground Automated People Mover (APM) — a mini underground train system designed to transport passengers seamlessly between Terminals 1 and 4, regardless of their check-in terminal. The airport will also include dedicated facilities for storing sustainable aviation fuel, making it both environmentally friendly and a model of sustainable airport infrastructure.

A presidente Magda Chambriard reforçou a visão estratégica da Petrobras, afirmando que “o futuro do Brasil é um futuro em que o agronegócio e o setor petrolífero caminham juntos”, enfatizando que ambos são pilares da economia brasileira.

Expansão e energias renováveis

A Petrobras tem buscado ampliar sua presença nas regiões do Centro-Oeste e MATOPIBA (Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí e Bahia), reconhecidas pela forte vocação agrícola. De acordo com o Mapa, a demanda por diesel nessas áreas mais que dobrou nos últimos anos devido ao crescimento do agronegócio. Durante o encontro, a estatal também destacou o potencial de expansão da infraestrutura logística, com foco no transporte dutoviário e ferroviário, além de alternativas para o escoamento da produção e o aumento da oferta de biocombustíveis como etanol de milho e biodiesel.

Em uma linha similar, Chambriard e Fávaro discutiram o aumento da produção desses combustíveis e o desenvolvimento de alternativas avançadas, como o Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) e o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Esses biocombustíveis utilizam matérias-primas renováveis, incluindo óleos vegetais, gorduras animais e resíduos agrícolas, alinhando-se com a tendência mundial de energias limpas e renováveis.

Parcerias e colaborações estratégicas

Além da integração de energia renovável, o encontro também abordou as parcerias estabelecidas entre o Mapa, a Petrobras e a Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa). Essas parcerias têm como objetivo ampliar a oferta de produtos e fornecer assistência técnica aos consumidores finais, por meio de cooperativas. Em colaboração com o Centro de Pesquisas Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello (Cenpes), as instituições estão desenvolvendo fertilizantes de alta eficiência, utilizando matérias-primas alternativas.

Magda Chambriard destacou o compromisso da Petrobras com essas iniciativas, afirmando: “Não estamos aqui para destruir nenhuma política pública. Pelo contrário, entendemos que esses investimentos foram necessários para valorizar o que temos de melhor: o petróleo e o agro”. A parceria entre o Mapa e a Petrobras no MATOPIBA teve início em março, após reuniões técnicas e visitas à região para fortalecer a presença da estatal no território e estabelecer articulações com associações e produtores rurais.

Industry leaders have just revealed during the Africa Energy Week (AEW) event in Cape Town, South Africa, running under the theme of ‘Invest in African Energies 2025.’

Emmanuelle Garinet, is the Vice President of Exploration Africa at TotalEnergies, who points out that Africa’s frontier basins hold significant volumes.

Garinet reveals that Namibia is an example of how seismic and subsurface data can de-risk projects.

“When we decided to drill the Venus well, it was frontier, but we had a probability of success of more than 50 percent because of the seismic data and direct hydrocarbon indicators,” says Garinet.

In the Republic of Congo, TotalEnergies’ exploration permitting process is moving at a markedly faster pace.

“We got our permit in less than six months and are preparing for drilling by the end of the year,” She said.

By contrast, South Africa’s permitting system has faced delays due to legal challenges, a problem she described as “unacceptable” given limited budgets for global exploration.

The Chief Executive at Chevron, Gavin Lewis, emphasized the critical role of comprehensive subsurface datasets in Africa.

“Before you can do any AI-driven workflows, you need a dataset that illuminates what the subsurface looks like,” he said.

“What Africa has lost is the ability to sponsor multi-client subsurface datasets. The only basin that allows for large, regional high-quality datasets is the Gulf of America, which has allowed that basin to reinvent itself multiple times.”

The Vice President of Exploration for BP, Bryan Ritchie, highlighted survey work in Egypt’s Nile Delta, where the company completed the first deepwater ocean-bottom node seismic survey over the Atoll field and noted that the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company plans to expand multi-client data coverage across a larger area of the delta.

‘We’re seeing new opportunities for these images,” he said.

Beyond exploration, Woodside Energy’s Vice President of Exploration, Terry Gebhardt, said geoscience and subsurface data are also key to carbon capture and storage projects, as well as “maximizing efficacy and recovery” in existing fields.

The panel discussion, sponsored by EnerGeo Alliance, also underlined the broader scale of investment in Africa’s oil and gas sector.

Nikki Martin, the Chief Executive Officer of EnerGeo Alliance, said African oil and gas capital expenditure is expected to rise to USD 54 billion by 2030, following a USD 6 billion surge in exploration spending in 2024.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/total-energy-chevron-in-africa-oil-exploration.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 13:56:49.855542

A bill currently going through parliament will ensure a fixed price for sustainable aviation fuel, to encourage investment in production.","One century ago, Italian aviator Francesco de Pinedo was attempting the unprecedented feat of traversing the Indian landmass in a flying boat. He later splashed down on the Tiber in Rome to national acclaim, having flown via Asia to Australia and returned after a seven-month period, taking off and landing in water 80 times.

The aviation sector has been characterized by stop-start journeys on previously unexplored routes to ambitious, if not unattainable, goals. The current shared belief – amid widespread doubt – is in pursuing a vague route toward eco-friendliness, via environmentally friendly fuels that are yet to be widely produced.

Industry Commitment and Challenges

Most in the aviation industry, if only for their own benefit, are on board with the theory. Of the identified emissions cuts needed for carbon neutrality, seven out of ten depend on sustainable aviation fuels, commonly known as SAF. “Lacking this,” notes Tim Alderslade from Airlines UK, “we cannot get anywhere near net zero by 2050.”

In the current year, initial measures were mandated in the EU and the UK, demanding that 2% of aircraft fuel be eco-friendly – by the year 2030, this rises to 6% in the EU and 10% in the UK.

Diverging Opinions Among Airlines

However, airlines have questioned whether supplies will be available and at what price. A fissure is developing between those that have secured sources of SAF and funded technological advancements, and those intensely focused on financial performance.

Ryanair’s CEO Michael O’Leary rejects SAF as impractical. He says: “It is all gradually dying a death, as it rightly should. We have just about met our 2% mandate. Reaching 6% by 2030 is unfeasible; attaining 10% is utterly hopeless. Net zero by 2050 is beyond our reach.”

More measured voices among SAF’s champions also have concerns. Willie Walsh, director general of the worldwide airline trade body Iata, had advocated for a 5% SAF blend in fuel by 2030. He admitted last week to disappointment in progress, noting he doubts the goal is attainable considering current SAF production levels”.

Government Initiatives and Production Hurdles

Britain is attempting to establish the structure with a guaranteed income system. A bill currently going through parliament will ensure a fixed price for sustainable aviation fuel, to encourage investment in production. The Department for Transport in July allocated £63m to seventeen firms aiming to produce SAF domestically. An official mentioned “promising initial indicators towards meeting the mandate” But only Phillips 66 in Humberside is making SAF at scale, while the five facilities pledged under the “jet zero” plan remain unrealized.

Incentives and penalties are essential, as major oil firms face diminishing reasons to adopt eco-friendly practices when invited to drill for easy profit. Shell’s decision to stop construction of a Rotterdam biofuel plant, anticipated as a major European waste-to-jet-fuel converter, will reduce SAF availability and increase costs. Concurrently, Donald Trump’s legislation cuts American subsidies for SAF manufacturing established under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – though, as a compromise to US agricultural producers, some subsidies on homegrown SAF feedstocks will continue for two more years.

International Views and Forward Projections

Philip New, a former BP alternative energy executive and government adviser on SAF, states: “I hold a bleak outlook for SAF in the United States. There’s no mandate or regulations or reason to use it.”

Beyond the US, geopolitics could weigh on supplies in various ways, he notes. Trade levies might redirect additional Chinese cooking oil to European SAF; simultaneously, Asian nations enacting their own requirements and limits could restrict exports.

New maintains that SAF will eventually materialize but warns: “It is going to be a lumpy transition.”

Technological Advances and Environmental Considerations

Current UK and EU mandates can be met entirely with HEFA-based SAF, made from sources such as recycled cooking oil – despite concerns about its origins. Greater challenges arise with governmental calls for second-generation SAF, made of feedstocks such as household rubbish.

Alderslade describes 2G output as “highly uncertain”. Failing to meet requirements, he states, will result in fines “which inevitably will be passed through to passengers”.

New remarks: “Theoretically, this offers an excellent waste disposal solution.” The challenge is getting the right level of support to back up the very high-risk first generations of these technologies.” Despite public support, 2030 goals for 2G are probably unattainable, he adds.

Investment and Long-Term Viability

Despite the risks, investors see the long-term value. An anonymous international investment manager said the US was an outlier in abandoning net zero, with mandates coming to Asia as well as Europe. “For oil majors, SAF is lower priority, it’s challenging – certain parties are withdrawing. However, carriers cannot forsake it. It’s going to be bumpy – but is it all coming down? No.”

Differing views among airlines, he suggests, may reflect the ease of access and price paid for SAF in their operational hubs: “There’s no shortage in the hubs.”

Business Approaches and Local Initiatives

The British Airways owner, IAG, says it has a “long-term commitment”, with some justification – it announced plans in 2011 for a pioneering waste-to-fuel plant in Essex, although it admitted defeat by 2017. IAG says there will be enough SAF to meet EU and UK mandates until 2030. But a spokesperson added: “Second and third generation SAFs do require more investment and development [and] support … Mandates are one lever to stimulate demand but investment in production is key.”

Positive developments continue to emerge: a Belfast company, Catagen, recently introduced proprietary modular systems capable of generating required SAF volumes in the vicinity of smaller airports, an innovation supported by Ryanair.

Airport-Specific Implications and Environmental Debates

For BA’s home airport, the debate has particular urgency: should the eco-aviation plan falter, Heathrow’s third runway becomes ever more politically difficult.

Heathrow’s carbon strategy director Matt Gorman insists: “SAF is not hypothetical. Heathrow is already leading globally in SAF use, 17% of global SAF in 2024 was consumed here. This is real progress, not a future promise.”

Some environmental campaigners, while remaining firmly against Heathrow expansion, have modified their stance on SAF, accepting it as a potential route to future decarbonisation – even if many fear it acts as a fig leaf to deflect environmental concerns today. Yet numerous advocates and researchers doubt the fundamental premise of SAF and its calculations of carbon reductions.

Aircraft will still release CO2 from engines – and in the broader context, will still be depleting resources. Matt Finch, in a report for the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “The blunt truth is that there is not a single SAF feedstock that can’t be used in another sector where it would bring a desirable environmental outcome. And in some cases, that outcome is already what a large proportion of the waste is used for.”

Sophisticated Fuel Varieties and Financial Constraints

That caveat applies even for the gold standard fuel, known as third-generation or e-SAF, produced through carbon capture and green power. It has been manufactured in limited amounts, and tested in a Swiss “solar fuel” flight this July. However, e-SAF needs eco-friendly hydrogen, resources that, Walsh notes, are “scarce and costly”. Current e-SAF backers, per a financial expert, “are likely to face losses”.

Past Precedents and Coming Forecasts

Historical patterns indicate uncertain technological trajectories. De Pinedo perished eight years post his seaplane accomplishments, in a conventional plane taking off from a runway in New York in 1933. Seaplanes were replaced by jet planes introduced during WWII.

“Forecasting will always entail some doubt,” Gorman remarks. “But what we’re doing is not guesswork. It’s based on evidence, expert consensus, and a clear roadmap.”",,N,,2025-10-04 22:56:49.400054

The production and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Africa is consistent with the African Development Bank’s viable transport and mobility and energy transition strategy.

On the other hand, the cooperation with JGC Corporation of Japan will include undertaking of demand and feasibility studies for production and adoption of Japanese technology to Africa in this regard.

Under the agreement, the African Development Bank will facilitate coordination and dialogue with public sector aviation stakeholders, identify potential project pipelines, and explore possible financing options, including feasibility study support and promoting global partnership around the concept in Africa, as well as debt/equity financing.

JGC Corporation will conduct demand studies for SAF in African markets, perform technical feasibility assessments, evaluate deployment opportunities tailored to local resources and infrastructure, and harness and facilitate Japanese technology adoption to Africa in this regard.

Previously, the two parties had signed a Letter of Intent to this effect in Yokohama, Japan, on the sidelines of the Ninth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD9) which concluded last month.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a term for any jet fuel made from renewable sources – like plant oils, waste materials, and even captured carbon – which are designed to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

African Development Bank Vice President for Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialization, Solomon Quaynor, and Mr. Shoji Yamada, Representative Director and President, JGC Corporation signed the agreement in Yokohama on 21 August.

The Letter of Intent establishes a framework for cooperation between the two institutions to jointly promote development, information and knowledge sharing, and to explore co-financing opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel and other green aviation solutions in Africa.

“Adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa is a crucial component of the journey to cutting the continent’s carbon dioxide emissions,” said Solomon Quaynor.

“Moreover, it should boost the competitiveness of the sector over time. This partnership with JGC will help unlock new opportunities for green aviation and position Africa as a pacesetter in the sector,” Quaynor maintained.

An estimated $100 billion in annual economic product and one million American employees are supported by regional aviation, making it a significant economic driver.
For people living in smaller towns, regional air travel provides quick access to urban amenities such as advanced healthcare and disaster relief.
A number of carriers have large fleets of turboprop aircraft.
Deutsche Aircraft D328eco The D328 combines solid speed with turboprop efficiency, making it ideal for rugged regional routes.","In the United States, the most common way that small airports stay connected with major hubs is through service with light jets. Many of those regional jets are made by Bombardier, Mitsubishi or, Embraer. Turboprop aircraft have not been the platform of choice for decades in the US, Europe, or Asia. Recently, that trend has shown signs of a shift as the rising need for environmentally sustainable and lower-cost aircraft may make turboprops the best choice in the coming years.

The DeHavilland Dash 8, ATR 42,, and the Deutsche Aircraft D328 are among the best examples of the resurging appeal that turboprop passenger haulers are seeing in the regional aviation market. The Bombardier Dash 8-400 is on the larger end, seating 80-90, and over a thousand examples have been produced for operators all over the world. Building on the legacy of the Dornier 328, the brand new D328eco seats a modest 40, but it has already proven its capability with the US Air Force, and the commercial production line is ramping up.

The likes of Embraer’s E-Jets and the Bombardier/Mitsubishi CRJ jet series may hold the dominant market share today, but as the oldest airframes begin to retire and the economics of jet operations get more difficult, an opening arises. Now we will dive into the key factors behind the new wave of turboprop hype that is driving demand for state-of-the-art models like the Dash 8 and D328.

The Prop Case

An airplane may be moved quite effectively with a propeller at the moderate speeds used for short regional flights (200 to 300 miles). It enables the engines to use a notably lower amount of fuel than the tiny jet engines seen on an Embraer 175 or CRJ-900. Since fuel is an airline's largest single-trip expense, the difference is key on the balance sheet.

Most of a regional flight is spent taxiing, climbing, and descending; the cruise portion, where the jet can stretch its legs, may last only fifteen minutes. A jet is likely to be only five or ten minutes ahead of propeller aircraft when they both arrive at the gate, which is negligible to offset the increased fuel consumption and ownership expenses.

Turboprops are also lighter and can operate from shorter runways. That gives airlines access to smaller airports with lower landing fees and lets them open routes that jets can’t serve economically. The initial cost of purchasing or renting a turboprop is also lower. Long-term maintenance costs can also be mitigated thanks to the ease and affordability of maintaining their engines and airframes. In a business notorious for razor-thin profit margins that can sink an airline, those numbers all add up to keep the bottom line in the black.

Keeping America Flying

In the US, regional flights are essential for linking rural and isolated communities to large cities and the national aviation network. Hundreds of small community airports depend on regional service. With smaller, more suitable aircraft, those carriers are essential in controlling traffic at large hubs, which reduces congestion. By expanding the reach of the national transportation system, these carriers provide accessibility for more localities. In addition to bridging remote regions, regional aviation enhances the nation's overall aviation infrastructure.

Larger airlines can expand their networks while keeping connections to low-traffic routes thanks to programs like American Eagle, Delta Connect, and United Express. An estimated $100 billion in annual economic product and one million American employees are supported by regional aviation, making it a significant economic driver. Regional aviation connects passengers to important hubs, promoting local travel, business, and tourism.

For people living in smaller towns, regional air travel provides quick access to urban amenities such as advanced healthcare and disaster relief. Regardless of the reason, regional flights drastically cut down on travel time and are often quicker and more practical than driving for short- to medium-distance travel.

Turboprops Around The World

Canada is characterized by large, sparsely inhabited regions with many isolated settlements that rely on air transportation. The Dash 8-400 is especially well-suited for connecting these smaller hubs to larger ones. For their regional networks, airlines like Porter Airlines and WestJet Encore make extensive use of the Dash 8-400. Canada is home to some of the world's busiest turboprop airports.

Turboprops are essential for improving connectivity in Southeast Asia and Oceania, regions with a large number of islands and frequently inadequate infrastructure. Indonesia, which has more than 17,000 islands, relies on turboprops extensively for flights between its islands, while the Philippines has a similar infrastructure.

The wide and varied topography of Africa, which includes several ""hot and high"" airports that favor turboprops, further highlights the usefulness of turboprops. A number of carriers have large fleets of turboprop aircraft. Ethiopian Airlines is one of the major operators of the Dash 8 in its domestic network, for example. Meanwhile, Brazil's extensive land territory and mature aviation network make turboprops an ideal choice for domestic flights, especially on shorter routes under 1,000 kilometers.

Australia and New Zealand use turboprops, much like in Canada or the US, to connect smaller fields with major hubs. The terrain of the two nations varies widely depending on the destination, which makes high reliability and performance under harsh conditions important. It can be tropical, “hot and high” or Alpine, depending on the itinerary.

In Europe, Norwegian Airlines uses a fleet of turboprops to navigate the difficult terrain of Norway, and Olympic Air uses turboprops for island-hopping flights in Greece. In the British Isles, turboprops are also used by airlines such as Aurigny in the Channel Islands and Loganair in Scotland. Operators in Malta and Spain's Canary Islands provide more evidence of the aircraft's applicability for short-distance flights across Europe.

Deutsche Aircraft D328eco

The D328 combines solid speed with turboprop efficiency, making it ideal for rugged regional routes. Airlines are able to serve airports in remote cities, mountains, and islands that are inaccessible to larger jets thanks to its innovative design. It has the quietest cabin in its class with pressurization and enlarged overhead bins. While fuel consumption and maintenance expenses remain modest, cruise speeds of about 300 miles per hour make it the fastest turboprop on the market.

It is powered by the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127XT engine and features the latest Garmin G5000 avionics in the cockpit. High reliability and low-maintenance cycles, with reduced costs per cycle, mean the plane has the lowest trip cost to operate in its class. Thomas Ahn, Chief Engineer of the D328eco at Deutsche Aircraft, remarked in a company statement earlier this May, saying:

“This is our moment to re-establish ourselves as a modern aircraft manufacturer with full system integration capabilities right here in Germany. We use advanced 3D modelling, seamless data sharing with suppliers, and state-of-the-art communication tools to enhance our development efficiency.”

The D328 is not only poised to be one of the most environmentally sustainable and affordable aircraft to fly, but its features and construction quality make it a “jack of all trades” that can support virtually any mission in the commercial, cargo, or specialized aviation markets. The plane will be competing to replace outgoing legacy models like the ATR 42 and Saab 340, matching the efficiency, capacity, and ruggedness of both in one package.

Deutsche Aircraft established its plant just outside Munich, in the historic home of Dornier, Oberpfaffenhofen. The first test aircraft is being assembled by a team of 550 staff with backgrounds from 40 different nations to create a plane that can fly on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF-PtL). The 20-seat configuration is expected to have an impressive range of 1,772 nautical miles while the 40-seater will have a solid 621 nautical miles.

The Air Force’s Wolfhound

The main role of the C-146A Wolfhound is to support Theater Special Operations Commands by offering the US Special Operations Command the ability to deploy small teams and cargo in a flexible and rapid manner. Air Force Special Operations Command aircrews carry out airlift missions to semi-prepared airfields worldwide, which demands a rugged and reliable aircraft.

The C-146 has served in combatant commands on four continents, delivering troops and cargo on long-term deployments supporting continuous operations overseas. The aircraft has also been tailored to support medevac missions with defibrillators, cardiac monitoring equipment as well as hot and cold galley equipment. It is the first air ambulance aircraft with the capability to support Casevac and Medevac missions.

The D328 has succeeded in fulfilling the Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) expectations since it entered service in 2011 as the Wolfhound. The airplane was even made to support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and features an inflight operable door (IFOD) for free-fall parachute jumps. Deutsche Aircraft wants to transform that military track record into a launching pad for its commercial airframe to serve small communities all over the world just as well as it served the special forces.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/how-regional-turboprop-aircraft-are-making-a-comeback.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-04 12:56:21.370640

The state-of-the-art greenfield airport has been built at a cost of Rs 19,647 crore and will mark the second major airport in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region after the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.
The commercial flight operations from Navi Mumbai Airport are expected to begin in December.

The state-of-the-art greenfield airport has been built at a cost of Rs 19,647 crore and will mark the second major airport in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region after the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

The commercial flight operations from Navi Mumbai Airport are expected to begin in December. The airport received its aerodrome licence from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30.

The project is being developed in multiple phases by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd, with the Adani Group holding a 74 percent stake and the remaining 26 percent owned by the Maharashtra government’s City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO).

“The second airport of Maha Mumbai — Navi Mumbai International Airport — is going to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8,” CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal told PTI after a media briefing.

According to Singhal, the Prime Minister will land at the new airport at around 2:40 pm and will spend nearly two hours at the facility. “The Prime Minister will first visit the terminal building, and then take a round of the terminal building, and then he will be addressing the audience,” he said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has assigned the code ‘NMI’ to Navi Mumbai International Airport. Domestic carriers, including Air India Group, IndiGo, and Akasa Air have already announced plans to shift part of their flight operations to the new facility.

Spread across 1,160 hectares, the airport will have four terminals with a total passenger capacity of 90 million per annum and a cargo capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes once fully completed, making it one of Asia’s largest aviation hubs.

“To begin with, we have completed terminal one, with a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo capacity and one runway,” Singhal said.

Currently, Mumbai International Airport handles around 55 million passengers annually. Once NMIA becomes fully operational, both airports together will manage nearly 150 million passengers per year.

“So, once this airport is fully completed, then these two airports together will cater to the almost 150 million passengers per annum, making the two airports a big aviation hub globally,” Singhal said.

He added that while Rs 19,647 crore has been spent on Phase 1, the total cost of completing all four terminals is expected to reach Rs 1 lakh crore.

Navi Mumbai International Airport will also be the first aerodrome in India to be connected by expressways, highways, metro lines, suburban rail, and even water taxi services.

“This is also a green airport as it has the storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel,” Singhal noted. He added that the facility will feature an Automated Passenger People’s Mover system to internally connect all four terminals.

According to recent updates from Hessenschau, ongoing weather disturbances, traffic congestion, and regional infrastructure works have collectively disrupted air travel, particularly affecting Lufthansa’s primary hub at Frankfurt Airport.

Lufthansa Battles Delays Amid Weather and Infrastructure Strain

Lufthansa flights experienced multiple delays over the past few days due to dense fog, technical maintenance on Frankfurt’s runways, and heavy passenger congestion. Frankfurt Airport, one of Europe’s busiest aviation hubs, continues to face operational strain as Lufthansa navigates increased travel demand following a record-breaking summer season.

Passengers reported waiting for hours for both departures and arrivals, with some domestic and short-haul European flights rescheduled to later slots. Lufthansa confirmed that it is “working closely with airport authorities to ensure smoother operations and minimize passenger inconvenience.”

While these temporary disruptions are not uncommon during seasonal transitions, Lufthansa’s operations have been particularly stretched by a surge in travel volume and parallel infrastructure issues on the ground, such as partial U-Bahn closures in Frankfurt and a recent A66 highway accident near Wiesbaden that delayed passengers en route to the airport.

Lufthansa Maintains Strong Recovery Post-Pandemic

Despite the turbulence, Lufthansa’s broader recovery story remains strong. The airline’s financial performance in the last quarter of 2025 showed a marked improvement, with revenues exceeding expectations thanks to higher premium cabin occupancy and growing corporate travel demand.

Industry analysts note that Lufthansa’s profitability in 2025 signals a solid rebound from the post-pandemic slump. However, operational reliability remains an ongoing challenge as the airline strives to balance expansion and service consistency.

CEO Carsten Spohr has emphasized Lufthansa’s continued commitment to innovation, sustainability, and digital transformation. The airline’s focus on modernizing its fleet and investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demonstrates its long-term vision for responsible growth. “Our mission is to lead Europe in sustainable aviation while ensuring passengers experience world-class reliability,” Spohr said during a recent industry briefing.

Lufthansa Expands Long-Haul Network and Green Initiatives

Lufthansa’s strategic roadmap includes expanding its long-haul network to major business destinations in North America and Asia. The airline has also introduced next-generation aircraft designed to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency.

In alignment with its sustainability goals, Lufthansa aims to cut its net carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030. The company is investing in partnerships for sustainable aviation fuel production and exploring innovative carbon offset programs to reduce environmental impact.

Moreover, Lufthansa continues to enhance customer experience through digital check-in systems, improved in-flight connectivity, and revamped lounges across major airports. These advancements are intended to reinforce Lufthansa’s position as a premium global carrier and restore customer confidence amid recent delays.

Local Disruptions Add to Lufthansa’s Hurdles

Regional transport challenges in Hesse have compounded Lufthansa’s operational load. With partial suspension of U-Bahn lines U6 and U7 in Frankfurt for track maintenance, and ongoing road repairs on major routes leading to Frankfurt Airport, many passengers have struggled to reach terminals on time.

The A66 highway closure near Wiesbaden, following a multi-vehicle accident earlier this week, resulted in widespread traffic jams that caused dozens of travelers to miss their Lufthansa flights. The airline responded by accommodating affected passengers on later flights and offering flexible rebooking options.

Lufthansa’s Resilience Reflects Broader Aviation Recovery

Lufthansa’s continued growth amidst such logistical hurdles reflects the resilience of Europe’s aviation industry. The airline’s ability to maintain high load factors despite sporadic disruptions underscores the enduring demand for air travel in both leisure and business segments.

Experts predict that Lufthansa will continue to expand its fleet and route network throughout 2026, supported by growing international partnerships and a focus on operational efficiency. However, analysts caution that frequent disruptions—whether due to weather, maintenance, or infrastructure—could test passenger patience and brand loyalty.

Aviation analyst Markus Neumann commented, “Lufthansa’s recovery trajectory is impressive, but operational consistency must now be its top priority. Travelers are more discerning than ever, and reliability will define success in 2026.”

The Road Ahead for Lufthansa

Looking forward, Lufthansa’s management remains optimistic about achieving sustainable growth. The airline plans to invest in digital operations and AI-driven flight scheduling to mitigate delays and enhance passenger experience. Additionally, Lufthansa is strengthening its training programs for ground and air staff to ensure service excellence.

Despite temporary turbulence in operations, Lufthansa’s core fundamentals remain robust. With an expanding network, a strong sustainability agenda, and renewed passenger confidence, the airline is well-positioned to navigate current challenges and maintain its leadership in global aviation.

SAF is central to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global effort to reduce aviation emissions.
To meet these future obligations, the Indian government plans to introduce SAF blending targets in aviation fuel.
India is also working on a comprehensive policy to support both the production and use of SAF.","India is preparing to launch a pilot project to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, marking a step toward greener aviation, reported The Hindu BusinessLine.

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) recently received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery, paving the way for domestic production.

The SAF blend will be developed using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) method, relying on feedstock such as used cooking oil and agricultural residue like rice straw (parali).

Delhi was selected for the pilot as IOC’s Panipat refinery already supplies aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to the airport via a dedicated pipeline.

“That is the beauty of SAF. You don’t have to change the infrastructure to implement it. It’s like fossil fuel,” said the Deputy Director of the Environment Branch, Air Transport Bureau, at the UN body International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as quoted by The Hindu BusinessLine.

Hupe noted that India’s existing fuel distribution pipeline is a major asset, reducing the need for costly new infrastructure.

“The infrastructure they already have to produce and distribute fuel to the airport can also be used for SAF, and that’s a big plus for this technology,” she told businessline.

SAF is central to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global effort to reduce aviation emissions. The scheme is being implemented in three phases, with voluntary participation from 2021 to 2026.

India has opted out of the voluntary phase but will begin offsetting obligations for international carriers under CORSIA from 2027. The scheme applies to international flights between two countries.

To meet these future obligations, the Indian government plans to introduce SAF blending targets in aviation fuel. These start with a 1% SAF blend in ATF in 2027, rising to 2% in 2028, and 5% by 2030.

The Gazette asked all candidates: What strategies would you pursue to strengthen collaboration with neighbouring municipalities and regional partners, and how would these efforts improve services or economic development in Sturgeon County?

Each mayoral candidate in Sturgeon County had 350 words to answer the question.

Patrick Tighe: I believe we have services within the county area that could become regional with minimal changes in service to the residents, but provide better value.

For example, the Roseridge Landfill Site for solid household waste (garbage) provides this service for the entire county region, as well as other areas.

Fire and Protective Services is another area that could be regionalized with little service disruption. By reducing existing boundaries and establishing a connected community fire response instead of isolated fire stations, we would have improved services and potentially lowered insurance premiums. Strategic locations for equipment and trained personnel would provide a much-improved collaborative approach to emergencies that would benefit residents both in response time as well as cost effectiveness.

Utilities is another area that could be regionalized for improved services. Again, reducing standalone services and establishing a regional approach would provide better equipment, tools and skill levels that would bring efficiencies and cost effectiveness to all residents in time of need.

Economic development using models like Strathcona, Lac La Biche, and West Hants’ Regional Municipality, N.S., would improve Sturgeon County. Having the right location for the right developments, providing a streamlined and welcoming approach for new and existing businesses in Sturgeon County would benefit all and bring prosperity for the future.

Alanna Hnatiw: I will continue the successful strategies developed over the past eight years. We have increased awareness and momentum around the Villeneuve Airport Area. Much of this can be attributed to the relationships developed with neighbouring stakeholders through the creation of the Villeneuve Landing Network. We have partnered with towns and cities, post-secondary and academic institutions, First Nations, Métis nations, business associations and the provincial government to assess the economic development opportunities and inform the Area Structure Plan that was approved in 2024. This initiative has increased investment interest and supported the Sturgeon Public School Division’s successful application for an Aviation Collegiate at the Villeneuve Airport. This partnership between the school and the Edmonton Airport Authority was a direct result of our successful strategy of advocacy and relationship building. There are immense opportunities at the Villeneuve Airport for pilot training, aviation mechanics, machine repair and overhaul, autonomous aircraft development, sustainable aviation fuel, aerospace defence and advanced materials manufacturing.

I initiated the update of the Sturgeon Regional Partnership where Sturgeon county and the mayors of the five towns within our borders meet regularly and have our administrations foster organizational efficiency and effectiveness without the creation of unnecessary bureaucracy. The guiding principles of our partnership is to support local autonomy while emphasizing that local goals can often best be achieved through regional cooperation and partnerships. We commit to explore opportunities to improve the delivery of service through cooperative efforts and promote regional prosperity and economic development through partnerships and collaboration.

Sturgeon County has worked collaboratively with the Alberta Industrial Heartland Association and the provincial government on the creation of the first Designated Industrial Zone in Alberta. Through this designation and collaboration, we have received grant dollars towards Phase One of the Industrial Heartland Process Water Initiative. I will continue to support the DIZ development water intake and the responsible use of this resource to improve our economic development opportunities with infrastructure necessary for development and growth in Sturgeons heartland.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/stalberttoday/alanna-hnaitw.jpg;w=690;h=948;mode=crop,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:22.052985

The project is being developed in multiple phases by Navi Mumbai International Airport, in which Adani Group has a 74 per cent stake, and the remaining 26 per cent with the Maharashtra government's land development authority CIDCO.

""Second airport of Maha Mumbai -- Navi Mumbai International Airport -- is going to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8,"" CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal told PTI after a media briefing.

Singhal said the Prime Minister will land at the Navi Mumbai International Airport at around 2.40 pm and will remain at the facility for almost two hours.

""The Prime Minister will first visit the terminal building, and then take a round of the terminal building, and then he will be addressing the audience,"" Singhal added.

The global body IATA has assigned the 'NMI' code to the Navi Mumbai International Airport.

Domestic carriers Air India Group, IndiGo and Akasa have already announced shifting a part of their flight operations to the new facility.

Spread across an area of 1,160 hectares, Navi Mumbai International Airport, upon completion of all phases, will have four terminals with a capacity of 90 million passengers per annum and a cargo capacity of 3.25 million metric tonne, making it one of the largest aviation hubs in Asia.

""To begin with, we have completed terminal one, having a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, 0.8 million metric tonne of cargo capacity and one runway,"" Singhal stated.

The existing Mumbai International Airport has a capacity of around 55 million passengers per annum, and the new facility will handle 90 million passengers per annum, he added.

""So, once this airport is fully completed, then these two airports together will cater to the almost 150 million passengers per annum, making the two airports a big aviation hub globally,"" Singhal said.

""Almost ₹19,647 crore have been spent on phase one, and once all the four terminals are completed, we would have an approximate expenditure of 1-lakh crore,"" Singhal said.

Navi Mumbai International Airport will be the first aerodrome in the country to be connected by expressways, highways, metros, suburban rails, and even water taxi, he pointed out.

This is also a green airport as it has the storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel, the official said.

Besides being one of the most efficient airports, it would also have an Automated Passenger People's Mover facility, which will internally connect all four terminals, he said.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-124306404,imgsize-137830,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etinfra,resizemode-75/news/aviation/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-navi-mumbai-international-airport-on-oct-8.jpg",N,,2025-10-04 10:56:27.488618

KLM and KLM Cityhopper are testing a suite of innovative measures to reduce the environmental impact of their flights as part of the 2025 edition of The Aviation Challenge (TAC), the annual SkyTeam initiative promoting sustainable aviation.

From AI-driven water calculations to filtered seawater, the airline is exploring solutions that can be scaled into daily operations to reduce the impact on the environment.

Cutting emissions through innovation

Among the trials, KLM is using an AI model to predict the exact amount of water required onboard, helping to cut weight and emissions.

Pilots are testing flight optimisation tools designed to minimise fuel consumption, while business class passengers are encouraged to pre-select meals to reduce food waste.

Filtered seawater bottles are being introduced to replace standard bottled water, and passengers contributing to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) receive priority boarding.

Digital boarding passes, which have already cut paper usage by 84%, continue to be promoted.

The focus this year is broader than in previous trials, covering multiple flights rather than a single showcase route.

From 4 to 10 October, selected services include Amsterdam to Rome on the new Airbus A321neo, Amsterdam to Nairobi on an undisclosed aircraft type, and Amsterdam to Kraków on KLM Cityhopper’s Embraer E195-E2.

Reducing aviation’s environmental footprint

Alongside the passenger-facing initiatives, the airline is testing lighter catering equipment, smarter cargo loading strategies, and electric pushback vehicles.

The challenge, inspired by the historic 1934 London-to-Melbourne air race, now seeks to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint while sharing best practices across SkyTeam carriers.

“KLM acknowledges its environmental and climate impact and recognises the limits of what the planet can sustain. Action is required to operate within these limits,” the airline said.

KLM is also linking its sustainability work with social impact through Wings of Support, the volunteer-run foundation supporting local projects at KLM destinations.

In Nairobi, for example, the Big Five Center teaches children trades and vocational skills to improve long-term prospects in underserved communities.

KLM announced the programme on the same day that it unveiled its first Airbus A350 simulator in the Netherlands, marking a significant step in preparing for the arrival of the A350 aircraft, which will join the fleet at the end of 2026.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KLM-Airbus-A321neo-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:31.804193
,,2025-10-04 12:37:30+00:00,Nebraska Examiner,The infrastructure thread that connects the dots - Nebraska Examiner,"Hunter Traynor, Christian Mapes, Lauri Cimino, Danielle Jefferis",,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/10/04/the-infrastructure-thread-that-connects-the-dots/,"These facilities will create new markets for farmers, jobs in rural communities and a larger state tax base.
And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built.
Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade.
If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.
Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.","Nearly a century ago, George Norris, a great United States senator, made the case for electrifying rural America.

“These young men and young women, America’s farmers of the future, observing all the wonders of the modern age of electricity, will not be content with the homes of earlier America,” Norris wrote in his autobiography. “Unless those homes in the countrysides are lighted electrically and equipped with the devices electricity provides — for comfort, convenience and efficiency — they will not be content. They will have been trained in the colleges and universities of this country for the most efficient agricultural methods, and electricity will be a part of their lives.”

He understood that without modern infrastructure, Nebraska couldn’t keep its young people, modernize agriculture or grow its economy. Electricity was the thread connecting it all.

Today, the challenge is similar but bigger. Nebraska’s economic future is tied to powering the next generation of industries, many of which are rooted in agriculture. Gov. Jim Pillen’s “Silicon Valley of the bioeconomy” vision calls for transforming our crops into sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, bioplastics, fertilizer, enzymes and other high-value products. These facilities will create new markets for farmers, jobs in rural communities and a larger state tax base.

But they will also demand vast amounts of electricity. Without new generation, transmission and grid capacity, we can’t fully realize that vision. And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built. This tension is as urgent as the conflicts in our communities over building sufficient housing to address our housing shortages and rising costs.

Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade. In the last few years, demand projections have been revised upward annually. That’s from bioeconomy projects, information technology, advanced manufacturing and more. Our public power providers are planning and investing for growth. But local resistance to building energy projects can slow or stop development that is vital to meeting the state’s generation needs.

Here’s where the dots connect:

• Communities want rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization.

• The bioeconomy, which creates domestic markets for domestic producers, needs abundant energy to operate, as do the advanced manufacturing facilities that anchor employment bases.

• Building renewable projects, transmission lines, natural gas turbines and the nuclear tech of tomorrow unlock demand and create the rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization described above.

If the last dot is missing, the picture breaks apart. If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.

The benefits of welcoming energy development are real and visible across Nebraska.

Nebraska’s nameplate capacity tax on renewables generates millions of dollars each year for schools, roads and other public services. Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.

Construction and operational jobs inject new spending into the local economy, and, in many cases, towns with a local option sales tax see millions in new revenue from major projects. Look at northeast Nebraska, where inviting generation has led to a flywheel of growth and revitalization in cities like Norfolk.

The Nebraska Chamber works alongside our public utilities, private developers, local leaders and the agricultural community. We believe in an “all-of-the-above” energy approach — not just because it’s good policy, but because it’s the only realistic way to connect the dots between Nebraska’s growth ambitions and the infrastructure needed to support them.

George Norris fought to bring electricity to every corner of Nebraska, because he knew it would change the trajectory of rural life. In our time, the fight is to ensure we have enough generation to keep our state competitive, our communities strong and opportunities here at home.

We grow it here. We can process it here. But only if we power it here. It won’t be easy. These emotional discussions invoke our sense of place, conservation and unfortunately in some instances, partisanship. I believe we can work together, connect the dots and make Nebraska’s next century as bright as the last.

This expansion dovetails with Egypt's Vision 2030 blueprint, aiming to double air traffic at Cairo International and position it as Africa's premier aviation nexus.","Cairo, October 4 - EgyptAir's ambitious expansion into the US market is set to transform transatlantic travel options for passengers seeking direct flights from Cairo to major American hubs. As the flag carrier of Egypt and a proud Star Alliance member, EgyptAir has officially filed with the US Department of Transportation for approval to launch two groundbreaking long-haul routes in 2026. The first will connect Cairo International Airport (CAI) directly to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) starting in May 2026, marking the airline's longest flight to date at approximately 7,500 miles and over 15 hours of flight time. This non-stop service revives a historic link, as EgyptAir previously operated flights to Los Angeles decades ago, before suspending them amid shifting global aviation dynamics. Complementing this, a Cairo to Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) route is slated to commence in June 2026, further solidifying EgyptAir's North American footprint. These new US routes from EgyptAir are not just additions to the schedule; they represent a strategic pivot toward enhanced global connectivity, catering to the surging demand for efficient travel between the Middle East and the West Coast and Midwest of the United States. With Egypt's tourism sector booming, drawing millions annually to its ancient wonders, and strong business ties fostering cargo and passenger growth, these initiatives align perfectly with broader economic goals. EgyptAir's leadership has emphasized that the routes will leverage the airline's modern fleet, including the incoming Airbus A350-900 aircraft, to deliver premium comfort on these extended journeys. Early indications suggest initial frequencies of three to four weekly flights per route, with potential for daily operations as demand stabilizes, offering travelers unparalleled convenience without layovers in Europe or the Gulf.

The operational backbone for these new EgyptAir US routes lies in the airline's ongoing fleet modernization, a multi-billion-dollar investment that positions it as a competitive force in long-haul aviation. Currently, EgyptAir's wide-body arsenal includes Boeing 777-300ERs, Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, and Airbus A330 variants, but the real game-changer arrives with the phased delivery of up to 15 Airbus A350-900s beginning in early 2026. These state-of-the-art jets, equipped with advanced aerodynamics for fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, boast spacious cabins featuring lie-flat business class seats, enhanced economy legroom, and cutting-edge in-flight entertainment systems. For the Cairo to Los Angeles flight, the A350's range exceeding 9,700 miles ensures seamless non-stop service, while its quieter engines and lower cabin altitude promise a less fatiguing experience for passengers crossing multiple time zones. Similarly, the Chicago route will benefit from this technology, allowing EgyptAir to optimize schedules around peak travel windows. Beyond passenger comfort, these aircraft support substantial cargo holds, vital for transporting Egyptian exports like textiles and perishables alongside US imports. EgyptAir's integration into Star Alliance amplifies the appeal, enabling seamless connections to over 1,300 destinations worldwide through partners like United Airlines and Lufthansa. This fleet upgrade isn't isolated; it's part of a comprehensive strategy that includes enhanced crew training and sustainability measures, such as sustainable aviation fuel trials, ensuring that new routes like Cairo to LAX and ORD adhere to global environmental standards while boosting operational reliability.

For travelers eyeing EgyptAir's new US routes, the benefits extend far beyond the flight itself, weaving into the rich tapestry of cultural and economic exchanges between Egypt and America. Imagine departing Cairo's bustling terminals at dawn, arriving in sun-drenched Los Angeles by evening to explore Hollywood's glamour or Silicon Beach's innovation hubs, all without the hassle of connections. Chicago-bound flights, meanwhile, open doors to the Windy City's architectural marvels, deep-dish pizza scenes, and proximity to the Great Lakes, appealing to leisure seekers and business professionals alike. These routes are poised to invigorate Egypt's inbound tourism, projected to surpass 15 million visitors in 2026, by making iconic sites like the Pyramids of Giza and the Nile River cruises more accessible from the US heartland and the Pacific Coast. Economically, they promise to channel increased trade volumes, with bilateral commerce already topping $10 billion annually, facilitated by streamlined visa processes and dedicated lounges at CAI. EgyptAir anticipates a diverse passenger mix: Egyptian-Americans visiting family, adventure tourists chasing pharaonic history, and corporate delegates sealing deals in emerging sectors like renewable energy. Safety remains paramount, with EgyptAir's flawless IATA Operational Safety Audit score underscoring its commitment to rigorous standards. As these services roll out, ancillary offerings like premium meal selections blending Mediterranean flavors with American classics will elevate the onboard journey, turning long-haul flights into memorable previews of destination cultures.

Looking ahead, EgyptAir's pursuit of these new US routes in May and June 2026 signals a new era of aviation ambition for the airline, potentially reshaping competitive landscapes in the transatlantic sphere. While rivals like Emirates and Qatar Airways dominate with vast Gulf hubs, EgyptAir's direct Cairo gateways offer shorter travel times and cost efficiencies, especially for East Coast and Midwest US departures. Approval from the DOT, expected by early 2026, could pave the way for accelerated bookings via EgyptAir's user-friendly website and mobile app, where dynamic pricing and loyalty perks through the EgyptAir Plus program sweeten the deal. This expansion dovetails with Egypt's Vision 2030 blueprint, aiming to double air traffic at Cairo International and position it as Africa's premier aviation nexus. Challenges like geopolitical fluctuations and fuel volatility loom, yet EgyptAir's resilient track record, navigating post-pandemic recoveries with over 90% load factors, instills confidence. Ultimately, these routes embody more than logistics; they bridge continents, fostering people-to-people ties that enrich global understanding. As EgyptAir charts this course, eager passengers can anticipate a future where flying from the cradle of civilization to America's dynamic metropolises feels effortlessly connected, inviting a wave of exploration and opportunity across the Atlantic.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5swiXhl6RjSL3HO08h8IxIFwGO1YyQ8UACPiBUdOb2s19LzMa3URRXU0svqLanwd_lhUNxIzt7A9XtmdottByobCuSBeXjjc6W7nx1EvsMVry7MR_FaOZ3uxKAeN2XkS1lhQJlrQOooT8QNG9782G4lHzINr0mHzYSflupC8NYdAb4w3Moxh0KmbX_g1t/w1600/Egyptair_LAX_ORD.png,N,,2025-10-04 12:56:37.380497

Ltd., announced on October 1 that they have signed an agreement to explore a worldwide partnership, reports Biodiesel magazine.

Their goal is to solve a major problem in the industry: the difficult and inefficient process of getting sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, from producers to airplanes. Currently, mixing SAF with traditional fuel usually happens only at large production sites, which isn’t very flexible. Most fuel terminals and airports don’t have the right equipment or approvals for this mixing process.

Together, the companies plan to create a complete solution. They will combine XCF’s knowledge in building SAF production systems with FlyORO’s unique, portable blending technology, called AlphaLite. This system is designed to be set up either at airports or before fuel reaches them. The collaboration aims to make it easier and more cost-effective for airports and airlines to start using SAF.

The need for solutions like this is growing quickly. By 2030, the worldwide market for SAF is predicted to be worth more than $25 billion, with demand expected to be over 5.5 billion gallons. New and flexible mixing technologies will be essential to connect fuel producers with airports and airlines globally.

This potential partnership fits with XCF’s plan to expand internationally using a modular and efficient approach. Teaming up with FlyORO would help XCF offer a more complete service, managing everything from producing the fuel to blending and delivering it around the world.

Mihir Dange, the head of XCF Global, stated, “This partnership could change how the aviation industry approaches SAF. Blending is a crucial part of the process that affects how quickly SAF can be adopted. By combining FlyORO’s technology with our global strategy, we are building a way to speed up its use, lower costs, and create new opportunities for everyone involved.”

Damian Mc Loughlin, a leader at FlyORO, added, “Our goal has always been to remove the obstacles to using SAF. Our portable AlphaLite system makes blending more adaptable and affordable. By working with XCF, we can bring this solution to airports and airlines worldwide, enabling faster and smarter deployment of clean fuel.”

This agreement shows the companies’ shared commitment to making clean aviation fuel more widely used. The final partnership depends on further reviews and the signing of formal contracts.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/XCF-global-image-logo-updated.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:47.848057

This sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a cleaner alternative to regular jet fuel.
Delhi was selected for this test because the Panipat refinery already supplies regular airplane fuel to the airport through a direct pipeline.
“The system they already have to make and deliver fuel to the airport can also be used for this new eco-friendly fuel.
It plans to mix 1% of this eco-friendly fuel with regular airplane fuel in 2027.","New Delhi: India will soon start a test program to supply a new type of eco-friendly airplane fuel at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, reports The Hindu businessline.

This sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a cleaner alternative to regular jet fuel. It is made from renewable sources or waste materials. The Indian Oil Corporation has recently been approved to make this fuel at its refinery in Panipat.

The fuel will be created using materials like used cooking oil and farm waste such as rice straw. Delhi was selected for this test because the Panipat refinery already supplies regular airplane fuel to the airport through a direct pipeline.

A major benefit of this new fuel is that it can be used with existing airport equipment and fuel systems.

“The great thing about this fuel is that you don’t need to change any of the current equipment to start using it. It works just like regular fuel,” said Jane Hupe, a deputy director at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN body.

She highlighted that India’s existing pipeline network is a significant advantage because it means no expensive new transportation systems are required.

“The system they already have to make and deliver fuel to the airport can also be used for this new eco-friendly fuel. That’s a major benefit,” Hupe added.

Globally, this kind of fuel is important for a UN plan to reduce pollution from international flights. This plan is being introduced in stages, and countries can choose to join voluntarily until 2026.

India has decided not to take part in these early voluntary phases. However, starting in 2027, Indian airlines operating international flights will need to follow the plan’s rules.

To prepare, the Indian government has set initial goals. It plans to mix 1% of this eco-friendly fuel with regular airplane fuel in 2027. This would increase to 2% in 2028 and reach 5% by 2030.

The government is also creating a full policy to encourage the production and use of this sustainable fuel.

Last month, India’s Civil Aviation Minister, K. Ram Mohan Naidu, stated that India has a natural edge in this area.

“Our location helps us become an exporter, and we also have huge amounts of raw materials available,” the Minister said.

Currently, India has more than 750 million tonnes of biomass and nearly 230 million tonnes of extra farm waste that can be used to produce this green fuel.

“India has the potential to become a world leader in making this fuel,” the Minister said. He added that India is expected to produce more of this fuel than it needs, allowing it to become a major supplier to other countries.

India already exports half of the regular airplane fuel it produces.

“It makes sense for us to focus on this, given our dedication to a cleaner environment,” he said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-01.jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:55.657360

UM6P participated through its subsidiary Green Energy Park (GEP) and its affiliated venture builder INNOVX, which operates HydroJeel, a green hydrogen and ammonia production company.

The university’s involvement in the summit reflects its end-to-end role in Morocco’s hydrogen ecosystem. UM6P runs physical platforms, including the Green H2A facility at Jorf Lasfar, a joint UM6P-IRESEN-OCP platform with 4 megawatts of electrolysis capacity producing 4 tons of green ammonia daily.

It also operates a micro-pilot system at the Green Energy Park in Benguerir, Morocco’s first installed green hydrogen production system.

The summit focused on bankability, offtake contracts, certification, and export readiness. Key sessions included a high-level plenary on securing offtake with H2Global and MASEN, and panels on decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and road transport.

Morocco has earmarked up to one million hectares of public land for green hydrogen projects, with five investors pre-selected in March 2025 for six projects worth approximately $31.9 billion.

Research and development drive Morocco’s energy transition

Hicham Lalaoui Moutarajji, Pedagogical Manager at UM6P’s Laboratory of Inorganic Materials for Sustainable Energy Technologies (LIMSET), told Morocco World News (MWN) that the university operates along two main axes: research and innovative projects addressing Morocco’s energy sovereignty.

“We work on innovative projects, carrying out R&D to find sustainable energy solutions that address Morocco’s energy sovereignty and ensure a flexible and efficient energy transition for both Morocco and Africa,” Lalaoui Moutarajji explained.

The laboratory translates research into practical applications. Its work covers green hydrogen, batteries for energy storage, and various industrial applications. These research outcomes feed directly into teaching programs designed for both junior professionals seeking upskilling and senior executives requiring specialized training.

“The essential goal is to guarantee this transfer of knowledge and expertise to future Moroccan generations, enabling them to meet both national and global challenges in this domain,” Lalaoui Moutarajji said.

UM6P’s research infrastructure includes partnerships with Argonne National Laboratory for collaboration on green energy technology and grids.

The university has signed agreements to run electrolyzer pilots with Chariot and Oort Energy on its campus. A recent memorandum with OCP SBU Mining and EDF aims to use green hydrogen for “green drying” and mobility trials at UM6P’s Mining ARC in Benguerir.

Co-founded by UM6P and IRESEN, the Green Energy Park serves as a testing ground for photovoltaics, storage systems, smart grids, and hydrogen applications. Research groups at UM6P have published work on alkaline hydrogen production systems and novel materials for electrochemical devices.

Published studies examine control of solar variability, thermal integration, and efficiency mapping in kilowatt-scale systems. UM6P’s ACER and LIMSET teams focus on materials and devices for hydrogen production and reversible electrochemical systems.

Executive training prepares workforce for hydrogen economy

The university offers an executive master’s degree in green hydrogen that has reached its third cohort. The twelve-month program covers the entire hydrogen value chain through intensive one-week sessions for each module. Participants engage in practical workshops, case studies, and sessions with international experts.

“This executive master’s runs over twelve months, structured around intensive one-week sessions for each module,” Lalaoui Moutarajji noted. The curriculum addresses fundamentals, emerging technologies, including SWAC, alkaline, PEM, and AEM electrolysis, along with energy storage challenges.

The program includes modules on safety, health, and security. “Integrating a safety module is essential – a key ingredient for the success of the program and for the concrete realization of hydrogen projects,” Lalaoui Moutarajji stated.

Project structuring and technical aspects of developing hydrogen facilities form another core component. The program draws participants from Morocco’s major industrial entities, including OCP, GESA, INNOVX, UM6P, and the Public Laboratory for Testing and Studies. The current cohort includes international professionals from Mauritania and Tunisia.

“Individuals recognized the value of enrolling in this unique executive master’s – the only one of its kind in Morocco and the Arab world – and who see its potential to contribute to success across the African continent,” Lalaoui Moutarajji said.

Training timelines align with Morocco’s industrial ambitions. An engineer requires five years of training to operate new hydrogen facilities. Programs at UM6P, Green Energy Park, and national academic partners prepare the workforce for units expected to become operational between 2027 and 2032.

The university’s approach combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience at pilot facilities. Students gain exposure to real-world challenges in hydrogen production, storage, and application across different industrial sectors.

Industrial decarbonization links CO₂ and hydrogen strategies

Abdelghafour Zaabout, Associate Professor at UM6P’s Applied Chemistry and Engineering Research (ACER) Center of Excellence, specializing in decarbonization technologies, described his work on hard-to-abate industries. He told MWN that the university prepares technologies respecting Morocco’s specific industrial context.

“At UM6P, we do several things basically that are linked to preparing first through training and education, but second as well through R&D development so that we can prepare the technologies that can lead the decarbonization,” Zaabout explained.

The connection between carbon capture and hydrogen production forms a central element of the strategy. Zaabout outlined how captured CO₂ from specific industries can combine with hydrogen to create green molecules.

“The CO₂ that has been captured from specific industries to decarbonize can be combined with the hydrogen to make green molecules,” he said.

This approach positions CO₂ as an enabler rather than merely a waste product. “The CO₂ is an enabler of the hydrogen economy,” Zaabout noted. The university works extensively on identifying which technologies suit Morocco’s hard-to-decarbonize industries.

UM6P trains chemical engineers and process engineers to understand fundamental mechanisms underlying these technologies. The educational philosophy emphasizes economic viability alongside technical feasibility.

“We create the mindset that they can understand that no technological development for solving specific challenges can be made unless those technologies create an economic value for society and impact for society itself,” Zaabout stated.

The university’s decarbonization work connects directly to OCP’s green investment program and ENGIE-OCP frameworks for renewables and green ammonia feasibility. UM6P and HydroJeel provide research, pilots, and talent development supporting these broader industrial initiatives.

Renewable energy competitiveness determines hydrogen viability

Mohamed Bousseta, CEO of Green Energy Park, stressed renewable energy’s role in hydrogen economics. Speaking to MWN, he explained that competitiveness drives the entire ecosystem’s success.

“Renewable energy accounts for 70% of competitiveness in green hydrogen production. In other words, to produce one kilogram of competitive green hydrogen, 70% of the cost comes from the LCOE – the levelized cost of energy,” Bousseta said.

Green Energy Park serves as a research, innovation, and training center for renewable energies, particularly photovoltaics, thermal and electrochemical storage, energy efficiency, smart grids, and modeling. The facility operates as a UM6P and IRESEN subsidiary.

Meanwhile, the Green H2A platform under construction at Jorf Lasfar will test new technologies at scale. The facility features 4 megawatts of electrolysis capacity split between 2 megawatts PEM and 2 megawatts alkaline systems. It will produce 4 tons of green ammonia daily.

“The platform will have emulators designed to test profiles specific to southern Morocco, where the majority of industrial projects will be implemented,” Bousseta explained. These emulators allow testing under conditions matching actual deployment sites.

Bousseta pointed out that demonstrators prove critical for ecosystem development. “Because if we want to successfully develop this ecosystem, competitiveness is absolutely key. Competitiveness means achieving a competitive price, and that requires innovation across all domains,” he said.

Innovation must span renewable energy generation, hydrogen production technologies, and applications. The process includes electrolysis for splitting water molecules, nitrogen production, and ammonia synthesis combining hydrogen and nitrogen.

From pilots to industrial scale through venture building

UM6P’s approach extends beyond traditional academic boundaries into venture creation and industrial scale-up. INNOVX, the university’s affiliated venture builder, established HydroJeel specifically to execute green hydrogen and ammonia projects for OCP and export markets.

Operated by HydroJeel, the Jorf Hydrogen Platform targets 100,000 tons per year of green ammonia in its first phase. The project received a €30 million grant from Germany’s PtX Development Fund, administered by KfW and KGAL, to advance the demonstrator.

Morocco’s “Morocco Offer” policy framework, launched in March 2024, provides up to one million hectares of public land for hydrogen projects. The first 300,000 hectares entered active development. In March 2025, the steering committee pre-selected five investors for six projects valued at 319 billion dirhams across three southern regions.

Projects span green ammonia, e-fuels, and green steel production. TotalEnergies studies a 200,000-ton-per-year green ammonia export project near Guelmim-Oued Noun. OCP and ENGIE signed a multi-billion-euro memorandum covering renewables, green molecules, and desalination.

Tarfaya represents a scaling pathway with renewable ammonia production targeting approximately one million tons per year by 2027, expanding to three million tons by 2032. The project obtained renewable fuels of non-biological origin pre-certification, positioning it for European Union market access.

UM6P’s Green H2A facility partners with Proton Ventures of the Netherlands for turnkey pilot installation. The dual electrolyzer configuration with renewable load emulation creates a world-reference pilot setup. The system allows testing under variable solar and wind profiles matching southern Morocco conditions.

Process-use cases focus on mining applications where OCP operations provide immediate demand. Green hydrogen can replace fossil fuels for drying processes and mobile equipment. These anchor applications address the critical challenge of securing customers before production begins.

Strategic partnerships accelerate technology transfer and scale

International partnerships strengthen UM6P’s capabilities across the hydrogen value chain. The university signed a memorandum with 247Solar to study green hydrogen and ammonia production pathways linked to solar thermal and power platforms.

Partnerships with equipment manufacturers bring cutting-edge technology to Moroccan soil. Electrolyzer pilots with Chariot and Oort Energy allow testing of different system architectures under local conditions. The OCP SBU Mining partnership with EDF demonstrates process integration in industrial settings.

The Argonne National Laboratory collaboration provides access to high-performance computing, advanced materials research, and systems integration expertise. This connection accelerates the translation from laboratory research to operational plants.

Morocco’s geographic position supports export-oriented projects. Ports including Jorf Lasfar, Dakhla, and facilities near Guelmim offer Atlantic access to European and global markets. Summit discussions on port readiness and export corridors included Port of Rotterdam participation, signaling concrete logistics planning.

Since its establishment in 2024, Germany’s climate and energy alliance with Morocco positions the kingdom as a key supplier for European hydrogen demand. This framework provides policy backing for long-term offtake agreements and project financing.

The summit’s focus on certification and traceability reflects market requirements. INNOVX and Hinicio run Moroccan pilots for renewable fuels of non-biological origin certification. MED-GEM, an EU-funded initiative, coordinates pre-certification work essential for accessing European incentives and sustainable aviation fuel mandates.

Water supply through desalination co-located with renewable energy installations addresses a critical input. OCP and ENGIE plans integrate agricultural water needs with molecule production. Summit sessions examined water-energy nexus solutions.

Morocco’s hydrogen strategy targets replacing imported ammonia for fertilizers while creating export capacity. Green ammonia serves as both an industrial feedstock and a maritime fuel.

E-methanol and sustainable aviation fuel address shipping and aviation decarbonization. Early green steel projects leverage Morocco’s industrial base and respond to the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) dynamics.

UM6P’s comprehensive model combines scientific research, pilot-scale validation, workforce development, and venture creation. This integrated approach addresses the full spectrum of requirements for establishing a hydrogen economy.

“The government should intensify trade promotion and branding initiatives to position Malaysian palm oil as a sustainable, climate-smart commodity,” Bernama reported him saying.
“Stronger branding reinforces Malaysia’s commitment to standards such as the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and the National Traceability System (SKN), which improve transparency and accountability.” Dr Ahmad Parveez said these efforts are critical to counteract negative campaigns in key export markets and assure buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious demands.
On improving yields, he proposed a 100 per cent reinvestment allowance (RA) for oil palm replanting to accelerate the replacement of ageing trees.
Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency.” Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is expected to table Budget 2026 in Parliament on 10 October.","THE Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) has urged the government to introduce targeted fiscal and policy incentives in Budget 2026 to strengthen the palm oil industry’s competitiveness, improve productivity, and advance its sustainability credentials.

MPOB director-general Datuk Dr Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir said support for trade promotion, branding, and replanting was essential to maintain Malaysia’s global standing amid tightening international sustainability standards and evolving consumer preferences.

“The government should intensify trade promotion and branding initiatives to position Malaysian palm oil as a sustainable, climate-smart commodity,” Bernama reported him saying. “Stronger branding reinforces Malaysia’s commitment to standards such as the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and the National Traceability System (SKN), which improve transparency and accountability.”

Dr Ahmad Parveez said these efforts are critical to counteract negative campaigns in key export markets and assure buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious demands.

He also called for greater fiscal support to accelerate the growth of downstream sectors, including oleochemicals, specialty fats, bioenergy, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which he described as key to ensuring long-term resilience.

“We urge more strategic support for logistics efficiency, including incentives for greener and lower-cost export solutions,” he added, noting that such efforts would address both current cost pressures and long-term positioning in global markets.

On improving yields, he proposed a 100 per cent reinvestment allowance (RA) for oil palm replanting to accelerate the replacement of ageing trees. “This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5 per cent, or 101,809 hectares, to 5.1 per cent, or 210,000 hectares annually.”

He called for RM280 million in dedicated funding under Budget 2026 to support replanting programmes for independent smallholders. “Recognising the urgent need to rejuvenate ageing plantations, the government remains committed to supporting independent smallholders,” he said.

A further RM100 million soft loan scheme was proposed to support small and medium-sized estates in undertaking replanting without undue financial strain. “In the medium to long term, this initiative will boost national crude palm oil (CPO) production through higher-yielding varieties and improved farm management.”

Dr Ahmad Parveez also recommended imposing a three per cent export duty on refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm stearin to ensure sufficient domestic supply for the oleochemical sector, alongside a 10–20 per cent duty on the export of waste oils, such as used cooking oil (UCO) and palm oil mill effluent (POME oil), to promote local utilisation.

“These measures would support local production, encourage compliance with sustainability certification schemes such as MSPO and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), and help transition the sector towards a circular, greener economy.”

He said Budget 2026 presents a timely opportunity to help the sector overcome external challenges, from trade restrictions to labour shortages, while strengthening its long-term productivity and market resilience.

“The focus should be on strengthening sustainability compliance through universal MSPO adoption and robust traceability systems,” he added. “Compliance with global environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is vital to safeguard Malaysia’s position in international markets. Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency.”

Alongside automotive and other industries, it has positioned Mexico as a global manufacturing powerhouse. But the era of industries operating in silos is ending. Driven by megatrends such as decarbonization, electrification, artificial intelligence, and supply chain resilience, the boundaries between sectors are dissolving.

In fact, this convergence is not only a global phenomenon, but it also represents one of Mexico’s greatest opportunities. By embracing cross-industry synergies, the country can move from being an assembler of global supply chains to becoming a true designer of innovation. The challenge is no longer whether these industries will intersect, but how Mexico can leverage their overlap to shape the future of mobility.

Aerospace and Automotive: Shared roads to Electrification and Autonomy

Few countries combine a robust aerospace presence with an equally strong automotive base. Mexico does both. Some regions in our country have become hubs for advanced aerospace engineering and manufacturing, while other regions anchor the automotive supply chain.

The parallels are striking. The automotive industry’s leap into electric vehicles and batteries offers valuable lessons for aerospace: Hybrid-Electric aircraft, eVTOLs, and Advanced Urban Air Mobility will depend on many of the same technologies. Lightweight materials and composites pioneered in car design are equally critical for next-generation aircraft. Similarly, autonomous driving systems share DNA with AI-driven flight safety and air traffic control.

If Mexico aligns its supply chains and innovation agendas, it could lead in developing the integrated mobility solutions of the future, in other words, where wings meet the wheels.

Aerospace and Energy: Powering the future of Sustainable Flight

The energy transition is rewriting the rules of the aerospace industry. Decarbonization requires breakthroughs in sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen propulsion, and new infrastructure. Here, Mexico’s energy landscape offers untapped potential.

Solar projects in the state of Sonora, and wind corridors in the state of Oaxaca could power the production of green hydrogen in Mexico, which will be as important for aviation as it will be for other transportation modes.

Mexico’s agricultural and petrochemical base could support SAF production, turning the country into a potential hub for clean aviation fuels. Airports themselves could evolve into microgrids that supply renewable energy to aircraft and surrounding cities.

Partnerships between the government, global energy firms, and Mexico’s airlines and MRO networks could unlock synergies that accelerate sustainable aviation across the Latin America region.

Aerospace and Digital: AI, Data, and Industry 4.0

The digital revolution is blurring the boundaries between aerospace and other industries. Predictive maintenance, and AI-enabled systems are already transforming how fleets are operated and maintained.

Mexico’s IT hubs like Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City provide a talent base that can bridge aerospace with other adjacent industries. Cybersecurity lessons from financial services can protect aircraft systems, Big Data and Analytics can optimize flight operations as much as they improve medical diagnostics.

This digital layer represents a great opportunity for Mexico to position itself not just as a manufacturing powerhouse, but as a designer of integrated, AI-driven mobility systems.

The Role of Industry Clusters: Living Labs for Synergies and Experimentation

Mexico’s industry clusters would be at the heart of this transformation.

To unlock synergies, these clusters must evolve from isolated centers of excellence into interconnected living labs where industries converge.

Clusters also play a vital role in workforce development. By aligning their educational programs, technical institutes, and research centers, they can build cross-sector talent pipelines that prepare engineers and technicians to work at the intersection of aerospace, automotive, and energy. In this way, clusters can act as catalysts for Mexico’s evolution from assembler to innovator.

Caveats and Conditions: Turning vision into reality

The opportunities above are real, but so are the challenges. For our country to transform potential into real leadership, several conditions must be addressed:

Energy policy alignment: Investors in renewables, SAF, and hydrogen need long-term clarity. Establishing clear incentives and stable regulatory frameworks will be key to unlocking the full potential of Mexico’s diverse energy resources.

Infrastructure modernization: Today’s refineries, electricity grids, and logistics networks are not prepared for large-scale SAF production or hydrogen distribution. Airports aspiring to become renewable microgrids also face significant challenges. A national plan for modernization is needed to align physical infrastructure with the innovation agenda.

R&D and IP protection: Mexico needs to increase investment in applied research, ensuring strong intellectual property frameworks, so that innovations developed locally generate local value. Protecting and commercializing locally developed IP, while aligning programs such as the National System of Researchers (SNI) with industrial priorities is critical.

Cross-industry governance: Isolated pilot projects are not enough. Mexico requires permanent mechanisms for collaboration among clusters, government agencies, academia, and industry. These governance platforms would ensure synergies move from isolated efforts to coordinated national strategies.

Talent development: Universities and technical institutes are producing strong engineers, but curricula remain industry specific. To lead in converging fields like electrified propulsion, AI-enabled mobility, and hydrogen systems, Mexico needs accelerated programs that cut across multiple industries.

Without these critical enablers, the vision of Mexico as a cross-industry innovation hub will remain aspirational. With them, it becomes a realistic path to competitiveness.

The industries of the future will not succeed in isolation. Industries like Aerospace, Automotive, and Digital are converging into a single innovation frontier, and Mexico is well positioned in all of them.

What Mexico needs now is the discipline to align policies, modernize infrastructure, accelerate talent, and institutionalize cross-industry collaboration. If these conditions are met, Mexico will not just assemble the technologies of tomorrow—it will design them, integrate them, and export them to the world.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2025-03/GE-Infrastructure-Queretaro-IMG-2021-Alberto-Robles-1-apd-MBN.jpg?h=aa4588f2&itok=HTLWHtIx,N,,2025-10-04 10:57:24.344417

US-based startup Otto Aerospace is behind the Jetsons-like plane, called the Phantom 3500. It features a teardrop-shaped fuselage that significantly reduces fuel consumption and increases range, as well as screens in place of traditional windows.

Its first flight is scheduled for 2027, with delivery expected in 2030.

There is one caveat: this is an all-new, clean-sheet aircraft type that has yet to be built and certified. The question of whether it delivers on time remains uncertain, as new concepts often take longer than initially planned.

Still, Flexjet CEO Michael Silvestro told Business Insider that while development hurdles are possible, the company is fully committed to innovation and is seeking manufacturers willing to move the needle in ways the industry has not yet seen.

""Otto impressed us. The technology is incredibly efficient and very capable in terms of size, speed range, comfort, fuel flow, and sustainability, so why not?"" he said. ""Why not think about continuing to push the envelope on the latest technological advances in aviation?""

The move comes as the private aviation industry continues to boom post-pandemic, with more and more people — particularly young professionals in their 40s — flocking to the luxuries of business aviation.

Yes, there are no windows

Besides the cockpit, the new nine-seater Phantom 3500 will be windowless. Instead, large screens will blanket the passenger cabin walls and ceiling.

Silvestro said these ""smart windows"" are designed to do several things, such as imitating what's going on outside or creating your own virtual images. He added that the goal is that clients could put anything they want on the screen — including movies or videos.

Getting rid of the windows helps smooth out the fuselage, reducing drag and fuel burn. Silvestro said Otto will have to figure out the logistics of seeing outside the aircraft during emergency events, like an engine fire.

""Now we have cameras everywhere on the airplanes, on the larger ones in particular, so there would have to be a pretty robust video ability to see what's going on outside,"" he said.

Despite potential deterrents like claustrophobia, Silvestro said he expects the revolutionary design to attract clients in the long term.

However, he said Flexjet's younger and more technically advanced customers, who are more open to change, would be the early adopters.

""It's just like anything else, like Waymo is going everywhere,"" he said as an example of other futuristic innovations. ""I think as you get a little bit more comfortable with technology, that unnerves people, and it will become more of the norm.""

Flexjet's bet on Otto comes as Silvestro pointed to an increase in young people flying private. This demographic is particularly more inclined to welcome futuristic tech like the Phantom 3500.

""The demographic is trending so much younger than it used to be,"" he said. ""We're capturing a good 10 years' worth of flyers; people in their 40s who can afford this are all in with regard to flying privately, and fractional ownership is the most desirable part.""

Once in service, the Phantom 3500 will become part of Flexjet's popular and ever-growing ""fractional ownership"" program.

This allows high-net-worth clients to enjoy the luxury and privacy of a private jet without owning one outright. Instead, they share one by purchasing flight hours.

It's essentially a timeshare for private flying and has become an increasingly attractive way to travel as billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Taylor Swift continue to battle jet trackers.

Data from Aviation Week's aircraft tracking tool indicates that the program is being used more than ever, with fractional ownership increasing by 10% between June and August compared to the same period in 2024, and by 70% compared to the same period in 2019.

What else does Flexjet get for $19.5 million

The Phantom 3500 is being developed as a super-midsized jet, competing with similar-sized planes such as the Bombardier Challenger 350 or the Embraer Praetor 600.

These jets typically have a cabin length of 23 to 28 feet and can seat eight to 10 passengers, depending on the configuration.

However, with a list price of $19.5 million, the Phantom 3500 is less expensive. The Bombardier and Embraer — both of which Flexjet already flies — cost about $27 million and $24 million new, respectively.

Otto's cost savings come from the plane's ""laminar-flow"" technology, which reduces drag by maintaining smoother airflow across the aircraft's carbon fiber composite surface. Otto said this would result in a 60% lower fuel burn than a comparable jet.

And smaller fuel tanks allow for smaller wings and engines, which also helps save on production and maintenance costs, per Otto.

Furthermore, the Phantom 3500 is designed to cruise at altitudes of up to 51,000 feet. This would allow it to fly above weather and turbulence, further reduce fuel consumption, and offer increased route flexibility. US airlines, by contrast, cruise at altitudes of up to 42,000 feet.

Overall, Otto said the jet would reduce operating costs by 50% and offer an expected range of 3,500 nautical miles (about 4,000 miles). That could connect Los Angeles and Hawaii or New York and London.

Otto already tested the laminar technology on a full-scale, piloted demonstrator jet called the Celera 500 for three years, starting in 2017. The company said the data collected proved the concept and projected savings.",https://i.insider.com/68ded8ac1c1f80efbec4d0a7?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 10:57:28.423068
