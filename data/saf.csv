When the global business aviation community lands in Las Vegas for NBAA-BACE 2025 this October, it will be stepping into a show that has been purposefully reshaped.

The world’s largest business aviation gathering returns with more than 770 exhibitors, a streamlined new static display, and a reinvigorated focus on safety, sustainability, and technology.

Amid supply-chain pressures and environmental targets, manufacturers are coming to prove that business aviation is not only resilient but ready to redefine itself.

“Business aviation finds itself at a crossroads,” one industry executive told AGN. “It’s no longer just about speed and luxury; it’s about resilience, technology, and sustainability.”

NBAA-BACE 2025 aircraft: New jets and special-mission conversions

The newly renamed Aircraft Connection static display will be condensed to just a day and a half, running from the afternoon of 14 October through 15 October at Henderson Executive Airport, with no static display on the final day.

In a major shift, chalets have been eliminated to reduce exhibitor costs and focus attention squarely on the aircraft. NBAA President Ed Bolen said the change aims to make participation more efficient while creating a more accessible, aircraft-centred experience for attendees.

Gulfstream marks a highly anticipated return to NBAA-BACE after a two-year absence, bringing a full complement of aircraft—G400, G600, G700, and G800—alongside a mock-up of the forthcoming “G300”, which is expected to replace the G280 at the entry level of the family.

Bombardier will showcase its Global 7500, Global 6500, and Challenger 3500, while Textron Aviation will make the public debut of its Citation Ascend, expected to be certified by the end of this year.

A new “Tribute to Flight Pavilion” will also appear within the static area, pairing icons such as the DC-3, de Havilland Mosquito, and Learjet 23 with today’s advanced business jets; a visual narrative of the industry’s evolution.

Elsewhere, attention will turn to Dassault’s Falcon 10X, now in advanced flight testing, and to the growing number of special-mission conversions that blur the line between corporate jet and defence platform.

Business aviation safety and maintenance in focus

Safety will dominate the agenda more than at any NBAA-BACE in recent memory. The show hosts three dedicated safety events: the Single-Pilot Safety Standdown, Small Operator Symposium, and National Safety Forum. These are supported by dozens of panels on operational risk, pilot wellbeing, and aircraft reliability.

NBAA is also pressing the FAA for a “safety-first” approach to upcoming drone integration rules, reinforcing the association’s wider advocacy role.

In the maintenance halls, exhibitors and MRO specialists will highlight advances in predictive diagnostics, digital twins, and data-driven maintenance planning. For the first time, NBAA-BACE will offer Inspection Authorisation renewal credit, recognising the event’s growing educational value for engineers and technicians.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and alternative propulsion at NBAA-BACE 2025

Sustainability remains a defining theme, but this year it’s more operational than aspirational.

SAF will be available at both Henderson Executive Airport and North Las Vegas, with book-and-claim credit options allowing exhibitors and operators to log verifiable emissions reductions even if the fuel isn’t physically uplifted. Several manufacturers have confirmed that aircraft flying to the show will do so using SAF blends or credits.

The Business Aviation Sustainability Summit will expand on this foundation, featuring panels on SAF scalability, hybrid-electric and hydrogen propulsion, and infrastructure readiness. For operators, the discussion is shifting from policy to practice—how to source, verify, and integrate greener fuels across their fleets.

AI, digital flight decks, and the connected cockpit

Digitalisation is set to be a defining feature of NBAA-BACE 2025. Expect to see AI-driven cockpit assistants, augmented-reality training tools, and paperless flight-operations software that link maintenance, scheduling, and compliance in real time.

According to NBAA, AI promises to “boost business-aviation efficiency and productivity”, helping operators cut downtime and make faster, data-backed decisions. The sector is positioning itself as a testbed for innovations that will eventually migrate into commercial and defence aviation.

Business aviation workforce and skills shortages

Workforce and skills shortages continue to shape the business aviation conversation.

NBAA’s YoPro (Young Professionals) programme will take on growing importance this year, focusing on recruitment, retention, and leadership development.

With technicians and pilots in short supply, the industry knows that digitalisation alone won’t solve its human-capital crisis.

Outlook: What NBAA-BACE 2025 means for business aviation

Between its reimagined format, sharpened focus on safety, and tangible sustainability measures, NBAA-BACE 2025 is shaping up as a turning point for the industry.

Whether through greener fuels, AI-enabled cockpits, or smarter maintenance practices, this year’s show is about proving that business aviation remains both dynamic and essential—ready to meet the challenges of the next decade head-on.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NBAA-BACE-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 08:56:12.125009

Ini dilakukan dengan mengembangkan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bioavtur berbasis Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau avtur campuran minyak jelantah.

Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis Pertamina Agung Wicaksono mengatakan, pihaknya juga sebelumnya telah mengembangkan BBM ramah lingkungan yang terus berevolusi seperti B20, B30, hingga B40.

Menurutnya, perjalanan Pertamina dalam mengembangkan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan bukan hanya kisah sukses ekonomi, tetapi juga perjalanan ekologi yang mendalam.

“Ini bukan hanya perjalanan sukses dalam hal ekonomi karena menciptakan penghematan devisa yang signifikan bagi negara, tetapi juga sebagai perjalanan ekologi. Menempatkan prinsip Environmental, Social, and Governance [ESG] sebagai inti adalah sesuatu yang sangat berarti,” ujar Agung melalui keterangan resmi dikutip Minggu (12/10/2025).

Dia mengatakan, keberhasilan Pertamina dalam menerapkan program biodiesel sejak B20 hingga B40 telah memberikan dampak besar terhadap kemandirian energi nasional.

“Sejak penerapan B20 dan kini B40, Indonesia telah mampu memenuhi kebutuhan energi dalam negeri dengan sumber daya yang lebih berkelanjutan,” lanjutnya.

Lebih lanjut, Agung menyoroti inovasi Pertamina dalam mengembangkan SAF yang berasal dari minyak jelantah.

Menurutnya, bahan bakar ini tidak hanya berperan penting dalam menurunkan emisi karbon hingga 84%, tetapi juga mendukung terbentuknya ekonomi sirkular di masyarakat.

“Kami telah menggunakan SAF itu dari minyak goreng masyarakat untuk terbang. Jadi ini bukan hanya tentang mengurangi emisi karbon, tetapi juga bagian dari ekonomi sirkular karena masyarakat dapat menukar minyak jelantah menjadi rupiah, yang kemudian diolah menjadi bahan bakar berkelanjutan dan efisien,” jelasnya.

Agung menambahkan bahwa keberhasilan pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan oleh Pertamina menjadi bagian penting dari transformasi energi nasional.

Menurutnya, program ini tidak hanya memperkuat ketahanan energi, tetapi juga membuka lapangan kerja baru di sektor energi hijau serta mendukung target Net Zero Emission (NZE) 2060.

“Ini adalah perjalanan transformasi Pertamina untuk mendukung agenda nasional mengenai bahan bakar nabati. Langkah ini menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia mampu menjadi pelopor energi bersih di kawasan Asia Tenggara,” ucapnya.",https://images.bisnis.com/posts/2025/10/12/1919572/bioavtur_pertamina_1755680600.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 07:57:16.640148

It will be Eni's second biorefinery in Sicily, after the Gela plant, which began biofuel production 2019 after being transformed from a petrochemical site, according to Eni.
The Priolo biorefinery will be fed mainly by vegetable waste and oils and animal fats, Eni said.
Expected to start operations 2028, the biorefinery will have the flexibility to produce SAF and HVO diesel.
""Eni has now started the authorization process and has filed an application for Environmental Impact Assessment"", Eni said in a press release September 23.","Eni SpA said Thursday it had launched the authorization process for an Environmental Impact Assessment to build a biorefinery and a chemical recycling plant in Sicily, after receiving approval from Italy's Environment and Energy Security Ministry.

Designed to produce up to 500,000 metric tons per annum (MMtpa) of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the Priolo project will rise on the site of an Eni ethylene plant set to be decommissioned, the state-backed energy major said in a press release.

It will be Eni's second biorefinery in Sicily, after the Gela plant, which began biofuel production 2019 after being transformed from a petrochemical site, according to Eni.

The Priolo biorefinery will be fed mainly by vegetable waste and oils and animal fats, Eni said.

Besides the Ecofining™ plant, the project will include a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit and a hydrogen production plant, it said.

Meanwhile the project's chemical recycling unit will have a processing capacity of 40,000 MMtpa and produce around 32,000 MMtpa of pyrolysis oil, Eni said.

The recycling plant will use the proprietary Hoop technology of Eni's chemicals business Versalis SpA, based on the pyrolysis of mixed plastic packaging waste.

The Priolo project will be the first deployment of the technology at a commercial scale, after the decommissioning of a demonstration plant at the Versalis plant in Mantua in June, Eni said.

""This technology, which complements mechanical recycling, transforms mixed plastic waste into raw material for the production of new plastic products suitable for all applications, including food contact and pharmaceutical packaging"", Eni said.

Developed from a joint project with Italian engineering company Servizi di Ricerche e Sviluppo SRL, the technology has high material recovery yields and feedstock flexibility, according to Eni.

Last month Eni said it had received approval from the ministry to convert several units at the Sannazzaro de' Burgondi refinery in Pavia into a biorefinery.

The refinery will continue traditional operations alongside a new processing capacity of 550,000 MMtpa for biofuel feedstock, mainly waste and residues. Expected to start operations 2028, the biorefinery will have the flexibility to produce SAF and HVO diesel.

""Eni has now started the authorization process and has filed an application for Environmental Impact Assessment"", Eni said in a press release September 23.

""The project involves converting the existing Hydrocracker unit using Ecofining™ technology and constructing a pre-treatment unit for waste and residues, which are the main biogenic feedstocks Enilive uses to produce HVO biofuels"", Eni added. Enilive is Eni's biofuels arm.

""The new Sannazzaro biorefinery will strengthen the site’s strategic role in supplying traditional jet fuel and SAF to north-west Italian airports, via both the pipeline connection to Milan Malpensa airport and depots connected to the refinery near other airports"", it said.

""Through Enilive, Eni is already the second-largest producer of HVO biofuels in Europe, including both diesel and biojet (SAF)"", the company said.

Eni has set goals to grow its biorefining capacity from the current 1.65 million metric tons per annum (MMtpa) to over three million by 2028 and more than five MMtpa by 2030, with the potential to produce up to two MMtpa of SAF by 2030.

Eni's current biofuels production come from two Italian plants in Venice and Gela and a United States plant in Louisiana, operated under its 50 percent-owned joint venture St Bernard Renewables LLC, according to the company.

""A third Italian biorefinery is due to come on stream in Livorno in 2026, followed by two plants currently under construction in Malaysia and South Korea; a further biorefinery in Italy has been announced for Priolo, Sicily"", Eni said.

The Cape Winelands Airport is moving closer to take-off, with developers confirming plans for construction to begin in the new year, pending environmental approval.

Environmental Authorisation to clear new airport lift-off

The final stages of the airport's Environmental Authorisation process were submitted earlier this year, in June. It weighs the project’s economic benefits, including job creation and improved regional connectivity, against environmental impacts, such as farmland loss and biodiversity degradation.

Developers have proposed extensive plans to counter the impact. Plans include operating largely off-grid, utilising renewable power and water reuse systems to achieve conservation offsets, as well as local road upgrades.

What passengers can look forward to at the Cape Winelands International Airport

Additionally, the first phase of the R7–10 billion development is expected to complement Cape Town International, rather than compete with it.

Private operators of the airport RSA.Aero aims to transform the airport into a full-scale international hub, featuring a 3.5-kilometre runway capable of handling wide-body aircraft, a boutique passenger terminal, new cargo facilities, and a heliport.

A hotel, retail spaces, conference facilities, and even sustainable aviation fuel storage are all part of the vision.

The site, formerly known as Fisantekraal Airfield, is not yet a commercial or passenger airport. Still, with its four runways (two active), it serves as a base for pilot training schools and general aviation services near Cape Town.

Long-Term Tourism Impact for the Cape

The team behind Cape Winelands Airport says it’s building more than just a runway - it’s creating an economic engine for the region.

Positioned at the crossroads of tourism, agribusiness, and logistics, the new airport aims to spark job creation, boostsupply chains, and open up new tourism opportunities across the Cape.

In a bid to put the project on the global map, the airport team recently attended Routes World 2025 in Hong Kong, where they met with airlines and investors to generate international interest. It’s all part of a broader push to connect the Winelands directly with global travel routes — and turn the area into a powerful gateway for growth.

If all timelines and approvals are met, passenger operations could start by 2028, relieving pressure on Cape Town International Airport and opening a new gateway for visitors heading directly into the Winelands.

Hal itu disampaikan oleh Wakil Direktur Utama Pertamina, Oki Muraza.

Menurut Oki, sejumlah inovasi energi hijau yang telah diluncurkan perusahaan, di antaranya Pertamax Green, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), dan Renewable Diesel (RD).

“Pertamina tidak hanya berfokus pada ketahanan energi nasional, tetapi juga berperan aktif menurunkan emisi dan menciptakan ekosistem energi yang lebih hijau,” ujar Oki, dikutip dari KabarBUMN, Minggu (12/10/2025).

Oki menjelaskan, inovasi pertama yakni Pertamax Green 95 yang kini telah beredar secara nasional. Bahan bakar ini memiliki RON 95 dengan kandungan sulfur di bawah 50 ppm (Euro IV).

Menggunakan bioetanol sebagai bahan campuran, Pertamax Green 95 tidak hanya membantu menekan ketergantungan terhadap impor bensin, tetapi juga menggerakkan ekonomi lokal berbasis energi terbarukan.

“Pertamina mencatat, penggunaan bioetanol dalam negeri dapat mensubstitusi bensin impor sehingga mampu mengurangi defisit neraca perdagangan impor bensin yang saat ini setara USD 12,4 miliar (Rp200 triliun), menurunkan emisi karbon sektor transportasi, serta menggerakkan ekonomi untuk para petani,” terang Oki.

Inovasi berikutnya adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), bahan bakar pesawat ramah lingkungan berbasis minyak jelantah. Pertamina sukses memproduksi SAF yang telah digunakan dalam penerbangan Pelita Air rute Jakarta–Bali pada 20 Agustus 2025.

Pencapaian ini menempatkan Pertamina sebagai satu-satunya produsen SAF co-processing di ASEAN, dengan rantai pasok terintegrasi mulai dari pengumpulan minyak jelantah hingga pemanfaatan oleh maskapai nasional.

Produk SAF tersebut juga telah memperoleh sertifikasi International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) dan terbukti mampu menurunkan emisi karbon penerbangan hingga 84%.

“Teknologi SAF ini sepenuhnya dikembangkan oleh insinyur dalam negeri, membuktikan kapasitas Indonesia sebagai regional champion energi hijau,” tegas Oki.

Di sektor bahan bakar diesel, Pertamina juga terus memimpin inovasi melalui penerapan B40, yakni program biodiesel dengan campuran 40% bahan nabati, yang saat ini merupakan tingkat tertinggi di dunia.

“Program Biodiesel B40 Indonesia merupakan yang tertinggi di dunia, sehingga Indonesia dapat sepenuhnya mandiri dalam pemenuhan kebutuhan solar domestik,” tambah Oki.

Selain itu, Pertamina turut mengembangkan Renewable Diesel (RD), bahan bakar nabati hasil hidrogenasi minyak sawit. Produk ini memiliki sejumlah keunggulan dibandingkan biodiesel konvensional, seperti stabilitas oksidasi yang lebih baik, tidak mudah menyerap air, serta efisiensi pembakaran yang lebih optimal.

Dengan berbagai inovasi tersebut, Pertamina menegaskan posisinya sebagai motor penggerak transisi energi nasional, sekaligus membuktikan peran penting BUMN energi dalam menciptakan masa depan yang lebih hijau dan berkelanjutan.

«La Universidad es clave, tiene un papel preponderante en adelantarse a aquello que se va a hacer en 20 años», resumió el representante de Airbus.","La segunda sesión del ciclo de Transición Ecológica organizado por el diario LA RAZÓN se centró en específico en la revolución energética que se está llevando a cabo a nivel mundial . Esta transformación puede llevar a Andalucía a cotas de liderazgo como exportadora de energía gracias a las innovaciones en materias de combustibles sostenibles como el Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) o el hidrógeno verde, además de la producción eléctrica proveniente de renovables como la energía solar y eólica.

Para abordar todas estas cuestiones, este segundo encuentro contó con la participación de representantes del mundo de la aviación comercial, con la presencia de Ricardo Rojas, presidente de Aviones Comerciales de Airbus en España. En el plano de las energías y combustibles renovables, destacó la presencia de Carlos Ayuso, director de Proyectos y procesos de innovación de Moeve. Germán López, por parte del Corporación Tecnológica de Andalucía (CTA), aportó la visión del conglomerado empresarial andaluz; además de Javier Hidalgo, director de desarrollo de Inerco, empresa especializada en gestión y tecnologías para el desarrollo industrial sostenible. Por último, la cita tuvo representación institucional de la mano de Antonio Posadas Chinchilla secretario general de Investigación e Innovación de la Consejería de Universidad, Investigación e Innovación de la Junta de Andalucía.

Fue especialmente revelador conocer de primera mano los innovadores avances del mundo de la aviación comercial personificados en los nuevos modelos de avión de Airbus, los «Extra Long Range» o XLR que, como su propio nombre indica, son capaces de cubrir distancias largas y tienen un consumo medio de combustible por asiento un 30% menor con respecto a los aviones de la generación anterior. Iberia fue la aerolínea de lanzamiento de este avión, que ya es una realidad desde el pasado año. Además, tal y como explicó Ricardo Rojas, la compañía ya trabaja en modelos con motores nuevos que permitan un aprovechamiento más eficiente de la energía de las turbinas en las partes electrificadas de la aeronave. «Una de las prioridades es la renovación de la flota con aviones de nueva generación, que son un 25 por ciento más eficientes que los de la anterior. Ahora mismo un 65 por ciento de los aviones en servicio son de fabricación más antigua y la idea es reemplazarlos gradualmente y que los combustibles sostenibles vayan adquiriendo un mayor protagonismo», explicó el presidente de Airbus, quien añadió que toda la flota Airbus está acondicionada para volar desde ya con un 50% de combustible SAF y para 2030 se espera haber alcanzado el 100 por cien. El uso de hidrógeno verde es todavía prematuro, pero es uno de los pilares futuros en materia de sostenibilidad para Airbus, que contempla otras prioridades como la mejora del control del tráfico aéreo como otra variante para cumplir con los objetivos de reducción de emisiones.

Para Moeve, en palabras de Carlos Ayuso, las prioridades están claras: ser una empresa que lidere el apoyo a la transición energética, para lo cual se está trabajando en proyectos «mil millonarios» como el Valle de Hidrógeno y la planta de combustibles bio, ambos en Andalucía. «La gente no tiene interiorizado el gran esfuerzo que hay que hacer, tenemos un sistema que gira en torno a combustibles fósiles; para cambiar eso vamos a necesitar mucha colaboración, también pública», advirtió sobre la transición ecológica que está en marcha.

Precisamente ahí entra en juego la Administración y su apuesta por la innovación tecnológica, algo que en el caso andaluz es una realidad tal y como defendió el secretario Posadas: «Fue un acierto del presidente Moreno incluir innovación en la Consejería junto a la Universidad. Nos creemos la innovación de cabo a rabo, somos profesores universitarios y la tenemos interiorizada», aseveró, al tiempo que hizo alusión a los diversos proyectos que la Junta de Andalucía está liderando en materia de innovación para iniciativas rurales, en el sector aeroespacial con la implementación de un cluster específico o en el trabajo con pequeñas y medianas empresas para que éstas tengan también acceso a las últimas novedades técnicas.

«No somos conscientes de la revolución que la descarbonización supone, el cambio es una absoluta revolución, para los que trabajamos en esto resulta apasionante, pero el ecosistema tiene tantas piezas que tenemos un riesgo, tenemos por delante un puzle gigantesco y hay que ir adecuando las piezas progresivamente», apuntó por su parte el representante de Inerco, quien coincidió en que el impulso a la innovación por parte de la Junta de Andalucía esta siendo «clave».

Por su parte, Germán López advirtió de los pasos que hay que dar en materia de descarbonización pero desde CTA avisan: «Los números tienen que dar, tiene que ser algo progresivo, la transformación verde no puede significar el perjuicio económico, hay que intentar que las empresas hagan innovaciones que lleguen en el lapso de tiempo más breve posible al mercado». En esto coincidió con Rojas, quien defiende que la cuarta revolución en que está inmerso el mundo de la aviación, la de la sostenibilidad, habrá de serlo a nivel de emisiones y económica.

Según Carlos Ayuso, en el objetivo europeo para conseguir la independencia energética gracias a energías limpias, jugarán un papel fundamental la movilidad sostenible, ahí será importantísima la consolidación del SAF y el uso de hidrógeno verde, pero también la circularidad: «Generamos una cantidad enorme de residuos, más del 50 por ciento acaba en vertederos, queremos ser capaces de aprovechar ese potencial reutilizando el desperdicio», aseveró. En esa línea, desde Moeve están promoviendo el trabajo innovativo de pequeñas y medianas empresas mediante proyectos como «Moeve Light Up», una iniciativa a través de la cual han sido seleccionadas diez startups locales que presentaron proyectos pensados para colaborar con la descarbonización y otros ámbitos del cuidado medioambiental: «Vamos a dotarles de una inyección económica, proyectos que se alargarán hasta 18 meses en algunos casos y les hemos abierto nuestros centros de innovación así como puesto en contacto con nuestras áreas comerciales para que conozcan mejor las demandas del mercado», explicó el director de proyectos de la compañía.

Otro actor principal en este juego es la Universidad andaluza, que ahora parece estar resurgiendo de sus cenizas como ave fénix: «La Universidad ha tenido un periodo complicado, desde 2010 no ha propuesto nuevos títulos adaptadas a nuestro tiempo. El año pasado conseguimos poner de acuerdo a todos los rectores para sacar un catálogo de 188 titulaciones, más del 50 por ciento en el ámbito de la tecnología y la ciencia», reveló el secretario de Innovación quien añadió que ahora sí, las universidades de la comunidad están preparadas para las demandas que exigen las compañías andaluzas, más aún con la reciente reforma universitaria anunciada por el Gobierno de Juanma Moreno. «La Universidad es clave, tiene un papel preponderante en adelantarse a aquello que se va a hacer en 20 años», resumió el representante de Airbus.","https://fotografias-2.larazon.es/clipping/cmsimages02/2025/10/11/D600FE7B-0510-4FE9-8C5F-EF06CDD05536/segunda-mesa-ciclo-transicion-ecologica-organizado-razon_69.jpg?crop=4530,2548,x0,y0&width=1280&height=720&optimize=low&format=jpg",N,,2025-10-12 00:56:10.053118

Agung menekankan bahwa pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan tidak hanya menjadi kisah sukses ekonomi, tetapi juga perjalanan ekologi yang bermakna.

“Ini bukan hanya perjalanan sukses dalam hal ekonomi karena menciptakan penghematan devisa yang signifikan bagi negara, tetapi juga sebagai perjalanan ekologi. Menempatkan prinsip Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) sebagai inti adalah sesuatu yang sangat berarti,” ujar Agung.

Ia menjelaskan, keberhasilan penerapan program biodiesel sejak B20 hingga B40 telah memberikan dampak besar terhadap kemandirian energi nasional. “Sejak penerapan B20 dan kini B40, Indonesia telah mampu memenuhi kebutuhan energi dalam negeri dengan sumber daya yang lebih berkelanjutan,” lanjutnya.

Lebih jauh, Agung menyoroti inovasi Pertamina dalam mengembangkan SAF dari minyak jelantah. Bahan bakar ini mampu menurunkan emisi karbon hingga 84 persen dan mendorong terciptanya ekonomi sirkular.

“Kami telah menggunakan SAF itu dari minyak goreng masyarakat untuk terbang. Jadi ini bukan hanya tentang mengurangi emisi karbon, tetapi juga bagian dari ekonomi sirkular karena masyarakat dapat menukar minyak jelantah menjadi rupiah, yang kemudian diolah menjadi bahan bakar berkelanjutan dan efisien,” jelasnya.

Menurut Agung, keberhasilan pengembangan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan merupakan bagian penting dari transformasi energi nasional. Program ini memperkuat ketahanan energi, membuka lapangan kerja baru di sektor energi hijau, serta mendukung target Net Zero Emission (NZE) 2060. “Ini adalah perjalanan transformasi Pertamina untuk mendukung agenda nasional mengenai bahan bakar nabati. Langkah ini menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia mampu menjadi pelopor energi bersih di kawasan Asia Tenggara,” tegasnya.

Sebagai perusahaan energi nasional, Pertamina terus berkomitmen mendukung pencapaian target NZE 2060 dengan mendorong program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Seluruh langkah ini sejalan dengan penerapan prinsip ESG di seluruh lini bisnis dan operasi perusahaan.(*)",https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/10/12/id_1434323/1434323_720.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:56:55.234210

Ia juga menilai keberhasilan pengembangan SAF perlu didukung kebijakan pemerintah, mengingat potensi bahan bakar berkelanjutan ini tidak hanya untuk Indonesia, tetapi juga kawasan regional.
Selain SAF, Pertamina juga mengembangkan sumber energi rendah karbon lain seperti hidrogen hijau, melalui proyek percontohan di Ulubelu, Lampung.
Sementara itu, transformasi Pertamina dijalankan melalui dual growth strategy atau strategi pertumbuhan ganda.","JAKARTA, investor.id – PT Pertamina (Persero) membeberkan kunci transformasi menuju energi bersih. Pihaknya memandang, kuncinya terletak pada pembentukan ekosistem terintegrasi yang menghubungkan inovasi, kolaborasi, dan keberlanjutan untuk mempercepat peralihan menuju energi rendah karbon di Indonesia.

Direktur Transformasi dan Keberlanjutan Bisnis PT Pertamina (Persero) Agung Wicaksono mencontohkan penerapan pendekatan tersebut dalam pengembangan bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan (sustainable aviation fuel/ SAF) yang dihasilkan melalui kolaborasi antara Pertamina Patra Niaga, Kilang Pertamina Internasional, dan Pelita Air Service.

“Ke depan, bagaimana memastikan transformasi ini benar-benar terjadi? Kuncinya adalah dengan pendekatan ekosistem,” papar Agung dalam panel diskusi di Indonesia International Sustainability Forum (IISF), Jakarta, Sabtu (11/10/2025).

Dalam pengembangan SAF, Pertamina Patra Niaga bertugas mengumpulkan minyak jelantah dari masyarakat. Kilang Pertamina Internasional kemudian memprosesnya di kilang hijau (green refinery) menjadi SAF, sedangkan Pelita Air Service menggunakannya sebagai bahan bakar untuk penerbangan dari Jakarta ke Denpasar.

Agung mengatakan inisiatif itu tidak hanya menekan emisi karbon hingga 84%, tetapi juga mendorong ekonomi sirkular. Sebab, masyarakat dapat menukarkan minyak jelantah dengan insentif ekonomi yang bernilai.

Ia juga menilai keberhasilan pengembangan SAF perlu didukung kebijakan pemerintah, mengingat potensi bahan bakar berkelanjutan ini tidak hanya untuk Indonesia, tetapi juga kawasan regional.

Selain SAF, Pertamina juga mengembangkan sumber energi rendah karbon lain seperti hidrogen hijau, melalui proyek percontohan di Ulubelu, Lampung.

Fasilitas tersebut akan menjadi yang pertama yang mengintegrasikan teknologi elektrolisis membran modern (anion exchange membrane/ AEM) dengan energi panas bumi sebagai sumber listrik bersih. “Kami menargetkan fasilitas ini beroperasi tahun depan. Dan kami juga bekerja sama dengan Toyota (dalam proyek pengembangan hidrogen hijau ini),” bebernya.

Di samping itu, Pertamina turut memperkuat dekarbonisasi di sektor hulu (upstream) yang memiliki potensi terbesar dalam pengurangan emisi karbon.

Agung menjelaskan, perusahaan tengah menyiapkan sejumlah proyek percontohan carbon capture and storage (CCS) serta carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) di wilayah Cekungan Sunda Asri, Gundih, dan Sukowati. Teknologi ini tidak hanya menekan emisi, tetapi juga dapat dimanfaatkan untuk meningkatkan produksi minyak melalui enhanced oil recovery.

Sementara itu, transformasi Pertamina dijalankan melalui dual growth strategy atau strategi pertumbuhan ganda. Di satu sisi, perusahaan tetap mengoptimalkan bisnis existing di sektor minyak dan gas serta pengolahan kilang untuk menjaga profitabilitas.

“Transformasi tidak akan terjadi jika hanya berfokus pada bisnis existing. Karena itu, mesin kedua dalam strategi pertumbuhan ganda kami adalah pengembangan bisnis rendah karbon,” kata dia.

Melalui pendekatan ekosistem dan strategi ganda tersebut, Pertamina pun berupaya menyeimbangkan pertumbuhan ekonomi dengan agenda dekarbonisasi untuk mempercepat transisi menuju masa depan energi yang lebih bersih dan berkelanjutan.",https://img2.beritasatu.com/cache/investor/960x620-w/2025/10/1760184194-800x533.webp,N,,2025-10-11 22:57:03.756040

Salah satu bentuk sinergi nyata adalah kolaborasi dengan perusahaan Eropa seperti Unilever, yang memanfaatkan minyak sawit PalmCo untuk menghasilkan produk asam lemak bernilai tinggi. “Langkah ini memperlihatkan bagaimana hilirisasi sawit mampu meningkatkan nilai tambah sekaligus memperkuat rantai pasok berkelanjutan,” kata Denis.

Tak hanya soal hilirisasi, perhatian Uni Eropa juga tertuju pada inisiatif energi terbarukan yang dijalankan PalmCo. Proyek Compressed Biogas (CBG) dan pengembangan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) dinilai sejalan dengan agenda transisi energi hijau global.“Kami menyambut baik inovasi PalmCo dalam energi hijau, termasuk penggunaan hidrogen, yang merupakan bagian dari strategi energi bersih Uni Eropa,” tambah Denis.

Namun, di balik teknologi dan investasi besar, Denis menekankan satu hal penting: kesejahteraan petani sawit rakyat harus menjadi fondasi utama keberlanjutan.

General Electric's Large Aero Engine Competitor In competition with the Trent XWB is the world's other enormous and highly efficient aero engine: General Electric's GE9X.","There are countless reasons that the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB is the ideal engine for the A350. Rolls-Royce describes it as: ""extremely efficient, impressively versatile, ultra-reliable, unbelievably popular."" The manufacturer believes that its many years exclusively powering the A350 are proof of these characteristics.

As such, there is no single reason that Airbus selected the engine to power the A350, beyond the simple fact that they have reached an exclusivity agreement with the manufacturer. Discover more below about the host of advancements offered by the Trent XWB, and how it continues to develop based on lessons from over a decade of operation. Then learn how General Electric and Boeing aim to compete with the GE9X and the 777X, the world's largest aircraft engine.

Trent XWB Facilitates Leading Widebody Efficiency

Airbus claims that the Trent XWB is the most efficient large aero engine in the skies. Compared to the first Trent engine, it has a 15% lower fuel consumption, helping A350s achieve a 25% lower total fuel burn compared to aircraft of the previous generation. This yields a reduction in operating costs of $2.9 million per year, primarily due to fuel savings, helping airlines using the A350 achieve greater profits, which is essential in an industry with such narrow margins.

The greater efficiency also allows the engine to operate more quietly. That means less noise pollution for those on the ground and a quieter cabin for those onboard.

Rolls-Royce attributes the leading efficiency of its jets to lessons learned over 30 years of developing the Trent engine family. During this time, they have begun to use better and lighter materials and build jets with higher bypass ratios.

Superb Versatility

Rolls-Royce claims that the Trent XWB powers 700 routes and has operated from 127 cities. This isn't just a broad selection of routes, as there is also real quality here. For example, since November 2020, Trent XWB engines have powered the world's longest active commercial flight: Singapore Airlines Flights 23 and 24. Using an Airbus A350-900ULR, this route covers 8,288 nautical miles in 18 hours and 40 minutes.

Simultaneously, Trent XWB engines are also used for exceptionally short routes. For example, A350s fly the short hop from Kilimanjaro Airport to Zanzibar, taking around 90 minutes.

The table below includes the key specifications for the Trent XWB's smaller -84 variant. It uses EASA data:

The jet's versatility is further aided by its record-breaking ETOPS capabilities. In 2014, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency certified the jet for 370 minutes of ETOPS operations. Beyond helping the A350 to be a safer jet, the ETOPS capabilities also allow the plane to reach its destination faster. That is because it can plot a straighter course for lengthy transoceanic flights, as emergency diversions can be over six hours of flight time away.

The Trent XWB Fended Off General Electric Competition

Rolls-Royce's exclusive partnership with Airbus on the A350 was not always guaranteed. General Electric has been trying to force its way into powering the aircraft family since May 2009, when they suggested offering the 787's GEnx for the A350 (-800 and -900). The manufacturer has also stated that it could develop a product that outperforms the Trent XWB. This is likely just bluster, as it has said it won't develop such an engine, as it would be in direct competition with GE90-115B-powered 777 variants. Any deals to power Airbus widebody jets would put its relationship with Boeing at risk.

Such suggestions from General Electric have now been rendered meaningless, as Reuters has reported that Rolls-Royce has extended its exclusive deal until 2030. The deal came at the perfect time in 2021, as Rolls-Royce had just disclosed a record $5.6 billion 2020 loss.

​​​​​Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Warren East told reporters why the deal was so important for the firm: ""We're already exclusive on the A350-1000, and extending our position on the -900 variant, that accounts for the bulk of the A350 fleet, out to 2030 is in line with the development timeline for our next generation UltraFan engine programme.""

The Trent XWB Continues To Develop

Another reason that Trent XWB engines have continued to be popular is the constant improvement sought by Rolls-Royce. In April 2025, Airbus' Newsroom reported that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had certified the A350-900 with the new Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 Enhanced Performance (EP) engine. This engine came with a host of improvements based on a decade of Trent XWB operations. These included a better fan and compressor, alongside developed turbine aerodynamics and turbine blade cooling. Combined, the developments yielded a 1% improvement in fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. That sounds small, but it adds up to a sizable development in the context of A350 flights that can be longer than ten hours. It could also push the A350's range further still, allowing airlines to serve new city pairs. Further environmental improvements stem from the fact that this engine can be operated with 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and is a step towards 100% SAF use.

Julien Puyou, Airbus’ Head of Widebody Programme, said: ""Together with our partner Rolls-Royce, this latest evolution underscores our joint commitment to continuous improvement and innovation. The Trent XWB-84 is already among the most efficient widebody engines on the market and this enhanced version will deliver even greater performance and efficiency for our airline customers.”

Pete Young, Chief Engineer, shared similar sentiments regarding the Trent XWB-84 EP: ""What excites me most is that we’ve continued to innovate and make it even better in every way with this new standard. Certification is a defining moment for our team, its testament to their expertise and dedication, and the culmination of hard work.""

General Electric's Large Aero Engine Competitor

In competition with the Trent XWB is the world's other enormous and highly efficient aero engine: General Electric's GE9X. This engine is the largest aircraft engine ever built. The engine will power the 777X when it is eventually delivered. At first glance, with its gigantic size and unmatched power, the GE9X appears to be about brute force and generating as much thrust as possible. However, it matches Rolls-Royce's use of advanced composite materials and an extremely high bypass ratio to be a surprisingly light and efficient engine. These attributes help the GE9X to achieve a 10% greater fuel efficiency than the GE90.

The table below includes critical specifications for the GE9X based on Federal Aviation Administration data:

Rolls-Royce's engine benefits from over a decade of commercial operations. During this time, countless customers have shown that the engine performs well and is reliable. The same cannot be said for the GE9X due to the delays that continue to plague the 777X. As such, it is currently impossible to make a true judgment about how the GE9X will stack up against either Trent XWB variant. This space is well worth watching when the 777X comes into service in 2027.

The Trent XWB For The A350F Is Coming

Airbus names its A350F the only true new freighter that meets the latest ICAO CO2 emissions standards and is set for release in the second half of 2027, later than the initially planned 2026. Part of the expected strong emissions' performance is down to the fact that Rolls-Royce is further optimizing the XWB engine for freighter use. The A350F will utilize the XWB-97, which will contribute to a freighter with superior range and payload compared to its competitors. The manufacturer writes: ""Based on the A350 programme, the A350F delivers more payload, more range and more volume compared to the 777F, all comforting its position as the only future-proof choice for operators today.""

The XWB-97 features a range of improvements over the XWB-84 that will make it ideal for the A350F. Its fan runs 6% faster than the -84. To deal with the extra air flow, the -97's combustion chamber has been strengthened and made able to withstand higher temperatures. The result is improved thrust. The XWB-97 also uses compressor blisk technology that yields 15% module weight savings.

You may have already flown on an aircraft powered by the XWB-97, as it is used on the A350-1000. This engine has made a mark for its impressive versatility, capable of operating efficiently for flights ranging from 45 minutes to 16 hours. The engine is also behind Qantas' Project Sunrise flights from Australia to New York and London, which could take 20 hours.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/the-real-reason-why-rolls-royce-owns-the-airbus-a350-engine-slot.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-11 17:56:48.907431

Not long after, Budget 2026 revealed that the government intends to support the establishment of flights between Dublin Airport and Derry City Airport.

The Dublin Airport Authority said it welcomed remarks from Darragh O’Brien that long-term planning should accommodate a Dublin Airport capable of serving up to 60 million passengers per year.

In thirty years, Irish aviation emissions have grown 500%.

A key reason for this is the massive subsidies the sector receives while inflicting increasing pollution and climate damage.

As minister for transport, Darragh O’Brien is representing the needs of the aviation sector to expand and the demands of businesses to maintain growth. But he also has a responsibility to address a climate that is spiralling out of control along with ecosystem collapse.

Forgetting about climate

What has Minister O’Brien done to meet those obligations since he was appointed as minister for climate and environment in January 2025?

Emissions savings from improved fuel efficiency have been wiped out by the explosion of the aviation sector, with no real path outlined towards major emissions reductions other than a vague gesture towards sustainable aviation fuels that currently meet less than 1% of the global demand for aviation fuel and is nearly three times as expensive as its fossil fuel equivalent.

The prevailing attitude that Dublin Airport’s connectivity is an essential prerequisite to economic resilience denies the reality of its escalating contribution to climate change – a factor that Minister for Climate Darragh O’Brien seems to have been able to put to one side.

We the consumers are willing participants in the denial as we continue to pack our bags and avail of cheap flights to the hotspots of Europe at every opportunity.

The climate may be spiralling out of control, but the vast majority of us block our ears to that whispering message in our brain – telling us as we book our flights that we are part of the problem.

In ‘The Lie of the Land,’ environmental activist John Gibbons suggests that if you are looking for signs of meaningful action to tackle the climate emergency, the one place you won’t find it is aviation:

“Jet kerosene for commercial aviation is exempt from both excise and carbon taxes in the EU. On top of these lavish subsidies, the Irish state pours significant resources into aviation including €35.6 million in regional airport funding in Budget 2023. What’s more, airline tickets are VAT exempt in the EU as is aircraft leasing – providing further hidden subsidies to the sector.”

Aviation fuel tax and carbon tax

Gibbons suggests that to bring aviation in line with the urgent need to cut carbon emissions, transport fuels should be taxed globally as with any other transport fuel. Added to that hefty carbon taxes should be applied to reflect the true cost of flying.

Additionally, Gibbons suggests a solution to the gross overuse of aviation by a small minority would be to introduce a system of flight rationing. The system he proposes would see each individual allocated a certain distance annually, say 1,750km (equivalent to a return flight from Dublin to Paris) that would be tied to your PPS or passport number.

If you took another flight, your next 1,750 km would come with a €250 climate levy, with the levy doubling with each additional round trip: €500, €1,000, €2,000 and so on.

“Eventually the cost will deter even the wealthy,” Gibbons concludes. “Properly managed it would be hugely effective in clipping the wings of frequent flyers.”

Not something that Minister for Climate Darragh O’Brien seems to keen on.

In terms of public transport, Director of Friends of the Environment Tony Lowes recently highlighted a “funding gap” for Public Services Obligations (PSO) of €250 million.

The PSO requires Government to ensure funding for essential routes, that are not commercially successful, especially in rural areas including Bus Connects and the “connecting Ireland rural mobility plan”, the Young Adult Card and the 90 minute fare free child fares.

The Department of Transport proposals to fund these projects include an increase in public transport fares, cutting public transport services or taking €250 million away from National Development Plan infrastructure projects.

Lowes suggests that an alternative would be to “reinstate the €10 tax on airline tickets imposed by minister for transport, Noel Dempsey in 2009 but cancelled by this successor Leo Varadkar in 2014.”

Lowes highlights how Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe who do not impose an airline tax. Even the United States imposes a passenger facility charge of about €37 that increases according to distance.

The UK imposes a €15 tax on passengers for short haul flights, which is due to increase in April 2026. The increase will include a 50 per cent increase on private jets – from €673 to €1,141.

“Restoring the air travel tax could meet the funding gap required to maintain our Government’s commitment to public transport,” suggests Lowes, “and would be a step towards climate justice.”

I wonder what the minister for climate, the environment and transport thinks of that suggestion.

A sign that the government is going in the opposite direction is that commencement of a new “Dublin-Derry airlink” in 2026 was among the budgetary measures announced by the Government on Tuesday in Budget 2026.

Were the impacts of aviation-induced greenhouse gas emissions considered in weighing up the decision to move ahead with air travel between the two cities?

Balancing priorities

An EAT-Lancet Commission report released earlier this month acknowledged that the relationship between food systems and emissions is very challenging, but that there is a get-out-of-jail card if we are prepared to take it on.

As ever, the answer lies in where we see our priorities – short term economic protectories or long term economic, and ecosystem sustainability.

Food systems are the single biggest contributor to the transgression of planetary boundaries that place our carefully balanced ecosystems at risk of collapse.

In Ireland, agrifood is the source of almost 38% of total national greenhouse gas emissions – by far our largest single contributor and the sector most resistant to doing its fair share on emissions reductions, an industry that employs 6.4% of our workforce and accounts for just 6.7% of the gross national income and 9% of exports.

The good news is that concerted global efforts to transform food systems could bring us back within planetary boundaries and slice annual greenhouse gas emissions from food systems by more than half.

Johan Rockström, Commission Co-Chair and Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research outlines how the report sets out the clearest guidance yet for feeding a growing population without breaching the safe operating space on Earth set by planetary boundaries.

“By uniting the latest science, it shows that what we put on our plates can save millions of lives, cut billions of tonnes of emissions, halt the loss of biodiversity, and create a fairer food system.

“The evidence is undeniable: transforming food systems is not only possible, it’s essential to securing a safe, just and sustainable future for all.”

Has Darragh O’Brien reflected on the recommendations of the EAT Lancet report or has he allowed it to pass by? Has he read the report, or even the executive summary?

A minister with responsibilities for both climate and transport must be factoring in the former when making decisions about the latter. If this minister isn’t prepared to strike that balance, then perhaps he should hand the portfolio to someone who is.

After years of blindness caused by cataracts, the pair have had both their sight and lives restored, thanks to a 15-minute cataract surgery aboard the Africa Mercy, the hospital ship operated by international charity Mercy Ships.

At 80 years old, Marie Jeanne had endured immense loss. Seven of her eight children had passed away, and her last solace came from weaving raffia mats and hats—a comfort that was taken from her when blindness struck three years ago. Soon after, her daughter Germaine began losing her vision as well, leaving her unable to farm or care for her children.

“If I had a weak faith, I might have given up,” Germaine shared.

Their journey to healing began when a relative heard about Mercy Ships’ free cataract surgeries on the radio. Hope rekindled, the two travelled from their remote village to Toamasina, where they were welcomed aboard the Africa Mercy. On the same day, both underwent the simple yet transformative procedure.

Their surgeon, Dr Guy Chevalley, recalled, “Their cataracts were so advanced that their pupils were no longer black, but completely white.”

Ella Hawthorne, Ophthalmic Programme Manager with Mercy Ships, added, “They could only see movement, just a hand waving in front of them. That was it.”

The morning after surgery, with eye patches removed, mother and daughter looked at each other clearly for the first time in years. Tears of joy followed.

“We no longer live in darkness,” said Marie Jeanne. “Our eyes can see, and our hearts are full of happiness!”

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 2.2 billion peopleglobally have vision impairment or blindness, with at least 1 billion cases preventable or yet to be addressed. Cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where access to affordable eye care and trained specialists is limited.

Reflecting on the moment, Hawthorne said, “It was very emotional to see their happiness when the patches came off at the same time. What a blessing it is to help this family. To see someone truly, to spend time with them and having that taken away and then restored is incredibly special.”

With her sight restored, Marie Jeanne has returned to weaving raffia mats and hats with renewed joy. Germaine is back to farming, actively participating in her church, and caring for her children.

Their restored vision symbolises more than medical recovery—it represents renewed dignity, independence, and hope for the future.",https://newstrends.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blind-Mother-and-Daughter-Look-into-Each-Others-Eyes-for-the-First-Time-in-Years.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 15:57:10.972137

Climate action remains a central pillar of the Fund’s work. The Climate Action Window (CAW) successfully mobilised $442 million, with 99 per cent of new projects integrating climate resilience measures. The Fund has also strengthened its response to fragility and conflict by applying a dedicated “fragility lens” across all operations.

Promoting Gender Equality and Youth Empowerment

The report reaffirms the Fund’s focus on gender inclusion and youth empowerment. All ADF-supported projects are now classified using a gender marker, with 96 per cent of new projects incorporating gender equality components. In 2024 alone, the Fund created more than 290,000 jobs for young people aged between 15 and 35.

“Together, with ambition and solidarity, let us engage with Africa’s youth to forge a new chapter of growth, resilience, and shared prosperity,” said Dr Sidi Ould Tah, President of the African Development Bank Group. “This is a defining moment. The African Development Fund stands ready to meet Africa’s aspirations, leveraging strategic partnerships and innovation for speed, scale, and impact.”

Under this partnership, SAF will be supplied and refueled directly at Aalborg Airport, leveraging existing airport infrastructure and ensuring seamless integration into daily flight operations.

This collaboration not only supports the technical deployment of SAF but also strengthens Denmark’s broader sustainability efforts within the aviation sector. The partnership serves as a model for other European countries, demonstrating that collaboration between airlines, airports, and fuel providers is essential for the adoption of clean aviation technologies.

Aalborg–Copenhagen Route: High Frequency, High Impact

The Aalborg–Copenhagen route is one of Denmark’s busiest domestic connections, with approximately 4,100 annual flights and 800,000 seats provided by Norwegian. By integrating SAF into such a high-demand route, the airline proves the practical viability of sustainable fuel solutions for high-frequency operations, a critical consideration for scaling eco-friendly aviation across Europe.

This route is expected to set a benchmark for environmental performance in domestic air travel and inspire other airlines to consider SAF adoption on major European routes.

A Bold Step Toward European Aviation Sustainability

Sara Neergaard, Director of Communications and Public Affairs, Norwegian Denmark, described the initiative as a “bold and necessary step” in demonstrating how aviation can reduce its carbon footprint. She emphasized that Norwegian aims to lead the way in sustainable practices and hopes the initiative encourages other European carriers to follow suit.

By showcasing SAF integration on a busy domestic corridor, Norwegian is providing a proof of concept for other airlines and governments, underlining that carbon reduction in aviation is achievable today, not just in theory.

Aalborg Airport’s Role in Advancing Sustainable Travel

Niels Hemmingsen, CEO of Aalborg Airport, highlighted the importance of the initiative: “This route proves that sustainability and aviation are not mutually exclusive. The collaboration demonstrates that real change is possible here and now.”

By facilitating SAF refueling, Aalborg Airport is playing a key role in enabling low-carbon aviation. This effort strengthens the airport’s position as a regional leader in green aviation infrastructure and highlights how airports can actively contribute to national and European sustainability goals.

PT Pertamina (Persero) memperkuat komitmennya dalam mendukung transisi energi berkelanjutan melalui pengembangan berbagai produk rendah karbon. Upaya ini menjadi bagian dari komitmen perusahaan untuk mempercepat terciptanya ekosistem energi yang lebih hijau, efisien, dan ramah lingkungan di kawasan regional.

Pada ajang Investor Daily Summit 2025 di Jakarta Convention Center (JCC), Kamis (9/10), Wakil Direktur Utama Pertamina, Oki Muraza, menjelaskan sejumlah inovasi energi rendah karbon yang telah dikembangkan, di antaranya Pertamax Green, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), dan Renewable Diesel (RD).

""Pertamina tidak hanya berfokus pada ketahanan energi nasional, tetapi juga berperan aktif menurunkan emisi dan menciptakan ekosistem energi yang lebih hijau,"" ujarnya dalam keterangan tertulis, Sabtu (11/10).

Salah satu produk unggulan adalah Pertamax Green 95, bahan bakar dengan RON 95 dan kandungan sulfur di bawah 50 ppm (Euro IV). Produk berbasis bioetanol ini mampu mengurangi ketergantungan impor bensin sekaligus memperkuat ekonomi lokal melalui pemanfaatan sumber energi terbarukan.

Menurut Oki, penggunaan bioetanol dalam negeri dapat mensubstitusi bensin impor dan membantu menekan defisit neraca perdagangan impor bahan bakar yang saat ini setara US$12,4 miliar atau sekitar Rp200 triliun. Selain itu, Pertamax Green juga mendukung pengurangan emisi karbon di sektor transportasi serta membuka peluang ekonomi baru bagi petani tebu.

Pertamina juga mengembangkan Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berbasis minyak jelantah yang pertama kali digunakan dalam penerbangan Pelita Air rute Jakarta-Bali pada 20 Agustus 2025. Inovasi ini menjadikan perusahaan sebagai satu-satunya produsen SAF co-processing di kawasan ASEAN, dengan rantai pasok yang melibatkan pengumpulan minyak jelantah hingga pemanfaatannya oleh maskapai nasional.

Produk SAF tersebut telah memperoleh sertifikasi International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) dan dapat menurunkan emisi karbon penerbangan hingga 84 persen.

""Teknologi SAF ini sepenuhnya dikembangkan oleh insinyur dalam negeri, membuktikan kapasitas Indonesia sebagai regional champion energi hijau,"" tegas Oki.

Di sektor diesel, Pertamina telah menerapkan program Biodiesel B40, yang saat ini menjadi campuran biodiesel tertinggi di dunia. Program ini mendorong kemandirian energi nasional sekaligus memperkuat ketahanan pasokan solar domestik.

Selain itu, Pertamina juga mengembangkan Renewable Diesel (RD), bahan bakar nabati hasil proses hidrogenasi minyak sawit. Produk ini memiliki stabilitas oksidasi yang lebih baik, tidak mudah menyerap air, serta menghasilkan efisiensi pembakaran yang lebih optimal dibandingkan biodiesel konvensional.

India is exporting trust through its digital public infrastructure like UPI and its emerging biofuel diplomacy. This initiative aims to promote clean energy and global cooperation. Following the success of fintech, India is now focusing on farmtech and green energy solutions. The Global Biofuels Alliance is a key part of this strategy.

In the same week that the Global Fintech Festival (GFF) wrapped up in Mumbai, headlines still echoed with India’s digital confidence. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharing the stage with the UK’s Prime Minister to foreign delegates applauding UPI’s reach across continents, India’s digital public infrastructure has turned into a new kind of diplomacy, an export of trust.

What began as a platform for seamless payments has become a global public good. UPI is now accepted in Singapore, UAE, Mauritius, France, Sri Lanka and even at European airports. It’s India’s cleanest export — an idea that travels faster than capital, carrying the credibility of a nation that solved financial inclusion at scale.

Now, India stands on the cusp of exporting another form of trust, not digital this time, but green. It’s called biofuel diplomacy, and if UPI helped the world transact cleanly, biofuels will help it breathe cleanly.

From fintech to farmtech: India’s new soft power

At GFF 2025, Prime Minister Modi spoke about bridging divides between urban and rural, rich, and poor, developed and developing. The same philosophy applies to India’s biofuel story. What began as a domestic policy to reduce oil imports has evolved into a platform for global cooperation, inclusion, and sustainability.

Live Events

Just as UPI turned every phone into a payment terminal, India’s ethanol program is turning every field into a clean energy source. Farmers who once waited for cane dues now see their produce powering mobility. Distilleries that once produced spirits now produce strategic energy.

And just like UPI’s open architecture became a blueprint for the world, India’s Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), launched during its G20 Presidency, is becoming the framework for sustainable fuel cooperation among 24 nations.

What UPI did for money, biofuel can do for energy

UPI Diplomacy

Biofuel DiplomacyExported payment technology to 10+ countriesExporting ethanol expertise and green energy ecosystemsEnabled transparent, cashless economyEnables carbon-neutral, import-light economyEmpowered small merchantsEmpowers small farmersBuilt global DPI standards at G20Built Global Biofuels Alliance at G20Reduced leakages and black moneyReduces crude imports and emissionsIndia became a trusted tech provider

India becomes a trusted clean-energy partner

In both cases, India isn’t selling a product; it’s offering a platform. A platform for cooperation, inclusion, and shared prosperity.

The numbers tell their own story

India’s ethanol blending program is one of the world’s fastest and most impactful clean energy transitions. In 2014, blending stood at just 1.5%. By 2025, it touched 20% (E20) five years ahead of schedule.

That single policy leap has saved Rs 24,300 crore in foreign exchange, substituted over 509 crore litres of petrol, and reduced 10.8 million tonnes of CO2 in 2022–23 alone.

Imagine this impact in everyday terms: what if 5.68 million cars were removed from the streets of Delhi for an entire year! That’s the carbon impact of India’s ethanol blending program in just one year (2022–23).

Or, think of it as trees: imagine planting 439 million trees covering nearly 2,925 square kilometres, almost twice the size of Delhi (197% of its area). That’s the equivalent carbon absorption of one year of India’s ethanol program.

Numbers like these turn climate diplomacy from theory into arithmetic. Simple, relatable, and measurable.

The diplomatic dimension: From sugarcane to statecraft

Biofuel diplomacy is the strategic use of clean fuel production, trade, and policy to build international relationships and achieve shared climate goals.

Brazil did it first, exporting ethanol technology across Latin America and Africa. The United States now exports nearly two billion gallons of ethanol annually to 80 countries. India, the newest entrant, is shaping its own model, rooted in inclusion and cooperation rather than competition.

When India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) at the 2023 G20 Summit, it sent a clear signal: green energy is not a race; it’s a relay. The baton must be passed, not hoarded.

With surplus ethanol capacity and innovations in second-generation (2G) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies, India can now help decarbonise not just its own roads, but also the world’s skies.

SEIC 2026: The GFF of bioenergy

If GFF 2025 showcased India’s fintech diplomacy, SEIC 2026 (Sugar, Ethanol & Bioenergy India Conference) to be held on February 5–6 at Yashobhoomi, New Delhi, will do the same for biofuel diplomacy.

The conference will convene ministers, ambassadors, global investors, and technology leaders from over 15 countries. Its dedicated ‘Ethanol and Bioenergy Track’ will explore how international energy cooperation can translate into trade, technology transfer, and climate finance, aligning closely with India’s Net Zero 2070 vision, the national commitment announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP26 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2070.

Participants include global institutions such as the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), IFGE, NSI, VSI, and ICT, alongside embassies from Brazil, Thailand, Indonesia, Germany, France, the UAE, and Denmark. Discussions will range from ethanol blending to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and from flex-fuel engines to carbon-credit markets; building the bridge between policy ambition and business execution.

If GFF proved India can lead the world in digital inclusion, SEIC 2026 aims to demonstrate that it can lead in decarbonisation inclusion; ensuring every nation, rich or poor, has access to cleaner energy pathways.

In many ways, the race for green-energy supremacy is unlike any other. Here, anyone coming out on top only makes the world a better place. The country that finishes second is not a loser, but a trailing champion; inspiring the next wave of emerging nations to follow. It is perhaps the only net-positive game in modern economic history where all major economies can win together.

A harmonisation is crucial for the success of the green energy revolution. Just as a QR code works anywhere, tomorrow a litre of certified green ethanol or SAF should power any engine, anywhere. Just as UPI connected nations through clean code; biofuel diplomacy will unite them through clean energy.

In today's aircraft, laminar flow is only partially achieved on the wings and fuselage, as the flow of air still comes across plenty of obstacles that disturb it, often resulting in turbulence and high drag.
The Phantom 3500, as far as I can get, is meant to be a lot more laminar flow-friendly than existing designs.
The focus, it seems, shifted to the Phantom 3500, which is supposed to begin flying operationally in 2030.
Remember how I said earlier that for the sake of laminar flow this thing has no windows?","The same goes for a Texas-based company called Otto Aerospace (or Otto Aviation). Established in 2008, this crew set out to revolutionize the business jet segment with something called laminar flow, an engineering solution that should be at the core of an aircraft known as the Phantom 3500.

What is laminar flow, you ask? The rigid, scientific definition tells us it's the orderly motion of fluids (air is a fluid) in parallel layers, undisturbed by each other or outside parties. In today's aircraft, laminar flow is only partially achieved on the wings and fuselage, as the flow of air still comes across plenty of obstacles that disturb it, often resulting in turbulence and high drag.

The Phantom 3500, as far as I can get, is meant to be a lot more laminar flow-friendly than existing designs. That's because it has no external interruptions (that means no rivets, panel gaps, and not even windows), it will be ultra-smooth on the exterior, and air flow should be effectively separated and maintained.

All of the above should reduce ""aerodynamic drag to levels never achieved in commercial aviation,"" and result in a significant decrease in fuel consumption and harmful emissions. Now, tell me who wouldn't want that?

Back in 2017, Otto started a three-year flight test program using a plane called the Celera 500 as a demonstrator. Powered by a RED A03 diesel piston engine capable of delivering 550 hp, it featured all the above-mentioned designed ideas on a body that looked more like a blue whale with wings than an actual aircraft – just like the Phantom 3500 will look like.

Over a period of three years, the Celera piloted aircraft flew over 50 times and stayed in the air for a combined 100 hours, trying to demonstrate full laminar flow aerodynamics characteristics. If we are to judge by what Otto is saying, that goal was achieved.

There are some numbers to back up that claim, and they say the Celera achieved 59 percent lower drag than other aircraft of the same size (it had a six-passenger capacity), and achieved near-jet speeds while burning only a fraction of the fuel, and that translated into 80 percent less operating costs.

Although it was initially designed for production in the mid-2020s, the Celera 500 has been retired, and Otto now claims the plane ""was never meant to be a production aircraft."" The focus, it seems, shifted to the Phantom 3500, which is supposed to begin flying operationally in 2030.

Not much is known about the plane at the time of writing, but the bits and pieces of info we were able to gather about it paint a pretty interesting picture. Supposedly, two Williams turbofan engines capable of producing 3,600 pounds of thrust each will be tasked with powering the plane, allowing it to reach a cruise speed of some 460 mph (740 kph).

The plane will be able to fly at maximum altitudes of 51,000 feet (15,544 meters), which is well above the usual height commercial aircraft reach during their flights. This, says Otto, should not only allow the Phantom to avoid traffic, weather, and turbulence, but it will also allow it to eat far less fuel. As an interesting side effect, flying so high also eliminates contrails from the equation.

The laminar flow plane should be capable of traveling for distances of up to 4,000 miles (6,500 km), which is enough to get you from New York to Berlin in one go.

During a single trip, compared to similarly sized aircraft is use today, the Phantom should experience a 35 percent reduction in drag, which in turn would translate into 60 percent less fuel burn. That leads to operating costs being cut in half. As a bonus, when Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is used, CO2 emissions should nosedive by 92 percent.

All of the above sounds interesting and all, but there is one other exciting aspect of this design. Remember how I said earlier that for the sake of laminar flow this thing has no windows? Well, their place will be taken by something called the SuperNatural Vision.

That would be a series of high-definition digital displays stretching the length of the plane on its sides, but also on the roof, apparently. The screens are used to show real-time external views, but aside from giving the cabin a shape unlike any other and the people inside incredible vistas, they also ""eliminate the structural and aerodynamic compromises of conventional windows.""",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/contrail-free-phantom-3500-laminar-flow-aircraft-looks-more-like-a-bullet-than-a-plane-258901_1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 11:57:38.947691

One of the most climate-conscious travel operators is axing carbon offsets as part of a new climate action plan worth €1.13 million a year.

Intrepid Travel, which has been carbon neutral since 2010 and is a certified B Corp, says it has failed to meet ""unreachable"" emission targets due to a lack of government action on renewable energy and sustainable aviation fuels.

In a joint statement, co-founder Darrel Wade and CEO James Thornton announced the company is now retiring its carbon offset program and Climate Active certification to focus on decarbonisation investment instead.

The duo say that while offsets once ""served an important purpose"", they no longer reflect the ""scale or immediacy of the challenge.""

Intrepid's climate action plan

Intrepid will now invest $2 million AUD (around €1.13 million) each year into immediate emissions reductions.

""This will include things like switching our owned and leased vehicles to EVs; investing in renewable energy in our hotels and offices; and sourcing lower-carbon fuel alternatives for transportation,"" the company says.

The tour operator will also work with more than 10,000 suppliers to decarbonise through renewable energy investments and electric vehicles (EVs).

It will also provide loans to suppliers in countries such as Nepal and India so they can purchase their own EVs and install solar panels in tourist accommodations such as homestays.

Other initiatives include investing in more ""domestic and short-haul products"", meaning fewer long-haul flights, as well as offering more flight-free itineraries.

Its progress will be verified by independent auditors in its annual report.

""We've always had the ambition to ensure that exploring the world could also help sustain it – but Intrepid, and frankly the entire travel industry, is not on track to achieve a 1.5C future, and more urgent action is required if we are to get even close,"" Wade and Thornton add.

So, what is carbon offsetting?

When you’re booking a flight online, you’ll often be presented with the option to offset the carbon footprint of your journey.

You’ll be asked if you want to add a small surcharge - sometimes even under €5 - to the cost of your booking to compensate for a proportion of the emissions of your flight.

However, carbon credit schemes have repeatedly been called out by scientists and climate activists as ineffective and even harmful.

So should you be choosing to offset your flight emissions or are there other options to make your journey greener?

How does carbon offsetting for flights work?

When you take a flight, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere can be calculated.

A one-way trip from London Heathrow to Paris Charles De Gaulle emits around 0.32 tonnes of CO2, for example.

When you choose the option to buy carbon credits, the idea is you offset the emissions by funding a scheme that will remove or store the equivalent amount of carbon elsewhere, often by planting trees.

The illusion of carbon offsetting schemes

For many climate scientists, the problem with carbon credits is that they do little to reduce flying - and perhaps even encourage it if travellers think they can make the trip eco-friendly and avoid the dreaded flygskam or ‘flight shame.’

Carbon offsetting at most cancels out emissions already released into the atmosphere, but does not reduce them as travellers sometimes mistakenly believe.

What’s more, many offsetting schemes have been labelled ineffective by scientists, while others can even have a negative impact.

Tree planting and forest protection schemes in particular are questionable yet Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) projects hold about a quarter of credits on the voluntary carbon market.

A 2023 study by researchers from Berkeley University concluded that “current REDD+ methodologies likely generate credits that represent a small fraction of their claimed climate benefit.”

Other investigations have even found that these schemes can have adverse impacts on Indigenous peoples and local communities who are forcibly removed from areas of land.

Legitimate carbon offsetting schemes should be verifiable and long-term - with a strategy in place for the care and maintenance of planted trees - and prove that they are additional projects i.e. the actions wouldn’t have been taken otherwise.

What are alternatives to carbon offsetting your flight?

Not flying at all is the best way to make a journey more planet-friendly.

Taking a train instead of a short-haul flight in Europe can reduce your emissions by over 85 per cent.

Thanks to Europe’s rail renaissance, long-distance train journeys are quicker, more comfortable and cheaper than they’ve ever been. Use websites like Omio and Trainline to find routes and prices and book tickets.

Train journeys can often be as quick as taking a flight because you don’t have to arrive at a train station hours before like you do with a flight. There are also very rarely limits on luggage reducing stress when packing.

On top of all this, it’s healthier to be able to move around a train, rather than being confined to a small seat on a plane. Trains also have perks like child-friendly carriages and, on long journeys, comfortable beds so you can arrive at your destination refreshed and save on the cost of a night’s accommodation.

But if you have to fly, you can choose to do so with airlines that use sustainable aviation fuel and choose an economy seat - business class passengers take up more space so account for more emissions.

Opt for large commercial aircraft rather than small planes or private jets as seating more people means emitting less per individual journey.",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/80/56/98/1200x675_cmsv2_19b84601-ac7f-5b41-a0a1-83e04db4c663-8805698.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 07:56:20.582808

It further notes that introducing green hydrogen into the SAF manufacturing process can extend this potential to 4.5 billion liters per year.
According to the study, the quickest and cheapest route to initial SAF quantities produced in South Africa is the first-generation (1G) alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathway, which is based on sugarcane A-molasses as feedstock.
The WWF South Africa report indicated that feedstock production could provide employment to around 20,000 farm workers (and perhaps even greater numbers of IAP harvesters), which could go a long way towards preserving at-risk jobs in sugarcane production.
I’m working with three [colleagues]–they have 13 years of experience of biofuel manufacturing industry; I’m still learning,” she says.","The development of this renewable energy source, on a commercial scale, could be a game changer for the country, and the African continent. But where are the challenges and are the opportunities being fully utilized?

As Africa’s economic potential and youth demographic soars to new heights, so too must its innovative capabilities, particularly in the development of ‘clean and green’ energy solutions.

The African Development Bank’s (AfDB) African Economic Outlook previously estimated that the continent would need around $2.7 trillion by 2030 to respond adequately to climate change.

Bioenergy, in particular, per the International Energy Agency (IEA), has the potential to play a vital role in decarbonizing transport by providing a low-carbon solution for “hard-to-abate” sectors like trucking, shipping and aviation.

A 2022 report by WWF South Africa titled, Fuel For The Future–A Blueprint for the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in South Africa, indicates that the country has the immediate technical potential to produce 3.2 billion liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) annually, following the strictest sustainability requirements.

It further notes that introducing green hydrogen into the SAF manufacturing process can extend this potential to 4.5 billion liters per year.

According to the study, the quickest and cheapest route to initial SAF quantities produced in South Africa is the first-generation (1G) alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) pathway, which is based on sugarcane A-molasses as feedstock.

“Over 300 million litres of SAF could be produced annually following this pathway, at an internationally competitive price,” states the report.

“Invasive alien plants (IAPs) and garden waste are potentially the largest available lignocellulosic feedstocks in the country. They could be converted to 1.8–3 billion litres of SAF annually using FischerTropsch synthesis.”

In 2020, the country established the Biofuels Regulatory Framework (BRF) to tackle five particular angles, namely, the feedstock protocol; the mandatory blending regulations; the cost recovery mechanism for the blending of biofuels; the biofuels subsidy mechanism; and the selection criteria for projects requiring a subsidy.

Sam Maphumulo, Sustainability Manager at the South African Sugar Association (SASA), explains that, per the BRF, mitigating the risk to food security was and is a key factor.

“There’s always that fuels versus food debate. Sugarcane was included as an approved feedstock to produce biofuels because, in our lobbying or advocating, we did explain that we’d be using, mostly, the sugar that we export at a loss, to produce the ethanol,” she tells FORBES AFRICA.

“That biofuels regulatory framework did say that there’ll be a subsidy mechanism–when we did our own studies on manufacturing biofuels or bio-ethanol, both brownfields or greenfields projects, we found it was just economically unviable, unless there was a sufficient subsidy to do it.”

This has yet to materialize.

The WWF South Africa report indicated that feedstock production could provide employment to around 20,000 farm workers (and perhaps even greater numbers of IAP harvesters), which could go a long way towards preserving at-risk jobs in sugarcane production.

“We’re trying to see if there’s other means of making it work; trying to see if we can engage with petroleum manufacturers–maybe it might drive down our costs,” says Maphumulo.

“For example, [if] one of the petroleum companies repurposes their plant for bioethanol production, we’re just the feedstock producer or provider and the facility is there to produce that bioethanol, do the blending etc. As an industry, we’re trying to engage with potential partners to see how we make this work without a subsidy.”

Regarding a recent study on the potential of SAF, Maphumulo explains: “We did the scoping study, collaboratively with the IDC. The finding of the study overview is that it’s just not viable economically because of a drastic negative NPV [Net Present Value]”.

“SAF is two to five times higher than the price of commercial aviation fuel so there might not be a great domestic uptake of it because the airlines, regionally, are actually trying to reduce their fuel costs… the IDC said they would like to put a pause on the study for now, so we didn’t proceed to pre-feasibility stage.”

She adds that the industry has been communicating with other stakeholders, including through the participation of a workshop with the aim of identifying roadblocks and seeing how SAF can be developed regionally.

Targeted biofuels penetration, per the IEA, is 4.5% v/v of the national fuel pool with 2% expected to come from first-generation biofuels technologies.

As the founder of Ino Biodiesel–a company looking to contribute towards the achievement of the planet’s renewable energy goals; energy security and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions–she is utilizing waste oil in an effective and sustainable way.

“With us, what makes biodiesel sustainable is it’s non-toxic, non-flammable with the chemicals that we’re using–potassium and methanol, and also the used cooking oil,” she says to FORBES AFRICA.

In 2021, she started producing 100 liters monthly, though mostly for testing. She applied for a grant competition and received funds, including from the Tony Elemelu Foundation.

Using this to invest in the business, Mamaila went from producing 1,000 liters to producing 5,000 liters. Today, the business produces between 10,000-100,000 liters of biodiesel weekly.

“I met with the guys who have been in the industry for a long [time]. I’m working with three [colleagues]–they have 13 years of experience of biofuel manufacturing industry; I’m still learning,” she says.

“We have a team in collecting. We collaborated with local restaurants and Abu Mama who makes amagwinya. We have created entrepreneurship [and] a supply chain of used cooking oil, which we pay per each liter we collect. Currently we have 325 local restaurants, so we go out there and collect used cooking oil.”

However, she does caution that policy mandates from government are key to the sustainability of this business, stating: “There’s no one protecting our raw materials; we’re using used cooking oil but we have people who are collecting that used cooking oil and exporting it. We need a clear mandate with government to certain a policy for us, starting from waste oil”.

Mamaila considers youth empowerment and community development as key to her role as an entrepreneur and sustainable fuel pioneer.

“With the 40 youth that I’m training, I’ve already trained the Limpopo [cohort]; they were getting a monthly stipend [and] 30% [goes] into the community trust. It also enabled us to build–because it’s a village in Limpopo–a small water facility where the community can have access to clean water… from the river to pipeline, cleaning it,” she explains.

“Next year, we’re looking to go into Mpumalanga and North West where we’ll also be training 40 youth in greenfield manufacturing. My plan is not just to train them but to work with them in our mission to supply 60 million liters.”",https://cms.forbesafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-672527274.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 05:57:21.782525

Deep in the south of Australia, on the island of Tasmania, scientists and engineers are working on a project that could completely change how the world produces and uses clean energy. So, let’s learn more about this.

The global race for hydrogen

Green hydrogen is created by splitting water molecules using electricity from renewable sources like wind or solar power. It’s a clean process that doesn’t release greenhouse gases, which is why it’s seen as one of the most important tools to fight climate change.

That’s why countries such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea have been investing heavily in hydrogen technology for years. They are already forming partnerships to import hydrogen from other regions to power factories, vehicles, and ships.

Meanwhile, areas like the Middle East, South America, and Oceania are preparing to export hydrogen on a large scale. Among them, Australia — and especially the state of Tasmania — stands out as one of the strongest players in this new global energy race.

Why Tasmania is the perfect place for clean energy

Tasmania is a small island, but it has something truly special — it runs almost entirely on renewable energy. Most of its power comes from wind and water, making it one of the greenest places on Earth. On top of that, it has a deep-water port and sits close to major Asian markets, which makes it the perfect spot to export clean energy to the world.

In recent years, several projects in northern Tasmania have tried to produce green hydrogen, but many of them struggled. The main problems were technical difficulties and a lack of the right infrastructure to make large-scale production work.

Now, a company called ABEL Energy has come up with a new, simpler idea. Instead of trying to export hydrogen directly — which is complicated and expensive — why not transform it into something easier to handle and more useful?

From hydrogen to green methanol

ABEL Energy, together with the company Worley, is developing the Bell Bay Powerfuels project, which plans to transform hydrogen into green methanol.

So, what exactly is green methanol? It’s a clean liquid fuel made by combining green hydrogen with carbon captured from sustainable biomass. The result is a fuel with a neutral carbon footprint, meaning it doesn’t add pollution to the atmosphere. Green methanol can be used as:

A clean fuel for ships.

A base for producing green chemicals.

Or even as a sustainable aviation fuel.

The Bell Bay Powerfuels project is expected to begin operations in 2028, aiming to produce around 300,000 tons of green methanol each year. It has already secured A$330 million in government funding, drawn interest from international investors, and may soon be acquired by Zen Energy, a company backed by economist Ross Garnaut.

Many experts now think that green methanol could soon overtake hydrogen as one of the most practical and effective clean fuels available in the world today.

Why this is happening now

Tasmania offers all the right ingredients for projects like this to succeed. The island has:

An almost fully renewable energy grid.

A deep-water port ideal for exports.

A strategic location close to Asia.

And a government strongly committed to the energy transition.

In addition, major infrastructure projects are underway to support clean energy development — such as a 224 MW wind farm in Bell Bay, and the Marinus Link, an underwater cable that will connect Tasmania to mainland Australia’s electricity market.

Together, these projects are turning Tasmania into a global hub for renewable energy.

A turning point for hydrogen

Even though hydrogen remains a key part of the clean energy transition, green methanol appears to be a more practical option for many industries. Being a liquid, it is much easier to store, transport, and use than pure hydrogen, which needs special tanks and extremely low temperatures.

For that reason, some experts say that the future of clean energy could lie in green methanol, while hydrogen remains a crucial ingredient in its production.

A cleaner, more realistic future

ABEL Energy’s project shows that the shift to clean energy is no longer a distant dream — it’s already happening. With its renewable energy, ideal location, and strong environmental policies, Tasmania is leading the way toward a new kind of energy economy.

If everything goes as planned, in just a few years we could see hydrogen giving rise to green methanol — a cleaner, safer, and more flexible fuel capable of powering ships, planes, and industries without harming the planet.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hydrogen-tasmania-methanol-clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 05:57:40.159638

The University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research (UK CAER) and the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (EEC) completed a risk assessment on various fats, oils, and greases (FOG) that could be used to produce SAF in the Commonwealth. The feedstocks reviewed included soybean oil, corn oil, distillers corn oil, animal fats, and used cooking grease (yellow and brown grease).

The assessment identified corn oil as the safest option for producing SAF in Kentucky due to its low overall risk profile, said Eduardo Santillan-Jimenez, Ph.D., associate director of CAER’s Sustainable and Alternative Fuels Research Group. He added that these findings can guide stakeholders looking to invest in SAF-related projects in the state.

SAF, an alternative to conventional jet fuel, can be made from plant oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking grease. It can be blended with up to 50% traditional jet fuel for commercial aircraft use and represents a global market potential of $80 billion by 2035. Jet fuel is Kentucky’s fourth most consumed fuel and is critical for its three major air hubs, as well as for national defense aviation operations at the Kentucky National Guard, Fort Knox, and Fort Campbell.

“As the aviation industry seeks sustainable and diversified fuel sources, SAF presents an opportunity for economic development in Kentucky,” said Kenya Stump, executive director of the Kentucky Office of Energy Policy. “It creates new markets for agricultural products, encourages investment in processing infrastructure, and strengthens local fuel production, supporting Kentucky’s Energy Security Plan.”

The study focused on soybean oil, corn oil, distillers corn oil, animal fats, yellow grease (used cooking oil), and brown grease (FOG from grease traps or wastewater treatment plants). Researchers reviewed six types of risk based on U.S. Department of Energy standards to help investors understand supply chain and operational risks when using biomass feedstocks.

“Supplier and supply chain risks were the highest across the feedstocks,” said Santillan-Jimenez. “Yellow and brown grease had high risks in both categories. Soybean oil showed high supplier risk but medium supply chain risk.

Cases of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis have surged, especially in communities like Victor, Canandaigua, and Naples, reported the Democrat & Chronicle.

The rising threat isn't just a bug problem. It's a growing health risk that's affecting real people, especially the most vulnerable, like kids and older adults.

What's happening?

As of early September, 296 cases of Lyme disease had been reported in Ontario County in 2025, a sharp jump from just 33 in 2021. Over half of this year's cases are concentrated in three towns: Victor with 74 cases, Canandaigua with 54 cases, and Naples with 42 cases.

""We live in a high-risk area,"" said Matthew Hanggi, an infectious disease expert with Ontario County Public Health, per the Democrat & Chronicle. The region is now rated as an ""extreme"" risk for ticks carrying Lyme, making encounters with disease-carrying insects more likely than ever.

According to Democrat & Chronicle, City Councilmember Doug Merrill, who leads a local study group on the issue, didn't mince words: ""This is a public health emergency, in my opinion.""

Why is this concerning?

As our planet heats up, so does the habitat for ticks. Warmer winters and longer growing seasons mean ticks survive longer, spread faster, and show up in more places. More ticks mean more chances for people to get sick.

Tick-borne illnesses like Lyme disease and anaplasmosis can lead to fever, fatigue, joint pain, and, if untreated, long-term complications.

Children ages 5 to 9 and the elderly, those most likely to be outdoors, are most at risk.

Beyond the illness itself, the growing deer population is also part of the problem. Deer act as hosts for ticks and are now damaging parks, yards, and even causing more car crashes.

What's being done about it?

Officials are acting. Canandaigua's environmental committee has approved two major steps: a stronger public awareness campaign and a countywide deer management plan.

The city wants to add warning signs in parks, share info on how to remove ticks, and create ""tick-unfriendly"" yards safely. Outreach to schools and local events is also in the works.

,,2025-10-11 08:13:02+00:00,The Business Times,The green paradox facing legacy carriers like Singapore Airlines - The Business Times,Linus Benjamin Bauer,,,,,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/green-paradox-facing-legacy-carriers-singapore-airlines,"LEGACY airlines across the world are under growing pressure to prove that their sustainability ambitions are more than skin-deep.
Singapore Airlines (SIA) illustrates this paradox particularly well.
But like many legacy airlines, SIA still relies heavily on paper-based systems for day-to-day cabin operations.
The credibility gap in airline sustainability Legacy carriers often approach sustainability through visible or high-profile initiatives: new-generation aircraft, SAF blending or plastic reduction campaigns.
A chance for leadership For SIA – and legacy carriers worldwide – the shift from paper to pixels represents more than a technical upgrade.","LEGACY airlines across the world are under growing pressure to prove that their sustainability ambitions are more than skin-deep. Fleet renewal, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investments and carbon offset schemes dominate corporate sustainability reports. Yet behind the scenes, many full-service carriers continue to operate with deeply manual workflows – a quiet contradiction that undermines their green credentials.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) illustrates this paradox particularly well. Long celebrated as a benchmark for premium service and operational excellence, the carrier has built its brand on innovation – from fuel-efficient aircraft and inflight recycling to its expanding SAF initiatives. But like many legacy airlines, SIA still relies heavily on paper-based systems for day-to-day cabin operations.

Passenger manifests, meal orders and inflight reports are often printed, prepared and filed manually. Even in premium cabins, orders are still taken by hand on paper slips. In an era when competitors are deploying integrated digital crew apps and real-time service dashboards, such processes feel increasingly out of sync with the sustainability narrative airlines wish to project.

A hidden source of inefficiency

The environmental cost of paper documentation may seem minor compared to jet fuel emissions, but its symbolism matters. It highlights a gap between public commitments and internal execution – and reveals a broader cultural inertia that has slowed digital transformation in legacy carriers.

Each SIA flight involves dozens of cabin crew printing and preparing operational paperwork, multiplied across thousands of flights a year. Emirates, Qatar Airways and British Airways, by contrast, now equip crew with tablets that consolidate flight information, passenger preferences and catering data into a single system. This shift doesn’t just save paper; it enables smarter, more sustainable decisions – reducing food waste, improving inventory management and capturing real-time insights that can inform future efficiency gains.

For airlines striving to cut emissions and resource use, digitalisation represents one of the most underappreciated sustainability levers. Yet for many, it remains a slow-moving ambition rather than a fully realised transformation.

The credibility gap in airline sustainability

Legacy carriers often approach sustainability through visible or high-profile initiatives: new-generation aircraft, SAF blending or plastic reduction campaigns. These are essential, but environmental leadership today is increasingly holistic. It extends to the digital infrastructure that underpins daily operations – where incremental inefficiencies can add up to significant environmental and reputational costs.

This disconnect, what sustainability experts call a “credibility gap”, emerges when corporate pledges outpace internal change. For passengers, it’s not only about what fuels the aircraft – but how the airline operates, manages waste and empowers its staff to act sustainably. A digitally enabled crew isn’t just more efficient; it signals a company’s seriousness about modernisation and environmental alignment.

Why progress is slow

The slow pace of digital transformation among legacy carriers reflects both structural and cultural challenges. Integrating new technology into decades-old IT systems – spanning rostering, catering and inflight reporting – is complex and expensive. It requires retraining thousands of staff, updating cybersecurity protocols and managing operational risk.

There’s also a mindset dimension. Airlines with strong service cultures, such as SIA, have long prized human interaction as a differentiator. Some within the industry fear that digital interfaces might erode the warmth and personal touch that premium brands are built upon.

Yet leading examples suggest the opposite: Emirates’ and British Airways’ digital crew apps, for instance, allow staff to anticipate passenger needs with personalised insights – enhancing, not replacing, the human connection.

Post-pandemic financial constraints have further delayed such initiatives. With capital often prioritised for fleet renewal or SAF procurement, crew digitalisation tends to fall down the investment list, despite its potential for both cost and carbon savings.

Digital sustainability is still sustainability

If the aviation sector is to achieve meaningful decarbonisation, sustainability cannot stop at the aircraft’s engine. Digital transformation should be seen as an environmental imperative – a foundation for reducing waste, improving operational efficiency and empowering staff.

A fully digital cabin ecosystem could link pre-flight briefing, inflight service and post-flight reporting into a seamless data flow. That integration enables smarter catering and inventory planning, reducing excess weight and food waste. It can also streamline crew workflows, cutting hours of manual preparation and freeing time for service delivery. The environmental benefits would therefore be matched by human ones: less stress, better focus and greater job satisfaction.

A chance for leadership

For SIA – and legacy carriers worldwide – the shift from paper to pixels represents more than a technical upgrade. It is a strategic opportunity to close the gap between sustainability rhetoric and operational reality. By embedding digitalisation into its sustainability agenda, the airline could once again set the regional benchmark, this time for holistic environmental leadership.

After all, sustainability in aviation goes beyond how efficiently an airline flies, to also how intelligently it operates. In that respect, the next great leap forward for legacy carriers may come not from the engines beneath their wings, but from the tablets in their crew’s hands.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/4eaae7e9083f848b419a96d5311a04e3fba391c937e50a92ddbba036dd2332d8?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-10-11 05:58:09.085046

With a portfolio of innovative solutions and impressive results, 4AIR is enabling travelers and aviation operators to significantly reduce their carbon emissions, opening doors to more responsible and environmentally conscious travel experiences.

Empowering Sustainable Tourism Through Carbon Emission Reductions

A dedicated focus on reducing the environmental impact of aviation has been central to 4AIR’s accomplishments, particularly as aviation plays an essential role in global tourism. One of the most notable achievements has been the promotion of carbon neutrality, which has enabled over two million flight hours to be fully carbon neutral or even better. This level of flight activity exceeds the total annual flying hours of the largest private aviation groups, illustrating a remarkable shift toward sustainability within the industry. Such a milestone not only highlights a growing awareness but also a robust alignment between the aviation sector and the goals of sustainable tourism, where reducing carbon footprints is becoming imperative for protecting natural and cultural destinations worldwide.

Beyond carbon offsetting, 4AIR has been instrumental in advancing the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a revolutionary alternative to traditional jet fuel derived from renewable sources. Unlike conventional fuels, SAF can be used directly in existing aircraft engines without modifying the planes, which makes its integration more feasible and immediate. To date, over 3.2 million gallons of blended SAF have been utilized within 4AIR-supported flights. This widespread adoption translates into a significant reduction of tens of thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. By lessening the volume of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, SAF plays a vital role in clearing the skies and reducing the environmental strain on popular tourism hubs, which often suffer from pollution-related degradation.

The impact of SAF extends deeply into making tourism more environmentally responsible. As more airports and operators incorporate SAF, travelers can fly with a reduced environmental impact, supporting the preservation of sensitive ecosystems and vibrant tourist destinations. The cleaner emissions profile not only helps diminish the aviation sector’s contribution to climate change but also improves air quality around airports and nearby communities, fostering healthier living environments for locals and tourists alike. This fuel’s growing availability, supported by 4AIR’s efforts to expand SAF supply chains and document usage transparently, ensures that sustainable choices become easier and more mainstream within the tourism and aviation industries.

Bridging Innovation with Compliance in Aviation Sustainability

Another noteworthy aspect of 4AIR’s impact revolves around regulatory compliance and technological advancement. Its expansive regulatory compliance program now supports adherence to more than 25 different environmental frameworks worldwide. This ensures that operators and travelers remain compliant amid evolving policies, fostering a culture of accountability and progress within the industry.

4AIR’s commitment to innovation in sustainable aviation also includes pioneering trials aimed at reducing contrail formation, a contributor to climate change effects from flight. These efforts illustrate the organization’s forward-thinking approach that combines environmental science with aviation practice to address all dimensions of the industry’s carbon impact.

Education and Collaboration Driving Sustainable Travel Culture

Education has played an indispensable role in 4AIR’s strategy to promote sustainability across the aviation and tourism sectors.

SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that meets all the same technical and safety requirements as fossil-based jet fuel but comes from a more sustainable source.

In the five years since its inception, 4AIR’s programs have:

Facilitated more than 2 million carbon neutral or higher flight hours, reducing the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted during flight. To put this into perspective, this is more flight hours than the annual amount flown by the four largest private aviation operators combined.

Documented more than 20.2 million blended gallons of SAF — which has reduced jet fuel emissions in its lifecycle by more than 43,000 metric tons of Co2.

Reduced or offset more than 6 million metric tons of CO2 through carbon offsets and SAF.

Contributed more than $250,000 to aviation sustainability research through its Aviation Climate Fund.

Implemented the first live trials for contrail mitigation into business aviation

“Our goal with launching 4AIR was to make sustainability accessible, and this success shows that there is a desire by business aviation to decarbonize, if the right tools are put in place. But we must keep pushing to drive broader industry adoption and achieve even higher levels of sustainability,” said 4AIR President Kennedy Ricci.

In addition to its impactful efforts on the offset front, 4AIR has been actively building out its offerings to better serve the aviation industry across the board. This includes the recent expansion of its comprehensive regulatory compliance program. With this extension, 4AIR now supports more than 25 regulatory schemes worldwide — ensuring aviation operators are in full compliance amid a rapidly changing regulatory landscape.

To further amplify its mission of educating the world on sustainability, since its 2020 launch, the 4AIR team has attended over 250 events — speaking at more than 100 of those — a testament to their dedication to empowering audiences worldwide to engage in meaningful sustainability initiatives.

1. Introduction

The Airline Deregulation Act (ADA) in 1978 significantly transformed the industry by removing government control over pricing and route decisions, thereby granting airlines greater strategic freedom [1,2]. While deregulation enabled open market entry, pricing autonomy, and inter-airline alliances, market dominance and power have persisted. Consequently, factors beyond regulatory intervention continue to shape airline efficiency and profitability in the post-deregulation era [3].

In more recent years, sustainability has emerged as a key strategic imperative across industries, including aviation. Since 2019, it has become both a driver of social change and a critical factor in corporate success [4]. High Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings consistently correlate with market outperformance, as reported by McKinsey [5]. Although sustainability strategies often involve initial costs, they yield substantial long-term benefits. Talal [6] emphasizes the integration of sustainability into corporate strategy, with many Fortune 500 companies appointing Chief Sustainability Officers to meet investor, consumer, and regulatory demands while enhancing organizational performance.

The aviation industry has not remained unaffected by this trend. Recognizing its substantial environmental footprint, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) began establishing sustainability guidelines in 2016 [7], notably through the adoption of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Accordingly, airlines are increasingly pursuing sustainable management strategies that incorporate environmental and social considerations beyond operational efficiency [8].

Improving operational eco-efficiency has become a core focus, promoting resource optimization and reducing the risk of future regulatory penalties. Sustainability in aviation must address both CO₂ and non-CO₂ effects, including transitions away from fossil-based fuels, and assess broader implications across environmental, economic, and societal dimensions [9].

Aviation generates a significant amount of CO₂ emissions and, if current trends continue, it could account for up to 22% of total global CO₂ emissions by 2050—posing a major challenge to climate goals such as the 1.5 °C limit [9]. Efforts to reduce emissions include Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), fuel-efficient aircraft design, and alternative fuels like ammonia, hydrogen, and battery-electric systems [10]. For instance, Korean Air is enhancing its fleet with fuel-efficient aircraft such as the A220-300, A321neo, B787-9, and B737-8, which reduce carbon emissions per seat by 15–25% compared to previous models. The airline plans to introduce 90 new aircraft—including 30 A321neos, 10 B787-9s, and 30 B737-8s—by 2028 [11].

Beyond CO₂, the aviation sector also contributes to climate change through non-CO₂ effects. Ground operations, for example, produce local air pollutants and noise, with studies linking noise pollution near airports to sleep disturbances, psychological stress, and adverse physiological outcomes among local communities [9].

Ultimately, sustainable aviation requires balancing environmental impacts, economic feasibility, and societal needs. This includes ensuring access to clean energy, maintaining affordability, and prioritizing the well-being of communities affected by air transportation.

Despite technological advancements and strategic efforts by airline operators, achieving the sustainability objectives also depends heavily on the actions of employees. As research shows, employees significantly influence corporate sustainability outcomes [12]. Within airlines, ecological behavior—shaped by environmental knowledge, awareness, and concern—plays a critical role in implementing eco-friendly practices and aligning with green management initiatives. To improve environmental performance and corporate image, organizations may benefit from recruiting individuals with strong environmental values and offering regular environmental training [13]. Studies further demonstrate that employee environmental behavior enhances overall organizational performance [14], and voluntary initiatives can help guide the industry toward sustainability—provided that significant shifts in mindset and processes are implemented [15]. Furthermore, everyday pro-environmental actions, such as effective resource and waste management, have a direct and measurable impact on organizational sustainability [16].

Based on the broader background of this research, some research questions have arisen:

How does employee behavior in the airlines influence corporate sustainability?

Is there consistency between airline employees and the corporate sustainability goals of their respective airlines?

What components contribute to differences in employee behaviors among employees of the airlines?

Do airlines provide consistent sustainability training for their employees, and if not, what strategic approaches can be taken to achieve this goal of the airlines?

Prior research in aviation sustainability has mainly focused on technological solutions—such as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) [17–19] and aircraft design improvements [20]—to address climate change [9,10,21]. Approximately 11–18 significant technology-oriented studies [22,23] are found in 2024. While these efforts are important, they often view sustainability as a technical issue and pay little attention to the human factors involved. In particular, the role of employee understanding and behavior in shaping corporate sustainability has been largely overlooked. There is still a clear gap in the literature regarding how airline employees perceive sustainability and how their actions affect sustainable outcomes within organizations.

This investigation aims to examine how the understanding and behavior of employees regarding corporate sustainability within the aviation industry influence the corporate sustainability performance. Specifically, this study is designated to verify whether the environmental knowledge, awareness, and concern of airline employees impact their actual ecological behavior. Subsequently, this research explores the overall impact of these changes on the sustainability performance of corporate.

This study consists of four main sections. Firstly, a literature review explores factors shaping ecological behavior, emphasizing that environmental knowledge, awareness, and concern are crucial for corporate sustainability across environmental, financial, and social realms. Secondly, it discusses the research framework, including survey design, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) for data analysis technique and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with emphasis on hypothesis outcomes. Lastly, it thoroughly examines research findings pertinent to academic inquiry and practical managerial application.

2. Literature review

2.1 Environmental knowledge

Environmental knowledge, research by Angreani [24] and Zsóka [25], encompasses understanding environmental issues and potential remedies. In addition, Tirno [26] asserts that environmental knowledge involves comprehending and evaluating how individual actions impact the ecosystem. Specifically, it is asserted by Kaplan [27] that environmental knowledge encompasses an individual’s comprehensive awareness of factors like the environment’s condition, climate change, and ecological repercussions on consumption and production. Furthermore, individual decision-making is substantially influenced by their understanding of specific environmental aspects. Cheng [28] explored the positive correlation between environmental knowledge and environmental performance, demonstrating that environmental knowledge enables individuals to reduce harmful environmental influences and contributes to green innovation. In exploring methods to foster environmental knowledge, the researchers, Otto and Pensini [29] emphasize the significance in positively shaping ecological behavior. They assert that environmental knowledge plays an essential role in encouraging ecological behaviors, supporting individuals to recognize proactive actions in advance. It has been established that environmental knowledge significantly influences pro-environmental attitudes, subsequently driving environmentally responsible actions, as indicated by Amyx [30], Corral-Verdugo [31], and Mostafa [32]. The study conducted by Lu [33], focusing on individual intention, establishes a correlation between environmental knowledge and ecological behavior, demonstrating that heightened environmental knowledge enhances individuals’ inclination to participate in carbon offsetting initiatives. Hence, based on the literature, this research study posits the following hypothesis.

H1. Environmental knowledge positively influences on the ecological behavior of airline employees.

2.2 Environmental awareness

Dabbous [34] describes environmental awareness as encompassing an understanding of diverse environmental challenges and advocating responsible actions that contribute to environmental preservation. Han & Kim [35] and Paco & Rapaco [36] expound upon environmental awareness, defining it as an individual’s acknowledgment and concern for various environmental issues. Moreover, Daziano [37] and Wang [38] assert that this comprehension represents a pivotal factor in steering individuals toward environmentally sustainable behaviors, and it proves that environmental awareness is in a crucial role in shaping environmental behaviors [39,40] and in guiding individuals toward adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles [41]. Research carried by Darvishmotevali and Altinay [42] emphasizes its critical function in mediating the impact of green HRM (Human Resource Management on employees’ proactive environmental performance. In addition, Zhang [43] argues that this concept intricately intertwines with psychological determinants that configure individuals’ predispositions toward pro-environmental activities, attitudes, and behaviors. It is possibly considered that a heightened level of environmental awareness leads to a deeper understanding of the crucial role environmental preservation plays in human well-being. The “4 R’s,” encapsulating principles of reducing, reusing, recycling, and rethinking as elucidated by Gabarda-Mallorquí [44]. It epitomizes environmental awareness, and it signifies an acknowledgment of the environment’s vulnerability and the imperative need for its conservation. Related to this, promoting environmental awareness effectively relies on a comprehensive grasp of environmental issues and serves as a potent strategy in fostering environmentally responsible behaviors and advancing sustainable practices. Additionally, environmental awareness stands as a fundamental concept due to its inherent connection to sustainability and its pivotal role in heightening awareness and cultivating green initiatives across entire organizations [45]. Hence, considering stated literature, this research study posits the following hypothesis.

H2. Environmental awareness positively influences ecological behavior of airline employees.

2.3 Environmental concern

Research carried out by Goh & Balaj [46] describes environmental concern measures an individual’s involvement with environmental issues. Another study conducted by Dunlap and Van Liere [47] suggests that environmental concern is essential to grasp the intentions behind purchasing green products, and it has been observed that customers’ environmental concerns influence their behavior when it comes to green purchases. Moreover, customers with heightened environmental concerns are more inclined to invest in renewable energy at premium prices compared to those with lower levels of environmental concern [48]. The degree of environmental concern among individuals not only indicates their awareness of environmental issues but also reflects their support for addressing them and their willingness to personally contribute to their solutions, highlighting the prioritization of environmental matters and the readiness to invest efforts in resolving them [49]. The study conducted by Bamberg [50] insists that environmental concern among students leads to significant differences in the perception and evaluation of identical decision scenarios. Furthermore, people who have a strong environmental concern are more likely to adopt eco-friendly behaviors due to their favorable attitudes and beliefs towards such actions. Additionally, customers with heightened environmental awareness were more well-versed in green products and technologies, showed increased vigilance in avoiding environmentally detrimental purchases, and exhibited enhanced understanding of the reliability and safety of green products. Another study from Newton [51] suggests that the complex interplay between environmental concern and ecological behavior underscores that environmental concern serves as a pivotal indirect factor in shaping intentions towards environmental behavior. Although environmental concern may not directly dictate environmental behavior, it can inspire individuals to seek out more information regarding the environmental impacts of their actions. Hence, considering stated literature, this research study posits the following hypothesis.

H3. Environmental concern positively influences ecological behavior of airline employees.

2.4 Ecological behavior and sustainability

2.4.1 Employee’s ecological behavior in the corporate environment.

A study by Axelrod [52] defines ecological behavior as positive engagement in the preservation and conservation of the environment. In addition, Krajhanzl [53] argues that environmental behavior encompasses actions perceived within a society as conducive to environmental protection or as a demonstration to fostering a healthier environment. At the organizational level, it is imperative for corporations to embrace environmentally conscious decision-making practices to fulfill their green objectives and safeguard the environment. Consequently, companies integrate eco-friendly initiatives into their operational and HRM strategies to gain sustainable advantages [54,55]. Recent research carried out by Whitburn [56] found that employees’ organizational alignment correlates with their ecological conduct, influencing them to mitigate detrimental impacts on nature and champion green practices within the workplace. These environmentally conscious behaviors encompass activities such as energy conservation, transportation choices, waste management, and community engagement [57].

Additionally, Arshad [58] proposes that employees’ environmental attitudes serve as catalysts for their ecological conduct and satisfaction within the organizational context. The findings affirm that employees’ dedication to the organization fosters their environmental attitudes, thus driving ecological behaviors and sustainable practices. Algarni [59] explores the direct and indirect links between environmental actions and company performance through corporate sustainability measures. Paillé and Boiral [60] examine the impact of environmental conduct within workplace settings to enhance sustainability practices and performance. Moreover, Ronnenberg [61] indicates that the sustainability strategies of corporate contribute to enhanced environmental performance via standardized organizational procedures. Likewise, Kim [62] investigates the correlation between eco-friendly behavior of employees and environmental performance, while Hameed [55] emphasizes the necessity of aligning environmental actions from employees with sustainable management practices of the corporate.

2.4.2 Sustainability in the corporate.

Corporate sustainability is commonly defined as a company’s capacity to meet the needs of its stakeholders while managing environmental, social, and economic impacts responsibly and proactively, ensuring long-term organizational resilience and societal value [63]. Corporate sustainability is also described as a new paradigm requiring businesses to align with environmental and societal trends, emphasizing the need for a coherent concept to guide effective sustainable practices [64]. Corporate sustainability is defined here as the implementation of environmental protection measures, adherence to ecological regulations, adoption of pollution prevention technologies, and practices promoting waste reduction. Recognizing the imperative nature of integrating environmental, financial, and social considerations into decision-making steps is fundamental for achieving successful sustainable corporate performance [65,66]. Contemporary business achievements hinge upon the integration of enduring sustainability principles that encompass environmental, financial, and social dimensions within executive operations [66].

Research by González-García [67] introduced an evaluation framework firmly grounded in the triad of sustainability pillars: social, economic, and environmental dimensions. This framework aims to establish methodologies that preserve resources, ensure societal well-being, and advance sustainable progress. Additionally, leveraging these three pillars enables the adoption of sustainable corporate practices, leading to sustainable performance [68]. Algarni [59] emphasizes the integration of sustainability principles into core corporate strategies to achieve their sustainability performance.

This research explores the intricate relationship between individual employee-level environmental behavior and its contribution to measurable corporate sustainability performance. To strengthen this connection, the study considers how aggregated behavioral patterns—resulted from employee’s knowledge, awareness, concern in environment —can translate into tangible corporate-level outcomes, including reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency, and promote recycling; steady growth in revenue, profit, and market share; and policies supporting business ethics, employee well-being, and stakeholder welfare.

The evaluation of environmental sustainability performance often relies on indicators such as scores for resource, emissions, and environmental innovation, provided by Thomson Reuters, to assess firms’ environmental contributions [69]. Environmental performance signifies a company’s positive influence on both its internal and external environment, necessitating reductions in air pollution, material, and energy utilization while emphasizing adherence to environmental standards [68].

Examining financial performance involves considerations such as reducing capital costs, improving financial resources, impacting capital structure, risk exposure, and enhancing profit margins [70]. Algarni [59] highlight the correlation between initiative-taking environmental protection by companies and the associated benefits, emphasizing the harmonization between environmental preservation and economic gains. They stress the importance of investigating the interplay between corporate sustainability practices, including sustainable operations, environmental preservation, regulatory compliance, technology adoption for pollution prevention, waste reduction, and their influence on financial performance [71,72]. Enhanced financial performance occurs as a business solidifies its standing in the market, improves market share, generates a ROI (Return on Investment), and accrues more earnings [73].

Socially sustainable performance revolves around a business’s capability to enhance social Note: by ensuring the safety and well-being of its workforce and the broader community [74]. It involves fostering better stakeholder and community interactions, promoting job security, improving the working environment, and raising community living standards [75]. In addition, social performance within firms encompasses the adherence to human rights, equity, and ethical standards [76,77]. Mani and Gunasekaran [78] delved into factors such as behavioral pressures, a culture inclined towards sustainability which significantly mold a firm’s adoption of social sustainability, particularly in emerging economies.

Hence, considering stated literature, this research study posits the following hypotheses.

H4. Ecological behavior positively influences environmental performance of airline sustainability.

H5. Ecological behavior positively influences financial performance of the airline sustainability.

H6. Ecological behavior positively influences social performance of airline sustainability.

3. Methodology

3.1 Survey design

Utilizing the conceptual framework depicted in Fig 1, a set of 28 survey items was devised for the quantitative methodology, drawing insights from prior studies in various industries concerning environmental knowledge, awareness, concern, ecological behavior, and sustainability performance (environmental, financial, social), as outlined in Table 1. All questionnaires underwent meticulous revision to align with the specific objectives of the study, utilizing a 5-point Likert scale. Subsequently, they were translated into the local language in Korea with the aid of two experienced translators to ensure the clarity of the survey questions for the participants. The translation process adhered to Ruvio & Shoham’s guidelines [79] to maintain cultural and linguistic equivalence in the scales. Moreover, a convenience sampling method [80], employing a non-probabilistic, self-participation approach, was implemented following Tarhini’s guidelines [81]. Moreover, a convenience sampling method [80], employing a non-probabilistic, self-participation approach, was implemented following Tarhini’s guidelines [81]. This method facilitated data collection; however, it may constrain the generalizability of the findings beyond the study sample. Five pilot tests were conducted 10 volunteers, and feedback from most participants guided the necessary adjustments to the survey questionnaires.

3.2 Data analysis

The primary survey utilized a Google survey tool and was specifically allocated to existing Airlines staff members via a widely used Korean social media platform. Over a period of 16 weeks, a total of 230 completed samples were gathered. Data analysis involved the use of SPSS version 25 for tasks like descriptive statistics and internal reliability assessment (Cronbach’s alpha). Furthermore, AMOS 23 was employed to conduct CFA encompassing convergent reliability, discriminant reliability, model fit analysis, and SEM path analysis to validate the proposed hypotheses [86,87]. Additionally, to evaluate multicollinearity among independent variables across factors and confirm their suitability for SEM analysis, a correlation analysis was performed using AMOS version 23 [88].

3.2.1 Descriptive statistics.

Table 2 illustrates the demographic distribution of the 230 employees working across various airline sectors. Among these, 63.5% were female while 36.5% were male. The participant distribution within this study encompassed 55.2% employed by full-service carriers within Korea, 26.1% with low-cost carriers in Korea, 16.1% from full-service carriers outside Korea, and 2.6% with low-cost carriers outside Korea. Regarding tenure in service, the majority had 6–10 years and above category, constituting 23.5% of the cohort, followed by individuals with over 20 years of experience at 22.6%. Participants with service durations of 1–5 years accounted for 21.7%, while those with 11–15 years comprised 18.7%. The 16–20 years category represented 10.4%, and those with less than one year of service accounted for 3.0%. Furthermore, in terms of occupational distribution, office-based personnel, inclusive of head office staff within the airlines, constituted 37.4% of the sample. Cabin crew members represented 27%, while individuals working in airport-related roles, comprised 23.9%. Cockpit crew members, technicians, facility support, and others each accounted for 3.9% of the total participant distribution.

3.2.2 CFA (Confirmatory Factor Analysis).

Prior to examining the hypotheses, a measurement model underwent validation using confirmatory factor analysis. During the data analysis, it was determined that seven questionnaires from the variables of environmental knowledge, environmental awareness, environmental concern, and ecological behavior fell below the recommended SMC threshold at 0.4. To enhance the quality of this research, the seven items including E.K1, E.K2, E.A2, E.C2, E.C4, E.B1, E.B4 were subsequently excluded from the analysis, leaving 21 items for further examination. The remaining 21 questionnaire items achieved an acceptable level of SMC at 0.4 and above, ensuring the reliability of each questionnaire. Additionally, to address other internal consistency issues and uphold reliability, Cronbach’s alpha analysis was performed [80]. As presented by Table 3, a total 20 questionnaires out of 21 exceeded the recommendation level of Cronbach alpha at 0.7 while mediating variable of ecological behavior’ was computed at 0.657 which is slightly lower than the recommended value at 0.7. Based on a study conducted by Helmstadter [89], the present research retained the mediating variable despite its Cronbach’s alpha value being under 0.7 of Cronbach Alpha.

Evaluations of AVE (Average Variance Extracted) and CR (Composite Reliability) were conducted to examine correlations among the provided variables, as depicted in Table 3. Typically, AVE and CR values exceeding 0.5 and 0.7, respectively, are considered acceptable [90]. Nevertheless, the perspective of Fornell and Larcker [91] was also taken into account to accommodate certain items that fell slightly below the thresholds of 0.5 for AVE and 0.7 for CR in this study. According to their argument [84], if the AVE value is below 0.5 but the CR value exceeds 0.6, the construct’s convergent validity remains satisfactory. Furthermore, this research also considered the perspective of Helmstadter [82], who suggests that while a Cronbach alpha value above 0.5 can be acceptable, the generally accepted threshold is higher, at 0.7 [83]. Drawing from the literature reviewed, pairs of CR and AVE values were computed: [0.680 (CR), 0.519 (AVE)] for environmental knowledge, [0.772 (CR), 0.532 (AVE)] for environmental awareness, [0.666 (CR), 0.500 (AVE)] for environmental concern, [0.702 (CR), 0.544 (AVE)] for ecological behavior, [0.900 (CR), 0.692 (AVE)] for environmental performance, [0.890 (CR), 0.674 (AVE)] for financial performance, and [0.924 (CR), 0.754 (AVE)] for social performance. It is noted that the CR and AVE results for all variables in this study surpassed the acceptable thresholds of 0.5 for AVE and 0.6 for CR. Furthermore, a discriminant validity examination was carried out, as illustrated in Table 4.

3.2.3 Model fit indices.

Table 5 presents the computed fit indices for this conceptual framework. It was observed that the majority of the fit index indicators either met acceptable standards or closely approached them. Through CFA, the factors within the absolute fit index surpassed the recommended thresholds, registering MIN/DF = 1.860, RMR = 0.037, GFI = 0.903, AGFI = 0.848, and RMSEA = 0.061. The factors within the incremental fit index achieved acceptable levels, demonstrating NFI = 0.916 and CFI = 0.958.

The outcomes of the goodness-of-fit assessment using the CFA approach were within acceptable ranges, indicating an elevated level of accuracy. These findings suggest that the model adequately meets the prescribed criteria for goodness of fit in CFA analysis without encountering any notable issues.

3.2.4 SEM (Structural Equation Modelling) analysis.

Table 6 displays the synthesis of the anticipated conceptual framework alongside outcomes derived from path analysis. Fig 2 depicts results indicating a substantial impact of environmental concern on ecological behavior (β = 0.875, SE = 0.248, CR = 4.811, p < 0.001). Conversely, the influence of environmental knowledge on ecological behavior was found to be no substantial (β = -0.035, SE = 0.058, CR = -0.131). Consequently, hypothesis H3 gains support, while H1 is rejected.

The hypothesis concerning the relationship between environmental awareness and ecological behavior (β = -0.484, SE = 0.075, CR = -5.008, and p < 0.001), revealed an unexpected negative effect, indicating that as awareness increases, ecological behavior tends to decrease. Nevertheless, as the result is statistically significant (p < 0.001), the hypothesis is considered supported. The structural paths from ecological behavior to environmental (β = 1, SE = 0.364, CR = 6.459, p < 0.001), financial (β = 1, SE = 0.243, CR = 6.049, p < 0.001), and social performance (β = 1, SE = 0.404, CR = 6.637, p < 0.001) are all statistically significant, indicating robust relationships. Thus, hypotheses H4, H5, and H6 collectively receive support.

4. Discussion and conclusion

Airlines have recognized the imperative to enhance environmental sustainability as the responses to consumer demands, market changes, and government regulations by focusing on reducing carbon emissions, exemplified by initiatives such as the ICAO CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and restrictions on short domestic flights [93]. The significant contribution to global Carbon emissions in the airline industry, near 2.1%, highlights the urgency to address its environmental impact amidst climate change concerns [94]. This research explored the effects of three environmental stimuli including environmental knowledge, environmental awareness, and environmental concern on employees’ ecological behavior and how the behavior influences sustainability performance in the airlines of Korea. The results of this investigation present meaningful insights into the airline sustainability by understanding and behavior of the employees in the airline industry. Based on Fig 2, the findings are presented below.

First, regarding the relationship between environmental knowledge, awareness, concern, and ecological behavior, this study revealed that environmental knowledge was not a significant predictor of ecological behavior. While prior literature often positions knowledge as a key driver of pro-environmental practices, this finding suggests that information alone—without emotional engagement or supportive infrastructure—may not be sufficient to drive behavioral change. This perspective departs from earlier studies and offers a new understanding of how environmental stimuli shape employee behavior in workplace contexts [16].

At a theoretical level, the study contributes by clarifying the distinct roles of environmental attitude components. Environmental concern consistently fosters ecological behavior, while environmental awareness was found to have an unexpected negative association, and knowledge showed no significant relationship with behavior. These distinctions highlight the need for more nuanced training approaches that prioritize emotional engagement, behavioral reinforcement, and practical enablement, rather than focusing solely on the dissemination of knowledge.

Importantly, it is also important to acknowledge that the ecological behaviors of individual employees may influence, and potentially contribute to, the overall sustainability performance of the organization. When employee-led sustainability efforts are rooted in strong environmental concern and supported by the corporate structure, they can generate positive outcomes across all dimensions of sustainability—environmental, financial, and social. This insight advances theoretical models by demonstrating how differentiated environmental attitudes can translate into organizational-level sustainability performance.

Second, both environmental awareness and environmental concern showed significant relationships with ecological behavior, albeit in opposite directions. Environmental concern was positively associated, reinforcing its role as an emotional and value-based driver of sustainable action. Environmental awareness, however, showed an unexpected negative relationship, suggesting that high awareness might not always result in behavior change—possibly due to psychological fatigue, perceived lack of motivation, or organizational barriers. This outcome reflects the awareness–action gap—a concept well established in environmental and behavioral studies—which describes the discrepancy between recognizing environmental issues and acting on them [95].

These findings also point to overlooked motivational gaps in many organizations. Airlines in Korea benefit from a comprehensive mix of sustainability incentives—including SAF blending mandates, airport fee waivers, and corporate SAF programs—designed to promote low-carbon aviation practices [96,97]. These collectively create compelling support for SAF adoption as one of the sustainability management. However, these incentives target corporate rather than individuals, and globally, employee-level ecological incentive programs remain rare or undocumented [98]. This reveals a policy-to-practice gap between corporate environmental objectives and frontline employee motivation—an area that merits attention in future sustainability management [99].

Third, building on the structural equation modeling results, this study reinforces that ecological behavior acts as a key mediating mechanism—especially in linking environmental concern to sustainability outcomes across environmental, financial, and social dimensions. While the potential negative influence of awareness warrants further investigation, these findings suggest that fostering pro-environmental behavior among employees may serve as an important mechanism for advancing sustainability goals. This frames ecological behavior not merely as a possible outcome of attitudes but as a strategic entry point for organizational transformation.

Extending from this, these findings emphasize the importance of differentiating cognitive and emotional components of environmental attitude when designing sustainability strategies. Concern, as a form of affective engagement, appears to be more behaviorally influential than either awareness or knowledge. Therefore, training that cultivates concern—rather than simply delivering information—may prove more effective in fostering ecological practices. This insight is further supported by practical cases: for example, British Airways and Delta Air Lines have launched internal initiatives—“Sustainability Champions” and “Green Up,” respectively—to embed ecological consciousness throughout their workforce [100,101]. These peer-led, participatory models demonstrate that bottom-up employee involvement is both feasible and effective, and could be adapted within Korean aviation contexts to build a more participatory environmental culture.

From a managerial perspective, the study offers valuable implications for sustainability-focused leadership. Among the 230 survey respondents, 29% were employees of Low Cost Carriers (LCCs), and 71% of them reported never receiving any form of environmental training. This indicates a critical opportunity for LCCs to implement employee-focused environmental education programs to support sustainability objectives. However, such programs must move beyond knowledge delivery alone. As highlighted earlier, ecological behavior is most effectively fostered through emotional concern, reinforcement structures, and aligned organizational culture.

In this context, the ecological behavior of airline employees continues to serve as a mediating force, shaping environmental, financial, and social performance outcomes. Enhanced green practices at the individual level may increase the likelihood of broader corporate sustainability success, underscoring the important role of employees in advancing sustainability transitions.

As observed in other studies, this research is bound by several limitations that offer suggestions for future inquiry. One such limitation arises from the scarcity of existing studies on ecological behavior within the aviation industry. Consequently, this study relied on a constrained pool of literature from other sectors and employed a limited set of mediators, thereby yielding restricted findings.

The second limitation is the relatively small sample size of the survey. With additional samples over 150 survey responses per job positions or levels, it could segmentize the employee’s diverse capacity to act on their ecological awareness or concern. Also, as the Table 2 demographic table shows, about 81.3% of subjects are working in Korean flag airlines. It could aid in increasing the understanding of airlines in Korea, but this constraint presents a promising opportunity for future research to extend its reach, potentially by including a more expansive selection of respondents from airlines out of Korea. Factors such as organizational culture, leadership commitment, and managerial support—particularly empowering leadership—are also known to influence employee behavior and innovation. It has shown that empowering leadership fosters innovation by energizing employees and enhancing their capacity to learn, with participative decision-making playing a central role. While these variables were beyond the scope of the current study, we acknowledge their relevance and suggest that future research could incorporate these factors to further enrich the understanding of sustainability-related performance outcomes [102].

This study encompassed various service categories and durations, prompting inquiry into the transferability of these findings across differing service categories and years. Expanding the green environmental concept and optimizing the management of diverse workforces necessitates an understanding of how environmental stimuli shape employees’ ecological behavior and the sustainability among corporate airlines.

Consequently, conducting research within specific demographic backgrounds holds potential in evaluating the universal applicability of environmental triggers and sustainability. Subsequent studies might explore additional variables that could impact the efficacy of implementing green practices. A further limitation concerns the potential for reverse causality between employees’ ecological behaviour and organizational sustainability performance. Future studies should address this possibility explicitly, as stronger sustainability performance (e.g., through leadership signalling or environmental policies) may itself foster greater employee concern and awareness, thereby constraining the generalisability of the present findings.

""This project stands at the crossroads of two global challenges—waste management and decarbonization of transportation. Our Phase-1 completion confirms that we can turn trash into clean jet fuel at scale in Ghana 🇬🇭, with measurable environmental and economic impact,"" said Mr. Frederick Opoku Agyekum, Project Development Director of F&B Bio Recyclage Ltd.

The project has already attracted strong interest from international SAF off takers, infrastructure investors, and development finance institutions due to its replicable model, positive carbon intensity profile, and scalability across emerging and developed markets alike. In addition, we have established strong partnerships with local governments, waste management authorities, as well as leading technology and engineering partners to ensure smooth project implementation. These collaborations position us to deliver the project effectively, while creating both economic and environmental value.

Technology and Process: The project leverages state-of-the-art gasification technology to convert solid waste—such as municipal solid waste or industrial residues—into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This syngas is then processed through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven catalytic process developed in the 1920s and refined over decades, to produce liquid hydrocarbons suitable for use as SAF and biodiesel. These fuels offer a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels, with the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels.

The Fischer-Tropsch process is particularly well-suited for this application due to its ability to produce high-quality fuels from diverse feedstocks, including biomass and solid waste.

""This project stands at the crossroads of two global challenges—waste management and decarbonization of transportation. Our Phase-1 completion confirms that we can turn trash into clean jet fuel at scale in Ghana 🇬🇭, with measurable environmental and economic impact,"" said Mr. Frederick Opoku Agyekum, Project Development Director of F&B Bio Recyclage Ltd.

The project has already attracted strong interest from international SAF off takers, infrastructure investors, and development finance institutions due to its replicable model, positive carbon intensity profile, and scalability across emerging and developed markets alike. In addition, we have established strong partnerships with local governments, waste management authorities, as well as leading technology and engineering partners to ensure smooth project implementation. These collaborations position us to deliver the project effectively, while creating both economic and environmental value.

Technology and Process: The project leverages state-of-the-art gasification technology to convert solid waste—such as municipal solid waste or industrial residues—into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This syngas is then processed through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven catalytic process developed in the 1920s and refined over decades, to produce liquid hydrocarbons suitable for use as SAF and biodiesel. These fuels offer a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels, with the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels.

The Fischer-Tropsch process is particularly well-suited for this application due to its ability to produce high-quality fuels from diverse feedstocks, including biomass and solid waste. Recent advancements in catalyst formulations and reactor designs have further improved the efficiency and scalability of this technology, making it a cornerstone of modern biofuel production.

Technical Specifications

• Capacity: 2,000 tons per day of solid waste with 50% initial moisture content from source (households), reduced to 20% moisture content after drying.

• Technology: Integrated gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

• Products: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and biodiesel meeting ASTM D7566 & ASTM D975 specifications

In the 2024–25 fiscal year, Mumbai Airport handled 55 million passengers, while Delhi Airport remained the busiest in India with 79 million.
Globally, Dubai Airport led with approximately 92 million, London Heathrow had 84 million, Singapore Changi Airport recorded 68 million, and John F. Kennedy Airport handled 63 million passengers.
But even with Navi Mumbai Airport operational, Mumbai is unlikely to surpass GMR Airports-led Delhi Airport in passenger traffic soon.
Noida Airport, developed by Zurich Airport International AG, is expected to serve 6 million passengers in its first year.","A year before the pandemic, a SpiceJet flight skidded off Mumbai Airport’s main runway, taking over three days to remove the aircraft and reopen the runway, causing around 300 flight cancellations. India’s airports are getting a lot of state attention.

Such incidents underscored the urgent need for improved air traffic management in India’s financial capital.

This week, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates Navi Mumbai International Airport, a state-of-the-art facility on the city’s outskirts, the risk of similar disruptions is expected to decline.

The new airport, completed at an estimated $2 billion after more than two decades of planning, aims to mitigate air safety challenges, reduce aircraft congestion over Mumbai, and provide additional flight routes and slots that have been limited at the older, land-locked Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, originally established in 1942 by the British Royal Air Force as Santa Cruz Airport.

“Terminal One is complete, with a 20 million passenger capacity per annum, 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo capacity, and one runway,” said Vijay Singhal, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited (CIDCO) referring to the new airport. “Once fully operational, the two airports together will handle nearly 150 million passengers per year, positioning Mumbai as a major aviation hub in India.”

Navi Mumbai International Airport will be the first aerodrome in India to be seamlessly connected by expressways, metro, suburban rail, highways, and even water taxi, and it will also feature facilities for storing sustainable aviation fuel, he added.

In the 2024–25 fiscal year, Mumbai Airport handled 55 million passengers, while Delhi Airport remained the busiest in India with 79 million. Globally, Dubai Airport led with approximately 92 million, London Heathrow had 84 million, Singapore Changi Airport recorded 68 million, and John F. Kennedy Airport handled 63 million passengers.

But even with Navi Mumbai Airport operational, Mumbai is unlikely to surpass GMR Airports-led Delhi Airport in passenger traffic soon. The existing Mumbai Airport will shut Terminal One for renovations, diverting some traffic to the new facility. Both airports are managed by Adani Airports Ltd.

Meanwhile, Delhi is set to get its second airport in the next few weeks as well. Noida Airport, developed by Zurich Airport International AG, is expected to serve 6 million passengers in its first year. With Delhi’s upgraded airport now capable of handling 110 million passengers, the capital is expected to maintain its lead.

For context, the last time Mumbai’s airport handled more passengers than Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport was in 2010, when Delhi recorded 12.2 million passengers and Mumbai 12.1 million.

There is no dearth of takers for all the incoming airport capacity.

Currently, Indian airlines, including IndiGo, Air India, and Akasa Air, have over 1,800 aircraft on order and India’s air traffic is growing at around 8%. Demand for airport parking bays and slots remains strong, with airlines already announcing plans to start flights once commercial operations begin in December at both these airports.

“What we feel is that there is scope for more airlines because the way the sector is growing we need more players,” India’s director general of civil aviation Faiz Ahmed Kidwai said in a recent interview, “If more carriers come, yes, they’ll have an opportunity.”

While new airlines don’t appear to be on the horizon yet, this massive capacity built up has also raised some key questions : Will these heavily invested airports lower air travel costs for passengers? How will they ensure fair and equitable operations? Will the two Mumbai airports, controlled by the same firm, genuinely compete or will competition be felt only at Delhi?

Over the next year, airlines, airports, and regulators will navigate these issues, even as passengers enjoy some relief from congestion and prolonged aircraft hovering over the city and Navi Mumbai International Airport finally reinforces Mumbai’s role as a key global aviation hub in the world’s fastest growing major aviation market.

Now, managing the business aviation team at another brokerage, Hunt & Palmer, her job, based at the firm’s offices in rural West Sussex, involves less globetrotting.
Black describes the personal service Hunt & Palmer provides as more flight management than pure brokerage.
In 2026, Hunt & Palmer will be 40 years old.
“It’s the people that really make this place.” COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE Charter brokerage is a competitive business, and one in which trusted relationships built over years are crucial.","Becoming a jet-setting aviation professional was never one of Julie Black’s childhood career goals. Growing up in a working-class family in London’s east end, she was 16 before she flew on an airliner. However, by her 20s she was travelling the world with rock stars supporting tours for a specialist charter brokerage. It gave her a chance to combine, she says, what had become her two loves: aviation and music.

Now, managing the business aviation team at another brokerage, Hunt & Palmer, her job, based at the firm’s offices in rural West Sussex, involves less globetrotting. But she says she loves the unpredictable, fast paced, demanding nature of supervising every aspect of clients’ private travel requirements, whether they are bankers on a US roadshow, billionaires summering in Barbados, or bands playing stadiums in Sydney.

Black was the first in her family to go to university – few of her teenage friends did. After graduating with a degree in communications, she mulled becoming a teacher. Then, sheltering from the rain one day outside a temping agency, she popped in for want of something better to do and was offered a job as an administrative assistant with London City Airport’s marketing department.

This was the mid-1990s and the Docklands airport and the high-rise financial district emerging around it was still gleamingly new. “I had an incredible time there,” she recalls. “I thought it was incredibly glamorous with all these people in suits checking in 15 minutes before their flights to Europe’s business capitals. I thought this was the future and I was hooked. My love for aviation was established.”

CHARTER BROKERS

A five-year stint in marketing for Biggin Hill – a business and general aviation airport on the southern edge of the capital – put her in touch with charter brokers for the first time. That led to 15 years with brokerage Chapman Freeborn, where she went on to run its music tour arm, often flying with the performers all over the world and making on-the-spot travel arrangements.

She remembers it as a thrilling period in her life – tales included being chased by excitable fans at an airport while wheeling a certain Irish rock star’s personal effects to a waiting van. But the demands of long-haul travel and being on call 24/7 took its toll. “It was intense, and I was working on very little sleep,” she says. “I had two young daughters and was spending a lot of my time away. Even when I got home, I wasn’t present. Something had to change.”

In 2017, she moved to Chapman Freeborn’s rival Hunt & Palmer, where her current job as manager, executive aviation involves running the brokerage teams across the family company’s business aviation and music touring divisions. Clients include high-net-worth individuals, financial institutions and corporations, high-end travel agencies, and tour promoters.

Like all brokers, Hunt & Palmer does not hold an air operator’s certificate or operate flights itself but charters them on behalf of customers, often getting involved in other aspects of the journey, from arranging ground transport and pet permits to ensuring the principal’s favourite meal or beverage is on board. Black describes the personal service Hunt & Palmer provides as more flight management than pure brokerage.

She rarely knows how each day will pan out when she arrives for work. The music side is often the “most planned it gets” with tours organised months in advance to the last detail. Those details can be crucial. Often a performance will end too late for a departing aircraft to beat a night-time curfew. At other times, an airport will not have a separate fixed-base operation or private terminal, leaving the entire entourage – together with their luggage and equipment – to negotiate the passenger building.

On the corporate side, deadlines tend to be much tighter. “It can be two or three weeks out; at other times it’s ‘go now’,” says Black. Her record from point of request to clients boarding the aircraft is 38 minutes. A group of Swiss financiers in London had to get to Zurich for a crisis meeting; Black located a business jet that had just landed at City Airport and had no other flight planned that evening. The bankers were in the air within the hour.

In 2026, Hunt & Palmer will be 40 years old. Founders Peter Hunt and Jeremy Palmer are still involved with the business although they have handed over to a senior management team the day-to-day running of a company that has a global client base and satellite offices in Dallas, Daytona, Australia’s Gold Coast and Hong Kong. Black says one of the firm’s strengths is the loyalty it inspires in its long-serving staff. “The company is part of their DNA,” she maintains. “It’s the people that really make this place.”

COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE

Charter brokerage is a competitive business, and one in which trusted relationships built over years are crucial. With modern technology supplementing industry knowledge and contact books, it is often tempting for individual agents to set up on their own and take customers with them. “But when they do that, clients risk losing this machine behind them,” says Black, pointing out her busy office. “There is so much collective experience here, as well as the group’s reputation and buying power.”

Black, who is deputy chair of the Air Charter Association industry body, is saddened by the lack of understanding from politicians and other opinion-formers of a sector that creates economic value and societal benefit, especially in Europe. “Slots and airport access are a huge problem that is only getting worse, which is terrible for our industry when it comes to promoting the flexibility of business aviation,” she says.

While picking on billionaires in business jets may not be a vote-loser, Black says many of her clients “also fly on EasyJet or Ryanair” and private jets are more about convenience, security, and saving time than travelling in opulence. In addition, she says business aviation’s pioneering environmental contributions are often overlooked, including being the first to adopt winglets and sustainable aviation fuel.

Black is an advocate for encouraging women into the sector, and not just as cabin crew. “When I started and said I worked in aviation, people asked: ‘Oh, are you a stewardess? But it’s slowly getting better,” she says. “As natural multi-taskers, women tend to be good at this job, and we often have greater human sensitivity, which makes us better at the soft skills when dealing with people. But don’t get me wrong. I love planes too. It still blows me away that a business jet can fly for 16 hours.”

Black maintains that after 30 years in the business she still “learns something new every week, if not every day”. It is also a job that inspires pride. “When an artist steps out in front of 80,000 fans, you think: ‘I helped make that happen’. Or it could equally be when you’ve arranged for a child in Africa to be medevac’d to Europe for life-saving cancer treatment.”

And in a high-pressure profession, a thank-you goes a long way. “People only normally contact you when things go wrong,” she says. “So, when things go well, and someone sends a note to say so, it still makes us feel good.”",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/1/5/4/113154_julieblack_7295_crop.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 05:58:45.096112

In the executive summary to its annual renewable energy report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said, “Global renewable power capacity is expected to double between now and 2030, increasing by 4,600 gigawatts. This is roughly the equivalent of adding China, the European Union, and Japan’s power generation capacity combined to the global energy mix. Solar PV accounts for almost 80 percent of the global increase, followed by wind, hydropower, bioenergy, and geothermal.

“In more than 80 percent of countries worldwide, renewable power capacity is set to grow faster between 2025 and 2030 than it did over the previous five year period. However, challenges including grid integration, supply chain vulnerabilities, and financing are also increasing.” You can download the full report at this link.

Carbon Brief has taken the data supplied by the IEA and converted it into a chart that illustrates the changes.

The 2025 Renewables report shows that more than 100 countries have cut their dependence on fossil fuel imports and saved hundreds of billions of dollars by continuing to invest in renewables. This is despite the global full court press in favor of expanding the use of fossil fuels from the US being conducted by the current US administration.

The UK, Germany, and Chile have reduced their need for imported coal and gas by around a third since 2010, mainly by building wind and solar power. Denmark has cut its reliance on fossil fuel imports by nearly half over the same period. Renewable expansion allowed these nations to collectively avoid importing 700 million tons of coal and 400 billion cubic meters of methane in 2023, which is equivalent to about 10 percent of global consumption.

In doing so, the fuel importing countries saved more than $1.3 trillion between 2010 and 2023 that would otherwise have been spent on imported fossil fuels. The Renewables 2025 report compares recent trends in renewable expansion to an alternative “low renewable-energy source” scenario in which the increase in local renewable energy did not take place. Roughly 80% of this new renewable capacity was built in nations that rely on coal and gas imports to generate electricity.

In total, the IEA identified 107 countries that had reduced their dependence on fossil fuel imports for electricity generation because of their transition to renewables other than hydropower. 38 cut their reliance on electricity from imported coal and gas by more than 10 percentage points and eight had seen that share drop by more than 30 percentage points.

In its report, the IEA stressed that renewables “inherently strengthen energy supply security,” because they generate electricity domestically, while also “improving…economic resilience” in those countries. The effect is seen most strongly in countries that previously relied on methane gas exports from Russia. Bulgaria, Romania and Finland, which all were dependent on Russian methane supplies, have all brought their reliance on imported fossil fuels close to zero in recent years by building renewables.

In the UK, where there has been mounting opposition to renewables from right wing political parties, the IEA says reliance on electricity generated with imported fossil fuels has dropped from 45% to under 25% in the past ten years, thanks primarily to the growth of wind and solar power. Without those renewables, 60% of electricity generation in the UK would depend on imported fossil fuels the IEA report said. The same is true for China and the European Union. Finally, the IEA points out that spending on renewables rather than imported fossil fuels keeps more investment in domestic economies and supports local jobs.

Renewable Transportation

The IEA Renewables 2025 report also deals with the transportation and heat sectors. For transportation, it said “renewable energy consumption in transport is expected to rise 50 percent by 2030. The largest share of this growth — 45 percent — will come from renewable electricity used for electric vehicles, especially in China and Europe.”

“Road biofuels contribute the second-largest share — 35 percent –with significant growth in Brazil, Indonesia, India and Malaysia, supported by tightening mandates and rising fuel demand. Aviation and maritime fuel use make up 10 percent of growth, primarily owing to mandates in Europe, and the remaining 10 percent comes from bio-methane, renewable hydrogen,and hydrogen based fuels, with activity concentrated in the United States and Europe.

“Globally, EVs are expected to account for more than 15% of the vehicle stock by 2030, with renewable electricity meeting more than half of electricity demand in key markets. In China, EVs represent more than one third of cars on the road by 2030 as vehicle costs decline and charging infrastructure continues to be enhanced. At the same time, renewable electricity is expected to make up over half of China’s total power generation.”

With respect to aircraft and maritime fuels, the IEA report claims sustainable aviation fuel will account for 2% of demand by 2030 — an indication that uptake of SAF will be constrained in the near term by higher prices. “Mandates in the European Union and United Kingdom, incentives in the United States, and blending targets in Japan drive most of this growth.”

Demand for biodiesel in the maritime industry is projected to double by 2030. That sounds promising, but only means it will account for about 1% of all maritime fuel usage. There is a long way to to yet in that sector.

For road transportation, the IEA is forecasting an increase in biofuel use of 50% by 2030, except in the US, where “lower EV sales and recent changes to Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards that reduce overall fleet efficiency have prompted us to increase our [conventional] transport fuel demand forecast from last year.”

Heat

“Heat accounted for almost half of total final energy consumption and 37% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2024,” the IEA reports says. “Annual heat consumption expanded by 6 percent globally over 2018-2024. Renewable energy, excluding traditional uses of biomass, met only half of this increase, with its share in global heat consumption rising to 14 percent in 2024. Nearly 80 percent of global growth in renewable heat use was in the form of bioenergy — especially in industry — and renewable electricity — mainly in buildings.”

The largest increase in renewable heat in the past 6 years occurred in China, supported by strong policy incentives and falling renewable electricity prices. The next largest increase took place in India and the European Union. Heat pump deployment has played a major role, translating into rising consumption of both electricity and ambient heat for space and water heating. Large additional contributions also came from electric heating equipment and solar thermal and geothermal developments in China.

The Takeaway

What can we learn from this year’s Renewables 2025 report? Simply this. The transition to renewables is now unstoppable. Not only is renewable energy the least expensive source of electricity, it promotes energy security so that countries that do not enjoy a surfeit of fossil fuels can power their economies themselves without being dependent on other countries.

Think about it this way. One of the reasons Japan attacked the US on December 7, 1941 was because the US had interdicted its supply of oil. If Japan in 1941 had access to renewable energy, Pearl Harbor may never have happened, which means Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never have happened either. The price of fossil fuels is much, much higher than the price of gasoline at the pump.

The other benefit is that fossil fuels are so inefficient that two-thirds or more of the energy contained in them is wasted, much of it as heat. Renewables are orders of magnitude more efficient. What possible sense could it make to go to war — actually or virtually — over something so wasteful? That is just insane!

The US, sadly, is looking at things through the wrong end of the telescope. Its leaders will be vilified by history as clueless morons. Despite all their chest thumping on behalf of fossil fuels, they will end up being exposed as the idiots they truly are.

The IEA has been criticized repeatedly for being too conservative in its prognostications. If that is so, then the renewable energy future is even brighter than they claim.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/solar-farm-wisconsin-doral.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 19:57:50.653413

""This project stands at the crossroads of two global challenges—waste management and decarbonization of transportation. Our Phase-1 completion confirms that we can turn trash into clean jet fuel at scale in Ghana 🇬🇭, with measurable environmental and economic impact,"" said Mr. Frederick Opoku Agyekum, Project Development Director of F&B Bio Recyclage Ltd.

The project has already attracted strong interest from international SAF off takers, infrastructure investors, and development finance institutions due to its replicable model, positive carbon intensity profile, and scalability across emerging and developed markets alike. In addition, we have established strong partnerships with local governments, waste management authorities, as well as leading technology and engineering partners to ensure smooth project implementation. These collaborations position us to deliver the project effectively, while creating both economic and environmental value.

Technology and Process: The project leverages state-of-the-art gasification technology to convert solid waste—such as municipal solid waste or industrial residues—into syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This syngas is then processed through Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, a proven catalytic process developed in the 1920s and refined over decades, to produce liquid hydrocarbons suitable for use as SAF and biodiesel. These fuels offer a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels, with the potential to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional petroleum-based fuels.

The Fischer-Tropsch process is particularly well-suited for this application due to its ability to produce high-quality fuels from diverse feedstocks, including biomass and solid waste. Recent advancements in catalyst formulations and reactor designs have further improved the efficiency and scalability of this technology, making it a cornerstone of modern biofuel production.

Technical Specifications

• Capacity: 2,000 tons per day of solid waste with 50% initial moisture content from source (households), reduced to 20% moisture content after drying.

• Technology: Integrated gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis

• Products: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and biodiesel meeting ASTM D7566 & ASTM D975 specifications

• Efficiency: Optimized energy recovery and product yield

• Final Output: 2000 bbl/d (SAF & Bio diesel)

Next Steps; With Phase 1 successfully completed, we are now advancing to Phase 2, which will focus on:

• Detailed engineering and procurement activities

• Environmental permitting and regulatory approvals

• Construction planning and contractor selection

• Financial close and project financing completion

We are currently receiving proposals for Phase 2 from qualified engineering firms and technology partners, to progress toward the Front-End Engineering Design (PRE-FEED) phase. This will be followed by a comprehensive FEED (FEL-3) phase, culminating in the Final Investment Decision (FID) and the commencement of Construction.

We extend our sincere appreciation to our Team, Technology and Engineering partners, advisors, and stakeholders whose expertise and collaboration have been instrumental in achieving this milestone.

Stay tuned for further updates as we progress into the next exciting phase of development.

The permit allows for piloted flights of the Axe VCA (Vertically Capable Aircraft) in the USA and enables the tricycle-wheeled eVTOL aircraft to continue an accelerated flight test program in the USA. It also grants Skyfly access to the larger US market for personal eVTOLs, which several companies are hoping to supply into after the FAA recently introduced the MOSAIC (Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification ) rule, which places certain eVTOLs in the Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) category.

Skyfly’s Axe eVTOL specification

Oxfordshire, UK-based company Skyfly has been developing the Axe in the UK so far. The company completed Europe’s first airfield-to-airfield flight of an eVTOL aircraft using its Axe prototype in July.

The Axe has an all-electric range of 100 miles (160km) and an estimated top cruise speed of 100 mph (161 km/h). A hybrid option is under development, which will offer a 300 mile (480km) range.

The two-seat aircraft is powered by eight electric motors – two on each wingtip within a single nacelle and is powered by swappable lithium batteries housed within the fuselage.

USA flight testing

Following the Axe’s North American debut at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s AirVenture show at Oshkosh during July, Skyfly’s prototype Axe VCA (Serial Number 001, registration N250EV) will now remain in the USA.

Skyfly plans to conduct verification flights this winter and begin customer demonstrations in the New Year.

According to Skyfly, relocating flight testing to the USA will mean engineers can test the aircraft through the winter thanks to the more stable weather. It will also allow the Axe SN001 to act as a customer demonstrator in the country.

The company is targeting summer 2026 for the first customer deliveries.

Michael Thompson, CEO of Skyfly said, “Receiving FAA Experimental authorization is a major milestone for Skyfly. It allows us to move forward with piloted flight testing under the world’s most respected aviation regulator, while positioning the Axe at the heart of the US market – the largest and most dynamic general aviation community in the world.

“With this approval, the Axe begins the next phase of its journey from prototype to production aircraft, as we continue to demonstrate that a safe, efficient, and truly practical personal electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft is already here.”

MOSAIC rules for eVTOLs

In July, the FAA introduced the MOSAIC rule, which puts smaller eVTOL aircraft into the LSA category. This offers a simpler and shorter certification pathway outside of Part 23, which is for larger aircraft and includes airworthiness standards for utility and commuter category aircraft.

It allows smaller eVTOL aircraft, such as the Axe to be flown by those holding a Sports Pilot Certificate, in addition to a full pilot license. The new rules will also allow the Axe to be used for some commercial purposes.",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Axe-Oshkosh.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-10-10 20:57:51.014751

From plant to plant, the list of variables any leadership team may have to navigate when working to bring a CCS project to bear can seem never-ending and nuanced—even the smallest differences can create big challenges. Above-ground geography and below-ground geology both matter, but for different reasons. CO2 infrastructure experts and technology providers are important, so too are carbon-focused end-users. Internal team buy-in is crucial, almost as much as the support of external stakeholders.

The road to fully integrated CCS or carbon neutrality is—and has been—different from plant to plant for producers not linked to a multi-state pipeline solution. Those that have made progress to date have taken a multifaceted approach. Some are further along than others, sometimes based on their location.

Ethanol Producer Magazine checked in with several ethanol producers across the country on progress in planning, permitting and their respective carbon-intensity reduction plans. Support for individual, plant-specific CCS has sprouted and spread—despite its challenges—from the Corn Belt to the West Coast.

Conestoga’s Net-Zero Goal

Conestoga Energy CEO Tom Willis says his team in Kansas was all about carbon before carbon was ever cool. According to Willis, Conestoga was the first to take low-carbon fuel to California under the LCFS back in 2010. Through two Kansas plants, Conestoga produces roughly 200 million gallons of ethanol per year: 115 MMgy at the Arkalon facility near Liberal and 62 MMgy at the Bonanza plant in Garden City.

The Arkalon facility has been capturing CO2 for roughly 15 years as part of an enhanced oil recovery CO2 injection program operated by CapturePoint LLC throughout parts of Kansas and Oklahoma.

“We looked at carbon and said we could expand and grow,” Willis says of his team’s early adoption of a carbon-focused strategy. Today, Conestoga refers to itself as a low-carbon solutions provider, not just an ethanol producer.

“We are trying to become net zero,” Willis says.

To do that, Conestoga has expanded its CCS efforts to both plants. In May, the company announced drilling was complete on its first Class VI CCS well near its Garden City plant. Willis called the well the “cornerstone of Conestoga’s initiative to permanently store carbon dioxide emissions generated during the ethanol production process.”

The CCS project will be a long-term staple of Conestoga’s net-zero vision, Willis says, but the company will continue to explore ways to lower its CI score and maintain a strong connection to markets in need of carbon solutions, both domestic and foreign.

After completing work on the Class VI well, several interested parties from fertilizer manufacturers to warehouse owners have reached out to Conestoga regarding carbon-sequestration possibilities. “They are coming to us,” Willis says. “We don’t have to go to them.”

The carbon-centric model is one others can follow, Willis says, regardless of a plant’s geographic or geologic footprint. While he notes some plants aren’t able to sequester, he also says every plant can benefit from carbon-related planning or investments, some but not all of which are related to the continuance of the 45Z tax credit.

In addition to the 2024 purchase of a Class VI well which included the leases and easements, Conestoga has also purchased CCS equipment and a CO2 flood field that can use fermentation CO2 for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery efforts in Kansas. The Class VI well work has now moved onto the permitting stage for the U.S. EPA to review.

In August, Conestoga also acquired SAFFiRE Renewables LLC from Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures LLC. As envisioned, SAFFiRE’s process technology will enable the production of ultra low-carbon intensity ethanol and intermediates.

Willis says his team is working on the buildout of a pilot plant at the Arkalon facility that could be ready by Q4 2026.

The SAFFiRE technology will aid Conestoga’s efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel feedstock. “The IP acquired in this transaction will provide us with tremendous optionality, not only as it relates to SAF feedstock production, but across our operations,” Willis said in August. “The momentum behind low-CI fuels is undeniable, driven by regulatory requirements, corporate commitments and environmental necessity.”

On top of the Class VI well work, investment in SAFFiRE and the overarching company approach to become a multifaceted low-carbon solutions provider that just happens to make ethanol, Conestoga is planning to invest in paying and training farmers for grain traceability. Such an effort will further reduce the plant’s CI score and help make Conestoga’s sustainability-infused growth plan “sustainable,” Willis says.

One Earth Sequestration

Since first partnering with the Illinois State Geological Survey in 2020, Illinois-based One Earth Energy continues to make progress on a CCS well and CO2 pipeline project that would capture and inject fermentation CO2. A proposed 5.62 mile underground pipeline would move fermentation CO2 from the ethanol plant to an injection well that has already been drilled.

Steve Kelly, general manager for the plant near Gibson City, says his team continues to work through the EPA to receive the Class VI permit for the well. The EPA expects a final permit decision in March 2026, according to the agency’s Class VI well permit tracker.

One Earth Energy created a website—One Earth Sequestration—to keep the public updated on the project, specifically around water quality and safety. The new website explains the state-of-the-art safety features that will be used, including automatic shut-off valves, around-the-clock in-person monitoring, reduced pipeline segments, leak detection, flow measurement devices, monitoring wells, six-foot burial and underground signage and more. Kelly and the team have also organized hazmat training hosted by the Illinois Fire Service, in addition to specific CO2 pipeline training hosted by ExxonMobil. The current work is all in addition to the pre-feasibility and geological studies One Earth Energy already completed to ensure such a project would be economically and environmentally sound, Kelly says.

The next milestones on the timeline revolve around the Class VI permit, acquiring the Certificate of Authority from the Illinois Commerce Commission to construct a CO2 pipeline and securing a Special Use Permit in McLean County, Illinois, at the sequestration well site.

Kelly says the company has worked with governing bodies ranging from local municipalities up to state and federal agencies. It has also worked with landowners to voluntarily secure pore space and pipeline lease agreements. One Earth has held more than 70 public meetings or sessions with farmers.

The CCS work and investment will impact the plant and community in multiple ways, Kelly says. “Once completed, our CCS will capture and compress 521,000 metric tons of CO2 annually. That’s like taking nearly 124,000 gasoline-powered cars off the road for one year.”

According to One Earth Sequestration, the project will generate $231 million in economic activity for Ford County, Illinois, including more than 300 new jobs and nearly $19 million in county and state tax revenue.

“For One Earth Energy, it means we’ll have the opportunity to expand our business into sustainable aviation fuel, which is the next step in renewable fuels,” Kelly says. “It also brings additional stability and longevity to our business and community.”

Chief Ethanol Set for November

Nebraska-based Chief Ethanol General Manager Wayne Garrett joined Brooke Rollins, USDA Secretary, in Nebraska in August to talk biofuels, agriculture and America’s renewable energy future. In November, Garrett expects to be capturing CO2 from fermentation ethanol.

Starting in 2021, Chief Ethanol partnered with Catahoula Resources and the Energy Minerals Group along with Battelle to develop CCS solutions for Chief’s two ethanol plants in Nebraska.

The new CCS infrastructure will capture and store 350,000 metric tons of CO2 through compression stations that will ultimately link to a Catahoula operated pipeline solution.

Gevo Selling Carbon Credits

Gevo Inc. has already earned dividends from its $210 million acquisition of a North Dakota Ethanol plant fully equiped with operating CCS assets. After purchasing Red Trail Energy in early 2025, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber renamed the assets Net-Zero North.

In July, Gevo announced it was officially selling carbon abatement credits into the market. The CCS process creates a carbon removal credit or CO2 removal certificate (CORC). In Gevo’s case, a global financial and technology company purchases CORCs and then retires them to meet its own CO2 abatement requirements.

Puro.earth, a Nasdaq-funded firm that certifies CORCs across the globe and provides a marketplace for suppliers and buyers, provided certification of the Gevo produced CORCs.

“Gevo is demonstrating that durable carbon removal isn’t some distant solution,” says Trenton Spindler, chief growth officer of Puro.earth, “It’s available now. With Puro.earth. certified CORCs, buyers worldwide can act decisively to tackle their toughest emissions with confidence in real, permanent results.”

Puro.earth has strict standards for CORC generation, including 1,000-plus-year permeance of storage. In July, Puro.earth’s CORC index showed CORC prices at roughly $150 each. From 2020 to November 2024, Puro.earth said the use of CORCs increased by 1,200%, rising from 12,000 units produced and sold per year to nearly 160,000. Starting in 2022, many CORC buyers began seeking offtake agreements of three- to five-year periods, but by 2024, many larger CORC buyers were looking for even longer-term CORC supply agreements.

Blue Flint’s CCS Tax Equity Benefits

CCS work at Harvestone Low Carbon Partners’ Blue Flint Ethanol plant in North Dakota continues to pay off. After commencing operation of a 125,000-metric-ton CO2 capture infrastructure and pipeline project in 2023, HLCP announced nearly a year later that it had closed on a first-of-its-kind tax equity financing round with Bank of America worth $205 million.

HLCP was able to structure a tax equity financing package that would allow Bank of America to participate in the 45Q federal tax credit benefits and purchase 45Z clean fuel tax credits generated by Blue Flint’s CCS biorefinery operations.

Karen Fang, global head of sustainable finance at Bank of America, says her team has a strong track record of innovative financing transactions for decarbonization technologies including CCS. Essentially, Bank of America receives that tax credit benefit in exchange for financing. HLCP has not said how it will utilize any Bank of America proceeds, but it does operate additional ethanol facilities that are actively developing or studying CCS infrastructure in North Dakota and Indiana.

Permitting in Process

The Andersons Inc. has acquired full ownership of the four ethanol plants it previously co-owned with a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp., a move the publicly traded grain and biofuels company says will allow for greater efficiency and streamlining of its operations. In its Q2 earnings call, the company stated that the regulatory environment for biofuels, “may support new opportunities,” including at the company’s Clymers, Indiana, facility where a Class VI well permit has been filed with the EPA for CCS.

Front Range Energy in Colorado continues developing its CCS operation, with a completed test well on its property, and is awaiting the Class VI permit. Through a subsidiary called Carbon Capture Solutions, Front Range Energy is playing a part in shaping the future regulatory and compliance framework for CCS in Colorado. In December 2024, representatives from Carbon Capture Solutions participated in discussions with the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) regarding state-level authority over geologic carbon storage. ECMC has now created a state-based policy on CCS with the goal of obtaining primacy over the EPA, similar to other states, including North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana.

In California, Aemetis awaits approval of its Class VI well permit for CCS operation that will inject roughly 1.4 million tons of CO2 into a saline formation. Baker Hughes, an oil and gas drilling company, is leading the underground engineering and drilling work, including consultation and project design. ATSI, an engineering, procurement, construction and project management firm, is helping on the project as well.

Expertise and Experience

Vault 44.01 is contracted or partnered with seven different ethanol producers. The CCS experts help each create on-site or near on-site CCS capabilities. Scott Rennie, president and CEO of Vault 44.01, says despite a range of challenges each plant may face, Vault 44.01 has a unique combination of technical expertise and CCS experience.

Hugh Caperton, senior vice president of development for Vault, says the company has grown a presence across the ethanol sector because it has expertise in all facets required to make a CCS project successful, including landowner agreements, commercial development structuring, technical expertise and permitting.

Cardinal Ethanol was the first to join with Vault 44.01. Today, other Vault 44.01 partners include plants owned by Valero, POET and Alto Ingredients. Cardinal Ethanol could earn its Class VI well permit in January 2026, according to projections by the EPA tracker database.

Rennie is quick to point out that the state where a CCS project is located greatly impacts the timeline for completion. North Dakota has seen multiple projects completed because the state has primacy over CCS regulations and permitting. States without primacy must rely on federal regulations, drawing out the timeline. The current administration has made a big difference in the speed at which the Vault team can move on permitting progress, Rennie says.

“We’ve made more progress on our permits recently than we have in the previous two years under the past administration,” Rennie says.

Like Rennie, Caperton is optimistic about the pace of project timelines in 2025 and beyond. He points out that CCS has always had bipartisan support in Congress. Every project will have challenges in design, community engagement and permitting.

“For us, it comes down to having the right skillset and energy level to bring these things to completion,” Rennie says. “Our team had a track record even before we started helping ethanol producers.”

Both Rennie and Caperton believe the ethanol sector’s CCS abilities will act as a seed from which producers and future industries can grow.

“CCS is a gateway,” Caperton says.

For its current producer partners, Vault is focusing on on-site or near on-site CCS. Initially, the team explored options to create connected CO2 sequestration hubs. Rennie says the economics and land commitment agreements were too difficult to pursue. The cost of running and operating pipeline can sometimes be in the range of $1 million or more per half mile. Some CO2 hubs connecting ethanol plants would need at least 40 miles of pipeline, Rennie explains, as most plants in a concentrated area suitable for a hub are 40 to 50 miles apart.

In most cases, Vault is capturing a single source of CO2 and has a flowline on the producer’s property connected to a sequestration or compression station.

“If you were to look at our projects from outer space, the projects are going to look very similar,” Rennie says.

In March last year, Alto Ingredients signed with Vault to further its CCS aspirations. Through the agreement, Alto will install CCS equipment at its Pekin, Illinois, dry mill, and Vault will transport and permanently store the CO2 underground within close proximity.

Bryon McGregor, president and CEO of Alto, says the agreement with Vault will serve shareholders and community stakeholders alike. In addition to operating two ethanol production facilities, Alto operates a liquid CO2 facility in Boardman, Oregon. In early 2025, Alto acquired Kodiak Carbonic LLC, a beverage-grade liquid carbon dioxide processor for $7.25 million.

“In our ongoing pursuit to optimize product value, we identified the beverage-grade liquid CO2 plant as a significant opportunity and pursued the acquisition to continue to expand our premium ingredients portfolio,” McGregor says.

The Time Is Now for On-Site CCS

Rennie says there has never been a better time for CO2 producers like Alto, Cardinal Ethanol and others to pursue CCS. “Now is the right time. The industry has learned a lot about CCS and the current administration has a proclivity for action and accountability.

“The project with Alto exemplifies our view that one of the best options for CCS is often a local solution.”

Sylvain Riba, president and CEO of the Houston-based team of underground energy storage and subsurface injection experts at Geostock Sandia, says the ethanol industry has maintained CCUS momentum since an uptick started in 2020. Riba and his team have been involved with eight ethanol-related CCS wells in the Midwest over the past five years, including the well for North Dakota’s Blue Flint Ethanol.

“We make the earth the best place to store energy,” Riba says. “We know how to drill wells and demonstrate this is the right place to store.”

Geostock Sandia expanded its drilling services for Class VI wells in the early 2000s and has since been a big participant in the CarbonSAFE program under the U.S. Department of Energy. Prior to that, Geostock Sandia helped lead the creation of salt cavern storage for hydrocarbons in the U.S.

Like the natural gas industry, Riba says many ethanol producers are now aware of the value and need for storing carbon.

“A lot of producers realize it’s possible to reduce the intensity of the existing industry and infrastructure in-place,” Riba says.

Successful projects led by teams like Geostock Sandia have helped show what is possible, he adds. The addition of voluntary carbon markets and private equity investors that want to participate in CCS or credit markets has also helped build momentum in the ethanol space.

“If I’m an ethanol producer today, I need to know CCS is safe, it is cost effective and it can really help improve your product,” Riba says.

He explains that a project started in 2025 will still take roughly three years to go through studies, well testing, permitting, infrastructure build-out and additional work, he says. Geostock Sandia can provide management of the process, man the facilities or train current workforce and help maintain the infrastructure for the life of the well. States including North Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana are all prime for well drilling, he says.

Because of the work and history of Geostock Sandia, Riba says the process today is simpler than most might think. It’s about logistics and managing the land, all skills ethanol producers already possess, he says. Trading on the carbon market is similar to any other daily process, including managing grain payments, he adds.

“Underground storage is really safe and now the momentum is there and it is a really good time to do it,” Riba says. “You don’t have to bring a lot of technology or create a complex logistics process. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.”

This partnership aims to advance key environmental objectives, including the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable energy technologies, and zero-emission transportation solutions. By pooling their resources and expertise, both nations are committed to reducing emissions, promoting renewable energy, and achieving net-zero targets. This collaborative effort not only highlights the shared environmental goals of Australia and Singapore but also sets a strong precedent for international cooperation in tackling climate change and fostering a greener, more sustainable global economy.

Singapore and Australia have formalised a new agreement aimed at advancing their clean energy ambitions, particularly in the areas of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biofuels, and other green energy initiatives. The announcement, made on October 8 during the 10th Annual Leaders’ Meeting, marks a pivotal moment in the partnership between the two nations. This agreement falls under the umbrella of an upgraded Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP 2.0), which encompasses a broader range of goals, including net-zero emissions targets, enhanced defence cooperation, and bolstered trade relations.

This newly signed agreement seeks to foster closer collaboration between Singapore and Australia on clean energy technologies, with a special focus on sustainable aviation fuel. One of the key components of this collaboration is the agreement signed between Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry and the state of Victoria in Australia. The deal outlines several key areas of exploration, including the development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, the advancement of zero-emission transportation solutions, renewable energy storage technologies, hydrogen energy, and offshore wind power projects.

The CSP 2.0 framework aims to support these efforts over the next decade, offering a structured approach to achieve long-term goals while promoting innovation and investment in the clean energy sector. The plan also includes increased public and private sector cooperation, with both governments committing to mobilising the necessary resources to accelerate the development of these technologies.

In terms of current progress, Singapore’s biofuels sector is more advanced than Australia’s, with the country already housing one of the world’s largest sustainable aviation fuel refineries. The Neste refinery in Singapore has a production capacity of 1 million tonnes of SAF annually, setting a significant benchmark for global biofuel production. This infrastructure plays a crucial role in helping Singapore meet its environmental and sustainability goals, and the country plans to further solidify its leadership in this field by introducing a SAF blending rule in 2026. This rule will require airlines to use at least 1% SAF in all departing flights, with the long-term goal of raising this proportion to between 3% and 5% by 2030.

Australia, however, is not far behind in its clean energy ambitions. While the country’s biofuels sector is still in development, it has an advantage in biofuel feedstock production. Australia’s agricultural industry, particularly its tallow production, plays a vital role in the global renewable fuel supply chain. Tallow, a key raw material for producing renewable fuel, is abundant in Australia, and the country has become a significant supplier of this material to Singapore. In 2024, Singapore imported 296,000 tonnes of Australian tallow, underscoring the deepening energy relationship between the two nations.

To support Australia’s transition to cleaner energy sources, the government has established a federal fund worth A$1.1 billion (approximately US$730 million). This fund is designed to help meet the country’s ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030, with particular focus on sustainable fuel development, renewable energy projects, and clean energy infrastructure. The commitment to supporting the green energy transition is a clear indication of Australia’s determination to play a significant role in the global shift toward sustainability.

In addition to clean energy projects, Singapore and Australia have also strengthened their cooperation on electricity trade through the finalisation of the Cross-Border Electricity Trade framework. Initially developed in 2024, this framework aims to enhance regional electricity trade and energy security, contributing to the broader goals of achieving net-zero emissions for both countries. This framework is expected to facilitate the development of energy transmission infrastructure between the two nations, paving the way for new projects such as Australia’s SunCable initiative.

The SunCable project is one of the most ambitious clean energy projects in the region. It seeks to transmit solar power generated in Australia to Singapore via an undersea cable, known as the Australia-Asia Power Link. Scheduled for completion by 2035, this project has the potential to revolutionise the way both countries approach energy generation and consumption, providing Singapore with a reliable, renewable energy source and supporting Australia’s renewable energy export goals.

Beyond the development of clean energy infrastructure, the two nations are also working on standardising renewable energy certificates (RECs) to help industries in both countries meet their sustainability targets. This move aims to streamline the process of tracking and trading renewable energy credits, providing businesses with the tools they need to prove their environmental commitments and make significant strides toward achieving their sustainability goals.

Australia and Singapore have forged a groundbreaking agreement focused on clean energy and aviation, aiming to reduce emissions, promote sustainable aviation fuel, and drive renewable energy innovation. This partnership paves the way for a greener, more sustainable future for both nations and the global community.

The collaborative efforts between Singapore and Australia represent a powerful example of how nations can come together to drive the global transition to cleaner energy. By pooling their resources, expertise, and infrastructure, the two countries are positioning themselves at the forefront of the sustainable energy revolution. Through joint ventures in SAF, biofuels, and renewable energy, Singapore and Australia are not only working toward achieving their own ambitious climate goals but are also setting a global precedent for how nations can work in tandem to address climate change and build a sustainable future. The next decade will undoubtedly witness further developments in these areas, as the CSP 2.0 framework lays the groundwork for a greener, more interconnected world.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/WhatsApp-Image-2025-10-03-at-12-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 15:56:19.747958

Unlike upcoming technologies like hydrogen or electric planes, which need major infrastructure overhauls and aircraft redesigns, SAF works seamlessly with current aircraft and fueling systems. This allows for immediate emission reductions of up to 80% over the entire product lifecycle. As the industry aims for net-zero emissions by 2050, SAF acts as a vital bridge between today’s operations and future innovative propulsion technologies, making it a key element in achieving long-term sustainability goals.

The UAE has positioned itself as a global leader in this transition by incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its comprehensive Net Zero 2050 Strategy and utilizing its distinctive strengths as an energy hub and international aviation center. Through collaborations with leading airlines, energy corporations, and technology enterprises, the UAE is advancing with extensive SAF production utilizing both bio-based feedstocks and synthetic fuel pathways powered by renewable energy and green hydrogen.

Flagship airports in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are strategically advancing as innovation hubs for sustainable aviation. These developments integrate SAF deployment with cutting-edge green infrastructure and smart operational practices. By harmonizing government policies, industry collaborations, and R&D initiatives, the UAE is not only shaping regional standards but also setting a global benchmark for sustainable aviation leadership. [The upcoming Dubai Airshow (November 17-21, 2025) will feature prominent panels and demonstrations focused on propelling sustainable aviation forward.]

Over the next 15 years, SAF is poised to become the primary driver for reducing aviation's carbon footprint. It is the key to helping airlines meet their near- and mid-term net-zero goals. Driven by regulatory requirements in regions like the EU, US, and parts of Asia, airlines are expected to steadily increase their use of SAF from less than 1% of today's global jet fuel demand to double-digit blending levels by the late 2030s.

Combined with ongoing advancements in aircraft and operational efficiencies, SAF is set to deliver the majority of near-term emission reductions. This will bridge the gap until hydrogen and electric technologies reach commercial-scale maturity beyond 2040. The market's rapid acceleration is clear: projected SAF deliveries are estimated to surge from 2.28 million metric tons in 2025 to a staggering 74.8 million metric tons by 2040. This growth is already underway, with SAF deliveries to airports having jumped by an impressive 453% between 2021 and 2024.

Several key factors are driving this accelerated adoption. Multi-year off-take agreements between airlines and producers are building market stability, while policy incentives like subsidies and tax credits are making SAF a more viable option. The rapid scaling of innovative production pathways, such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and power-to-liquid (PtL), is also crucial. As blending and depot infrastructure expands at major hubs, it will facilitate smoother integration into existing supply chains, while increasing corporate demand for sustainable travel will further support market growth through ""book-and-claim"" systems

The accelerated adoption of SAF is being driven by two key developments: long-term production contracts and investments in blending depot infrastructure.

Multi-year SAF production agreements between airlines, producers, and energy companies provide financial stability for fuel suppliers, enabling them to expand refinery capacity and invest in advanced technologies like power-to-liquid (PtL) and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). Simultaneously, contracts to develop blending depots and distribution networks ensure SAF can be efficiently integrated into existing supply chains at airports worldwide. These depots facilitate mixing SAF with conventional jet fuel to meet certified blending ratios, while also streamlining logistics, reducing costs, and guaranteeing consistent availability for airlines.

Together, these production agreements and blending infrastructure contracts are resolving distribution bottlenecks and creating the necessary ecosystem for rapid SAF adoption. As both parts of the value chain develop, airlines will gain dependable access to larger SAF volumes at more competitive prices, speeding up the industry's journey toward net-zero goals.

At Dubai Airshow 2025, SAF will take center stage with dedicated sustainability forums, live demonstrations, and industry partnerships showcasing ways to increase production and adoption. The event will emphasize airline–producer collaborations, new fuel technologies, and policy frameworks driving aviation’s net-zero transition.",,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:15.235857

The venture is part of “Project MORISORA,” which aims to commercialize bioethanol and biochemical products derived from woody biomass. A demonstration plant will be built at Nippon Paper’s Iwanuma mill in Miyagi Prefecture, utilizing sustainable forest resources, including wood processing residues from the Tohoku region. The plant will leverage GEI’s low-carbon, cost-effective bioethanol production technology and aims to produce over 1,000 kiloliters of bioethanol annually starting in 2027.

JAL has been advocating for the use of biofuels for more than 10 years and joined Project MORISORA in March 2025. This investment marks JAL’s commitment as an airline and SAF user to promote a “purely domestic SAF” industry based on wood sourced within Japan.

On October 3, 2025, a groundbreaking ceremony, known as “Jichin-sai,” took place at the site of the demonstration plant within Nippon Paper’s Iwanuma mill. The plant is expected to be completed by fiscal year 2026, with plans to operate a commercial facility producing tens of thousands of kiloliters of bioethanol and biochemical products annually by 2030.

The discussions got me thinking of a story I wrote about 14 years ago, titled “Beyond the Hype.” For that piece, I spoke with soil scientists, researchers and producers about biochar’s promise, from climate mitigation to bioenergy.

Something that I heard a few times while there was that there has been some “industry fatigue”—the idea that biochar has generated plenty of interest and conversation over the years, but still hasn’t fully delivered on its potential. That said, it was clear from the diverse group of energized attendees from across every corner of market development that real, measurable progress is finally underway. The discussions got me thinking of a story I wrote about 14 years ago, titled “Beyond the Hype.” For that piece, I spoke with soil scientists, researchers and producers about biochar’s promise, from climate mitigation to bioenergy. One small-scale producer told me about the hurdles of scaling up and the difficult economics, saying: “Although researchers are currently willing to pay $1,000 to $2,000 per ton for biochar, in the long term it will probably be worth about $100 per ton … if you’re making 2 or 3 tons a day, that doesn’t pay the bills.”

That early perspective has aged well. While his estimate was on the low end of today’s price points, the challenges he flagged—especially around scaling—were echoed throughout the conference. We explore this theme further in our page-32 feature, Buzzing on Biochar, which follows the journeys of two successful companies producing biochar and biocarbon pellets as a fossil fuel replacement.

On the topic of industry gatherings, I’m writing this just days ahead of the North American SAF Conference, also in Minneapolis. While the sustainable aviation fuel industry has certainly weathered turbulence over the past year (and still is), there are still many bright spots—especially on the global stage. In our page-20 feature, “Decarbonizing Paradise,” Associate Editor Katie Schroeder tells the story of Par Pacific, which is moving toward commercial-scale SAF production in Hawaii. As the state’s only refinery, Par has faced its share of challenges, but the project is now nearing the finish line and bringing with it meaningful economic and environmental benefits. This facility’s startup marks a major milestone in an otherwise challenging period for project development.

You’ll also want to read “A Full Circle Feedstock” on page 26, which explores the journey of a family-owned sawmill turning residuals into wood pellets with the addition of innovative drying technology. For Conner Holdings, risk turned into reward. As Junior Staff Writer Caitlin Scheresky reports, the company entered the pellet sector with little prior experience. CEO James Foss put it this way: “It was risky, but it was a calculated risk. We have two operating sawmills with residuals, so we already had our feedstock.” He added that during the installation process, the company’s owner “seemed like he was kicking himself for not doing this sooner.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Anna_Simet_2025_1471b63243.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:58:17.201779

Global demand for biofuels is expected to reach 825 million metric tons per year by 2030, according to the Renewables 2025 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA). This figure represents a 25% increase from 2024 levels. The IEA states that biofuels could account for 27% of global vegetable oil production and 80% of waste and residue oil supply by the end of the decade.

Strong reliance on imports

Since 2020, used oil imports to the European Union and the United States have increased twentyfold. Around 60% of these volumes originate from China and Indonesia. This rapid development raises concerns about the reliability of the supply chain. The IEA notes that the United States, formerly a net exporter, has become a net importer due to the expansion of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

New blending obligations in Europe, targeting a 6% share for aviation fuels by 2030, alongside maritime requirements and incentives for low-carbon intensity fuels, are driving up demand for these oils. They are especially valued for their favourable lifecycle emissions profiles.

Diverging regional strategies

Globally, feedstock imports remain limited to around 10% of total demand, but regional differences are becoming more pronounced. Indonesia and Brazil maintain strong domestic availability thanks to local palm oil and sugarcane supplies. In contrast, European and North American markets increasingly rely on imports to meet renewable fuel targets.

Europe remains the largest demand centre for used and residue oils, although consumption is also growing in Southeast Asia to supply Singapore’s refining capacity. In July 2025, used oil prices in the European Union reached their highest level in two years, while U.S. soybean oil futures rose 20%.

Strengthened regulatory oversight

In response to supply chain concerns, authorities in both Europe and the United States have tightened regulatory frameworks. The European Commission launched a Union-wide biofuel database to ensure traceability and prevent double-counting. The International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme suspended certificates for over 130 companies and revised its audit procedures.

In the United States, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated tax credits for imported biofuels, except those sourced from Canada and Mexico. Proposed updates to the Renewable Fuel Standard also halve credit values for fuels made from imported feedstocks.

Limited supply of advanced feedstocks

Despite growing interest in next-generation fuels, pathways relying on advanced feedstocks remain limited. In the IEA’s accelerated scenario, cellulosic ethanol and Fischer-Tropsch fuels could quadruple in volume to 45 million metric tons annually by 2030.

The use of lignocellulosic biomass and alcohols is expected to remain restricted to certain markets such as the United Kingdom and the European Union. Technological and economic barriers continue to limit broader deployment.

Rising competition across sectors

Even though sustainable aviation fuel will account for only 2% of total feedstock demand by 2030, its expansion is placing direct pressure on already limited used oil supply. The IEA estimates that 55% of SAF inputs will come from waste oils due to their compliance under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and ReFuelEU Aviation regulations.

This growing competition between road transport and aviation for the same premium feedstocks is likely to increase price volatility throughout the decade.

Accelerated scenario and structural constraints

In its accelerated scenario, the IEA projects an additional increase of 125 million metric tons in feedstock demand, reaching 950 million metric tons annually by 2030. Meeting this would require coordinated strategies including yield optimisation, crop rotation, use of degraded land, and the development of emerging technologies.

Despite these constraints, the IEA forecasts a 43 billion litre increase in global biofuel consumption by 2030. However, the agency notes that many producers, particularly of biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF, experienced tight or negative margins in 2025.

Performance-based standards are expected to account for one-third of total biofuel demand by 2030, up from just under 20% in 2024, as governments move from volumetric mandates to emission reduction frameworks.

Repsol has approved the final investment decision for the Ecoplanta project in Spain. This innovative project, utilizing Enerkem's technology, aims to convert non-recyclable municipal waste into methanol, marking a step towards industrial decarbonization.

The French government unveils its strategy to increase offshore wind capacity, targeting 18 GW by 2035 and 45 GW by 2050, through an ambitious call for tenders covering all maritime fronts.

The continued increase in development costs of upstream oil projects is testing the economic viability of new oil production. A recent study by Rystad Energy reveals an increase in breakeven costs, while still remaining below current oil prices.

Andy Beshear, First Lady Britainy Beshear and other members of Team Kentucky will travel next week to the United Kingdom, France and Ireland to meet with business leaders and trade officials to further Kentucky’s presence in the region and spur job growth for Kentuckians.

The visit provides an opportunity to build on the Governor’s record-breaking tenure, which includes the highest private-sector investment figure for any administration in state history.

“New jobs mean more opportunities for Kentucky families to pay the bills and live good lives, which is why my administration has worked hard to secure new investment – including foreign investment, which is essential to our success,” Gov. Beshear said. “This visit provides us a great opportunity to connect with leaders of existing Kentucky businesses, companies we want to see invest, and trade organizations as we continue to show the world there’s no better place to do business than our New Kentucky Home.”

The delegation from Team Kentucky will meet with more than 45 companies during the weeklong trip, 16 of which are in existing industries in the commonwealth that currently employ approximately 4,000 people statewide. Collectively, the companies have active projects with the potential to bring up to 2,900 full-time jobs and over $3.5 billion in investment to the state, in addition to future growth opportunities. The Governor will also meet with trade officials in the U.K. and France, which are Kentucky’s second- and third-largest export markets, respectively, with more than $9.7 billion worth of goods exported to the two countries in 2024.

Cabinet for Economic Development Secretary Jeff Noel, who will join Gov. Beshear on the trip, noted the importance of building on existing relationships to secure future wins for Kentucky: “We are fortunate to have a strong and diverse group of international companies here in Kentucky, and this is a great chance to build on that foundation and further those relationships to bring even more great jobs to our state. I look forward to joining the Governor on this critical mission, and I’m excited to see what new opportunities arise following these discussions with innovative and growth-minded companies.”

Kentucky has over 530 internationally owned operations that employ more than 115,000 people statewide. European-owned companies employ over 40,000 people at 238 facilities in Kentucky and represent 17 countries. The commonwealth is home to 26 U.K.-based companies that employ over 2,700 people, 40 French-owned businesses that employ over 5,600 workers, and eight Irish-owned operations that employ nearly 1,000 Kentuckians.

Gov. Beshear’s foreign trade mission builds on the best five-year period for economic growth in state history.

Since the beginning of his administration, Gov. Beshear has announced more than 1,200 private-sector new-location and expansion projects totaling over $43 billion in announced investments, creating more than 63,200 jobs. This is the highest investment figure secured during the tenure of any governor in the commonwealth’s history and $20 billion more than the next highest total.

The robust job creation has been accompanied by rising wages across the commonwealth. Since 2022, the average incentivized hourly wage has topped $26 in three consecutive years for the first time.

Gov. Beshear has announced some of the largest economic development projects in state history, which have solidified Kentucky as the electric vehicle battery production capital of the United States: Ford Motor Co. and SK On’s transformative $5.8 billion, 5,000-job BlueOval SK Battery Park in Hardin County; AESC’s $2 billion, 2,000-job gigafactory project in Warren County; Toyota’s $1.3 billion investment in Scott County; Ford Motor Co.’s $2 billion commitment in Louisville; and Shelbyville Battery Manufacturing’s $712 million investment, creating 1,572 jobs in Shelby County, among others.

The Governor’s administration also secured the largest General Fund budget surplus and Rainy Day Fund. In 2023, Kentucky recorded over 2 million jobs filled for the first time ever and has stayed above that number ever since.

Kentucky also secured rating increases from major credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings, S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.

The project, funded by the Office of Energy Policy within EEC, is one of two SAF studies currently underway in Kentucky. The second, led by WSP, is funded by the Kentucky SAF Coalition.

The study identified corn oil as the safest bet for making SAF in Kentucky thanks to its low risk profile, according to Eduardo Santillan-Jimenez, Ph.D., associate director of CAER’s Sustainable and Alternative Fuels Research Group. He noted that such a finding can guide the decision-making of stakeholders interested in investing in SAF-related projects in the Commonwealth.

By Dave Melanson, UKnow

SAF is an alternative to jet fuel that can be made from everyday materials like plant oils, animal fats and recycled cooking grease, can be blended up to 50% with traditional jet fuel for use in commercial aircraft and represents a market potential of $80 billion globally (by 2035). Jet fuel is the fourth most consumed fuel in the Commonwealth and is critical for Kentucky’s three air hubs as well as for national defense aviation operations at the Kentucky National Guard, Fort Knox and Fort Campbell.

“As the aviation industry looks to diversify its fuel sources and become more sustainable, SAF represents an advanced energy economic development opportunity for Kentucky. It creates new markets for agricultural products, brings investment to processing infrastructure and directly supports fuel diversification and local production supporting Kentucky’s Energy Security Plan,” said Kenya Stump, executive director of the Kentucky Office of Energy Policy.

Essential to this growth, however, is understanding the supply chain risk necessary to attract infrastructure and manufacturing investments. The risk assessment conducted by UK CAER focused on soybean oil, corn oil and distillers corn oil — which are some of the most important agricultural commodities in Kentucky — as well as on animal fats (from livestock rendering), yellow grease (used cooking oil) and brown grease (FOG recovered from grease traps and/or from wastewater treatment plants).

Six types of risks were reviewed based on a U.S. Department of Energy standard that helps investors better understand the risks of using biomass as a resource, making it easier to support and grow the bioeconomy.

“Risk was highest in supplier and supply chain categories,” said Santillan-Jimenez. “The risk associated with the other categories was found to be low. Both yellow and brown grease show high supplier and supply chain risk, while soybean oil shows high supplier risk but medium supply chain risk. Notably, corn oil shows medium supplier risk and low supply chain risk, making it the less risky feedstock overall.”

Cirium’s recent webinar, “Rethinking flight emissions: the case for time-based CO2 calculations” brought together experts from RouteZero and Asset Impact to discuss why the industry needs more robust, data-driven methods for tracking and reducing emissions.

Key takeaways

Traditional distance-based models are too simplistic for effective emissions management.

Time-based, data-driven methods capture the operational realities that matter for decarbonization.

Reliable data supports practical climate action, credible reporting, and effective capital allocation.

Immediate adoption of granular emissions tracking offers meaningful progress while enabling the industry to prepare for future technological shifts.

Why traditional calculations fall short

Most emissions calculations today use the “great circle distance” model, which measures emissions by calculating the direct distance between two airports and applying a standard factor. This method is convenient but fails to reflect the complexity of real-world operations:

Aircraft specifications: Factors like engine efficiency, winglets, and aircraft age significantly impact fuel burn.

Operational realities: Route deviations, weather delays, and extended taxi or wait times add variability.

Aircraft weight: Each flight’s unique weight profile, including passengers and cargo, alters fuel consumption.

As a result, these models treat identical routes as if they have identical emissions, ignoring factors that can make a real difference. The webinar illustrated this with flights from New York to Miami: although traditional models rated them the same, a time-based analysis revealed a substantial emissions difference due to aircraft efficiency and actual flight duration.

Time-based, flight-specific calculations: a better way forward

A time-based, granular approach – like Cirium’s EmeraldSky methodology – accounts for the real variables affecting every flight:

Detailed aircraft data: Specifics on type, engine, age, and modifications.

Flight weight estimation: Actual operational weights, with passenger and cargo estimates factored in.

Real-world operations: Use of satellite-based and diverse data sources to capture flight and taxi times.

Sophisticated fuel burn models: Independent, third-party analysis capturing how fuel use changes during the different stages of a flight.

The result is much more accurate emissions accounting, enabling better decisions by airlines, investors, and policymakers.

Real-world applications: how granular emissions data is already shaping real-world strategies

Data-driven corporate climate action

Dan Brown, RouteZero co-founder and CEO described how detailed flight data enables companies to meaningfully decarbonize business travel. By evaluating every flight’s emissions and other relevant factors, companies can empower employees to choose lower-emission flights without reducing necessary travel. Over a year, these choices can produce significant emissions reductions.

Informing investment and finance

Vincent Jerosch-Herold, Asset Impact’s Chief Product Officer shared how investors and banks benefit from flight-level data. Banks gain a clearer view of which airlines are operating the most efficiently, helping them direct capital to industry leaders in decarbonization. This transparency drives sustainable investment in cleaner fleets and fuels, supporting innovations such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and next-generation aircraft.

Combating greenwashing with transparency

Credible, science-based data is crucial as scrutiny of corporate sustainability claims intensifies. Nearly 70% of organizations now cite greenwashing as a risk. Both Dan and Vincent agreed that transparency and precise measurement are the best defences. Companies that report clear, measurable, flight-specific reductions – not just general pledges – will stand apart in credibility and compliance.

The path to net zero: immediate steps and long-term vision

The journey to net zero aviation by 2050 will require breakthroughs in aircraft technology and SAF production, both demanding years of research and significant investment. However, as emphasized in the webinar, actionable change is possible now by adopting more accurate, flight-level emissions accounting. This enables organizations to:

Make better travel and purchasing decisions

Provide robust data to investors and regulators

Set and verify real, quantifiable emissions targets

By moving beyond outdated calculation models and focusing on accurate, transparent emissions data, the aviation sector can accelerate progress and support a more sustainable future.",https://assets.fta.cirium.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09091435/RethinkingFlightEmissionsWebinar_banner.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:56:54.514117

With hybrid-powered flights on offer, the country is ensuring that even the aviation sector pledges towards 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with their zero-emissions jet. By rewriting the rules of flight, the innovation is rewriting the rules of sustainable commitment as well. Sweden’s 30-seater hybrid is the future of aviation.

Sweden is committed to sustainable soaring in the skies

Sweden is now at the very core of the launch towards future aviation possibilities. The hybrid-electric aircraft, still under development, that will be powered by SAF will spell the end of fossil jet fuel. Sweden is transitioning to 100% SAF in terms of domestic flights, which will occur within the next 10 years.

Sweden surely is committed to a broader climate strategy and holds onto the goal of being a net-zero country by 2045. To date, aviation has been one of the biggest industries causing pollution, and the transition to SAF means utilizing a fuel that is not fossil-based. SAF was created using waste oils, captured CO₂, and agricultural residues. Sweden is looking at using nothing less than 100% SAF when considering future aviation design options.

The country is not just considering SAF for their future aircraft, but has aligned with airports and carriers to ensure infrastructure upgrades are in place that support the production, distribution, and refueling of SAF. All airlines would need to comply with Sweden’s SAF mission.

ES-30 running on SAF and soaring to sustainable heights

Heart Aerospace is the heart of this sustainable transformation, and the startup company is busy building the ES-30. This 30-passenger hybrid-electric aircraft will begin flying by 2030 and will be best suited for shorter-haul flights. Offering a 32 km full electric range and a hybrid SAF-based engine, this hybrid aircraft will fly to about 200 km.

The ES-30 is being designed for commercial routes and will be great for communities like Gotland, Sweden’s most remote island, where daily flights to the mainland become essential. Local authorities in Gotland have already signed the agreements with Heart Aerospace and the Elfly Group to start electric aviation testing.

Infrastructure and regulatory protocol are becoming essential

Moving towards an electrical aviation future expands beyond just the aircraft. Airport infrastructure needs to support these electric aviation flights. Already onboard are airports like Säve in Gothenburg that have agreed to include charging stations, battery safety zones, and SAF blending facilities. At the same time, Sweden’s transport and environmental agencies are looking to fast-track certifications for electric aircraft, as these agencies are currently battling with archaic setbacks.

Sweden sees the government collaborating with research institutions and ambitious startups. With over 100 projects devoted to ensuring that air taxis enjoy a more sustainable future, Sweden surely is committed to producing commercial electric planes that will take over the skies. Sweden is saying goodbye to polluting airplanes for good by running 100% on their chosen sustainable fuel.

**********************************************************************

Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Joint Business Community Luncheon today (October 10):

Ms Agnes Chan (Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce), Dr Jonathan Choi (Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong), Dr Wingco Lo (President of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong), Mr Anthony Lam (Chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries), Mr Wang Haimin (Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association), Mr Davide De Rosa on behalf of InterCham (President of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao), Consuls-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. I thank you for giving me this opportunity to come and join you, once again, for this essential annual gathering - the Joint Business Community Luncheon.

My thanks, first of all, to the main organisers: the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce; the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Hong Kong; the Federation of Hong Kong Industries; and the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong.

I have been told that over 400 of you are here today from five local chambers and 19 international chambers, together with a number of Consuls-General and other consulate officials.

Business and institutional leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators, investors and more, you're here for more than a fine social occasion - and the good lunch that comes with it.

I would like to take this opportunity to give you a better sense of the HKSAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) Government's policies, and how they may fit with your plans - your future, your business and your career in Hong Kong, this beloved community we all call home.

The theme of the 2025 Policy Address is ""Deepening Reforms for Our People, Leveraging Our Strengths for a Brighter Future"". As I emphasised in the Policy Address, my ultimate objective is to improve the livelihood of the people of Hong Kong. And that's best realised through economic growth driven by continuing reforms.

Successful reform is a collective commitment. Working together, we can, and we will, create a brighter future for us all. And build an even more dynamic, innovative and business-friendly hub, as noted by Agnes.

International recognition

The results to date are no less reassuring. Confidence is returning to our businesses and industries, and our communities, shops, streets and homes. And the world has recognised these achievements.

In June, the annual World Competitiveness Yearbook, produced by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development, ranked Hong Kong third in the world, up two places from last year. In government efficiency and business efficiency, we rose one place and five places, respectively, to second overall, topping the rankings in ""tax policy"" and ""business legislation"". For international business and investors, Hong Kong is one big welcome mat.

And what a month September was, with Hong Kong in the international ratings spotlight, four remarkable times. Each honour recognises a distinctive facet of our revitalised economy.

I will start with innovation. Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Guangzhou are, collectively, recognised as the world's top innovation cluster, in the World Intellectual Property Organization's annual Global Innovation Index. That's up one place from previous years and our highest ranking ever.

In talent, we claimed fourth place, overall, in the World Talent Ranking, up from ninth in 2024 and 16th the year before. This also marks our highest-ever ranking in the report. And Hong Kong finished first in Asia and world's best in the percentage of graduates in sciences.

For economic freedom, Hong Kong was once again ranked No. 1, as the world's freest economy by the Canadian-based Fraser Institute last month.

And in finance, we placed third in the world in the Global Financial Centres Index, just one point back of London, and only two behind New York.

Those, and other international plaudits, are a compelling reflection of Hong Kong's cheering improvements - and in multiple sectors of our economy as well. They're powered by government policy and, more importantly, by the collaborative efforts of Hong Kong - of everyone in this room.

I would like to share with you some of the Government's policies and plans underlying those rankings, and new initiatives from my Policy Address last month. Together, they're designed to advance our economic development a good deal further.

Northern Metropolis

First of all, the Northern Metropolis. It is at the heart of the HKSAR Government's long-term policy priorities. An innovative new engine for our economy, a far-reaching and welcoming space for community and family, the Northern Metropolis symbolises the rewarding future we all want for Hong Kong. A future built on co-operation and the wide-ranging rewards it promises.

Given the boundless potential of the Northern Metropolis - given, too, its sheer size and the scale of funding required to bring it to full and sustainable life - I am taking a leading role in its development. As head of the new Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis, I called our first meeting last week. And I am determined to fast-track its evolution, removing every possible speed bump in its path.

We aim to enact new, dedicated legislation within next year to accelerate the development of the Northern Metropolis. The legislation will streamline procedures for setting up and funding statutory industry park companies, fine-tune parameters for land development, and speed up compensation payment for land resumption. Speed, speed, speed.

We will expedite land and construction project approval and implementation. We will smooth the cross-boundary flow of people, goods, data, capital and more to attract the investors, businesses and research organisations that want a stake in the Northern Metropolis, and its far-reaching economic potential.

And that's just touching on the open-minded measures we are pursuing to bring Hong Kong's new powerhouse engine to engaging life, as expeditiously as possible. In my Northern Metropolis playbook, ""soon"" is not nearly soon enough.

The San Tin Technopole, a key area in the Northern Metropolis, will provide some 210 hectares of land dedicated to innovation and technology (I&T). The Government will publish the Conceptual Outline of the Development Plan for the Innovation and Technology Industry in the San Tin Technopole before year's end. With that, San Tin will begin its inevitable rise as the fast-beating I&T heart of the Northern Metropolis.

Tenants - from life and health technology, new energy, artificial intelligence and other strategic industries - have begun to move into the first three buildings of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Innovation and Technology Park. Construction of five other buildings in the Park will be completed, progressively, from 2027.

This Hong Kong Park, together with Shenzhen Park, make up the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Technology Innovation Co-operation Zone, an area that straddles our boundary with the neighbouring city of Shenzhen. Co-operation is central to the Zone and the Northern Metropolis, to Hong Kong and Shenzhen, and to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, of which we are a part. Our concerted collaboration will propel the Greater Bay Area's rise and shine as one of the world's greatest I&T hubs.

The Northern Metropolis will also excel as a centre for education. We are building a University Town there, on some 90 hectares of land. In my Policy Address, I noted that a Working Group on Planning and Construction of the University Town would be set up, one of three working groups under the Committee on Development of the Northern Metropolis.

It had its first meeting last week, highlighting the Government's strategy of integrating educational excellence and industry at University Town.

That's part of a larger goal, outlined in my Policy Address, of developing Hong Kong into an international education hub.

Hong Kong is proud to be home to five of the world's 100 top universities. In fact, in the latest World University Rankings just announced by Times Higher Education, all six of our previously ranked universities have risen to higher positions. Meanwhile, two more of our publicly funded universities have entered the Rankings for the first time. That, ladies and gentlemen, means that all eight of our publicly funded universities are on the Rankings, and in higher positions than last year. So we're making good progress, and that's thanks to everybody involved in the education sector, particularly in higher education.

Hong Kong demonstrated outstanding performances in key indicators of the Rankings, making sustained progress in such areas as teaching reputation and staff-to-student radio. That's probably why our universities are highly popular, with a double-digit year-on-year increase in the number of self-financing non-local applicants.

In my Policy Address, I also announced that the number of self-financing places for non-local students wishing to study at our post-secondary institutions will rise to 50 per cent, from the previous 40 per cent, beginning in the 2026/27 academic year - this is a strategy designed to create a more diverse and international student body.

To help our eight publicly funded universities recruit overseas and Mainland teachers and students, I have set aside funding support of $40 million for them. And the Government will establish a task force designed to attract more international teaching and research talent to Hong Kong.

Talent attraction

Talent is an essential component in the integrated development of education, technology and industry in the Northern Metropolis. Indeed, talent is central to every sector, industry, business and institution in Hong Kong.

Which is why we've introduced a range of talent admissions schemes since the end of 2022. Since then, more than 230 000 people have come to work here, with 70 per cent of them under the age of 40. The Top Talent Pass Scheme alone has brought in nearly 100 000 young professionals, mostly employed in the financial and I&T sectors. These are high-income individuals and degree holders from prominent international universities. For those whose Top Talent Pass has expired, some 55 per cent of them have applied for an extension of stay, continuing their contribution to our economy. And our businesses are willing to pay much higher salaries to them, which means that they are in high demand, and companies reckon that with what they pay, they get more out of it.

Attracting enterprises

Attracting businesses is also a policy priority of the Government. The results are just as encouraging. The Office for Attracting Strategic Enterprises, set up by me less than three years ago, has already attracted over 100 - the exact number is 102 - strategic companies to Hong Kong. They are bringing in investments of $60 billion and will create some 22 000 jobs.

Just yesterday, the Office welcomed three of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical firms to Hong Kong, alongside companies specialising in generative AI (artificial intelligence), autonomous driving, microelectronics, Web3 and new media.

Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK), our investment promotion agency, has helped over 1 300 Mainland and overseas companies set up or expand their business in Hong Kong. They are expected to bring in direct investment of more than $175 billion, while creating some 20 000 job opportunities.

To build on this success, I announced, in my Policy Address, that the Financial Secretary will lead a team of government and public organisations in putting together packages of preferential policies. These will include land grants and premiums, as well as financial subsidies and tax incentives.

The initiative is designed to encourage strategic industries and high-potential companies to set up in Hong Kong. Our goal is clear: to promote diversified, high-quality, long-term economic development.

Targeted industries include life and health technology, pharmaceuticals, aircraft recycling and trading, AI and new energy.

Artificial intelligence

Yes, artificial intelligence has become central to our lives. It helps with decision-making, reduces errors, and boosts productivity. It is the future of our development. I think the world has no choice.

The Government will promote AI as a core industry for Hong Kong. I have set aside $1 billion for the establishment, next year, of the Hong Kong AI Research and Development Institute. It will enable upstream R&D (research and development), as well as midstream and downstream outcomes.

And the $3 billion Frontier Technology Research Support Scheme, announced earlier, will help universities attract prominent researchers in AI and other fields.

The Hong Kong Investment Corporation, established in my first year in office, is investing in AI companies, in fields ranging from cloud computing to drug development.

Sustainable development

As for new energy, we are developing a sustainable aviation fuel industry chain, in concert with Mainland authorities and a local company setting up its business in the Greater Bay Area.

And we now have 28 hydrogen energy trial projects either underway or under preparation, covering everything from hydrogen buses to a hydrogen gas station. We will also develop hydrogen standard certification and work with Guangdong to develop the Greater Bay Area Hydrogen Corridor.

Going global

Our co-operation with the Mainland extends beyond the Greater Bay Area. Given the shifting global trade order, and our country's steadfast commitment to multilateralism, there is fast-growing demand for ""Made in China"" products. I see growing opportunities in helping Mainland companies go global through Hong Kong's customised, wide-ranging and world-class professional services.

In my Policy Address, I announced the establishment of a task force focused on supporting Mainland enterprises in going global. I am glad to add that this GoGlobal Task Force has already been launched earlier this week.

The task force brings together the overseas offices of InvestHK and the Trade Development Council, as well as Hong Kong offices on the Mainland. It is also joined by partners from various industries including legal, accounting, financial services, banking, chambers and professional organisations. It will smooth the way for Mainland companies taking their businesses globally.

Through Hong Kong, a ""super connector"" and ""super value-adder"", companies will connect, faster and more effectively, with international markets and buyers. Ladies and gentlemen, I am confident we can contribute to our country's development of its markets and business opportunities in the Global South, in Belt and Road regions and emerging markets everywhere. Thanks to the unique ""one country, two systems"" principle. Thanks to you, the companies and professionals driving Hong Kong's unparalleled strengths.

Culture, sports and tourism

But we need fun as well. There's a great deal more in this year's Policy Address, including wide-ranging measures designed to promote the integrated development of culture, sports and tourism. We work hard, but also we need to play hard, eat hard, drink hard and spend hard.

These measures range from the development of an arts trading hub and deepening ties with Art Basel, to boosting the West Kowloon Cultural District's international visibility, targeting yacht tourism and promoting sports development.

That certainly includes next month's 15th National Games, together with December's 12th National Games for Persons with Disabilities and the 9th National Special Olympic Games. These landmark Games mark the first time Hong Kong has served as a cohosting city - alongside Guangdong and Macao - in the country's top sports games.

That, ladies and gentlemen, will surely be an integrating, entirely electrifying, moment for Hong Kong, for our country, for us all.

In the interest of time, I think I better stop here. I look forward to taking your questions about this year's Policy Address. And Hong Kong's flourishing future.

Thank you for your time.

Honeywell UOP, a global leader in energy and process technology, is driving the next phase of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) revolution through innovation, scalability, and collaboration. With over a century of refining expertise and more than 5,900 patents, the company is advancing cutting-edge solutions such as the FT Unicracking™ process and Experion® PKS control systems to make SAF production more efficient, cost-competitive, and feedstock-flexible. ChemAnalyst spoke with Dr. Rajesh Gattupalli, President of Honeywell UOP, discussed his leadership vision, Honeywell’s role in accelerating the global energy transition, and how integrated technology partnerships with organizations like Johnson Matthey and USA BioEnergy are helping the aviation industry chart a faster path toward net-zero emissions.

Complete Interview with Rajesh Gattupalli

To start, could you introduce yourself and outline Honeywell UOP’s role in advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) within the global energy transition?

Rajesh Gattupalli: As president of Honeywell UOP, I oversee a team that develops solutions aimed at improving energy, resource and cost efficiency in the refining and petrochemical sectors. The business also works on technologies designed to reduce emissions and support the development and production of new fuels such as SAF at scale. With over a century of experience, 5,900 patents, and more than 70 licensed processes in 6,000 facilities, we deliver expert energy solutions worldwide.

Honeywell is developing innovative technology that addresses some of the biggest challenges in the SAF industry – production costs, efficiency and feedstock availability. By enabling efficient production and pioneering technologies that expand feedstock options, our technology will play a significant role in advancing SAF production.

Honeywell’s FT Unicracking™ process is being positioned as a breakthrough for SAF. What sets it apart from conventional hydroprocessing technologies in terms of yields, efficiency and costs?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Honeywell’s (FT) Unicracking™ process technology provides a 3–5% increase in SAF production, up to a 20% cost reduction and reduced waste streams as compared to other similar hydroprocessing technologies. What makes it stand out is its ability to turn Fischer Tropsch liquids and waxes derived from waste, biogas, or CO2 combined with green hydrogen into high-quality SAF that meets strict aviation standards.

By boosting yields, lowering costs and cutting waste streams, FT Unicracking offers producers a reliable and commercially viable way to scale SAF, enabling production from low cost, domestic feedstocks while achieving significant emission reductions.

The technology has already been selected for several publicly announced projects that will create hundreds of millions of gallons of SAF per year by using this technology.

This process is designed to handle a wide variety of feedstocks, including waste and forestry residues. How does Honeywell ensure consistent quality and efficiency across such diverse inputs?

Rajesh Gattupalli: One of the strengths of the Fischer Tropsch value chain, including our FT Unicracking process technology, is its ability to handle a wide variety of feedstocks, from municipal solid waste and forestry residues to CO2 combined with green hydrogen. FT-Unicracking can, for example, take Fischer Tropsch liquids and waxes from processed biomass—including leftovers from crops, wood waste, or even food scraps—and convert them into SAF that complies with the strict standards of the aviation industry, while also delivering a lower environmental impact.

We ensure consistent quality and efficiency across such diverse inputs by combining proven process technology with advanced catalysts, automation and control systems. The integration with Honeywell’s Experion® PKS control system helps optimize performance, improve reliability and ensure the final product consistently meets aviation fuel standards, no matter the variation in feedstock.

Reliability and scalability are critical for SAF producers. How does FT Unicracking™ support continuous operations and enable both greenfield projects and retrofits to scale quickly?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Reliability and scalability are vital for SAF producers, and this is where Honeywell brings unmatched expertise. We offer modular renewable fuels technology that can be built off-site and quickly installed at existing refineries or greenfield sites, lowering risk and accelerating start up compared to traditional methods. This approach can reduce the time between feasibility study to facility startup by more than 15% and reduce capital costs by up to 10%.

Altogether, Honeywell’s licensed SAF capacity projects more than 500,000 barrels per day upon full operation. That level of commercial deployment gives producers confidence that our solutions can support both greenfield projects and retrofits at speed.

Honeywell highlights the strong commercial appeal of its SAF solutions. How does this technology encourage faster adoption within the aviation sector?

Rajesh Gattupalli: The strong commercial appeal of Honeywell’s SAF solutions comes from the fact that they are proven, scalable and designed to lower risk for producers and airlines alike. By expanding the range of viable feedstocks, reducing production costs and shortening project timelines, our technologies make it easier for SAF projects to reach investment decisions and move into operation.

This combination gives producers confidence to build and airlines confidence to commit to long-term offtake agreements. Agreements like the USA BioEnergy project in Texas, supported by a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines, show how our technology is already helping the aviation sector move quickly toward wider adoption of SAF.

Experion PKS will be deployed alongside FT Unicracking™ at the Bon Wier biorefinery. How does its advanced control system enhance plant efficiency, safety and resilience compared with conventional approaches?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Honeywell distinguishes itself by integrating process technology with automation for end-to-end solutions. Using Honeywell’s Experion Solution Suites with Honeywell UOP licensed technology units, USA BioEnergy can manage investment risks, improve scheduling flexibility, and prepare operators for startup.

Experion PKS optimizes plant performance through real-time automation, predictive maintenance, and advanced safety systems, aiming to reduce downtime and costs while increasing efficiency. Built-in redundancy, cybersecurity, and analytics further ensure stable operations. At the Bon Wier biorefinery, Experion PKS supports reliable scaling of operations and risk management.

The Bon Wier project brings together Honeywell, Johnson Matthey and USA BioEnergy. How does this collaboration create a model for integrated SAF production and what lessons can be applied globally?

Rajesh Gattupalli: USA BioEnergy’s biorefinery demonstrates how advanced technology can rapidly scale SAF production. Together with Johnson Matthey’s technology, we offer an integrated solution that combines Fischer-Tropsch technology, Honeywell’s FT Unicracking process, and the Experion PKS control system. This approach streamlines project timelines, reduces capital costs and ensures reliability from start to finish.

The key takeaway is that collaboration between technology providers, feedstock suppliers, and producers accelerates SAF projects. With global demand for biofuels set to rise, this integrated model offers a blueprint for expanding sustainable aviation fuel production worldwide.

Feedstock availability and costs are often seen as bottlenecks for SAF growth. How is Honeywell addressing these challenges through technology innovation and partnerships?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Honeywell’s technologies are designed to help producers overcome cost and feedstock availability challenges. We have pioneered technologies that expand the range of viable feedstocks, including Ecofining™ to process natural oils, greases and waste oils; our Ethanol-to-Jet process to convert ethanol from corn, sugarcane and cellulosic materials; eFining™ to turn captured CO2 and green hydrogen into methanol for SAF; and FT Unicracking to process Fischer Tropsch liquids and waxes derived from waste, biogas, and captured CO2 combined with green hydrogen. Each of these pathways helps reduce pressure on traditional feedstocks and lowers the cost barrier for producers.

We are also forming strategic alliances and collaborative efforts to bring these solutions to market faster. Our agreement with USA BioEnergy is converting one million tons of forest thinnings into 65 million gallons of SAF annually, while our global technology alliance with Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy and SAMSUNG E&A is helping producers leverage waste and biomass feedstocks at scale. These collaborations show how combining technology innovation with industry collaboration can directly address the feedstock and cost challenges facing SAF growth.

Beyond SAF, what role does Honeywell see for other alternative fuels—such as renewable diesel, e-fuels and hydrogen—in aviation and broader transportation decarbonization?

Rajesh Gattupalli: We take an “all-in” approach to energy transformation. Meeting the needs of aviation and transportation will require multiple fuel pathways working together, not just a single solution. That’s why Honeywell is advancing renewable diesel, e-fuels, hydrogen and other alternatives alongside SAF.

The world will continue to need more energy, and the challenge is to expand supply while keeping costs competitive, ensuring security and reducing emissions. By optimizing today’s fuels while scaling the alternatives of tomorrow, we can broaden the mix of available energy sources. This approach gives airlines and industries greater choice, creates resilience and helps deliver the fuels needed to keep up with demand growth.

Looking ahead, what technological breakthroughs or system-level innovations is Honeywell prioritizing to ensure SAF becomes both sustainable and cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel worldwide?

Rajesh Gattupalli: Looking ahead, we are prioritizing both technological breakthroughs and system-level innovations that make SAF cost-competitive while ensuring it meets industry and emission-reduction standards. We continue to build on our hydrocracking expertise, which we have pioneered for more than 70 years, while advancing new pathways like eFining™, which uses abundant feedstocks such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce SAF.

At the system level, we are investing in modular technologies that shorten project timelines and reduce capital costs, as well as digital solutions like Experion PKS that improve efficiency, reliability and safety across facilities. We are also expanding the range of viable feedstocks through technologies such as Ethanol-to-Jet and FT Unicracking, so producers have more flexibility to source what is most available and cost-effective in their region. And through collaborations with complementary technology and service providers like Johnson Matthey, GIDARA Energy and SAMSUNG E&A, we are demonstrating how integrated, end-to-end solutions can scale globally.

By combining these technological pathways with system-level advances, we are working to make SAF both sustainable and cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel worldwide.

ChemAnalyst Insights on JET Kerosene Market

Jet kerosene, the conventional aviation fuel refined from petroleum, is increasingly being complemented by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—a bio-based, “drop-in” alternative that can be seamlessly blended with traditional kerosene for use in existing aircraft and infrastructure. While both fuels share compatibility, SAF’s distinct advantage lies in its lower carbon footprint, achieved by recycling atmospheric CO2 through renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and municipal waste.

In North America, jet kerosene spot prices remained relatively subdued during the second quarter of 2025, reflecting weaker market momentum compared to the previous year. Despite firm crude oil values, ample refinery production, high inventories, and cautious airline procurement kept jet fuel rates under pressure. June recorded a mild month-on-month uptick, supported by seasonal travel demand and speculative buying, though underlying fundamentals stayed soft.

Airline fuel consumption trailed prior-year levels throughout the quarter—usage dipped in April even as passenger volumes rose—while average fuel costs per gallon declined from March. Supply conditions remained favorable, with Gulf Coast refiners operating steadily and imports from Nigeria’s Dangote refinery and Russia helping to sustain market balance.

Meanwhile, industry focus is steadily pivoting toward SAF. Although current availability remains limited, evolving policy mandates and corporate ESG commitments are beginning to reshape procurement strategies—placing long-term structural pressure on conventional jet fuel demand.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-10 11:57:38.899141

The study identified corn oil as the safest bet for making SAF in Kentucky thanks to its low risk profile, according to Eduardo Santillan-Jimenez, Ph.D., associate director of CAER's Sustainable and Alternative Fuels Research Group. He noted that such a finding can guide the decision-making of stakeholders interested in investing in SAF-related projects in the Commonwealth.

SAF is an alternative to jet fuel that can be made from everyday materials like plant oils, animal fats and recycled cooking grease, can be blended up to 50% with traditional jet fuel for use in commercial aircraft and represents a market potential of $80 billion globally (by 2035). Jet fuel is the fourth most consumed fuel in the Commonwealth and is critical for Kentucky's three air hubs as well as for national defense aviation operations at the Kentucky National Guard, Fort Knox and Fort Campbell.

""As the aviation industry looks to diversify its fuel sources and become more sustainable, SAF represents an advanced energy economic development opportunity for Kentucky. It creates new markets for agricultural products, brings investment to processing infrastructure and directly supports fuel diversification and local production supporting Kentucky's Energy Security Plan,"" said Kenya Stump, executive director of the Kentucky Office of Energy Policy.

Essential to this growth, however, is understanding the supply chain risk necessary to attract infrastructure and manufacturing investments. The risk assessment conducted by UK CAER focused on soybean oil, corn oil and distillers corn oil - which are some of the most important agricultural commodities in Kentucky - as well as on animal fats (from livestock rendering), yellow grease (used cooking oil) and brown grease (FOG recovered from grease traps and/or from wastewater treatment plants).

Six types of risks were reviewed based on a U.S. Department of Energy standard that helps investors better understand the risks of using biomass as a resource, making it easier to support and grow the bioeconomy.

""Risk was highest in supplier and supply chain categories,"" said Santillan-Jimenez. ""The risk associated with the other categories was found to be low. Both yellow and brown grease show high supplier and supply chain risk, while soybean oil shows high supplier risk but medium supply chain risk. Notably, corn oil shows medium supplier risk and low supply chain risk, making it the less risky feedstock overall.""",https://research.uky.edu/sites/default/files/styles/big_16x9/public/2025-10/eduardo_santillan-jimenez_lab.png?h=9f2ba84c&itok=FZsg4dAy,N,,2025-10-10 11:57:57.391791

Brookfield’s 20-billion-dollar Global Transition Fund raise marks a milestone in global finance.","Brookfield Asset Management has raised 20 billion U.S. dollars for its second global energy transition fund. This makes it the largest private fund ever created for clean energy and decarbonization projects.

The fund, called the Brookfield Global Transition Fund II (BGTF II), will invest in renewable energy, carbon capture, nuclear, and other low-carbon solutions worldwide. Brookfield said the fund exceeded its target.

The company will commit about 25 percent of the capital from its own balance sheet, showing strong confidence in the opportunity. More than 200 global investors joined the fund, including major pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and insurers.

Brookfield also secured 3.5 billion dollars in co-investments from partners that will join in large projects. The firm has already deployed $5 billion from the fund into new projects. This shows a quick start in building clean energy infrastructure on a large scale.

From BGTF I to BGTF II: Bigger, Broader, and More Ambitious

Brookfield’s first transition fund, BGTF I, launched in 2021 with $15 billion. It focused on renewable power, carbon capture, battery storage, sustainable aviation fuel, and nuclear services through Westinghouse.

That first fund achieved strong performance. Brookfield says BGTF II now targets a net internal rate of return (IRR) of about 12%, slightly higher than the goal of the first fund.

BGTF II builds on that experience and scale. It seeks to change carbon-heavy industries, grow clean energy, and back technologies that reduce emissions. The company manages over $850 billion in assets. This gives it the reach and skills to handle a large platform.

Connor Teskey, President of Brookfield Asset Management, remarked:

“Energy demand is growing fast, driven by the growth of artificial intelligence as well as electrification in industry and transportation. Against this backdrop we need an ‘any and all’ approach to energy investment that will continue to favor low carbon resources. Our strategy will succeed by investing in the technologies that will deliver clean, abundant, and low-cost energy and transition solutions that underpin the global economy.”

Where the Money Will Go

BGTF II focuses on three major investment areas:

Clean energy expansions, such as wind and solar projects.

Transition technologies include battery storage, grid modernization, carbon capture, and next-generation nuclear.

Sustainable solutions that cut emissions in industries and transportation.

Early investments already include Neoen in France, Geronimo Power in the United States, and Evren in India. These projects plan to create more than 10 gigawatts of clean energy. They will use wind, solar, and battery storage.

Brookfield plans to deploy capital across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. The company is expanding into emerging markets, such as India and Brazil, where energy demand is increasing rapidly. Clean power investments can also make a big social impact.

Brookfield now oversees over 200 gigawatts of renewable power. This capacity, built or in development, can supply electricity to hundreds of millions of homes worldwide.

Record Scale in a Fast-Changing Market

The 20-billion-dollar fund comes at a time of record investment in clean energy. The International Energy Agency reports that global renewable power investment hit 680 billion dollars in 2024. Total energy transition funding also exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars.

Private infrastructure investors can raise over 2 trillion dollars by 2030 for clean energy projects. Brookfield’s new fund shows how private capital is stepping in to meet that demand.

The size of BGTF II sets it apart from rivals. It surpasses other large climate funds managed by firms like BlackRock, KKR, TPG, and Macquarie. Many analysts see it as proof that energy transition investments are moving from a niche market to the financial mainstream.

Some of the world’s biggest investors have backed the fund. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, European pension plans, and large insurers all made multi-billion-dollar commitments. Strong demand allowed Brookfield to close the fund early and above target.

Beyond Returns: ESG with Real-World Results

Brookfield’s first transition fund, BGTF I, helped avoid over 100 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions. This was achieved through the projects it financed. The new fund, BGTF II, is expected to double that impact over the next decade.

The company says its clean energy projects create tens of thousands of skilled jobs. These jobs are in construction, operations, and maintenance worldwide. In emerging markets such as India and Brazil, new renewable projects are creating steady jobs. They are also boosting local economies.

BGTF II boosts Brookfield’s role as a top investor in sustainable infrastructure from an ESG perspective.

Environmental: The fund supports renewable generation, energy storage, and industrial decarbonization — key areas for cutting emissions.

Social: The projects promote local job creation and responsible sourcing.

Governance: Brookfield promises clear ESG reporting. They provide third-party checks on emissions cuts and metrics for investors.

These steps align with global net-zero goals and contribute to keeping global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Why It Matters: The Private Capital Shift to Clean Power

Brookfield’s new fund is a signal of how the global energy system is changing. The rise of artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles is driving rapid growth in electricity demand. At the same time, governments are tightening climate policies and pushing for more clean power capacity.

Funds like BGTF II help fill the gap between public targets and real-world project financing. Private capital can move faster than government budgets and can help deliver clean energy solutions at scale.

The fund also shows that investors see climate projects as long-term infrastructure instead of short-term experiments. Stable cash flows from renewables and storage assets attract institutions. They seek both returns and a positive impact.

Building the Next Generation of Clean Energy

Brookfield plans to deploy BGTF II’s capital over the next 5 to 7 years. Early focus areas include North America, Europe, India, and Latin America — regions with clear climate policies and rising energy demand.

If executed well, the fund could help close the global investment gap in clean power and low-carbon infrastructure. It will show that sustainability and profitability can go hand in hand, and it works best with strong management and scale.

The new fuel, branded Nexa 95 Gasoline of 100% renewable origin, is compatible with existing gasoline vehicles without engine modifications and reportedly reduces net carbon dioxide (CO2?) emissions by more than 70% compared to conventional gasoline.

The fuel is currently available at 20 service stations in Spain, primarily in the Madrid and Catalonia regions. Repsol expects to expand availability to 30 stations by the end of the year, including locations in Tarragona, Valencia, Zaragoza, and Bilbao. The company is adding the renewable gasoline to its existing lineup of renewable fuels, which includes a 100% renewable diesel product.

The development marks a step in the ongoing efforts by refiners to decarbonize the transportation sector using existing vehicle infrastructure. Repsol highlighted the significance of renewable liquid fuels, noting that combustion engine vehicles—gasoline, diesel, and hybrid—represent 97% of the Spanish and European vehicle fleets.

The company also used the announcement to address the proposed European Union (EU) regulation on CO2? emission standards, which includes a potential ban on the sale of new combustion engines by 2035. Repsol suggested that the role of 100% renewable fuels should be re-evaluated within the EU's climate targets.

The press release SUGGESTS that the uncertainty created by the potential ban has contributed to the aging of Spain's vehicle fleet, which has an average age of 14.5 years. Repsol stressed the need for long-term targets and a favorable tax framework for renewable fuels to drive investment, similar to policies already in place for the aviation and maritime sectors.

Repsol’s industrial process in Tarragona, which resulted from over 20 years of research, was developed in collaboration with Honeywell. The company's strategy for decarbonizing mobility involves a combination of solutions, including electrification, renewable hydrogen, and renewable fuels.

Repsol is already operating a large-scale plant in Cartagena, Spain, focused exclusively on producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel. A second plant is scheduled to open at its Puertollano complex in 2026 with an annual capacity of approximately 200,000 tons of renewable fuel for road and maritime transport.

Repsol has established supply agreements for renewable fuels with several heavy-duty transport, passenger transport, and maritime operators across Spain and Portugal, including Scania, Alsa, and Royal Caribbean, in addition to agreements with commercial airlines such as Iberia and Ryanair for sustainable aviation fuel.

The two-year extension of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit until 2029 is a positive regarding fiscal support for biofuels. However, the requirement that feedstocks must be sourced only from the United States (US), Canada, or Mexico restricts the use of international inputs, such as used cooking oil, which is widely utilized in SAF and renewable diesel (RD) production.

Furthermore, the SAF credit is reduced from USD 1.75 to USD 1.00 per gallon, weakening the relative competitiveness of SAF compared to RD. The bill also removes indirect land use change (ILUC) from lifecycle emissions calculations, allowing previously ineligible feedstocks to qualify for tax credits, departing from internationally agreed sustainability standards approved under the CORSIA Eligible Fuel Criteria.

The OBBBA phases out the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit for projects that have not commenced by the end of 2027, which is five years earlier than under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The accelerated phase-out shortens the investment horizon for hydrogen infrastructure, particularly affecting Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF development. Given the complexities involved in PtL projects, this change may stall progress and diminish the role of the US in scaling e-fuels technologies.

Conventional jet fuel is made from petroleum.

Using internal research funding, a multidisciplinary team produced and characterized the SAF, along with two other commercially available fuels, before collecting emissions and particulate data to support the aviation industry’s emissions goals.

Fueling jets with SAF could help reduce carbon emissions. Worldwide air travel accounts for 2% of all carbon emissions, and 12% of all carbon emissions from transportation.

“Aviation is difficult to decarbonize due to the fuel density and power required for flight,” said Francesco Di Sabatino, a group leader in SwRI’s Mechanical Engineering Division. “With this project we’re gathering important data for conventional fuel and two different SAFs.”

The team tackled three focus areas – production, characterization, and testing.

First, chemical engineers refined e-fuels manufactured with hydrogen produced from electrolysis of water and captured carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. The team then processed that into an in-house SAF meeting aviation fuels standards. Then SwRI’s fuels and lubricants specialists characterized the in-house SAF and compared it with traditional jet fuel and a commercially available SAF blend. SwRI's propulsion and energy specialists used a jet engine test stand to collect emissions data.

Through a series of hydroprocessing reactions throughout several weeks, process engineers refined the e-fuel into SAF to meet federal specifications. They engineered a small batch – about one barrel of fuel – to characterize and test fuels prior to commercialization.

“All jet fuels, including SAFs, must meet ASTM quality and safety standards, along with emissions guidelines set by the EPA, but conducting a full-scale jet engine test requires millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of gallons of fuel,” Hsiang Yee Hoekstra, a manager in SwRI’s Chemical Engineering Department said. “By creating, characterizing, and measuring emissions for SAFs in small batches, we lower development costs, time, and risks for our clients.”

“We are excited to offer multidisciplinary solutions across all stages of the SAF development cycle,” said SwRI’s Executive Vice President Walt Downing. “This integrated project paired chemical and mechanical engineers with fluids and emissions experts to address several technical challenges.”

Di Sabatino will present at the Sustainable Aviation Futures Congress in Houston, October 14-16, 2025.

Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) is a leader in propulsion, aircraft technology, alternative fuels, and emissions characterization.

We already have the technologies to fight climate change – so why aren’t we deploying them faster?

That was the question I explored in my TED Countdown Talk. As Head of Climate Innovation at Tencent and an environmental engineer by training, I believe the biggest barrier to decarbonization isn’t the lack of technology – it’s how we work together.

The good news? There’s a way forward. Many scalable climate solutions are available today. From bacteria that turn CO₂ into fuel, to cooling materials that help save glaciers, we can make real impact now. The key is accelerating them by uniting science, engineering, and business to turn bold ideas into real-world solutions that help decarbonize the planet.

Catalyzing emerging low-carbon technology

“I’m more optimistic than ever that we have the answer to accelerating climate innovation, and it’s simple.”

Dr. Hao Xu, Head of Climate Innovation, Tencent

Although Tencent is not a major emitter, we are deeply committed to sustainability and tackling climate change. We have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations and supply chain by 2030 and are leveraging our capabilities to fulfil our mission of creating tech for good.

Beyond improving data center efficiency and sourcing renewable energy, we’re focused on how to catalyze the next generation of climate technology. That’s why we launched our CarbonX program in partnership with industry, investors and innovators. Three years in, I’m more optimistic than ever, because we think the right answer is not so complicated.

Through CarbonX, we've learned that successful climate tech acceleration happens when four key areas work in harmony.

1. Scientific innovation: saving decades of climate tech R&D

Let’s start with the science, which is in advanced stages. We can capture solar energy, store it using cutting-edge chemistry, and convert CO₂ into valuable products – shaving decades off development.

Take Gasgene, a startup we work with through CarbonX. Using CRISPR – a gene editing tool – to reprogram clostridium bacteria, they've essentially taught these microorganisms to ""eat"" carbon dioxide and produce butanol instead. Butanol is found in clothing, paint, water bottles, toys and the like. With engineered clostridium, we can make these everyday products from captured carbon instead of fossil fuels.

2. Engineering expertise: scaling the science from lab to real world

Next is engineering, which acts as the bridge from lab to production, bringing scientific ideas to life at scale.

Imagine building a facility to produces 20,000 tons of butanol a year from captured CO₂. Engineers must decide: what size reactors are needed? Can we use standard equipment, or must systems be customized? How do we optimize for cost, safety and energy?

Think of it like LEGO – you use existing blocks wherever possible to build something new quickly and efficiently.

Feynman Dynamics, another CarbonX innovator, faced this challenge. Their goal: produce sustainable aviation fuel by combining captured CO₂ with green hydrogen. Their breakthrough? A catalyst that blends these ingredients at the molecular level, like a smoothie machine. Inspired by pharmaceutical chemistry, they created a reactor that delivers consistent, scalable performance, cutting waste and boosting efficiency.

3. Business knowhow: turning innovation into industry

However, even the best-engineered solution can fail without a viable business model. Markets, costs and customer demand drive adoption and innovations must make commercial sense.

Yuanchu, a startup that captures CO₂ and turns it into calcium carbonate – used in paper, makeup, and toothpaste – found a smart market fit. Instead of mining limestone, they repurpose steel and industrial by-products, cutting both emissions and costs.

Another example is Moguang, which developed cutting-edge radiative cooling material that reflects over 90 percent of sunlight. It cools objects naturally without using electricity. We piloted this technology on the endangered Dagu Glacier in southwestern China. After three years, melting slowed by 80 percent.

Today, that same material is used in hundreds of thousands of smartphone screens and sports cameras. From glaciers to gadgets, climate tech innovation is full of possibilities.

4. Integration: solving the bottlenecks

So, what’s holding us back? It’s not invention, it’s isolation.

Scientists focus on discovery. Engineers optimize performance. Businesses look at balance sheets. But rarely do they work together from day one.

To accelerate climate solutions, however, these disciplines must collaborate from the start. That means:

Scientists asking: how much energy does it take to capture one ton of CO₂?

Engineers asking: can this be deployed at industrial levels?

Business leaders asking: when can we make this cost effective?

These aren’t easy conversations. But such cross-disciplinary tensions are essential to speed up progress and get us closer to decarbonization.

We’ve already seen this model succeed. With Gasgene, we helped form a clean chemical consortium, linking startups, chemical companies, and consumer brands to make carbon-based products a reality. That alignment enabled pilot deployment and scaling.

To recap, we don’t need to wait for new inventions. We need to work faster, and work together. That’s how we can accelerate the transition to a low-carbon world!",https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/10/10/12ab4d13eabf7aa2ccb4990e336b5634.png!article.cover,N,,2025-10-09 23:56:21.533646

More efficient operations—from route optimization and digital documentation to the use of renewable energy and automation—can eliminate redundant processes and help teams focus on higher-value work. For instance, the FedEx South Pacific Regional Hub in Singapore began using solar panels that meet more than half of the facility’s total electricity demands, while the FedEx Incheon Gateway in South Korea is powered in part by 2,400 rooftop solar panels, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and potentially generating long-term cost savings. Other FedEx facilities across APAC are also being upgraded with energy-efficient systems.

Beyond facility efficiency and renewable energy, FedEx is also looking to alternative fuels to help reduce emissions and power its fleet. FedEx started to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in 2025; the fuel will account for roughly a fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX, addressing aviation emissions alongside ground transportation.

More Sustainable Deliveries With Smarter Networks

Last-mile delivery, often the most resource-intensive part of the supply chain, is being transformed by electrification and technology. In APAC, FedEx is rolling out electric delivery vehicles (EVs) for last-mile deliveries that are tailored to the needs of local markets.

This shift is already visible in markets like Singapore, where FedEx has introduced custom-built electric vans. In China, EVs now make up more than 20% of the country’s FedEx delivery fleet, while new additions were also made to the fleet in Malaysia, New Zealand, Japan and Thailand. FedEx also completed its first cross-border EV delivery between Malaysia and Singapore. In Taiwan, the company has even introduced electric tricycles to navigate dense urban environments more efficiently.

This transition has business implications beyond sustainability. With fewer emissions, lower fuel costs and reduced maintenance needs, FedEx is creating a more resilient network.

Delivering Measurable Impact for Customers

While FedEx continues to transform its own operations, it also recognizes the need to support customers to meet their sustainability goals. In particular, a company’s ability to measure and manage carbon emissions has become critical.

To address this, FedEx has developed FedEx®Sustainability Insights, a self-serve digital platform that enables customers to track and analyze emissions data related to their shipments across the FedEx network.

This tool provides granular data on shipment-related emissions by mode of transport, service type and geography, enabling businesses to identify high-emissions routes and make emissions-informed logistics decisions.

FedEx has also introduced paperless solutions such as Electronic Trade Documents, which allow customs information to be submitted electronically. This not only reduces paper usage across millions of packages daily but also helps to make cross-border shipping more efficient and increase customer satisfaction.

Making a Difference Beyond Business

FedEx’s sustainability approach also extends into the communities it serves. Through FedEx Cares, the company’s global community engagement program, it supports local sustainability and education initiatives across the region.

In FY25, FedEx has significantly stepped up its support for volunteer-driven environmental initiatives in APAC, with volunteer participation in community projects increasing 20% year-on-year. The number of sustainability-focused community programs also grew 14% year-on-year during the same period. These initiatives have made a tangible impact on local communities and ecosystems, from restoring mangrove forests in Bengkalis, Indonesia to cleaning up riverbanks in Tokyo, Japan. Collectively, FedEx team members have planted 3,465 trees and native plants, helping preserve and protect natural ecosystems where the company operates.

The annual FedEx Cares Purple Tote Campaign remains a cornerstone of the company’s community engagement efforts. In FY25, over 800 team members from across APAC dedicated more than 1,000 volunteer hours to collect and donate more than 3,600 kilograms of essential supplies. Through collaboration with 20 non-profit organizations, these efforts impacted over 1,600 beneficiaries, including young children, the elderly and underserved communities.

FedEx has also expanded its 2025 Library Program, recognizing education as essential to sustainable development in rural and underserved areas. The initiative reached 40 schools and communities across China this year, providing educational resources that benefit approximately 9,000 children and teachers by creating conducive learning environments.

For SMEs looking to give back to their communities, these programs offer useful models of how to align business goals with social impact. Volunteering can also strengthen employee engagement, while partnerships with non-profits can amplify reach and effectiveness.

Strengthening Customer and Employee Loyalty

Whether it’s through more sustainable operations or community initiatives, a strong sustainability strategy can help SMEs attract more environmentally conscious customers, build brand loyalty and differentiate themselves in competitive markets. Increasingly, consumers expect carbon-efficient delivery options and often prefer to buy from brands with credible sustainability practices. This creates a “flywheel effect”: responsible sourcing and shipping contribute to customer satisfaction, which can in turn drive repeat business.

Internally, sustainability also plays a role in talent acquisition and retention. Companies with strong sustainability values may be more likely to attract top talent and foster a culture of engagement. A positive workplace culture, supported by clear values and actionable initiatives, helps improve retention and boost team morale, which are particularly valuable for SMEs competing for skilled talent.

A Collective Effort

Businesses now view sustainability as a core strategy that requires collaboration across the value chain. FedEx works alongside its customers, technology partners and industry peers to help scale solutions that support sustainable, smarter trade across APAC.

Whether through carbon-efficient shipping options, emissions tracking tools or smarter infrastructure, SMEs can make informed decisions to help optimize their environmental performance. By doing so, they are building a foundation for long-term resilience and growth.

Ultimately, sustainability is about unlocking value. Through investment in innovation, smarter operations and data-driven services, FedEx is helping SMEs across the region seize new opportunities and build a logistics strategy that works for both the bottom line and the planet.",https://forbesasiacustom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FedEx-Oct-25-Image-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-10-09 22:56:55.219685

(WJHL) – While many think tariffs are behind the struggles Tennessee farmers are facing this harvest season, some say stagnant prices and soaring input costs are the real culprits.
“We were already seeing these low prices, and of course, there is a supply and demand situation that takes place there,” Maddox said.
“The input costs are going up,” Klepper said.
“Agriculture is our number one industry in Tennessee,” Maddox said.
“Because the longer they drag out, the more it’s going to hurt Tennessee farmers.”","GREENE COUNTY, Tenn. (WJHL) – While many think tariffs are behind the struggles Tennessee farmers are facing this harvest season, some say stagnant prices and soaring input costs are the real culprits.

Tennessee Farm Bureau Director of Communications Lee Maddox said he’s “extremely concerned about where our farmers are going to be at the end of this year and especially going into next year,” adding that the agriculture industry in the state lost $430 million last year and $730 million over the past two years, well before the latest tariffs were in place.

“We were already seeing these low prices, and of course, there is a supply and demand situation that takes place there,” Maddox said. “But the inflation costs do not add up to the price that farmers get for the crops they produce.”

Mark Klepper has owned Woodlawn Farms for decades and says about 20% of his crop is exported. He told News Channel 11 that the price of fertilizer alone has more than tripled since he began, while the price he can sell his goods for has remained largely unchanged.

“The input costs are going up,” Klepper said. “And our crop prices are the same now that they’ve been for the last three or four years. And really, if you look back, I mean, other than a few peaks in a few years, the same prices we’ve had for the last 40 years.”

Klepper believes the best long-term fix is “to increase usage in the United States” to support farmers across the country.

According to Maddox, one way to do that is to increase the amount of biofuel we produce and to make it available year-round instead of seasonally.

“Biofuels is one of the most important ways that we can support a long-term future for our farmers who grow corn and soybeans,” Maddox said. “Both of those are used pretty readily for ethanol and biodiesel. And we’re even talking about, and there’s a lot of research being done on sustainable aviation fuel that would be derived from soybeans.”

However, he believes a new farm bill, which has not been updated since 2018, should be the priority as it brings certainty to the farmers and rural communities.

“Agriculture is our number one industry in Tennessee,” Maddox said. “It’s the number one driver of our economy. It contributes over $103 billion each year. And that’s significant in terms of what it means to our rural economies as well.”

Maddox acknowledged that eventually the tariffs will have an effect, especially if they go on long-term.

“We just encourage the administration to quickly try to resolve any of these tariff disputes,” Maddox said. “Because the longer they drag out, the more it’s going to hurt Tennessee farmers.”",https://www.wjhl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2025/10/featured_480b8d.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-09 22:57:06.677493

From Ambition to Action Asia’s energy transition is not just an environmental imperative; it is an economic one.","Across Asia-Pacific, more than 350 million people have limited access to electricity, while 150 million have none at all. Southeast Asia’s (SEA) power needs will more than double by 2050 compared to 2022, while global electricity use from data centers is expected to exceed twice the current levels by 2030.

The convergence of electrification, industrialization and digitalization means Asia faces a potential energy crisis: how to expand access while simultaneously decarbonizing. The region cannot meet this challenge through government action alone. While the private sector has both the capital and the capacity to accelerate solutions, it must work hand-in-hand with policymakers.

Anderson Tanoto, Managing Director at RGE, with global operations in the bio-based resources and energy sectors, explains: “No single country, company or institution can deliver the energy transition on its own. The private sector brings innovation, capital and speed; governments provide vision and enabling frameworks. Together, we can build an energy system that is sustainable, inclusive and built to last.”

Partnerships That Scale Impact

Energy transition requires collaboration that crosses industries and borders. RGE’s joint venture with TotalEnergies, Singa Renewables, shows what is possible. Supported by the governments of Indonesia and Singapore, the partnership is developing a utility-scale solar and battery energy storage system in Riau, Indonesia.

When operational, the project will supply green electricity to both Indonesia and Singapore while stimulating investments, creating skilled jobs and strengthening regional energy security. The collaboration marries RGE’s deep local roots with TotalEnergies’ global expertise in utility-scale renewables.

Singapore’s Energy Market Authority has already granted Singa Renewables a conditional license for up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of solar energy from Indonesia, a step aligned with Singapore’s target of 6 GW of low-carbon imports by 2035. Building on this, RGE and TotalEnergies signed an agreement with Singapore Energy Interconnections to co-develop a subsea interconnector, a vital step toward the ASEAN Power Grid, which aims to strengthen cross-border electricity trade and accelerate an equitable transition.

Innovation Beyond Electricity

The transition extends beyond power generation. RGE is advancing a waste-to-value strategy by transforming waste and residues from its agribusiness Apical’s global supply chain into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through Apical, it has partnered with Spain’s Moeve to build Southern Europe’s largest SAF plant. Scheduled to be operational in 2026, the facility will produce 500,000 tonnes of SAF annually, reducing carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

In parallel, RGE is investing in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transition fuel. Together with Canada’s Enbridge Inc., it is developing Woodfibre LNG, the world’s first net zero LNG export facility, in British Columbia.

Tanoto notes: “The toughest sectors to decarbonize demand innovation and collaboration on multiple fronts—and the private sector can scale and share expertise across regions.”

Unlocking SEA’s Renewable Potential

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates SEA’s renewable potential to be 40 to 50 times greater than its current electricity generation. But scale requires more than ambition. Derisking large-scale projects is critical to attracting capital and accelerating deployment.

Governments hold the keys by setting clear, consistent policies that endure beyond political cycles, establishing supportive regulations and cross-border agreements, and designing mandates and targeted subsidies to overcome first-mover risks.

Private players, meanwhile, must manage risks within their control: access to land, building enabling infrastructure, proving technical feasibility, and ensuring benefits flow equitably across markets. Shared value is essential for regional buy-in.

From Ambition to Action

Asia’s energy transition is not just an environmental imperative; it is an economic one. Reliable, low-carbon energy underpins growth, competitiveness and social inclusion.

RGE’s experience shows that commercial viability and long-term impact can go hand in hand. With scale, innovation and cross-border collaboration, the private sector can unlock the capital and expertise to complement government leadership.

Says Tanoto: “Energy is the foundation of progress. If Asia can expand access while decarbonizing, we won’t just meet demand. We will define how economies can grow sustainably, inclusively and competitively for generations to come.”",https://forbesasiacustom.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RGE-Oct-2025-Image-1-150x150.png,N,,2025-10-09 22:57:12.759626

This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.
Space is limited in government conservation programs, however, and farmers must prove that they aren’t already engaging in climate-smart practices to obtain credits.
This approach could subsequently be broadened to reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices for crops to supply food and feed markets as well.
Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.","A team of agricultural economists, environmental scientists and policy experts envisions a path toward a carbon-neutral agricultural future by expanding the reach of policies designed to promote low-carbon biofuels for transportation and aviation. In a new paper in the journal Science, the researchers propose policies that would reward farmers for adopting “climate-smart” practices when growing biofuel crops and remove the hurdles that currently thwart such efforts.

Climate-smart practices include techniques that build soil carbon, like cover-cropping, not tilling fields after harvest and adding biochar or finely ground silicate rock to soils; and those that reduce the carbon footprint of crop production, like optimizing the timing of fertilizer application, electrifying farm vehicles and improving crop genetics.

Studies show that, if adopted globally, “climate-smart” farming practices could reduce carbon emissions by 4-8 billion tonnes per year, the researchers wrote. To put that in perspective, in 2024, global carbon dioxide emissions reached an all-time high of about 40 billion tonnes.

“Biofuel markets can be a pathway to decarbonize agriculture as a whole,” said Madhu Khanna, a professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and lead author of the new report. Khanna is the director of the Institute for Sustainability, Energy and Environment and a researcher in the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, at the U. of I.

“Currently, our biofuel policies don’t reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices,” Khanna said. “For example, they treat all corn grown for the corn-ethanol market the same, whether or not the farmers adopt those types of practices. By accounting for differences in practices implemented at the farm level and paying a premium for corn grown with climate-smart practices for corn ethanol, biofuel policies can incentivize adoption of these practices.”

Biofuel markets have already established mechanisms for accounting for the carbon-intensity of different feedstock types and have well-developed channels for transferring payments from energy markets to biofuel producers, the researchers report. This opens the door to using these channels to expand performance-based incentives to increase the adoption of climate-smart practices in agriculture.

“For example, the ‘40B’ Sustainable Aviation Fuel tax credit of 2023-2024 was designed to differentiate the credit based on the climate-smart practices adopted while producing the crop,” Khanna said. “The lower the carbon intensity, the higher the tax credit paid for sustainable aviation fuels and for the crop used to produce it.”

At present, however, the channels for crediting farmers for soil-carbon sequestration or other climate-friendly practices on the farm are segregated from the markets that provide credits for low-carbon biofuels, Khanna said. To be compensated for their sustainability efforts in growing the crops, farmers must either enroll in a conservation program or sell carbon credits to one of several companies specializing in agricultural carbon offsets. Space is limited in government conservation programs, however, and farmers must prove that they aren’t already engaging in climate-smart practices to obtain credits. This requires a lot of extra effort on the farmer’s part.

“It also means that early adopters get penalized,” Khanna said

Khanna and her colleagues propose an approach for merging the biofuel feedstock market and climate-offset market into a single channel to reward farmers and others in the biofuel supply chain who use practices that lower the carbon-intensity of their operations. This approach could subsequently be broadened to reward farmers for adopting climate-smart practices for crops to supply food and feed markets as well.

Like existing policies, any new approach would require verification that farmers are actually implementing the practices they’ve pledged to follow.

“Emerging digital technologies and modeling advances can document farming practices and accurately calculate their carbon intensity. This can simplify and scale this process,” said Bruno Basso, a co-author of the study and an expert in modeling and digital agriculture at Michigan State University. Certification programs could allow independent verification that feedstocks were sustainably produced.

Calculating the changes in the amount of carbon sequestered in crop soils precisely each year is a more daunting task, the authors wrote. But “using multiple process-based ecosystem models can reduce the uncertainty in these estimates and avoid the need for labor-intensive soil sampling procedures,” Basso added.

Another concern is the chance that farmers will implement and then abandon various climate-smart practices, Khanna said.

“If they do it one year and not the next, they’ll sequester the carbon and then, perhaps, release it back to the atmosphere the following year,” she said. “But we can design incentives for longer-term soil-carbon sequestration by having farmers sign longer-term contracts. This would relate the size of the payments to how long the farmer agrees to keep that carbon in the ground.”

Khanna acknowledges that the carbon benefits from existing biofuels are controversial. Some critics argue that devoting farmland to the production of plant-based fuels takes up land that can be used for food crops and can contribute to the conversion of forests to cropland in other parts of the world, erasing its sustainability gains.

But current approaches could be under- or overestimating the carbon benefits of biofuels by disregarding the carbon effects of crop management practices implemented on the farm producing the crop for the biofuel market.

“By developing a market for agricultural products that accounts for all the direct and indirect carbon emission effects from the farm to the consumer, we can better address these concerns,” she said. “The main premise of our proposal is that we need to have a full and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from the beginning to the end of any product’s life cycle. And right now, the way that biofuel policies are designed, they treat crop producers supplying crop for a biofuel as all being the same.”

While technological improvements in aircraft and operational efficiencies play a role, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is widely recognized as the single most promising pathway for immediate and scalable decarbonization. In the United States, policy incentives, corporate climate commitments, and capital market interest have catalyzed SAF development, but significant challenges remain in financing and contracting. This article explores the evolving landscape of SAF financing and contract structures, focusing on the U.S. market, and offers insights for industry stakeholders seeking to navigate this complex environment.

An overview of SAF

Definition and characteristics: SAF is a class of aviation fuels derived from renewable or waste sources that can replace or supplement conventional petroleum-based jet fuel. To be classified as “sustainable,” these fuels must demonstrate a significant reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to fossil jet fuel. Key sustainability criteria also include responsible feedstock sourcing, land use considerations, and avoidance of negative impacts on food security or biodiversity.

Feedstocks and production pathways: The main SAF production pathways in the U.S. include hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) using waste oils and fats; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, or forestry byproducts; and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes using ethanol or isobutanol as intermediates. The U.S. is a leader in HEFA production, reflecting a mature supply chain for waste lipids and established refining expertise.

Regulatory and technical standards: U.S. SAF must comply with ASTM D7566, which specifies criteria for fuel quality, safety, and blending limits with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel. The Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. EPA, and U.S. Department of Energy provide regulatory oversight, while the Renewable Fuel Standard and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standards (e.g., California) further incentivize SAF production and use.

Key drivers for SAF adoption

Regulatory incentives and mandates: The policy environment in the U.S. is a primary driver of SAF growth. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a blender’s tax credit for SAF, offering up to $1.75 per gallon for fuels achieving at least a 50% lifecycle GHG reduction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduced and capped this tax credit at $1 per gallon, but extended it through Dec. 31, 2029. The RFS provides renewable identification numbers (RINs) for renewable jet fuel, creating a secondary revenue stream for producers. California’s LCFS offers additional credits based on carbon intensity, further improving project economics for SAF producers in or supplying to California.

Internationally, the International Civil Aviation Organization has implemented the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, mandating emissions monitoring and offsetting for international flights. While not directly enforceable in the U.S., CORSIA shapes market expectations and is influencing airlines’ procurement strategies.

Economic and industry commitments: Major U.S. airlines have made public commitments to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, with interim targets for SAF adoption. These commitments are translating into long-term offtake agreements and direct investments in SAF projects. Corporate buyers (e.g., tech companies with significant travel emissions) are participating in voluntary markets for Scope 1 and 3 environmental attributes to decarbonize their travel footprints, even when physical SAF supply is not locally available.

Market and consumer pressures: Aviation customers and investors are increasingly demanding transparency and progress on carbon reduction. SAF is a visible, reportable way for airlines to demonstrate climate leadership, which in turn drives demand for scalable, bankable SAF projects.

Financing trends for SAF projects

Investment models

SAF projects require large upfront capital expenditures and face unique risks compared to conventional refining. As a result, a variety of financing models are emerging in the U.S.:

Project finance: Larger, commercial-scale facilities often use non-recourse or limited-recourse project finance, where lenders rely on project cash flows and contracts (especially long-term offtake agreements) for repayment. Lenders scrutinize feedstock contracts, technology risk and offtake terms.

Corporate finance: Some established biofuel producers with strong balance sheets may finance SAF projects internally or through corporate debt.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs): Federal and state grants, loan guarantees (e.g., the U.S. DOE’s Loan Programs Office), and tax incentives are blended with private equity and debt, reducing risk and catalyzing investment.

Venture capital and private dquity: Early-stage SAF technology developers attract venture funding, though investors typically seek clear commercialization pathways and strong intellectual property protections.

Green bonds and ESG investments

Institutional investors are increasingly using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to guide capital allocation. Green bonds and sustainability-linked loans are being deployed for SAF projects, with proceeds earmarked for projects that meet third-party sustainability standards. For example, an airport authority or airline may issue a green bond to finance SAF infrastructure, reporting annually on environmental outcomes.

Risk allocation and mitigation

Key risks in SAF project finance include:

Feedstock supply and price risk: Long-term, fixed-price feedstock contracts are rare; supply can be affected by weather, competing demand, or regulatory changes.

Technology risk: Novel conversion technologies may not scale as projected, leading to cost overruns or underperformance.

Regulatory risk: Project economics depend on the continued availability of tax credits, RINs and LCFS incentives, all of which are subject to policy change.

To mitigate these risks, project sponsors pursue diversified feedstock supply, insurance products, conservative financial modeling, and strong contractual protections.

Protective risk policies

Recent developments in risk mitigation for SAF project financing have seen the emergence of innovative insurance products and policy structures designed to address the unique risks faced by project developers, lenders, and investors. These protective risk policies are increasingly critical to wrap technology risk, protect revenue streams, provide floors on offtake and collars on feedstock agreements in an evolving regulatory and market landscape.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Mc_Shane_Patrick_headshot2_41e654c739.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 19:56:20.122108

While technological improvements in aircraft and operational efficiencies play a role, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is widely recognized as the single most promising pathway for immediate and scalable decarbonization. In the United States, policy incentives, corporate climate commitments, and capital market interest have catalyzed SAF development, but significant challenges remain in financing and contracting. This article explores the evolving landscape of SAF financing and contract structures, focusing on the U.S. market, and offers insights for industry stakeholders seeking to navigate this complex environment.

An overview of SAF

Definition and characteristics: SAF is a class of aviation fuels derived from renewable or waste sources that can replace or supplement conventional petroleum-based jet fuel. To be classified as “sustainable,” these fuels must demonstrate a significant reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to fossil jet fuel. Key sustainability criteria also include responsible feedstock sourcing, land use considerations, and avoidance of negative impacts on food security or biodiversity.

Feedstocks and production pathways: The main SAF production pathways in the U.S. include hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) using waste oils and fats; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, or forestry byproducts; and alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) processes using ethanol or isobutanol as intermediates. The U.S. is a leader in HEFA production, reflecting a mature supply chain for waste lipids and established refining expertise.

Regulatory and technical standards: U.S. SAF must comply with ASTM D7566, which specifies criteria for fuel quality, safety, and blending limits with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel. The Federal Aviation Administration, U.S. EPA, and U.S. Department of Energy provide regulatory oversight, while the Renewable Fuel Standard and state-level Low Carbon Fuel Standards (e.g., California) further incentivize SAF production and use.

Key drivers for SAF adoption

Regulatory incentives and mandates: The policy environment in the U.S. is a primary driver of SAF growth. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a blender’s tax credit for SAF, offering up to $1.75 per gallon for fuels achieving at least a 50% lifecycle GHG reduction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduced and capped this tax credit at $1 per gallon, but extended it through Dec. 31, 2029. The RFS provides renewable identification numbers (RINs) for renewable jet fuel, creating a secondary revenue stream for producers. California’s LCFS offers additional credits based on carbon intensity, further improving project economics for SAF producers in or supplying to California.

Internationally, the International Civil Aviation Organization has implemented the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, mandating emissions monitoring and offsetting for international flights. While not directly enforceable in the U.S., CORSIA shapes market expectations and is influencing airlines’ procurement strategies.

Economic and industry commitments: Major U.S. airlines have made public commitments to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, with interim targets for SAF adoption. These commitments are translating into long-term offtake agreements and direct investments in SAF projects. Corporate buyers (e.g., tech companies with significant travel emissions) are participating in voluntary markets for Scope 1 and 3 environmental attributes to decarbonize their travel footprints, even when physical SAF supply is not locally available.

Market and consumer pressures: Aviation customers and investors are increasingly demanding transparency and progress on carbon reduction. SAF is a visible, reportable way for airlines to demonstrate climate leadership, which in turn drives demand for scalable, bankable SAF projects.

Financing trends for SAF projects

Investment models

SAF projects require large upfront capital expenditures and face unique risks compared to conventional refining. As a result, a variety of financing models are emerging in the U.S.:

Project finance: Larger, commercial-scale facilities often use non-recourse or limited-recourse project finance, where lenders rely on project cash flows and contracts (especially long-term offtake agreements) for repayment. Lenders scrutinize feedstock contracts, technology risk and offtake terms.

Corporate finance: Some established biofuel producers with strong balance sheets may finance SAF projects internally or through corporate debt.

Public-private partnerships (PPPs): Federal and state grants, loan guarantees (e.g., the U.S. DOE’s Loan Programs Office), and tax incentives are blended with private equity and debt, reducing risk and catalyzing investment.

Venture capital and private dquity: Early-stage SAF technology developers attract venture funding, though investors typically seek clear commercialization pathways and strong intellectual property protections.

Green bonds and ESG investments

Institutional investors are increasingly using environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria to guide capital allocation. Green bonds and sustainability-linked loans are being deployed for SAF projects, with proceeds earmarked for projects that meet third-party sustainability standards. For example, an airport authority or airline may issue a green bond to finance SAF infrastructure, reporting annually on environmental outcomes.

This initiative aims to position the industrial-port zone as a European hub for hydrogen and e-SAF production, supporting France’s and Europe’s decarbonisation ambitions.

75 000 tpy of e-SAF will be produced from green hydrogen produced by 300 MW water electrolysers, and from captured CO2, with first production expected in 2030. This project exemplifies a significant step towards reindustrialising France in line with Europe’s ambition for sustainable aviation.

A key aspect of this project is the potential of methanol-to-jet fuel synthesis pathway, which offers a promising route for decarbonising aviation. Methanol, produced from green hydrogen and captured carbon, will be converted into high-quality jet fuel, providing a scalable solution that can be used without modifying aircraft.

Aligned with European objectives to incorporate 10% e-SAF into aviation fuels by 2040, as outlined in the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, this project underscores France and Europe’s commitment to a cleaner, more competitive aviation sector.

A collaboration built on strength and innovation

Following early-stage engineering studies, the project demonstrates Rely’s strong position in integrating electrolysis and gas-to-liquid technologies. Rely brings a strong track record and foundation of technological excellence and project execution capability. Studies will also integrate technological providers for CO2 to methanol and methanol-to-jet technological bricks. The studies conducted will pave and accelerate the way for a potential FEED study.

H4 Marseille Fos’s connection to the European pipeline network makes it an ideal location to serve southern and eastern France, as well as the Mediterranean basin and airports in the rest of Europe. H4 Marseille Fos is strongly supported at regional level as a levy for the decarbonisation of local industry.

Such collaboration between Rely and H4 Marseille Fos, through its parent companies H2V and Hy2gen, is envisioned to support a sustainable and competitive aviation fuel supply chain, leveraging partnerships as catalysts for the development of green hydrogen and its derivatives. Supported by Région Sud, Marseille Provence Airport, and Vinci Airports, the initiative exemplifies a collaborative ecosystem approach to innovation and sustainability in aviation.

Damien Eyriès, CEO of Rely, stated: “This project marks a strategic milestone for Rely, reinforcing our position as a leading expert in e-SAF and hydrogen solutions and showcasing our innovative efforts to deliver and de-risk the energy transition in Europe. Leveraging our engineering expertise and our standardisation approach, we are committed to advancing this landmark project towards next development stages, therefore with the aim of accelerating its final investment decision (FID).”

A team led by a venture spun off from Oxford spun and heavy weights in aircraft manufacturing and green financiers made a notable announcement (below) that they were infusing £20.75 MILLION ($28 MILLION) for sustainable aviation fuel development. The SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT, THE PROMISING TECHNOLOGY AND THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INVESTORS make this a significant milestone in the drive to 2050.

The goal of Net Zero Carbon emissions by 2050 is one of , if not the, greatest challenge for aviation. Billions have been committed by OEMs, major capital venture companies, foundations, universities, NGOs and countries. Here is a short list of blogs focused on the players, the variety of energy sources, exploring different chemical options to convert raw materials into suitable fuels, the environmental consequences of harvesting the feedstocks for SAF,the distribution for these new sources and the infrastructure needed, the capacity of CO reduction through cleaner engines, similar analyses of fuselages’ impact on emissions and even operational tactics’ which may be greener:

These provide some context to the 2050 goal campaign, so many different directions and with so little apparent coordination )competition better?). In this universe SAF is but one option and it is not without possible problems and doubters.

SO WHY TOUTING THIS OXFORD PRESS RELEASE AS SIGNIFICANT?

An excellent assessment of SAF has been published by ICCTO20, Why and how to bring down the cost of SAF. The OXCCU “solution” seems to meet the ICCTO20 identified impediments-

COMPARATIVE PRICE-“European Union Aviation Safety Agency estimated that the average production cost of SAF in 2024 ranged from €1,461 per tonne (for biofuels) to €7,695 per tonne (for e-fuels). We calculate that this is a cost premium of 2.1–10.6x compared with fossil jet fuel by converting fossil jet production costs from the International Energy Agency, reported in U.S. dollars per liter, into equivalent units. While e-fuel costs should come down when they arrive on the market around 2030, they are expected to remain far above the current price of fossil jet fuel.”

The Oxford production technology looks to be a cost effective method for refining

RISK OF INVESTMENT—“It takes up to 5 years for SAF projects to reach final investment decision—a critical stage during project development that indicates whether projects are ready to move forward to construction—and many projects fail before this is achieved. Earlier this year, consulting group BCG found that fewer than 30% of SAF projects globally have reached final investment decision. Often projects come apart due to technology “valleys of death” during the transition between the demonstration and commercialization stages. This can be the result of poor project financing, mismanagement, or unforeseen technical barriers. SAF projects require significant funding and investor backing, particularly when constructing first-of-a-kind (FOAK) facilities.

If funding support fluctuates (as it has with the recently revised 45Z tax credits in the United States), if producers cannot secure long-term offtake agreements, or if governments and other investors do not provide sufficient loan support, SAF projects may fail before final investment decision.

OXCCU has attracted an uber impressive investment team which has a gravitas by including

a consortium of airlines, likely excellent judges of the prices and the practical implementation issues;

a major OEM that knows how its powerplants and systems emit carbon plus what their machinery ingests a range of potential fuels

six financial institutions that already participate in the green energy sector and thus have insights into OXCCU’s competitors

As noted green investor, celebrated baseball player and manager, Yogi Berra[1] once opined that…

As good as the OXCCU prospects appear to be, innovation, technology, market prices and a whole host of “unknown/unknowns” may not reward the BLUES’s green solution.

Airlines and Safran Back New SAF Production Process

A Series B funding round raised $28 million for the Oxford University start-up

UK start-up OXCCU is preparing to start demonstrating its new SAF production process in a larger plant at Oxford Airport.

By Charles Alcock • Managing Editor

September 30, 2025

International Airlines Group and aircraft engines and systems group Safran are among the main investors in the Series B funding round that raised £20.75 million ($28 million) for sustainable aviation fuel innovator OXCCU. The capital will support development of the UK start-up’s OX2 fuel manufacturing demonstration plant located at Oxford Airport, which is expected to be fully operational in 2026.

OXCCU is developing a process to support mass production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by converting biogenic waste carbon and hydrogen by the end of the 2020s. The company, which was founded by Oxford University chemical engineers in 2021, is already producing small quantities of its SAF blend in the smaller OX1 demonstration plant.

In addition to the IAGi Ventures arm of International Airlines Group (parent company of British Airways and Iberia) and Safran Corporate Ventures, the latest funding round was also backed by new investors Orlen VC, Hostplus, and TCVC. The oversubscribed round was supported by existing backers including Clean Energy Ventures, IP Group/Kiko Ventures, Aramco Ventures, Eni Next, and Braavos Capital.

“In a market where capital is tight and investors are rightly selective, this raise is a testament to the strength of our science, the clarity of our mission, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving,” said Andrew Symes, OXCCU’s CEO. “What we’re seeing is that serious players with truly distinctive technologies are still getting funded.”

Simplified, Lower-cost SAF Production

According to OXCCU, its approach simplifies SAF production by eliminating the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps. Instead, its patented iron-based catalyst enables the direct synthesis of jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons from gaseous waste carbon in a single exothermic reaction.

The company claims that this process reduces capital and operating costs, as well as the carbon intensity of the fuel. The catalyst can be applied with a wide range of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen input gas compositions, which is expected to deliver the flexibility to efficiently convert different feedstocks such as reformed biogas, gasified wood waste, and pure carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

OXCCU says its catalyst will produce sustainable aviation fuel in a simpler and lower-cost process.

“We recognize the need for the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and for the aviation sector to play its part and to develop sustainably,” commented Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group sustainability director. “IAG has been a leader in the sector, being the first airline group globally to commit to net zero by 2050. We are further committed to our goal of meeting 10% of our fuel needs with SAF by 2030. Meeting these goals will be supported by this investment into OXCCU, which is part of our strategy of developing new partnerships to produce next-generation fuels.”",https://jdasolutions.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/green-engine-saf.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:58:00.454792

The adjacent Parking Plaza provides over 250 EV charging stations with an additional 250 EV-ready spaces, as well as more than 300 bicycle parking spaces. Airfield improvements reduce emissions through an underground fuel-delivery system, and a 900,000-gallon cistern captures and reuses stormwater. The facility is designed to withstand future climate impacts and is pursuing LEED-Gold certification.

Construction on Phase 1B will begin in early 2026. Three additional gates will open in spring 2026, with the remaining eight gates opening in early 2028, bringing the total number of gates to 30.

Beyond passenger amenities, the $3.8 billion New T1 project is estimated to generate over $4.5 billion for San Diego’s economy. Upon completion, the programme will have created 25,300 jobs paying $2 billion in wages. Local governments are expected to receive $127 million in tax revenues, supporting public services and infrastructure.

In the pursuit of net-zero by 2050, the aviation industry demands “fundamental innovation” in aircraft design. A partnership between aircraft giant Airbus and tech leader Toshiba is leading the charge.

According to the companies, they’ve developed a breakthrough superconducting motor designed for hydrogen-powered flight.

The Future of Hydrogen-Powered Transportation

Toshiba unveiled the superconducting motor in 2022, showcasing a potential solution to the need for high power with minimal weight. According to Fumitoshi Mizutani, who leads the motor development project at Toshiba, the initial prototype demonstrated remarkable efficiency.

In 2022, we succeeded in developing a prototype superconducting motor that is both lightweight and compact, but still capable of delivering high output of 2 megawatts,” Mizutani said. “It is one-tenth the weight of conventional products with the same output.”

The prototype’s compact size and favorable output drew the attention of Airbus. The company is developing zero-emission, hydrogen-powered aircraft that could utilize a superconducting motor.

According to engineers, the motor’s technology, specifically the electric method where hydrogen fuel cells generate power, is an ideal match for hydrogen propulsion. Superconductivity is the property of certain materials to achieve zero electrical resistance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures. They emphasize its ability to work in tandem with hydrogen storage.

If engineers want to use hydrogen as fuel, it must be liquified and stored at –253∘C.

Toshiba leaders consider themselves pioneers because the company has put over 50 years of research into this field. However, hydrogen’s availability remains a barrier. Despite the hurdles, they expect the superconducting motor to boost fuel efficiency and flight range. Additionally, it holds promising applications beyond aviation into shipping and space development.

Shibata and Mizutani said, “As engineers, there’s something truly romantic and exciting about developing next-generation aircraft.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/superconduction-robot.png,N,,2025-10-09 11:58:11.226561

Building a domestic carbon removals market

Air New Zealand has become one of the first major corporates to invest in a new wave of homegrown, internationally verified carbon removals, committing to purchase 8,000 tonnes by 2030 through its partnership with My Native Forest.

The initiative aims to catalyse a robust voluntary carbon market in New Zealand by backing native forest regeneration verified to international standards — a step that could redefine how the country’s private sector contributes to climate targets and biodiversity goals.

My Native Forest provides a digital platform for investing in the restoration of indigenous ecosystems across Aotearoa in exchange for verified carbon removals. Unlike conventional avoidance credits, which prevent emissions elsewhere, removal credits represent carbon physically captured and stored by newly established forests.

Long-term climate strategy for hard-to-abate aviation

Kiri Hannifin, Air New Zealand’s Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer, said the decision reflects the airline’s commitment to begin climate action “in its own backyard” while preparing for a carbon market expected to mature later this decade.

“Native forest planting takes time, so it’s important to secure future supply now,” Hannifin said. “As New Zealand’s national carrier, the co-benefits for biodiversity and pest control here at home make this agreement even more powerful.”

She noted that aviation remains among the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. “Scaling sustainable aviation fuel, optimising our fleet, and developing alternative propulsion technologies are complex, expensive, and rely on multiple external factors. High-integrity carbon removals will play a significant role in reaching net zero by 2050 — and New Zealand is uniquely positioned with its land, ecosystems, and international reputation to supply them,” she added.

The airline’s purchase will be delivered in phases — 500 tonnes in 2028, 2,500 in 2029, and 5,000 in 2030 — with each verified credit representing one tonne of carbon removed. All credits will be issued via a global registry under recognised international verification frameworks.

Carbon finance for biodiversity and local resilience

Mitchell McLaughlin, co-founder of My Native Forest, said Air New Zealand’s early investment demonstrates the power of carbon finance to fund nature-based restoration at scale. Land parcels for the programme are being identified across Canterbury, Nelson, Marlborough, Tairāwhiti Gisborne, Waikato, Auckland, and Northland.

“Air New Zealand will provide capital in return for carbon removals that might otherwise have flowed offshore. Instead, it will stay here, directly funding native forest restoration,” McLaughlin said. “This partnership shows that planting native trees is no longer just a goodwill gesture — it’s a commercially viable pathway for landowners.”

He added that the benefits reach far beyond carbon accounting. “We’re creating income streams that reward integrity while restoring biodiversity, protecting waterways, and strengthening rural economies. Every tonne of carbon removed supports nurseries, contractors, pest-control operations, and local communities across Aotearoa.”

Strengthening credibility in the global carbon market

New Zealand’s voluntary carbon market has faced challenges in establishing verification systems that align with international standards, a key barrier to attracting institutional buyers. My Native Forest’s approach — combining digital monitoring tools, global registry issuance, and local ecological oversight — is designed to overcome that gap.

The move also positions New Zealand to play a larger role in global carbon markets as corporate demand for removals accelerates. Removal credits have gained traction among multinational buyers seeking to align with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidance and aviation’s global net-zero roadmap under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA scheme.

Hannifin said securing verified domestic supply early ensures Air New Zealand can meet future compliance and voluntary offset needs without relying solely on overseas projects. “Starting now helps ensure the market will be ready when we really need it,” she said.

Expanding local partnerships

Air New Zealand is in the final stages of negotiating a second contract with another New Zealand-based supplier of internationally verified, nature-based removals, expected to be finalised by the end of the year. Together, these partnerships aim to demonstrate how domestic, high-integrity removals can compete with — and complement — global supply options.

For investors and corporate sustainability leaders, the deal offers a case study in using carbon finance to drive local climate action while meeting international reporting and verification requirements.

By directing capital into native forest restoration rather than overseas offset schemes, Air New Zealand is testing a model that could help bridge the gap between national climate priorities and global market credibility — a space increasingly critical for hard-to-abate sectors worldwide.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Air-New-Zealand-invests-in-New-Zealand-nature-through-first-verified-carbon-removals.webp,N,,2025-10-09 12:57:53.233190

4AIR continues to empower aviation stakeholders to be at the forefront of climate change solutions

CLEVELAND, Oct. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- 4AIR, the global leader in business aviation sustainability, announced today that it has helped aircraft owners, operators, and passengers offset or reduce more than 6.2 million metric tons of CO2 through the use of verified carbon offsets and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) since launching in November 2020. SAF is a ""drop-in"" fuel that meets all the same technical and safety requirements as fossil-based jet fuel but comes from a more sustainable source.

In the five years since its inception, 4AIR's programs have:

Facilitated more than 2 million carbon neutral or higher flight hours, reducing the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted during flight. To put this into perspective, this is more flight hours than the annual amount flown by the four largest private aviation operators combined.

Documented more than 20.2 million blended gallons of SAF — which has reduced jet fuel emissions in its lifecycle by more than 43,000 metric tons of Co2.

Reduced or offset more than 6 million metric tons of CO2 through carbon offsets and SAF.

Contributed more than $250,000 to aviation sustainability research through its Aviation Climate Fund.

Implemented the first live trials for contrail mitigation into business aviation

""Our goal with launching 4AIR was to make sustainability accessible, and this success shows that there is a desire by business aviation to decarbonize, if the right tools are put in place. But we must keep pushing to drive broader industry adoption and achieve even higher levels of sustainability,"" said 4AIR President Kennedy Ricci.

In addition to its impactful efforts on the offset front, 4AIR has been actively building out its offerings to better serve the aviation industry across the board. This includes the recent expansion of its comprehensive regulatory compliance program. With this extension, 4AIR now supports more than 25 regulatory schemes worldwide — ensuring aviation operators are in full compliance amid a rapidly changing regulatory landscape.

To further amplify its mission of educating the world on sustainability, since its 2020 launch, the 4AIR team has attended over 250 events — speaking at more than 100 of those — a testament to their dedication to empowering audiences worldwide to engage in meaningful sustainability initiatives.

""The positive response to our programs confirms that the aviation industry is not only ready but eager to lead in sustainability. As we look to the future, we are dedicated to pioneering even greater advancements in sustainable aviation practices, ensuring our industry makes bold progress towards a more sustainable world,"" said Nancy Bsales, 4AIR's Chief Operating Officer.

Since 2024, 4AIR has sponsored an initiative that enables pilots to be trained on fully electric aircraft. Through partnerships with flight schools in the United Kingdom, 4AIR offers unique electric aircraft training to student pilots as part of its commitment to advance fully electric flight.
